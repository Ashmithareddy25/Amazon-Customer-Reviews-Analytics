B009YQJ322|3.0|I don't understand how people can even compare this to the movie Judge Dredd... it's a totally different story line except for the fact the in both movies a Judge was the judge, jury and executioner all in one.  Other than that, the stories are completely different.  If you're looking for a simpler story line and pure shoot 'em or blow 'em up action this is the movie for you.  If you're looking for a little more complicated story along with some humor then watch Judge Dredd.  I love Sylvester Stallone, anyway.  I liked this movie, too, but I had to go back and watch Judge Dredd again!  I have to say I enjoyed it more than Dredd.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|VERY entertaining movie.  Drama, Romance, Action.  LOTS of blood but you know there die packs.  I didn't know if I would like a western.  But, it was SO much more than a western.  It was about slavery, kindness, justice and true love.  Jamie Foxx was outstanding!  I would recommend this movie BIG TIME.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I love this record. It plays perfectly. It is exactly what I wanted. If I could I would play it all the time.
B0086700CM|3.0|Don't get me wrong the app is great, but after a while it gets. boring and I just play Temple Run 2 and Subway Surfers. The game is great, but it is totally out dated.
193700788X|5.0|It's fun, face-paced, and easy to love.  Makes me want to move to the south, the characters and scenes are lush and wonderfully creative.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very addictive.<br />Not enough invest points tho. Tough to expand. Wish i could trade coin for invest points. Super rich but cant build cuz i have no space.
B008XG1X18|3.0|there are too many glitches with the new update. its very slow and shuts down randomly. it works well just lots of glitches! please fix it!
B00AEBBAEK|4.0|Johnny Depp is a good actor. I do enjoy his roles. Even on Jump street ( TV Series ) he was good
B009RH9FR6|3.0|I would have liked it better if the small cleats were on both side of the horizontal  so you can charge it in the horizontal position
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun escape game. The puzzles are challenging enough to require thought without being unreasonably difficult. Hopefully they add more levels.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a good book for a small price. The story isn't unique but it does have a twist I didn't see coming. What I did enjoy was that this is a complete story in one book, not necessary to buy 2 or 3 more books. If you want an easy to read book I can recommend this one.
1612680011|4.0|This is not just finance related book, it is about education, psychology, emotions and fears. The suggested rules look simple but you know they work since writer give real examples. It worths to read.
B001F12J48|2.0|says 3D but not reallly, wont play on my 3D TV.  You have to use the stupid blue and red glasses.....this was false advertising.

B008K8VDPU|5.0|its simple, easy to use, and it feels like a real piano on my kindle so I LOVE IT. I also enjoy how it teaches me notes and it also allows me to record and save my own songs. BEST PIANO APP OUT THERE :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging.  I love a good brain game and this was great! Hope they plan to add more puzzles soon!

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Thirty-five years after the release of \\"Never Say Die\\" the original members of Black Sabbath (minus Bill Ward) return with \\"13\\", a welcome reminder of what real Heavy Metal music sounds like and proof that, even in their 60s, these gentleman can still rock.<br /><br />In reading through the reviews here on Amazon, I'm struck by the contrast between the one-star folks who pan the album because it isn't \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", and many of the five-star reviewers who pretend it is.<br /><br />Both thematically and in tone \\"13\\" harkens back to Sabbath's glory days.  However, that's where the comparisons with the 70s version of the band end.  If you're expecting to pop this disc in and hear the same brilliance that marked that earlier period, you're bound to be disappointed.  But let's be honest: the Black Sabbath catalog - at least from their eponymous debut through \\"Never Say Die\\" - represents some of the greatest Heavy Metal material ever produced.  To compare this - or anything else for that matter - to the band's earlier work is simply unfair.  \\"13\\" should be judged on its own merit.  And on its own, it's pretty darned good.<br /><br />Ozzy Osbourne, pushing 65, is a shadow of what he once was, but he's still better than most of what's out there today and his vocals suit this material well.  Geezer Butler is, predictably, outstanding and Tony Iommi reminds anyone who may have forgotten that he is one of the very best to ever pick up the instrument.<br /><br />My biggest problem with \\"13\\" is the absence of Ward.  That's no knock on Brad Wilk, who fills in and does solid, if unspectacular, work.  But the classic Black Sabbath sound is driven by drumming that is anything but solid, if unspectacular.  There's definitely something missing here and it's noticeable.<br /><br />Bill Ward is to Sabbath what John Bonham was to Zeppelin; what Keith Moon was to The Who; and what Neal Peart is to Rush.  Take any one of them out of the equation and the end product is different.  Still good maybe, but missing that key ingredient that makes it special.  And, to my ear at least, that's where \\"13\\" falls a little short.<br /><br />All that being said, this is still a fine effort and definitely worth a listen.  Welcome back boys!is different.  Still good maybe, but missing that key ingredient that makes it special.  And, to my ear at least, that's where \\"13\\" falls a little short.<br /><br />All that being said, this is still a fine effort and definitely worth a listen.  Welcome back boys!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was an interesting story, kept you guessing til the end. There were some interesting twists and turns throughout the story
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's a wonderful book.. I definitely recommend it to anyone older than 11 or 12... I don't know how to describe it.. But I feel different in a way after finishing this book. Very good book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is the best messaging app ever. A lot of people have it so why not you. I would say go for it and get this app!
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|the grandkids I think have already worn this movie out. they watch it over and over again. Nice that we have cute movies for the kids.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Its okay it let's me connect to FB with ease but it freezes up sometimes and it doesn't give me all the features of the full site
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game keeps getting better and better every time i play. Maybe add some new animals though. I cant wait to see what happens next. Au reviour!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This minecraft game is just awesome it's the best minecraft game I downloaded it was worth the $7.00. And the game keeps  upgrading its just AWESOME get this app.<br />P.s works AWESOME on kindle fire!!!!!!!
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|The thing is certainly complicated and messy on the first pass.  I've been telling friends who haven't yet seen it to go straight to the credits and view (in slow motion!) all the roles each actor played.  That'll help keep them diverted on that first viewing.<br /><br />For me to enjoy a movie I have to suspend disbelief - to wholly embrace the world the moviemakers have presented.  Stuff like reincarnation and the dreadful futuristic Korean society were easy enough.  I had to deduct a star from my rating because I found the post apocalypse segment impossible to digest.  Great ending if you can buy into the premises they presented, but I just couldn't.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really enjoyed this game. very much like mystic or riven (old school-i know). I hope they add more rooms soon. creative and enjoyable couple of hours.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|This stinks thisbis the most unhelpful dictionary evet!!!! Don't bother to read it! I love to read dictionarys andnstuff, but tjis one is so boring. It is very unhelpful.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I enjoy the game it makes my time go by fast , it's easy to play my family plays all the time..the food takes a long time but it's a game can't all be perfect. But overall it's a great game when you don't have to do nothing. So add me my STORM ID IS kamoria..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging and fun. I completed all 10 levels in less than an hour. Almost quit when I thought this was just impossible.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Hunger Games: not much to say here. it was a good translation from book to film. Long start from the begining to action scenes. Love Jennifer as katniss and Josh as Peeta. and Woody was great as haymitch. Worth watching, Hope 2nd film  is better.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This book is much better than the first! It is super helpful! It was very entertaining! Although, it can be difficult for young readers to navigate through. So many great word definitions. Thanks for making words more easy to understand!!!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Why is it so difficult for developers to get through their thick skulls that we have a right to our own privacy? What makes it even more disgusting is that this is a paid game. Why do you need to collect private and personal fine location data on us? The only people that don't care about these things are people with no life. I have nothing to hide but that doesn't give you a right to look.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Gets you hooked right away. It's fast and furious and with so many secrets to unlock during the game. Currently playing WWHULK table and I'm loving it!
B004WY2M8I|4.0|A staple for any vampire lover, This series was one of my first vampire books. Love the vampire- lestat. The backstorys are just great!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app.  It is easy to use and u can make your pictures look a lot of cute ways.  I like that u can add your own text to them.  And that u can get picture off facebook.  It a good app.
B00140PK6O|4.0|I have withdrawals  from no new Downton Abbey, so I bought this. It has many of the same actors and seems to be well written.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is just not my cup of tea.  it is not the type of game I enjoy. But  I am sure that many other players would love it.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|What a great Re-boot!!! Thank god- for Christopher Nolan.... what a genius!!!!! Can't wait to see what else this director does in the future.
1451627297|5.0|I have read half the book and really like it.  It is a fast reading book and keeps your attention.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nothing really to do but push the coins.  Great do nothing game without the need to think or care so much.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|Ok I liked it at the beginning when I first got it but it got real boring real fast. I played for 2 minutes and I had already beat my hi score twice. No<br />offense  but it could have been a little more fun. Like I said it was fun at first but unless you like having to play for a year to get a new car then this is for you.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Best movie of the series!!!! The joker is the best villian of all the batman villians. a must see.
B0082PQ93C|5.0|I have not read it as of yet.  But I heard from several friends that it is a real good book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought I had the plot figured out from page one. A girl gets picked for the games, but her older sister volunteers as a replacement to save her life and in the games arena, she befriends Peeta and they somehow both make it out alive together. But no, I really had no idea. The love Peeta had for Katniss is what kept me so in-love with the characters and so concerned with their safety that I couldn't put this book down.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I would recommend to any couple having problems out not. Learning that love is a choice and by starting with basics you can have a strong marriage. Great book!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The neat thing about Angry Birds is that there is so much variety in the game. You never get tired of it!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Can't wait for version 2.  Loved the story, mystery and hunt all in one game.  Fun for  kids and adults.  Highlights recommend!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Random Access Memories (RAM) is easily the best album of this decade. An album that doesn't settle with one or two singles as many modern albums do. It goes against the grain of modern music where one picks and chooses songs to play...no, instead RAM is a journey, a story, from start to finish. Start at track 1 and play all the way thru 13 and listen along as Daft Punk takes you on a time traveling spaceship with a robot pilot through an incredible epic.<br /><br />With this album, Daft Punk once again redefines EDM. While it may be ahead of its time for some and not meet the expectations of others, but for those that are ready for EDM created from a studio with live musicians with actual instruments then this album does just that.<br /><br />If you don't want some sort of musical acid trip, RAM still has a few singles that you can jam to with the windows down in your car...Get Lucky, Insta-Crush, and Doin' It Right.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like it it wakes me up wen I want to get up early in the morning and I like the time good graphics good for the telling time and whether
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Fast paced, action-filled and great film. Strong cast that works a basic storyline excellently. Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Great soundtrack too!
B000FC146C|5.0|This is a book that I have read at least twice and watched the mini series.  It is always an interesting story.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|I was disappointed in this album. It had a heavy-handed Metallica-like vibe that I found overwhelming and rather mismatched with Meatloaf's style. This is not an automatic pick-up for Meatloaf fans by any means; preview the album first.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really liked this game it is really cool  and I wish they do the same  with rain forest animals !!!!
B001LPWGE6|2.0|opened my brand new sealed in the shrink wrap bourne trilogy and the first movie was missing. i thought maybe i was just confused, but there are defiantly only two movies, an empty space to fit the third. very strange.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|There are a number of great westerns, and it is very difficult to choose the very best. Among the greats are Unforgiven and Rio Bravo to name just a few. But, I think Pale Rider is at the top of the list. Clint Eastwood at his finest!!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I really loved the quality of this animation, especially on my HD TV. I highly recommend this for any anime or manga fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game and recommned it to anyone who loves horses. It keeps me entertained hours on end.
B00CLIJ9A6|2.0|Quartet<br /><br />I thought the beginning of it was dragging - we almost didn't watch it all the way thru.  Better after the first half.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|Some of the buttons aren't recognized by my mac. You can't set they key bindings to shortcuts in that case but works fine with my PC.
B0041LG08U|5.0|I was really excited to recieve this watch. It is my first diver style and first automatic. The pictures really do not do justice to the beauty of this watch. The blue is a deep, inky blue that looks beautiful on the wrist. The band was a little big and I had to have some links removed, but now it fits perfect. It is not too big, but not took small, perfet size. The hands and display are beautiful as well and the bezel, which feels sturdy and has a nice click to it.I would definitely recommend this watch to someone who wants a diver style but cannot afford the price for a real one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is AMAZING. You get to tilt your device collect coins and try not to die or be killed by those CRAZY monkeys. It's addictive and fun. You don't need WiFi so it's good for the go. The game is addictive I recommend this app for you. For everyone.... little kids,big kids,teens,adults,senior adult, and preteens
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best new game I have played in a long time.  It is not super easy, and it is not super hard.<br />I enjoy the game as it is a game that takes some thinking.You have to solve one task to get to the next to the next task...and so on.  I highly recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love AccuWeather. I have health issues that are affected by the weather. AccuWeather helps me decide how to plan my day
B003ZSJ212|4.0|the seller does an ok job with delivering it's items, and they arrive in excellent condition, but as for the product, ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it's ok, the blu - ray set has some really great artwork for all 6 films and the 3 bonus discs, it's a very good first impression, but then you watch the movies, the prequels are about the same, the phantom menace is ok, except for jar jar binks, and and that annoying kid actor who plays young darth vader is really terrible, but the movie is still decent, attack of the clones is terrible, revenge of the sith is really good all things considered, but the original trilogy is where things take a huge dive into s***'sville, all the stupid special edition changes are here again, and also with a few new ones to make them even more worthless, the most famous one is of course the change to return of the jedi, it ruins the movie for me, revenge of the sith and empire strikes back are really the only great blu - ray experiences, cause the empire special edition is a'lot more watchable then the other special editions, the sound and video quality of these discs are very spectacular, so there is that, as for the special features, there are deleted scenes from all six movies, don't expect to see all the deleted scenes from the prequels here, more reason to keep the old dvd's, and there is also some cast and crew interviews, however if you still have the 2004 special features disc, you are not going to see anything new here, which is a disappointment since the empire of dreams documentary is the best documentary of the original trilogy, and it's not even on here, finally as for the final bonus disc, this disc is very very very, VERY awesome!!!!!! it has old documentarys dating back all the way to 1977, and all of these documentarys except for 2 are only on the original trilogy, which is very good, since we care about those movies way more then the prequels, at least that is me, and then there is a 90 min. run of just spoofs on star wars, sounds crazy at first, but this bonus feature is the best, you name it, it's there somewhere, robot chicken, family guy, that 70's show, saturday night live, and even the muppits!!!! so while i have mixed feelings for this boxset, it still does have some really cool bonus material for the original trilogy, except the trailers, more reason to keep the 2004 bonus disc, and the art work and good hd transfer of sith, empire, phantom menace, and even star wars is good enough for that atleast, but if you still have the widescreen prequel and 2006 dvds, keep those, cause you are not geting everything from previous releases, but you do get some good stuff at the same time. i'm just glad i did not pay $70-110 for tgis boxset.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love subway surfer to play when I am in break of school and when I am board board can play with my friends to bet them so the time

B000001FN8|5.0|My favorite Scorpions CD and I really like a lot of their CDs. This CD seems underrated compared to others.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|The trailer made it seem that the whole movie was going to be funny, but all of the funny parts were in the trailer.  The story line was about selfish people lying and cheating and wondering why they were miserable.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|At first I didn't like the then and now format but the way each chapter dragged me in then brought me to a new part of Lena's life really got me excited and really pulled me into each part of her story. The last few pages of the chapter I just knew what was coming but when it happened I still was shocked! Love this series!!!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great book!  A little wordy the first half but once you get to the meat and potatoes...er....cheese, the book says it all. I've been on the keto diet for 1 year now. Lost 30 lbs and my lipid panel is perfect. Highly recommend the book. Listen and digest Taubes' philosophy. He's not wrong.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|God please let me grow old in such a beautiful estate with such loving, fun staff and filled with old friends who happen to be retired musicians.  The quartet here are aged opera stars who shared beds, friendship, and many, many curtain calls during their careers. The plot is very light: three of the friends are well established at Beecham House for Retired Musicians and have made peace with their fates...lost love, Alzheimers and stroke. The estranged fourth, Maggie Smith's \\"Jean Horton\\" , arrives to great fanfare as she was the biggest STAR, and she may prove a moneymaker for the home if she will sing a Verdi quartet with the others.  She once cheated on Tom Courtenay's character, \\"Reggie\\", her former lover and husband for a brief period.  She wants forgiveness. He rejects her....for about five minutes.  Will they put old hurts aside?  Will Maggie Smith agree to participate in the famous Verdi quartet at the fundraising gala and save the old folks home?  Will they all survive the frailty and indignities of old age and make it to the stage one more time? Dustin Hoffman directs lovingly.
0345803485|5.0|it was plainly the best.. I love the character Christian Grey!!! Ana is awesome too and cannot wait for the movie
0756407125|5.0|Incredibly well-written, interesting and well-crafted characters, this is a brilliant sequel to Rothfuss' first Kingkiller book.  The first one ended with just the barest hints about what was to come, and clearly most of those things have not yet arrived, though several myths about Kvothe have been demystified, in a sense, as he told his own story.  But this book ends on the brink of change and built such a real sense of trauma and impending darkness that, with my own life stresses, I felt on edge for 3 days afterwards.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing. Nothing like temple run. Infact I've totally gone off temple run! Every month this game updates and goes to a different place in the world. Like at the moment it is in miami. When I first got this game, I was in France on a yr7 trip and when I uploaded it it was in Rome. I hope it comes to the uk or even exeter! That would be awesome
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|Simple, sleek, and functional.  Fits my Kindle great and offers great protection.  I would buy it again, but I doubt I'll ever have to replace this one.  Very good quality.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|After about thirty minutes of watching retired musicians behaving like children in their stately retirement home, I gave up hoping for a story to develop. Even Maggie Smith couldn't salvage this ridiculous movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is my third time purchasing this--saddly my others keep getting scratched or lost.  Some of these are cheesy and some aren't my favorite episodes, but everything from the acting to the story lines are incredibly well-crafted and interesting, enjoyable, satisfying.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I could not play cloud city . I cant get the upgrades but I still like this game.I also don't get Lando
B000PKX2KA|3.0|In order to use this device with Windows 7 you will  need to manually download and install the drivers from a site that is not part of the manufacturer (They're here is you're looking for them: http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=225&pcid=41)
B003XMXZCW|5.0|An all time classic movie, even better in bluray. The picture quality and sound track clarity enhances a great movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My kids like this game. A bit challenging for them, but they love a challenge. My daughter has some trouble with some of the floors but for a six years old she does pretty good on figuring out most of it. My son is 9 years old and loves it.

B00D8WMASM|5.0|I love everything about this album. Every morning I wake up craving a different track. This is the album of the summer - maybe of the year.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|And Kanye is definitely prick, but not a swallower. Kanye's newest album \\"Yeezus\\" is another mix of self-indulgent, excellently produced rap tracks. This time around Kanye's giving Trap/Techno a shot while bringing back a little bit of \\"808's & Heartbreak\\" and \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\". Kanye goes absolutely nuts on this album making it darker than his last solo outing, and he's being even more daring than any of his previous albums. But with (mostly) excellent production, a few excellent guest features, and top-of-the-line lyrics, this is right up there with all of his other albums as a classic.<br />We've missed Kanye, his last two outings just weren't him, mainly because they weren't really his albums. \\"Watch The Throne\\" with Jay-Z was decent record, but stood out as Kanye's weakest album to date. Cruel Summer was just sad in comparison to Kanye's other albums as even the best of that album didn't even match the worst of Kanye's solo stuff. But Yeezus is now the sixth reason to love Kanye despite his previous public outbursts and his thinking he's a god.<br />Yeezus starts out with a high note of \\"Onsite\\" the over-the-top Daft Punk production makes it stand out as one of the highlights of the album with an infectious beat and some genius lyrics, it really is an amazing track. He tops it with his second track \\"Black Skinhead\\". The intimidating rolling drums dominate the track as Kanye raps and screams over it. It truly is one of Kanye's best songs to date. \\"I Am A God\\" is a step backwards as it has a sound like \\"Onsite\\" but isn't nearly as memorable and the lyrics kind of take a back seat. \\"New Slaves\\" has absolutely dominated the internet since his 66-building premiere of the song. The simplistic pounding synths are absolute genius and let Kanye's lyricism take over. The Frank Ocean outro is weird at first listen, but later grows on you. \\"Hold My Liquor\\" is another highlight as Chief Keef puts out a hook that is surprisingly good knowing that it's ChiefKeef. The beat feels like it could have fit perfectly with his nearly perfect album \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\".<br />Unfortunately the next three tracks aren't quite as memorable as the strong start. \\"I'm In It\\", \\"Blood On The Leaves\\", and \\"Guilt Trip\\" are all absolutely amazing tracks, but they lack the epic feel of the beginning five tracks. Luckily \\"Send It Up\\" saves the ending of the album from feeling a bit sour as the production of the siren in an empty stadium echoing over King L's forceful but chilled verse and hook make this song one of the most immediately likable tracks on the album<br />Bound 2 is the song I have the biggest issue with. I absolutely love the Bound sample, but the production is lacking severely here. The sample is just repeated while Kanye raps to it and it feels like it was made lazily on somebody's laptop. There's a gaping hole between the repeating sample here, and it comes off as awkward and even amateur-ish. Especially on an album of such epic proportions it feels like he just threw a weird mixtape track at the end, which is sad because the song had a lot of potential.<br />Despite the odd track at the end, Yeezus still comes off as an absolutely phenomenal album. It may not seem that way in the first listen or two but after getting used to the all over the place instrumentals, and Kanye's complete lack of giving a crap, it might just take you by surprise. The real question though is; Could Yeezus be the album of the year?... well... yeah...  it probably will be.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: 9/10<br /><br />Must Have Tracks:<br /><br />Just buy the whole album<br /><br />If not then:<br /><br />Black Skinhead<br />New Slaves<br />Send It Up<br />Onsite<br />Hold My Liquor

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Had this app for awhile now and I am happy with it. This app provides a nice interface and a good list of run times the device can last when performing an activity (e.g a 3D game). The ability to choose what color the app is also nice.<br /><br />A very good app indeed.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was way better than the first. A little dark and depressing but not too much to turn you off reading more. Very addictive and hard to put down. I'm already working on the third book. :) it was a little cheesy near the end but this book is greared towards a younger teenage age group! Fun and fast read!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love this show.  Gets better and better every season.  Can't wait to add season 5 to the collection thus far.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game<br />really enjoyable<br />We can't wait for new levels. It was fun to complete the puzzles.  Mind bending!  Great!

B000FC1PNE|5.0|It was a fun loving ,witty entertaining book, minds meet minds, thoroughly enjoyed it, it is good to read them in order
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is either love or hate.  Good thing I love it.  The dry sense of humor and slapstick comedy right up my alley
B0063M22QO|3.0|well that was dissapointing. just a few sets of play and then you have to buy the next set separately. Meh.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played. It forces you to think logically and outside of the box. I wish there was more to it though because I blasted through. it already lol.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This is a really entertaining series that has a little bit of everything in it.  The scenery is awesome too.  Season 2 is a little slower than 1 and 3 but it is still great.

B003VS0CXS|5.0|Excellent movie. Great Blu Ray restoration. Fun for the whole family. Definitely worth watching and adding to your Blu Ray collection.
0143122916|4.0|Amazing story of the extremes of humanity.  From brutality to evil to survival to compassion and love make this a must read to expose what the PRNK is like.<br />And to learn how cowardly we as a freedom loving nation are!
B005LAII3A|4.0|We really enjoy this modern version of Total Recall. It is action packed with a twisted shift in the plot that it's not predictable.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|Funny, emotional, witty and very well-written! I look forward to reading more by Matthew Quick. I really enjoyed the theme of silver linings, as you always hope and wish life would be.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Outstanding TV series. The best detective series of all times. Peter Falk at his best. Excellent DVD quality. Great addition to anyone's DVD collection
B0037VNX44|5.0|Great movie. Tom H does an amazing job playing this guy. I could of done without the full nude times though.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This movie tries to tell the story of OZ before Dorthy and her dog come along.  I'm a Wizard of OZ fan, I've watched it every Thanksgiving holiday as long as I can remember. So I was hard on this movie. It tells how the wicked witch came to be, and how the great and powerful oz developed. It lost me abit when the scarecrow, lion arrived  and no tin man came in at all. The good witch,  reminded me of  the white queen in the newer version of alice in wonderland. For me there was too much cgi involved. I'm however glad I only rented it, and didn't go to the theater.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I got hooked after the first episode of season 1! Watched both seasons within a week. Wish they produced more episodes.<br /><br />Suspense and intrigue! Great twists. Amazing how Sherlock observes and deduces!<br /><br />Very entertaining!

B00D6BU8GG|4.0|My family's a Die Hard fan. We own all and rented this one first before buying. This one bings in the son, who of course is at odds with his father. Willis' charater once agian gets in over his head , this time trying to save his &#34;loser&#34; of a son, not knowing his son has everything in control. Die Hard 5  has loads of laughs, guns, fights, great crashes, and stunts everyone will enjoy!  What's even better is the relationship between father and son.
0316743003|5.0|Stayed up half the night reading. So very interesting. We plan on getting one as a gift for a special friend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I frequently use this calculator. The numbers are large and easy to see. The ads are small and not intrusive.<br />Would recommend this app.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Can't stop laughing when  watching this series, this could not be outside your private laugh collection, a must have for the humoric person
B00C7LB20C|4.0|This movie  is very similar to the &#34;bourne&#34; movies. It moves quickly, and keeps you guessing.  Aaron Eckhart  plays a dad lost when it comes to connecting with his daughter. The plot forces the two to work together, to stay alive.  In so doing both come around to accepting and  resolving their issues. Aarons character is well thought out, but not so powerful as Jason in the bourne movies. All in all a good movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is simplistic and adorable for when I just want to shut off my brain and poke at some dragons to waste some time. I quite enjoy the artistic inspiration it brings me.
B000002JEV|5.0|This album has Led Zeppelin's best LIVE performances. Allot of these songs I taped off the radio in the 80's and I needed the CD to replace the cassette. Some of the recordings are raw, but that is what I like about Zep.
B00684J49U|5.0|Grey's Anatomy Keeps getting better as the years go by.  It is rare for a long running series to keep their audience tuned in every episode with the same excitement as the earlier seasons!  I am looking forward to more of the drama in this excellent TV show! Keep it coming!
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|Absolutely loved the board game from Marbles, and I was excited to see this as the free app of the day today. But I don't understand why it needs to track where I am. What on earth does this app have anything to do with my location? I'm going to try playing this with wi-fi off to see if it works without the Internet. If it does, I'll add another star, because you have the choice of whether or not you want them to track you.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Just an awesome epic movie necessary for any collection, the discs are good and work fine on a dvd player
B001EOOQF6|5.0|Ronnie James Dio has one the greatest voices in hard rock. He has the ability to make the songs melodic and rough at the same time. This is his 2nd best performance. If you like RJD buy &#34;Heaven and Hell&#34; first, then buy this album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun. Did not want it to end. I hope they make more rooms . Better than other games i have played.
B005DD7MH8|1.0|I did not see i bought this and another movie to watch on plane ride. i could not bring it up to view, what i did not know when i purchased those to movies is that you have to have w-fi if i knew before hand i would not have purchased i will stick with books for now on unless someone tells me how to retrieve movies and watch without having to be on w-fi
B00821OX98|5.0|Good story line, characters really draw you in.  As soon as you think you know what is going to happen they drop a surprise on you.  I am really excited that this show is free for prime members.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|This album is a little lighter and more commercial than Infinity or Evolution, but still a very good album. It has their biggest hits.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game and I would like to see more rooms added to this app in the future
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun, easy to play game that will appeal to all ages. It is very versatile in difficulty with many different levels of complication. You won't be able to put it down!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Lots of twists and turns.Surprise ending.Enjoyed every page.Will read more from this author.Liked his style of writing.Very fast read.Kept my interest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun at the same time. You can never get bored with this game and don't forget it's free.
B0001WGIBW|5.0|These fit along with the smaller Brio set we had and you get a lot of pieces for your money.  Seems like the best deal out there to expand your track...
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer writes a very compelling family saga in the Clifton Chronicles, I enjoyed reading the entire series.  You need to pay attention because he writes about each character individually.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I liked everything about this book, from the premise to the demise. The characters are genius, and brilliantly funny, most particularly the angel and the demon who are not especially good at their tasks. Besides, after all those millenia, they're rather fond of each other. They are pursued by an intrepid elderly Witchfinder and a very trepid young Witchfinder. There are no less than 3 sets of the Four Horsemen, some more menacing than others. Yet, with all the mayhem of the impending apocalypse, love also manages to sneak into the mix.<br />This is truly a laugh aloud story thanks to Pratchett and Gaiman. I would recommend Good Omens to anyone except the rigidly devoutly religious and anyone else who missed the gene for laughter.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|great game!!! great play,great graphics. Definitely a great time killer, and I normally don't play games like this. It rules
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so cool!! its not too hard, but not too easy either. I reccomend it for anyone! amazing game
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|After listening to a second full play, I really like the ethereal and wistful sound of the whole album.  It struck me how much this reminds me of Lloyd Cole's \\"Don't Get Weird on Me Babe\\" (this is high praise from me) with an updated production.  More so than Neil Young.  Here and there I grab a little Beck or Moby.  One of my favorite album purchases in a while.  Thanks to Sirius for playing yesterday and motivating me to purchase here.  I had seen the author's name in concert listings before, and assumed his sound was some kind of post-punk with a clever appropriation of Kurt Weill's name.  And, in fact, there is a nice aggregate of styles in this artist and album -- just not what was presumed.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|An honest, in your face & to the point book that lets folks know how to achieve a muscular physique without the mindless advertising magazines are saturated with. Go heavy or go home!!
1476734941|5.0|I first became aware of DOCTOR Michael Mosley (Yup, he's a Doctor!) when I saw his special on PBS, called &#34;Eat, Fast And Live Longer With Michael Mosley&#34;, which I truly loved & learned a HUGE amount from. I highly recommend reading this book & if you get the chance watch his special. Both are very informative.<br /><br />This book is an easy read, but still has lots of great info. This book follows sort of a summary of the TV special, touching on the highlights of the science part of the show & diet, but adds more depth in the actual diet & food part of things. I believe that to be due to his co-author, Mimi Spencer. Someone we're not too familiar with here in the US, but has some pretty impressive credentials in the UK. The book also give a bit of detail on who Michael is & what he's done. I won't go into much of that here, but suffice it to say, he's actually a medical doctor & he's done & been part of some pretty impressive stuff mostly with the BBC in the UK. Much, if not all of it has made it to the US.<br /><br />Back to the book. I highly recommend this book & following this diet has done wonders for me, personally. I've tried a lot of diets over the years. Over the last several years I've gone up & down in weight, done several diets & tried ALL of the pills, Raspberry Keytones, Green Coffee beans, Saffron, Garcinia Cambrosia, you name it. I've tried them. None of those pills worked for me. I've had limited success with some of the diets, but just like Michael's book & show say, they're just not something one can keep up long term. After seeing the special & reading this book, I've been doing the 5:2 diet that this book is about. It IS something I believe I can keep up long term.<br /><br />I've had GREAT success so far. Over the last 2 months, I've gone from about 195 to 175 pounds. Lowered my Cholesterol from 220 to 190 & more importantly to me, I feel like this &#34;diet&#34; is so easy, that I could keep it up for the rest of my life. I won't giveaway the farm & say what the diet is all about, but I will say that it's VERY simple to follow. It has very few &#34;rules&#34; & there are SO many other benefits to doing this diet that I actually look forward to fasting 2 days a week.<br /><br />I've had great success with this diet. I love the book & now (without me asking) my wife has just decided to start. She's been doing it for 3 weeks & has been doing & feeling great.<br /><br />All I can say is there are SO many reasons to buy this book & start on this diet right away, that you'll be glad you did. Do a Google search for Michael Mosley the 5:2 diet & read about all of the things that you can do for yourself by going on this diet ASAP. Again, I highly recommend this book.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have played this for hours .It s the best. App I have found. Do your self a favor and down load this game you will love it.
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|It was truly funny. The accents made it more funny. I'd watch it again and again. One part was too gruesome for my eyes though lol.
B00D6M86RS|1.0|the others are right this is for the HD kindle... must be time for warnings on this type of stuff.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I'm enjoying this album and I find myself just listing too the whole album every time I play it. I guess if you don't feel it that's you but in my opinion I'm enjoying this album.<br />1. Bound 2<br />2. New Slaves<br />3. Guilt Trip<br />4. Black Skinhead<br />5. Send it Up
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun, addicting, and awesome all combined into one little app! The only thing I wish, is that it had more levels. So overall this app is pretty awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is not very difficult but amusing. It is a good game with relatively quick levels. I enjoy it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Maybe I'm just niave but I didn't get this alarm clock to work intuitively. I downloaded another clock and no problems with it. Like the screen on this one, too bad I didn't have a 5th grader around to show me how to program it.
0307477479|5.0|Loved this book -- especially the format where each chapter is written from a different character's perspective, some of whom intersect.  It's like a puzzle of sorts where you try to connect the people, even with the smallest detail. The story line is interesting and very well told.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a marvel. This intricately woven novel of love, longing to be loved, and sadness when what you wished for does not materialize or falls short of its mark is incredible. The old and new Afghanistan, the way promises are kept and broken, and how family somehow never leaves one as a thread in life is beautifully written and memorable. I would say it's as good or better than &#34;Kite Runner&#34; in its themes and beauty. A must read for fiction lovers.
B00821OX98|3.0|Actually I would purchase another movie or show off of Amazon, but Falling Skies at least this season #1 did not answer my questions regarding the first exposure, or attacks.  I wanted to see the attack from the very beginning, and find out why our military did not stop the aliens because if they can be stopped now, why could they not be stopped from the very beginning. Oh well, it is only a darn show, but if your looking for some answers, you will not find it here. Sorry, God Bless.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little pony is the best game in the world!!!!<br />Doesn't cost any money to play a long time.Lots of fun( like pinkie pie).
B006YTTVHO|1.0|Really quite silly and basic, just be normal and skip this book! The suggestions for topics to discuss aren't particularly interesting truth be told.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Easy read, very interesting as you watch David develop a huge change in his life, and take his journey to success!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game not to challenging to drive you mad at points  like other games must get game if like puzzles
193700788X|4.0|Thats the only thing I can figure out. The book’s really not as bad as everyone’s saying.  Yes it’s got its problems, but for the most part it was a pretty good book.  Everyone’s entitled to their opinion, but based on some of the reviews I have to wonder how in the world did you expect the series to end?  I honestly don't have any idea what they expected except they clearly expected it to end like Twilight -- Ugh (the most improbable book series ending EVER.)    --SPOILERS--    First off, I should say, I liked Harris’ other Sookie books but they weren’t my favorites.  The books always seemed strangely laborious.  A lot of details, a lot – A LOT – of details about this and that, sometimes going over the same material and familiar characters and their history etc. etc. many times over throughout the entire series.  It got really monotonous.  You add that plus all the intrigue and mystery plot points and new characters and it just got to be too much.  This book seemed to eliminate those problems for me.  I could tell she tried something new with the third person narrative which was not hard at all to follow or get into.  I mean, so what, it’s not in first person?  Big whoop.  It would actually be kind of impossible to do a first person narrative with those sections.  She wanted to surprise us and she did.  But I have to say that while a part of me appreciated her bringing some beloved characters back for one last time, it was sort of unnecessary to bring some back especially since they’re not really a part of Sookie’s life anymore.  Unless they’re going to be a big part of the story, it’s not necessary to have her to run into someone while she’s having dinner or whatever, except maybe to confuse the reader into thinking it’s more than it seems.  Who knows.    But back to the book itself, I thought it flowed really well, the story never bored me or played down to the reader and it had a believable ending. Based on the trajectory of her previous books, I always knew she’d end up with ……sorry, can’t say.  That’s one spoiler I’ll leave alone.  But anyway, this guy was the best possible choice for Sookie and always was.  Sookie’s final sex scenes were sexy but I could have done without the seal reference.  That brought me out of the story and made me go, “ugh.”  Other than that I was happy for her and glad they made the leap.    One review I read left me shaking my head.  To paraphrase, they were basically chastising how Sookie was an awful female protagonist because of her poor life choices, she’s a lowly waitress from beginning to end, dead end job, dead end town and seems thrilled about it, also pretty much hating her for other silly things and for not ending up with their favorite guy character, etc. etc.    I’m sorry but that’s a crock of s***.  People forget how much time has gone by in Sookie’s world and are being pretty unfair.  I’d have to go wiki to be sure, but I think it’s only been a few years since Sookie first met Bill.  I mean really, how much is a person supposed to grow in a few years’ time?  Are you worlds different from a few years ago or are you still in the same job, same company, same home, same car, etc. etc?  In a few years’ time, Sookie went from being a waitress to being part owner of Merlotte’s.  She’s a business owner.  She owns her own home and doesn’t have a mortgage, all she has to do is pay for upkeep which she either does herself or she gets someone to do it.  She’s taking care of business and straightening her s*** out.  How many of you can say the same?  She’s even – FINALLY – getting her love life situated and in a relationship with someone that actually loves her.  Why is that so bad?  She also knows who her friends are, her real friends.  Again, that’s pretty darn awesome.  She’s grown up and that’s a good thing.    I’m sorry so many people were disappointed for whatever reason.  I frankly have no idea why allthe objections, but to put it country simple – I really think you need to be happy for her and let it go.  Sookie grew up, got the guy, is finally taking care of herself after having gone to the dark side and lived to tell the tale.  What's not to love about that?
0062124293|1.0|I stopped reading after Moran began discussing her pubic hair at length... I did not want to hear about her pubic hair. I was really disappointed because the book seemed so promising when I first started reading, but I wasn't able to connect to anything she was trying to say with the book. Perhaps it would be better slated to a teenager.
0143122916|4.0|Very in depth look at the horrors of living under the regime in North Korea. Recommend this read to all interested in learning the truth.,
0345529057|5.0|The books are great. After season 3 ended I knew I'd go through withdrawals before it came back, so I got the books to keep me entertained until then.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book reminds me of a Lifetime movie that is poorly scripted yet you cannot stop watching. The storyline was juicy enough to hold my attention and I was definitely invested in the characters outcomes. However, I thought the writing style was often very juvenile. Also, the books conclusion was highly unrealistic. It seems like the author gave up and just needed a nice easy way to bring it all together.
B001EC2IT4|5.0|It's not the first time I have seen this movie, but still enjoy it each time I do see it.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|Pink Floyd have had some excellent records along with some forgettable ones but The Final Cut isn't one of them. Came out about 3 years after their '79 smash hit The Wall and it lives up to it also. TFC has a similar sound but it's a bit darker lyrically. Inside the booklet it says dedicated to Eric Fletcher Waters 1913-1944 who die during WWII. The songwriting is excellent and very serious throughout, sometimes criticized for being too depressing. Roger Waters contributed a lot more vocally and lyrically than usual which I thought was alright but a lot of fans would disagree. Although it's not a rock album though so don't expect another Dark Side Of The Moon but I's recommend it if you can look for quality over genre or just want something a bit different from the usual. There's some real masterpieces here that rank among my top 25 Pink Floyd songs at least such as The Gunners Dream and The Fletcher Memorial Home.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This movie is enjoyable cheesy fun while you are watching it, but completely forgettable. Wait, what movie was I talking about....
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Just as fun as farmville and frontierville but with the slight nostalgic feel of the original game we all love. Definitely a great game.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|I purchased this product to entertain grandchildren on the summer Wednesdays with me.<br />It arrived in good condition (so far as I can tell, we haven't watched it yet) and very quickly.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|fun but wish it didn't cost to get stuff wish there was like a side game on the game to win things
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|I thought it was well done, I enjoyed the movie and found it entertaining.<br />I would recommend the movie to anyone.
0061564893|5.0|Controversial, full of implications for the future, politically and otherwise.  I have read the sequel 1434 also, but 1421 is more exciting.
B00AFEQA5K|1.0|This movie was way over rated in my thoughts.  Just stupid drugs, people getting them into trouble and looking for easy way outs, and some sexual scenes that I didn't appreciate--they don't make a movie a hit.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|There is nothing like that feeling of getting way more than you expected especially when you spent a rather good amount of time looking at what you were buying. It has been over 3 months since I purchased this mouse and I was skeptical at the time because it was a company I hadn't heard of before. I'm sorry I didn't have faith Anker, I promise won't make the same mistake again.<br />The mouse came on time and the packaging was really nice. I had seen similar offerings from Razer and it is on par if not better than those packages. The wire is threaded and feels durable and despite my less than spectacular care it is still running, no problem. I point this out because mice usually have problems when you disconnect them and reconnect them often (the connector part gets loose/breaks) and this was not the case here.  I had grown accustomed to gaming with stock computer mice and switching up to this was just significantly better. It took me some time getting used to the higher DPI and the use of the side buttons but now that I have I can't say I ever want to use another mouse.<br />It's always the tiny things I find most impressive and these are the things I thought wouldn't matter at all. For example, the weights. I thought it was a stupid little gimmick that didn't really do anything but, man, when I fiddled around with them (allowing a few days before I added/took off weight) I noticed an added level of comfort. The lights, which I thought were over the top for something you're not going to be looking at, add a beautiful hue to your desk area when not in use and I would spent some minutes just watching the light breathe as I fell asleep.<br />Of course the reason to buy this is not for the lights or the weights or that comfortable grip. It's for gaming, and boy can it game. The customizable DPI allows you to set it to 4 preconfigured levels and with the software (you have to download it which is not a problem for any gamer who should have a good Internet connection anyway) you can pinpoint that magical DPI sweet spot. The button on the bottom, that switches between your two sets of configurations, is really nice when you have macros set up for different games and is enough out of the way to prevent accidental clicks. I will admit I don't have the greatest of experience with mice, and less with gaming mice, but from what i have experienced it seems that this is a perfect product to learn and figure out exactly what you like. Plus, it works exactly as it should and to me that alone is worth the price tag on it, especially when you spend an average of 4 hours a day trying to get better at your game.<br />The final thing i was impressed with, though I didn't respond at the time, was the customer service. They emailed me to check on me and see that everything was fine with the product. I have never had a company care so much for my personal opinion and it felt really nice. Since I didn't have any problems and was busy with schoolwork and gaming I didn't respond with the deserved praise. I hope this makes up for it Anker.<br />I love this mouse and will soon buy another for my brother. He keeps changing my weights on the thing and it gets frustrating.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|Can't beat the price and it is great to have the complete works all in one place.<br />It is clear and easy to read.  Gotta love it!
0060556501|3.0|This is the beautifully illustrated and condensed version of C.S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  It is great for the younger child who is not quite ready for the original version.  The illustrations are truly stunning, and the adaptation hits all the high points of the story pretty well.<br /><br />**HOWEVER...**<br /><br />The allegory of Christ's sovereign power and redemptive act on the cross is completely missed in this version.  In fact, it seems deliberately replaced with the false theology of \\"God helps those who help themselves.\\"  For example, on Aslan says to the children, \\"Crowns must be earned, and that time is upon you\\"; after Edmund has his walk with Aslan, it is written, \\"Lucy thought her brother looked quite different...as if he was beginning to trust himself again\\"; and then the worst example of all is when after the great battle with the Witch, Peter says to Aslan that without Edmund's help in breaking her wand, the Witch would have won, and Aslan says, \\"True, even I might be a statue.\\" (!!!!!!!!)  These examples are not even close to what Lewis wrote, and completely MISS the point of the original book: That Jesus came to rescue people who were traitors, just like Edmund, and it is by His own doing and not our works.<br /><br />\\"But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ...For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\\" Ephesians 2:4-5, 8-9<br /><br />Despite the huge theological problems with the book, the pictures are just too beautiful to not own this.  So, as another reviewer suggested, get out your white-out, and be prepared to write-in your own words in some places.  In the egregious section where Aslan reflects that he, too, might have been a statue had Edmund not intervened, I have replaced it with: \\"No, I havecome to conquer the White Witch, and bring statues back to life!\\"

It was nice looking, yet it also added a bit of charm to the cake that exceeded the normal boring wedding cake look without being too excessive or ridiculous. My younger guests were particularly charmed because it made an element of the wedding familiar to them.

NOW THESE TWO RIVALS WILL BECOME ALLIES AND TEAM UP TO FINISH THE JOB NO MATTER WHO COMES IN THEIR WAY. IT'S LIKE WHENEVER THESE TWO KILLERS COLLIDE, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
0062124293|5.0|This book is HILARIOUS! I laughed out loud many times while reading. Moran does a great job of tackling current (and some historical) women's issues with grace and humor, and makes a compelling argument for why feminism is important for everyone. I will definitely purchase and recommend to all my friends! Thanks Caitlin!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story is all about survival, creativity and science. If I were a HS science teacher, I would build lesson plans around this book.  It makes science real. And Mark Watney is a great character. The first person narrative is tough to pull off, but the author really pulls it off. I highly recommend it.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I am shocked so many people like this movie, and that it was nominated for so many awards.  The story gives a complete oversimplification of mental illness and the message seems to be that if two completely broken people get together and learn a dance routine, they can overcome their immense psychological struggles and cure their mental illness forever.<br /><br />Not to mention I wasn't ever sure what mood they were trying to convey.  There is an artful way to do dramedy, and it can't be found here.
1932907009|4.0|This book will help you say the same thing only heighten your material by allowing you to say more and do more in your storyline and with your characters. You'll accomplish a lot more in the same number of pages before you referenced and applied the beats mentioned in this book.

B001N3OJEG|5.0|Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger were great in this movie.  It is too bad that the movie industry does not make movies like this anymore.  There are so many great actors in this movie I just wonder how the directors and producers were able to cast such a great group.  I doubt that such a collection of great talent could be assembled in a movie now.

B00992CF6W|5.0|sadly, Minecraft is not number one on the game chart. We need more people to purchase and rate the game so that Mojang will feel more appreciated. Even though there are millions of purchases and thousands of ratings, it just not enough! Please let Minecraft reach the top. We all love this game, but without more ratings, Minecraft will get lower and lower! Hurry, before time runs out.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Cheap fix for removing ads and comes with the added bonus of in game gold for vehicle upgrades. This adds value in my opinion. The gameplay is intuitive and easy to control. Anyone or any age can pick it up and play.
B006M4F67A|3.0|This could be a great game- addictive in a good way, great graphics, but, I really don't like the way time is added to the clock when a reshuffle is needed. I don't think my time should be increased (a full minute!) because options ran out.
B003TTCURU|5.0|I was a Grey's Anatomy fan from the beginning, then eventually, as some TV series get, the plot became rather boring. Season 6, however, seemed to bring the series back to its original very interesting story line, and the finale had me hooked again and waiting for Season 7, which also didn't disappoint!

Last night I purchased some cards to play a round, and the game froze just after my purchase. This morning I logged on and I had a message that my chips would be replaced. I was happy. :)
B0001I55OC|3.0|The movie was pretty good as a standalone movie but there were unnecessary changes from the book. They even changed the gender of one relatively unimportant character. The end should have stayed the same as the book as well. I know they were going for action but what happened to the boss in the book would have been better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not excited about the ending...but that has nothing to do with the quality acting.  The story line is intriguing and always has you coming back for more.  I can't wait for Season 4!
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|While my title is not exactly true, SW began a neo-solo journey with this album. There's a wide range of his talents on display, and a few really good songs that stand out. Most notable is Harmony Korine, Abandoner, Get All You Deserve and Insurgentes. A good album to put on and just take it in.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|After following Insurgentes with Grace for Drowning, SW arrived at &#34;The Raven...&#34;. A well-composed, artful compilation, with fantastic Mellotron and Hammond/Leslie runs that brought me to comment to him, &#34;You are the second coming of Progressive Rock!&#34;.<br /><br />The album has a unique musical style that runs through each song, all built around a thematic story-line as well. Much as one might play a song over and over to try and figure out what a singer is saying, I found myself listening to songs over and over to catch the subtle, perfectly placed sounds, instruments and fleeting effects. He has also shown a keen ability to play emotions like an instrument, and &#34;The Raven...&#34; may quite well leave you in tears.<br /><br />Of all his endeavors - Porcupine Tree, Blackfield and No Man - this, to me, is his best.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|me and my children love it and me and my husband have competitions on who is the quickest. we all find it very addictive

B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I'm playing a game, not geocaching. I'm not looking for the nearest gas station or restaurant. So, why does this app need to know where I am? I'm playing against the app's AI, so why does it need to access the internet?<br /><br />Answer : it doesn't. Everyone is upset about the NSA listening to our calls. So, why are we paying for apps to track our locations?

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Good movie. It's not only about comic book heroes anymore. It's just like with Batman Begins. How would the real world deal to if aliens might finally be among us. Man of Steel is not about spandex heroes with superpowers any more. It's about humanity, power, responsibilty and how to deal with all of it. There is a lot to think and discuss about after watching this movie, and that's exactly what you do after you saw any good film that is not just a popcorn movie.<br /><br />Now,  how are the filmmakers  going to up the ante for a sequel. Well, it is not about upping it anymore. To understand why, you must read this review from a clear perspective. This film, just like all of Nolan's previous ones, is not only about flashy visuals but more bout it's content and how we react to that content. That's why the Nolan - Snyder team up is the perfect marriage to present the new Man of Steel.<br /><br />Clark Kent is what he is because of his alien heritage AND his parents rising. He's Clark Kent all along the movie. From beginning to end. We're introduced to both his kriptonian and terran parents. And we got fond to all of them. I love how the movie shows us Clark from the beginning, right after the Kripton sequences. I've always hated when movies begin with some kid played by an unknown actor and we're forced to assume and accept this kid as if he's our hero.<br /><br />Because Clark is practically human by how he was raised, and also because he's the only one with this powers around for nearly thirty years, It's clear that although he's definitely willing to help and protect everybody, he just don't know how to properly react when Zod and the other kryptonians appears on Earth, threatening the whole planet.<br /><br />Take for example, what happens when you get involved in a horrific car crash accident? it won't  matter what an excellent and conscious driver you truly are. If you're in the middle of it, you won't be able to do much to avoid it. I think is the same for Superman.<br /><br />And because of this, we all get the long awaited punch to punch action. But it's not senseless anymore. Action-ReAction. As the action secuences progressed, we change from moviegoers to spectators. We're not only watching the cool action but we're beginning to notice all the devastation generated from the fight, and we begin to worry and care for all the casualties that are for instance very high. And then, we're not mere Superman fans anymore, but suddenly began to question the menace this and any alien threat could be. If you emphatize with what I just wrote, well, I guess the movie is spot on.<br /><br />The next chapter will, without a doubt, not try to up the ante by a mile. The filmmakers have clearly planted the foundations to give us now a movie that will undoubtedly deal with why Superman is kind of dangerous. And this will be the trigger for the Man of Steel to reach his next level of wisdom.<br /><br />Also, just picture this. Although all of Superman efforts, if this kind of threat ever shows again, it won't matter what Superman does. He can't handle it alone. This is the perfect background for the Justice League to enter the picture.<br /><br />To end this review, let me add. I do like Man of Steel. At last we're presented to a Clark Kent that is what he is not only because of his heritage, but of his rising. And how he constantly keeps trying to honor that. And like any of us, will fail at some points. How we deal with this failings is how we really grow in the end.<br /><br />ABOUT iMAX and 3D:<br /><br />Although you can enjoy this film on standard cinemas, this movie is one of those few where iMAX screenings do add to the experience. What a difference! And to watch the final battle on 3D, Just wow!<br /><br />YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED ON WATCHING THIS VIDEO:<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS!!!!!!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />everything said here is exactly what I think I how I feel about Man of Steel. I don't rant about Zod being killed at the end. and I don't think Superman killed him to save just a family of four. What he did was because is right there and there when Superman realizes how many people have been put at perile and how many more would be because Zod won't simply stop. All the consecuences about this will be dealt in MoS 2
B009NY43NY|4.0|If you have followed Sookie's story this far, you are of course going to buy this book and read it. She wraps things up pretty well, although I didn't find it quite as gripping as some of her others in the series.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I will always remain a loyal fan of Hosseini's stories but found this one disappointing.  Somewhere around halfway it felt like the story lost its flow as it started whiz zing back and forth across the stories of too many characters.  They all seemed unfinished.  I wanted to know them all or at least follow two or three right through.  Perhaps a great story teller trying to fit too many stories or threads in one book.
5550507080|5.0|I've Been a Rush Fan since the Early 1980's and have Seen the Band In concert over 10 Times and I own all The Albums. Moving Pictures is NOT my favorite Rush Album(Power Windows Is) but to the average Fan This is The Greatest Rush album. Honestly they are not far off. Side one Is Basically a Mini Greatest Hits album Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, YYZ, And Limelight are still played on Classic Rock Radio in Max Rotation Today(A Good And Bad Thing). Side 2 Has Witch Hunt(Fear Trilogy) The Camera Eye And Vital Signs. Not A Bad song in the Bunch And it All Clocks in At Under 45 Minutes. Simply A Stone Cold Classic, Hey Maybe it is The Best Rush Album.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson!  Seriously, I'm still looking for something he has written that didn't just grab me and pull me into that imaginary world.  The only things I haven't tried are the Alcatraz series.<br /><br />This book is no exception.  It took a few pages to kidnap me from the real world, but I find the larger the scope of the story, the more time needs to be invested to really grasp the mood and pace.  By 25%-35% into the book, I was hooked.  I liked the world he has created, the magic system (always unique and interesting from Mr. Sanderson's books) and, maybe most importantly, I was able to care about the characters.  I wanted to know &#34;what happens next?&#34;.<br /><br />Now for my biggest complaint.  The story is going to be big.  I mean HUGE!  That's not my complaint; I love that part.  What I hate is that I'll have to wait 1-4 years between each book.  At my age (*cough* 44), my memory doesn't last that long.  By the time the next book is out, I will have forgotten the most recent book and have to re-read it.  (I'm looking at you, Wheel of Time series!  Oh high, Mr. Sanderson.  Glad to see you here, too.  Great job finishing Mr. Jordan's magnum opus.)<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for a huge world with great characters, interesting world and unique magic system, get this!
B0093LINVK|5.0|Intel Next Unit of Computing Kit with Dual HDMI, Gigabit LAN, Core i3-3217U DC3217IYE<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093LINVK/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Purchased 6 of these after getting first one and being excited how small yet powerful this computer is. It is not comparable with my main workstation that is running 6-core s2011 Sandy Bridge-E CPU but it is great machine for general (and not only use).<br /><br />Here is what I use these for.<br /><br />First one is running Linux Ubuntu at this moment, will install SuSe later to try. I have very limited experience with Linux but I definitely want to expend it since this is the OS (or variant of OS) that Android is based on and it is the one used for Raspherry PI, various video streaming devices, smart TVs, Synology NAS etc. Everyone should be familiar with Linux unless you're willing to be one devices command. Personally, I am willing to learn how and command/control my devices.<br /><br />Second one is my Windows 8 system I use to test.<br /><br />Third one is a Windows 7 system with Advanced Host Monitor software installed that I use to monitor multiple networks/devices, both internal and remote via probes. Works great for this purpose as it consumes very little and it is powerful enough for hundreds and thousands test that are checking servers, computers and network gear.<br /><br />Two other are running VMware ESXi 5.1 and acting as hosts for my growing park of test lab devices I use to test high availability and other features of vSphere. Since all these computers are in my home office it was a mandatory requirement to be very quiet and energy efficient. Intel NUC fits the bill nicely for this purpose. Since the LAN adapter is not in vSphere list, custom driver is required but it is very easy to buid your own ISO, just use web search engine of your choice.<br /><br />Sixth is running a ESXi and vSenter in virtual machine that manages my test lab virtual infrastructure. You can install ESXi on SSD or run it off USB stick without any other storage device installed on NUC.<br /><br />I understand that 6 NUCs is not a typical setup for average user but I was just wanted to show you a possible use for this amazing small computer.<br /><br />Some notes:<br /><br />Not USB 3.0 but so far I am not affected by this in any way since there are just a few occasions I need to communicate with a USB 3.0 device and the speed is imperative.<br /><br />Like that there is no power cord in the box. This way you can re-use the one from any old device like Dell laptop. This is better for environment since we will reduce the waste. Since I had only one such a cord I ordered the rest from Amazon, there is a nice deal for 2ft long cord that cost just couple bucks each.<br /><br />I would prefer the power supply inside the case as it is on Mac Mini instead of external power brick. The Mini's case is larger but if you have multiple devices you'll create a big mess with all cables and transformers lying around.<br /><br />Default settings for fan speed and CPU temperature are too low (and temperature set too high) and unit becomes how after a while. Just go into BIOS (and update it first) and change the CPU threshold to 60C or so, retation from 20 to 30% and your NUC will be almost as cold as the walls in your room without fan being noisy at all. I can't hear any of my NUCs 1m away; the only noise I hear is coming from the fan of my RabbitAir A2 filter on \\"3\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, video resolution is 192-x1080 max on this model, I'd like to see 2560x1600 to match my 30\\" Dells native resolution.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|Love this CD.  Worth the money! I carry it in my car and play it all the time.  If you are considering - just buy it you wont be sorry.
B000002O3I|5.0|My son is interested in all types of music but when he deeply relaxes and feels like he is truly home, he puts on the blues.  Over the years he has developed favorites, yet welcomes new (to him) artists.  With 4 children between 4 to 14 he does not take a lot of time to research on his own so when he was given this CD for his birthday, it was a revelation which he enjoyed very much.  It has been added to the favorites already!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really loved the book because it told a true romantic story of two people who would not have met in their lives if not for the accident.  They both tried their best to do what they felt would help the other person.  Clark grew immensely in her work to save him from committing suicide.  He did everything he could to help her become the person he knew she could become.  The story was well told and all the characters were believable.  I would have to say it was one of the best books I have read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book and recommend you put it on your summer reading list.<br /><br />We travel back in forth through years of Jamie McCloonie's life from the hell he endured while starting life in a orphanage to his realization that heaven is actually here on earth &#34;not up there&#34;.<br /><br />I loved the characters as they came to life on the pages of Ms. McKenna's story.  My favorite, next to Jamie himself, was Rose. Rose was a wonderful woman with many talents from crafts to cooking and always a good saying for almost any situation.  I laughed out loud as she mixed a few of these saying up but that's part of what made her so lovable.  Her heart was always in the right place.  Rose's husband, Paddy, was a man of few words but he also had a heart of gold.<br /><br />I believe we all look for that one love of our life - sometimes we find it and sometimes it eludes us.  Jamie is no different in his quest to find love.<br /><br />Pity that the description of the orphanage was based on tales the author gathered from those that were subject to such treatment.  I was definitely surprised to learn that the last of these houses of child slavery and torture in Ireland did not close until the late 90's.  I wonder how many children are still subjected to such cruelty in children's homes throughout the world, I'm afraid that the answer would be more than most of us would like to believe.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did - toward the end I had mixed feelings because I hated to leave Ireland and the people I met during my journey through the book.

I have not seen a movie that has pulled me in as much as this movie did in a very long time.  The story is extremely thought provoking, which makes me immediately want to re-watch it as I am sure I will take something different away each time.  Another Earth immediately shoots to the top of my all time favorite movie list along with Lost in Translation.<br /><br />I look forward to watching this movie again - and again - and following both Brit Marling and the director of the film as their careers evolve.

0142410705|4.0|John Green is quickly becoming one of my favorite guilty pleasure authors.  An Abundance of Katherines is very witty and smart.  The story centers around recent high school graduate and former child prodigy, Colin Singleton.  He has only dated girls named Katherine and has just been dumped by Katherine XIX.  His best friend Hassan, talks him into going on a road trip where they end up in a small town in Tennessee.  I really enjoyed this book even more than I liked The Fault in Our Stars, which was the first John Green book I read.  The only complaint I have is that Green is sometimes too witty in his dialogue between teenagers.  If you are looking for a funny and quick read.  This is the book for you!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|AWSOME game! Beautiful graphics, and nice animals. I love how you can rescue animals, and breed too! The update made it better! Alas, though not all games are perfect. For those going to buy and read reviews, I don't like how some missions. You have to log in to a website you don't know, and you have to make friends. The breeding takes too long too. Sometimes, I have to just collect money and experience, BORING! it's fun and all, but to mostly the ones who created this, it needs more excitement! I mean an adventure! Too ME, it's fun, but what about a storyline? Like take the legendary guardians for example. Notice the guard in guardians? Aren't they supposed to protect the wild, not act like normal animals! Anyways, it's an AWSOME game, but needs adventure.

0399165274|2.0|One of my favorite thrillers of all time is THE DAY OF THE JACKEL. It is a brilliant novel- with a pulse-pounding plot that gets increasingly fast paced as we near the ending. Knowing that Charles DeGaulle was not assassinated did not matter as the suspense continued to build. Characters were well rounded and we truly sympathized with the antihero assassin. It is and demands to be on every best novel list in the genre. To be honest, the author of that book is not at all the same type of writer.<br /> In THE KILL LIST, we follow The Tracker aka Colonel Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson as he organizes a highly secret search to find and kill a person known as The Preacher. This individual has placed on the internet videos of himself encouraging the faithful to kill one important person in their community then die themselves. His perfect English motivates multiple young Arabs to commit murder in the US and Great Britain. In an effort to silence him, The Tracker utilizes everything at his disposal in an effort to find this elusive criminal and terminate him. What he has to utilize is considerable including the CIA and multiple special ops including those of Britain and Israel. In a very matter of fact way, Frederick Forsyth describes how the mission progresses in tedious tradecraft detail.<br /> There is so much technical detail in this `novel' that the reader might feel more like they are reading a covert ops journal. There is virtually no character development or sympathetic characters of any kind. There is little suspense as we are left to little doubt as to the final outcome of this tedious overwrought `novel'. Read a nonfiction work if you are interested in the technique of tracking terrorists.  Avoid this one.

Yes, she always goes into detail about diamond mining in this, but she always gives the reader background into the topics she writes about.

It may not have been something I would ever have looked into on my own, but Reichs always keeps me interested!!

B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I had really been looking forward to seeing this movie. I was disappointed to not see it in the theater, and it was the first movie on my list to see when I had a chance.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the three worst movies ever made. I think the main problem is the actor cast as Oz--I don't watch TV but I think he's in a popular television show. In this movie, it was as though he bothered to show up on set and say his lines, but there was nothing at all behind the character.  Very two-dimensional.  As a matter of fact, all but one of the cast seemed to be like snotty kids in a school play--the ones who think they're good enough to be on stage but really aren't.<br /><br />I think there might have been a story line behind this that could have been salvaged.  I'd heard of many of the actors/actresses in the film and expected that it would be pretty good, but my sense in watching it was that they filmed it over the course of a couple of weeks and used the rehearsals in the final cut.<br /><br />My 9-year old daughter claims to have liked the movie, but...probably only because I said I didn't :)<br /><br />It's particularly disappointing that this is associated with one of the greatest film classics of all time. But if it weren't, I'm sure no one would ever bother watching it all the way through.
B002JCSWVG|5.0|When I first watched Invictus I was not sure what to expect for I knew very liitle about South Africa. I also had no understanding of how the game of rugby is played. Yet I found that this movie was about much more than rugby. I was awed at how Nelson Mandela was able to use a team (sport) that was hated by many in South Africa as a way to unite the country. This movie shows that reconcilation and forgiveness is possible no matter how dark the situation seems at the time. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in sports as well as in history. My respect for Mandela has increased significantly since watching Invictus. This movie has also intrigued me to learn more about South African history.
B001RPIYV4|4.0|Interesting comparison to Shakespeare.  More action, louder soundtrack gets students' attention. Provides stimulus for discussion. Use in conjunction with play itself.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this continuing series of books. If you love Sylvia Day's writing you'll continue to read her work.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the continued twists and turns by the characters. Eva & Gideon issues are as complicated as their family issues making me think things are screwed up even with money involved just you can pay people off better.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book to come out!

B004X181TY|5.0|**This review is full of spoilers --sorry!**<br />After our recent time spent driving through the Yorkshire moors and visiting the Brontë Parsonage museum, I decided to watch this 2011 version of Jane Eyre again last night with the director's commentary on as I worked at diminishing my huge sewing pile.<br /><br />Colours are one of the first things I notice about a movie I'm watching.  With this particular film I am always instantly struck by the stunning colour palette. Mossy greys, forest greens, earthy browns, a few rare glimpses of russet reds.  Black shadows... deep and dark, pierced only by lonely candles or dim golden firelight. Truly evocative of an electricity-free 1840s England, this lighting --or lack of lighting-- style has resulted in a drama that is more realistically shaded than than most period films.  In nighttime scenes, we see little more than faces lit only by the candles they are carrying.  The surrounding darkness is intense, alive, and sometimes oppressive.<br /><br />This is the first version of Jane Eyre in which I've been fully impressed with the portrayal of the title character.  I was gratified by Mia Wasikowska's accurate interpretation of Jane's strength and inner courage. After feeling disappointment with Ruth Wilson's pretty but meek and mild performance in the 2006 TV miniseries, it was refreshing to watch Wasikowska embody Jane's self-possessed yet passionate personality brilliantly.  Director Cary Fukinaga has chosen to capture on film only what Jane herself would have seen, which completely makes this all about Jane --rightly so.  The only exception is a brief moment when Mr Rochester discovers Jane's open window, and her flight from Thornfield.  This scene is blended with his voice calling out to her across the miles that separate them, so she is instantly connected to it anyhow.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender carries off Mr Rochester's rudeness and generally abrupt manner quite well, as described in the novel.  He expresses a less fierce Rochester than the novel does, but this is in keeping with the movie's approach.  There is an austere dreamlike quality to the entire film due to the restrained screenplay and understated filming style that imparts a softer feel to the plot and characters.  Actors playing Mr Rochester usually have a field day with their character. He is portrayed as loud and larger than life, completely dwarfing Jane in personality, wealth, humour, and looks.  An appropriate amount of restraint in the interpretation of Mr Rochester, for this movie, is a welcome change from previous versions; after all, the novel is titled Jane Eyre --not Rochester!<br /><br />A less important but yet rather key detail of this film is the fact that the characters of Jane and Rochester are played by actors of ages accurate to those in the novel.  Eighteen-year-old Wasikowska plays nineteen-year-old Jane, and Fassbender is at least thirty, or looks it. Wasikowska is small, with a childlikeness about her that conveys the naive Jane's character well.  Other film versions, for me, have been less believable just because of the inaccuracy of the casting.<br /><br />Moira Buffini's screenplay is filled with direct quotes from Charlotte Brontë's novel.  Many well-loved lines, such as \\"A mere reed she feels in my hand! I could bend her with my finger and thumb!\\", and \\"Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?\\" are in.  Others, less congenial to the bare story this movie is telling, such as \\"Reader, I married him\\" are out.  It's refreshing to see a film adaptation of a classic novel that doesn't feel the need to drastically change the language or the plot in order to make the movie watchable.<br /><br />In the director's commentary, Cary Fukunaga mentions his desire to strip the story down to its key elements and thus increase the emotional impact of the film, all within the time constraints.  I've seen other directors attempt less successfully to do this [notably Joe Wright's 2005 Pride and Prejudice], but here Fukunaga's strategy works, probably because of Moira Buffini's brilliant screenplay.  There is one scene --straight from the book-- after Jane's discovery of Rochester's duplicity on their wedding day, when she leaves her room for a drink of water only to stumble over Rochester on the threshold.  The conversation that takes place between them afterwards is one of the most evocative passages in the book, and so stark in its description of Jane's moral struggle that early reviewers of Jane Eyre derided Brontë's novel as \\"coarse\\".  In many film versions, this scene is either out or edited strangely.  Here it is completely stripped of its original verbosity and yet still faithfully rendered through a few accurately chosen lines, in an emotionally impacting scene that is heartrending and raw.  Rochester's sense of his own power and his inability to use it because of his love for Jane [\\"A mere reed she feels in my hand! I could bend her with my finger and thumb!\\"] and Jane's desperation [\\"God help me!\\"] are perfectly acted.<br /><br />Those who have read the book will have no difficulty following the story of Jane Eyre as this movie portrays it.  For watchers who haven't, I think they might have some questions.<br /><br />If I had not read the book, I might be wondering why Jane falls in love with Rochester in the first place.  The movie veers quite close to a rather strange interpretation of this, making it possible to believe that Jane is merely a lonely, persuadable schoolgirl and Rochester is selfishly using her as an escape from his tarnished past in an attempt to return to a more innocent time in his life when his memory was \\"without blot or contamination\\".  However in the novel, Charlotte Brontë clearly shows us that her feelings for Rochester arise out of a sense of an intellectual connection: a meeting of the minds and a bond between their spirits.<br /><br />Also, I would question Rochester's wife Bertha's madness after watching this version.  We see her for all of three minutes -rather calm ones, at that- and the blood-chilling dream-to-reality scene in which she rips Jane's wedding veil in two makes no appearance in this adaptation.<br /><br />Both of these plot gaps are only a result of the lack of time to tell the story.  Yes, this is the \\"cliff notes\\" version of Jane Eyre.  There is a fast-paced feel to what is actually a very slow story.  As with any film struggling to fit a many-layered, complex 500-page piece of literature into less than two hours of screen time [again, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" 2005] we are missing a few scenes and narrative that define key developments in the plot.  In order to cram the story into the typical two hours, sacrifices have been made --thus the minor plot omissions-- leaving those unfamiliar with the novel unable to fully appreciate the story.<br /><br />I love the way the film begins in the last third of the book and then plays catch-up for the remainder of the movie.  It is very well executed, and works perfectly.  Someone who hasn't read the novel might disagree with me on that, but I thought it was an effective and unique method of visually interpreting the book!  The abrupt ending was refreshing. I often feel, while reading the final few pages of Jane Eyre, that Brontë is rushing to provide a satisfactory postscript to the story of every single character in the plot, just as many traditional movies love to do.  Sometimes less is more; and this film's pared-down, succinct contrast was superbly executed.<br /><br />This movie is a version made by those who've read the book and love it, for those who've read the book and love it

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is the kind of book that grabs you and won't let you go. Well written, eerie, and disturbing, the story never eases up.  The tension is palpable. I am always searching for a book that makes time fly as you read it and this is one of those books.  Great read for a long plane trip, I recommend it to anyone who likes this genre.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|I liked the read, it was fun, but I never got too worried about the characters too much. Red shirts die, galaxy is in danger, let's take a drink every time Picard straightens his uniform! I watched the episode involving this plot and timeline and it's very accurate with it's descriptions of the past events and well worth the daily deal price.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|good gameplay. lots of unit upgrades. I like the different skill trees. excellent time waster. definitely worth the cheap price
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus is a fantastic narrative that had me reading as fast as I could. I will not spoil any information, but I particularly enjoy the balance Hugh Howey employs between description and action as well as dialogue and internal monologue. He manages to keeps the twists from being too obvious while keeping the tension palpable. I also notice that when transitioning from character to character as the stories progress he brilliantly gives the character something to discover the reader doesn't know, but the previous information the reader does know keeps the tensions high as we learn more and more about the world.<br /><br />If you're looking for a well written story with compelling characters, this is your man.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Finally an easy-to-use app for printing from my Kindle Fire and HTC One! It was simple to set up and use.
B0002199H2|5.0|Anyone who is interested in Miles Davies and Gil Evans will love this 6 set of CD's. It also tells you the story of how each song was written, it is awesome. Quick delivery from Amazon in the US as well as I could not get it in the UK! Very happy with this purchase.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|A fantastic and absolutely unexpected look into the zombie's side of the story, with an unusually feel-good characteristic for a film within this genre. The only regret I have about this movie is that I didn't follow my gut instinct to buy the movie instead of rent it. This is once again, a very unexpectedly unique film and I fully intend to purchase this film as well as watch it again in the future.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I own the whole collection.  Needless to say I'm a twiheart and love this movie and all the rest in the series.  I'm 33 and I'm not afraid to say that...  ;-)
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think the awesome part of this game is if you don't have Internet (you need Internet to play this game) you can still play you just can't buy coins or visit friends you can earn bling just for watching video this game is really addicting I recommend it for sparkly girls and peoples who love animals._
0066620996|1.0|\\"Good to Great\\" introduces readers to the concept of an enduring great company, one that sustains tremendous growth for at least 15 years from the so called \\"turning point\\".<br /><br />Published in 2001, the book gives us a great opportunity to analyze how much endurance there is in a great enduring company.<br /><br />Since many of the graphs in the book end in 1998, let's see how the eleven example companies listed in the book did in the next 15 years, from 1998 to 2013.<br /><br />If a convinced reader of the book bought $1 worth of stock of each company back in 1998, the total return on the portfolio in 2013 would be $19.72.<br /><br />In comparison, the Dow Jones went from 8,000 to 15,000, so the return on investment of $11 in general market would be $20.62.<br /><br />It turns out, on average, the \\"great enduring companies\\" performed slightly worse than general market in the next 15 years after their big sustained successes.<br /><br />After the author's praise to the great management teams at the companies which target for sustained long-term growth and build a lasting corporate culture to support the growth, these results are disappointing. In the timelines presented in book, the same portfolio does 8x better than the general market, not 5% worse.<br /><br />Conclusion: The book is well-written and full of interesting notions and quotes. But its main value today is seeing what happened next to superstar companies scientifically and elaborately picked as examples by a group led by a Stanford scholar. There is no way around a feeling that even these highly educated individuals fell under the spell of success and started to find patterns and laws where there were none. One thing is clear though - the subsequent failures of the great enduring companies can be explained in another book, based on an even better scientific study.<br /><br />--- Data<br /><br />I have put together a list of company name, stock price in 1998, stock price in 2013 and calculated returns on investing $1 in the companies' stock for that period.<br /><br />For companies that went under, I assumed the investor held on the stock until it fell to $1.<br /><br />Abbott Laboratories $21 $36 $1.71 nyse:abt<br /><br />Circuit City $18 $1 $0.05 nyse:cc<br />Delisted.

1476733953|5.0|Consider yourself lucky that you can read the Wool Omnibus edition and will not have to wait for further installments. This is one of those books that is too long to read all at once, but you will be hoping for the next chance to get back to it.<br /><br />The world of the silo and their characters are completely believable. This is true in large part to letting us in on the thoughts and interactions that seem so genuinely human. You can easily put yourself in their place and understand completely how they are feeling. You really connect with the people. It also helps that these people are trying to do the right thing in the face of some very tough circumstances.<br /><br />The depth and story pace are just right. I think you will find the circumstances and events of the saga to be thought provoking. I found myself thinking about the present day human race and the struggles we all face.<br /><br />I am so happy that I got to read this story. I hope you enjoy it too.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great world, interesting characters, ingenious plot twists. This is a hard book to put down. It's always just \\"one more page...\\"
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Beautifully narrated heroic story delivered in a page turning style. The book is an eye opener on the intensions and viewpoints of the professional German Ace pilots.
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|The delivery of the movie was terrible. Every 2 minutes the screen went black and it took another 20 seconds to restore. I want my money back.
B00004XMTJ|3.0|I didn't realize it was not a film of one of the Broadway plays.  The price was very high. I would recommend a lesser cost video.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Crashes a lot!  When playing,  the game will often freeze. and get stuck - you have to close. and restart!  But it 's a fun game when it works!
0307744434|5.0|this book is encompasses the atmosphere and overtones of being in sleep no more. if you have not seen this theatrical masterpiece, you must see it. if you have and you have not read this book, you must read it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun game. When you first start it takes a minute to figure out what you're supposed to do, but after you know what to do its a lot of fun...
B000069HKH|4.0|I'm not what you would call a massive Springsteen fan but I do enjoy some of his music, with The Rising being the record that initially caught my attention. Songs like The Rising and Lonesome Day immediately grabbed me and they still hold up over a decade later, as do the contemplative ballads like My City of Ruins and Nothing Man. Despite being released shortly after September 11 the record doesn't sound dated and it feels much more timeless than one might expect. The only weak area comes from the album's running time, which feels too bloated at 72 minutes. I don't have an issue with long albums but they only work when the material necessitates that length, and sadly The Rising is about four or five songs too long. Nothing here is inherently bad but there are a few songs that fail to really leave an impression and they could have been relegated to b-side status quite easily without sacrificing the theme and flow of the record.<br /><br />That aside, this is a good introduction for those just getting into Bruce and it's a treat for the longtime fans who might have felt his best days were behind him. Definitely give this one a spin. The highs are more than worth it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Jack London is a brilliant wordsmith. The story he tells is a powerful one that transports you to a different time and place. I found it deeply engaging.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well written and moves fast.  Writer jumps around constantly from one character and time to another which makes you have to wait to put the whole story together.  I did like it and learned a great deal about another culture.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|I remember this movie from my childhood and always thought Danny Kay was great. I was very glad to find it. If you love old movies this movie is a must to have.
1452113432|5.0|I want to dive into Rachel Khoo's world!  All her recipes look enticing and the photographs attest to that.  Highly recommend this.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Khaled as usual doesn't disappoint. A beautiful story rich with life and emotions,.  My only negative is that when the story moved to a new location, the characters were hard to follow.
B00C061HZY|5.0|A great album on beautifully printed, simple vinyl. Stylized like the older 70s and 80s Columbia releases, which is a great touch. Can't go wrong.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen. The evil doctor turns out to have a great heart. Gives up the bad life for the love of children. Cool.
B007R21JJK|5.0|My last computer was a Q6600 OC'd to 3.2 GHz that had a Gigabyte P35-DS3L mobo that lasted me all the way from XP through Win 7 for 5+ years of solid computing without much problem. It too had Ultra Durable caps and such.  When I started looking for an update, I wanted to wait for Haswell.  It turned out that Haswell had more of an emphasis on integrated graphics than pure desktop performance.  Hence, I went back to looking at Ivy Bridge parts that were much cheaper and have greater OC headroom than Haswell parts. So when the i5-3570K went on sale, I bit. The Gigabyte Z77X-UD3H is a stellar mobo, and when paired with the i5-3570K, it shines.  This thing has four 4-pin case fan headers and one 4-pin CPU fan header to work in the latest revise of the Antec 900 case.  The bonus features are many for people that want to OC.  The power button and reset buttons are integrated into the board. There are even voltage drops to test with a multimeter on the board, just like the OC varieties of the Gigabyte Z87 boards. The BIOS is awesome.  I really like UEFI BIOS and AMI does a good job here.  You just need to make sure that if you use a USB keyboard, to use the USB ports below the network port for compatibility with the Intel USB drivers.  I also have a PS2 keyboard just in case.  I also noticed that older versions of Memtest do not work right and keep rebooting.  I used the latest 4.2 version of Memtest and it works with this mobo.  As of this writing, I got a mobo that had the F18 bios version as shipped.<br /><br />A couple of notes for the bios, I started with Load Optimized Defaults and stock settings for the i5-3570K and used the XMP profiles for my RAM  (16GB DDR3-1600 9-9-9-24 Patriot Memory). I ran memtest,  and then installed windows 7 x64, checking for stability along the way with Prime 95. This was all stock.<br /><br />Then comes the OC.  I saw a youtube video review on this board and noticed they used Auto VCore for OC.

B0000C1733|5.0|I will more than likely use  your services again in the near future . I was very impressed with the fact that the CD did arrive in a timely manner and  met and possibly exceeded my expectations with level of service.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I had a great  time  playing with this game.  The graphics are beautiful and the puzzles were not to hard  but not too easy. The only reason why I gave it a four star and not a five is because I wanted it to be a longer game.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I look forward to reading more from this author.  Came away with an inspired, motivated sense of emotion and a yearning for more....
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|One of my very favorite authors.<br /><br />I loved this story. So real and as heartwarming as it was heartbreaking. The story touched my heart. And my soul.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it too much for Human comprehension. They vocabulary just... unf unf unf. I cried twice and laughed a lot too
B00CH87HF4|4.0|So far, I've enjoyed the game.<br />Pros: it was free, it's rpg, you can customize your character<br />Cons: I'm not fond of the control for movement, not a lot of opportunity for letting or making money, I haven't noticed where I can spend game money for better equipment versus real money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun solveable levels. more interactive than 100 floors. minus 1 star because it is only free  for 10 levels. so many actually free similar games, won't pay for this. fun while it lasted.

B009MO5960|2.0|The 3D aspects of the blu-ray are awesome, however this particular movie lacks storyline depth. It's huge on action but, I just found myself getting bored with this movie. It is time to end these Resident Evil Series. I think the first movie was the best of all. Don't pay over $10.00 for this blu-ray. Sorry, but this movie sucks.
0061733199|5.0|This book, unlike a lot of other survival books (that have too many flashy pictures and no info) is packed with good info and helpful pictures and realistic tips for anyone who wants to improve their outdoor skills.
B00783NWB6|3.0|I really enjoy the Underworld Series, however this one kind of lacked something. This was not their best movie.<br />The 3D aspects of the blu-ray could have been a lot better. I was a little disappointed with the 3D rendering.<br />I would recommend not paying over $10.00 for this movie.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|This movie was totally engrossing.  It is very beautifully done.  Kept my interest to the very end.  The cast was excellent.
B009YQJ322|5.0|in my opinion, one of the best Action Films in recent years. This movie has very high replayability. its just a great movie top to bottom and I love it every time I watch it. I wish they would make more like it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am not a big player of game such as these, but this one pulled me in and kept me going. Challenging but not impossibly difficult.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Awesome movie if you are into foreign made fills with will not dissapoint you. the only real problem I had with the movie was just HOW MUCH fighting was in it. no one person could ever exert himself that much ever. but if you can overlook that and just enjoy the non-stop top-notch kung-fu buffet of Badassery then GET THIS MOVIE!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Forget the reviews and have fun with Le Carré's book!  I particularly love the British-isms throughout -- great training for the U.S. reader.

B004ELSDZK|5.0|Great graphics and lots of challenge I play this game often. I haven't even made it through half this game but I'm hoping the dev keeps up the work and releases some great updates.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book kept me totally immersed in it.  I didn't want to put it down.  It's very moving and I advise you to keep a box of tissues nearby.
B00881PTRC|3.0|A bit slow animation wise but it's a classic kids game so it may entertain an adult for 30 minutes. Maybe some kids will find this more enjoyable.
B009JBZH54|3.0|I picked the middle rating because I don't know how the recipient liked or disliked it. I did not use it so I can't rate it correctly. You need to make a space for products purchased as gifts!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is a great challenge. cant wait to find all clues and get to the next level. if you enjoy puzzles. you will probably enjoy this game.
1609611543|4.0|He did a very good job explaining why wheat isn't the same as it was.  He also gave good ideas for substitutions.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We were abroad when this series started, so we have watched it all at once, so to speak.  We love the setting, the humor, the depth, the commentary on life, the contrast between Britain and USA, the idea that life is changing radically, but we can't process that, and overall, a great show.  Can hardly wait for the next season.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Disclaimer -- I absolutely despise sitcoms.  That said, I would probably watch every episode of this show multiple times, it is simply so well written and enjoyable.  I do not understand what it was about a genre that I almost never watch that would draw me in so much.  I resisted watching the program for a number of years until Hurricane Sandy... We had no power or cable, and after I got the generator up and running, I realized the show was really the only thing we had in the house (season one DVD) to watch that had not already been watched.  I was hooked by maybe episode two.  The characters are likable, amazingly detailed in most of their back stories, and the cltural references interspersed throughout make the geek in me giggle every episode.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|According to Amazon, an app that has tracking built in should be for an older player. This app allows gps tracking so therefore is not appropriate for all ages as permission suggests.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett is an amazing writer.  I originally came to know him because of his Pillars of the Earth book, and have read a few others.  The century Trilogy is holding my attention very well, and is another amazing piece of writing.  This is more recent history if you will, and is interesting because it intersperses a fictional story set in a time where the historical facts run along side, making you feel as if it were actually a true account from the time.  Fans of television shows like Downton Abbey, or any movie/story set in the early 20th century may enjoy this book.  It has enough historical reference points within to read almost like a memoir or biography, but is wide reaching enough for those of us that like stories with meat on their bones.  I tore through this fairly monster sized book over just a couple days sitting on the beach, and literally could not put it down.  The second in the series has proven to be just as entertaining.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|The description made this app sound like it had several different channels, like USEFUL and ENTERTAINING channels. Not stupid stuff like weird news reports and whatever. If I could return this, I would. What a waste of time and money. DON'T GET IT!

B007VTUYWW|5.0|Love this movie!! Love all Lara Croft films, Angelina does a fantastic job bringing the character to life. Tomb Raider is a go to when there is nothing new on or when you are traveling and need to goo stand by film.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums this year. They've perfected their sound and satisfied all expectations. This excellent album combines the angst of the &#34;Alligator&#34;, the soothing sound of &#34;Boxer&#34; and the artfully restrained ambition of &#34;High Violet&#34;. For all of the National's fans this album will solidify the well-deserved love for the band.
1451668945|5.0|What was tall, blond, CPA Kate Connelly doing in the wee hours of the morning with Gus, a disgruntled craftsman, in her family owned funiture company in Long Island City? The firm, founded by Kate's grandfather, was famous for its fine reproductions of priceless antiques. But on the night of Kate's visit suddenly there's an explosion and the complex goes up in flames, leaving Gus dead and Kate badly injured. Now in a coma and unable to speak, or tell what happened, Kate is visited daily by her dad, Douglas, who lost his wife and brother in a tragic boating accident years before. Doug, who may have problems of his own, is deeply in debt and frantic to get his hands on the insurance money from the fire. Kate is also visited by her younger sister Hannah, a rising fashion designer, who senses Kate is in grave danger, but doesn't know why. Then a skeleton is found in a sinkhole that opened up after the complex burned down. Could this be the remains of a young woman who's been missing for years? Is someone so desperate to cover his tracks he'll resort to anything, even murder? Are some people hiding secrets and not who they seem to be at all? Will Kate come out of her coma in time to save her own life and solve the mystery of the real killer? The chilling excitement and suspense keep building to a dazzling crescendo and demonstrates again why Mary Higgins Clark is known as the queen of suspense.

0786838655|4.0|Percy Jackson is timeless in a way much like Harry Potter-it can truly be enjoyed by anyone of any age.<br /><br />The Percy Jackson series is popular because Riordan writes a hero that everyone can't help but root for. Percy doesn't come from much, his mother has gotten remarried and his true father was \\"lost at sea.\\" His stepfather isn't anything special, either. From the start, I felt for Percy-I didn't pity him, but I sure as heck rooted for him. Weird things have happened to Percy all his life, but he has always put them aside, attributed them to ADHD and Dyslexia. chblog10<br /><br />But when these incidents can not be ignored any longer, his mother comes clean and directs him to a place where she'll know he will be safe: Camp Half-Blood. Percy meets people just like him there-children of Gods and mortals: Half-Bloods. Just when Percy thinks he has found a place where he is safe, a hellhound proves otherwise. Percy is given a quest to retrieve Zeus's stolen lightning bolt and prevent a war. This is where the real story starts.<br /><br />THE LIGHTNING THIEF told a nonstop story of action, mythology, and friendship. The pacing gets five stars from me, something was always happening, always keeping you on edge. Although it was a bit predictable, it was a really fun, entertaining read.<br /><br />I really loved all the characters, especially Percy and Annabeth, they were two great protagonists. It was refreshing to read about the dynamic between these two, completely free of romance and drama we usually see in YA. I can not wait to see how their relationship progresses later on. Percy sounds much older than twelve at times, but I suppose when you are hunted by monsters you tend to age quicker.<br /><br />(review also posted on readerswonderland.com)
B007RRFUHM|5.0|Best known outside her homeland for her cameo appearance on Gotye's hit song \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\", this debut album by New Zealander Kimbra was a very pleasant surprise when I randomly purchased it last year and it became one of my favourite albums. Here is a track by track review:<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Settle Down\\". The layered, looped vocals in the background show off her vocal talents while she declares \\"I wanna settle down\\" over the top of the loops. Very quirky and creative, and it works really well in my opinion.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Something in the Way You Are\\" which I guess is about wanting to REALLY know someone deeply. Kimbra's impressive voice and emotive delivery are well displayed on this track.<br /><br />Track number 3 is the delightfully vintage pop sounding \\"Cameo Lover\\" which IMO deserves to be a massive worldwide hit. This song is the one which Kimbra deserves to be known for, very very catchy indeed and stayed in my head for weeks. Oh, and there's perhaps the cutest delivery of the word \\"trouble\\" of all time.<br /><br />\\"Two Way Street\\" is a slower number which begins with a simple keyboard intro and the instruments gradually come in while Kimbra sings in the buildup to the chorus \\"I can't make you fall for me, love is a two way street\\". I think you get the gist of what this song's about.<br /><br />\\"Old Flame\\" is about an old love and longing for the return of those times, as the title would suggest. Atmospheric keyboards, a slowly throbbing bass and a delightful vocal. One of my favourite tracks on the album.<br /><br />\\"Good Intent\\" sounds really 70's soulful and won Kimbra a songwriting award and listening to it you can tell why. It's pretty good lyrically with a stellar vocal performance to match.<br />\\"Plain Gold Ring\\" sees the vocal loop technique make a return for this cover version. I've never heard the original so can't comment on how it compares but the loops and instruments have a nice vibe and Kimbra's singingis soulful.<br /><br />\\"Come Into My Head\\" appeared on FIFA 13 soundtrack and is quite aggressive musically compared to the tracks that came before. Kimbra shows off her vocal range to great effect, managing to sound a little like Gabriella Cilmi in places.<br /><br />\\"Sally I Can See You\\" sounds like it's about changing as a person but it could probably be interpreted differently. Good lyrics and performance.<br /><br />\\"Posse\\" carries the message of not giving into peer pressure and staying true to who you are. Something I can relate to as a young person, with references to skipping school, cursing and reading psalms instead of palms. Instrumentally it sounds more straightforward than other arrangements on the album but retains the quirkiness that is beginning to become a hallmark of Kimbra's music.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is an optimistic song about (I guess) belonging - \\"Home is here\\". Musically it begins with vocal loops then the synths and drums come in to create a quite laidback vibe that washes over you. I'm not sure how well I've described that haha!<br /><br />\\"The Build Up\\" is stripped down and slightly sombre musically while Kimbra sings about wanting love without the build up. I like the lyrics and Kimbra's singing is amazing.<br /><br />That is the end of the album proper but the version I've got has the bonus track \\"Warrior\\" at the end which is an amazing electronic pop song and brings a more upbeat ending to the album.<br /><br />Overall this is a very impressive and accomplished debut album by an intelligent, quirky and talented female singer-songwriter. If you're reading this review I urge you to buy the album, you won't regret it!<br /><br />I apologise if my review has been too long or pretentious but I'm not usually moved enough to write reviews for music but this album and artist definitely deserved it!<br /><br />Five stars!

B00081MUY0|5.0|My CD arrived promptly and I immediately listened to it. Brought back good memories of my youth.... the added tracks are a bonus....and the enhanced recording techniques make it new again. Highly recommend.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun I loooooooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it . Totally fun if it an angry birds lover or fan then you'll sure enjoy this game totally recommend it
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|as with most ang movies it starts slow and builds to a climax, and for this movie the draw was well worth its view, if your looking for alot of bang then this is not your movie, its lul to the finale was great leaveing you with wow and wonder of a child, i would have given it more stars if it was in my realm of normal movies I watch (sci-fi), and so i say go watch it no matter your norm and take that special someone aswell you won't be disappointed..
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Opinion: perfect<br />Reason: the game it's self is fun. The point is eat ppl and your shark will survive longer. It's funny bc when u eat someone they scream old why I find tht bt I do so yeah get it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to more great challenging levels!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Never thought I'd wanna watch a series about a bike gang, but oh my god!<br />This series packs a wallup.<br />And Katy Segal She's never been better.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Loved it.  Watched the second film as well and Before Midnight twice...now would love a marathon viewing of all three.
0307719219|5.0|This is essential reading for political reformers, to help frame debate.  This volume is a clear companion to The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alasdair Smith.<br /><br />Why Nations Fail tells many of the same tales, but the keys to destroying the insider dealings are murky.  Relying on accidents of history to produce pluralistic institutions is not a great strategy for reform.  While the outcomes are better, the coalescence of such a movement is hard to establish.  Breaking the grip of dictatorial power is obviously quite hard, but there is too much at stake to leave it to chance.
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|For those who are concerned about the application accessing your location, perhaps it's not so the developer can spy on you!  Perhaps it's so the developer can sell advertising that is location sensitive? Where I am, the course location reports are very inaccurate... by several hundred miles.  So the only way to present me with &quot;local&quot; adds would be using GPS.<br /><br />The real question is &quot;why would a paid app need to sell adds?&quot;  YOU DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS FREE APP OF THE DAY!  Go figure!  Another commented that this app didn't require GPS location on the paid version when actually purchased from another company!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I Get this game every time love it it has some issues but it is free so won't complain  there is in game money but u can by pass it and still have fun
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Goonies is a wonderfully fun family movies for 6 years and above. It inspires creativity in the viewer and allows you to dream a little bit more.
B000R4SMCW|1.0|Boring...I just could not get into it because it was waaaay toooo slooow.  A lot of blah blah blah.  I turned it off after a half hour.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|It's a creative, well thought-out, and funny movie. The acting is great with surprises at every turn. I enjoyed it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I gave this beautifully written story 5 stars because its one of those books that not only draws you in but gives you a feeling of complete admiration for the characters.  Its sad, funny, heart wrenching, but more about strength and the meaning of true first love. It made easy for me to have a connection because I have Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and I too, sleep with a bi-pap machine and recently had to get a feeding tube.  I look forward to reading other books by John Green.
B005MHHREI|5.0|This book should be on every high school required reading list. In fact, every American would benefit from reading this book as it relates to how easily a country and it's people can be destroyed when a maniac is allowed to be in power. God bless America! May we always live in the land of the free!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like I said... entertaining! This app is amazing and I love to play with puzzles! If you like challenging puzzles, get this app! The levels get increasingly harder each time and really make you think!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was awesome.  My daughter just bought it to take back to college in the fall.  If college kids will watch it, you know it has to be good :)
B007EC27QM|4.0|Like I said, the app does what it is supposed to do. Sometimes there is a bit of a slow response to the touch screen, but other than that its an alright app
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to use. I like how it keeps all of your calculations from the prior use.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV today! It's interesting, beautiful (setting, clothes) and not like a soap opera. It is consistently good. I now have all three seasons and will continue to watch the series and buy the DVDs. I can't get enough of it!
B00D41H2PS|5.0|It was easy enough though I got stuck a couple times everything worked. People say it's short but if it had the routine HO games it would be average length. Most games I need a walkthrough to finish,  this game I didn't.
0399160450|5.0|I still thoroughly enjoy these new books even though there is a co-author. Your typical Clancy format....background, background, build up, action! Another entertaining &#34;spy&#34; book
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app!!! If you play minecraft then this app is for you! You can choose between creative mode or survival mode for each time you play on a different profile. I highly reccommend it for everyone. 8)
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It was ok, but it did get a bit boring after a while, especially since it costs almost 3 dollars to unlock everything. But overall it was pretty good
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Truly a wasted opportunity to complete a wonderful story which millions have grown to love. FAILURE on every level....Save your money and watch something else.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I am currently watching seasson 1 it is soo good , I cant waut to see what happenes in the next seassons
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so fun but it could get frustrating. If u want a game that  keeps u guessing and has mysteries then I would get this game. Plus it's free. And another thing is that it only gives u the first 13 levels I hate that but besides that this game is awesome and yes I recommend it
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this game was horrible I wad scrolling through apps and the cover of this one looked cool and fun but its not its hard to control and just not fun I would not get it if I wad you I'm deleting it now
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very nice game good graphics an addictive not the first puzzle game I played but one of the better ones
B000NW5CDK|5.0|The movie uses lots of archival footage and interviews of those who knew Dylan to show him between 1961 and 1966.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|QotSA keeps getting better, and this is their best work yet. There is only one band in this world who has never recorded a song one might call &#34;average&#34;...everything is classic, and this entire reckid is classic.
B00BX3KZAS|5.0|I guess many other people have already reflected my opinion. It was a welcome return to form after a pretty disappointing RRF. Still not to the level of follow the reaper or hatebreeder, but the bodom sound in this record is definitely heading that way. Typical examples are waste of skin, transference and bodom blue moon. Overall, a killer album that cements bodom's exclusive position as melodic death titans!
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Installed on Kindle Fire HD. Makes access to camera a little easier, and allows the use of video picture on Kindle Fire HD.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Yes, I know, this is not a thrash album but a hard rock album. Yes I know its not as good as UA or endgame. But there is no need to loathe the record cuz trust me, there is not going to be another rust in peace or maybe even another endgame. If you want every record to be like these two, you gotta be extremely unrealistic. Some tracks are good, some not so good, but overall the album is a nice listen and it kinda grows on you. Dave Mustaine virtually initiated the thrash movement in the 80s and Megadeth will always be the Gods of thrash/speed metal. Surviving and selling 38 million records in 30 years is no easy feat! So, if they come out with a hard rock record,hell yeah they can!! Because its Megadeth and they can do whatever the hell they can. They absolutely deserve to experiment with their sound since they have nothing more to prove to anybody about their musical prowess. Oh btw, this record is way better than risk or TWNAH. If you are a true droogie, you will love them for what they are and not for what you want them to be..
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Installed first on Kindle Fire HD, worked so well that I installed it on my LG Optimus V cell phone also. Great note reminder on both units! Try it, you'll like it!
B00633W614|5.0|This second book in the trilogy was excellent. I was swept up in the families saga. I highly recommend it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|A must have for Kindle! Have used Google Search for years on my laptop, was very glad it was available for Kindle Fire HD! Great, easy to use menu! Recommend!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was awful. The tornado had kind of neat effects, but that is the only good thing I have to say about it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Installed on Kindle Fire HD, perfect! Great reference for word games, etc. Miriam-Webster has a long standing reputation for excellence, this app is great!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady Gaga has done it again, by continuing to amaze us with songs inspired by Prince and Madonna. A great album for those who like to dance!
B008220DGE|4.0|This movie is not for everyone. Almost every character portrayed in the film is unlikable in some way and in a pleasingly anti-Hollywood fashion, there are no deep complexities solved neatly by its end.<br /><br />But that's chiefly because what Anderson is considering in this film HAS no neat or tidy resolution: how best to find order and make meaning in one's life.<br /><br />Anderson presents us with two commonly pursued courses people take to deal with this existential tension. First, in Phoenix's Quell, we find hedonism and an albeit reluctant embrace of absurdity. Quell is NOT an existential hero, nor is he is Kierkegaard's Knight of Meaning, fighting his inner doubts and choosing to embrace noble cynicism. He is a tightly wound and gaunt alcoholic WWII veteran who is struggling to \\"quell\\" the pain of his post traumatic stress disorder first with homemade hooch and as the movie progresses, with The Master's \\"processes.\\" The second traditional approach to the question is presented through Hoffman's portrayal of Lancaster Dodd, The Master, a thinly veiled characterization of L. Ron Hubbard's early years developing Scientology. The religious life has provided, for many, a sense of meaning and purpose when face with the universe's absurdity.<br /><br />What makes this film interesting rather than a transcript from an introduction to Existentialism class is that Anderson has created real CHARACTERS here, not simply marionettes who represent contrasting viewpoints. What's most compelling about this approach is that we're viewing people, not ideologies, struggle to find the best \\"master\\" to serve; both characters, though wildly different in lifestyle and temperament, desire what the other holds most dear. Quell is deeply engaged by Dodd's seeming inner peace and the \\"answers\\" he has to every question. Dodd is envious of and somewhat seduced by Quell's freedom and complete honesty and feels compelled to bring him into The Cause's fold, thus making him the ultimate trophy convert. What's fascinating about Dodd's reaction to Quell is his need to dominate him and become his \\"Master\\" and the scenes in which he attempts to do this are incredibly compelling and disturbing.<br /><br />All of this said, I return to my initial statement. This is a long, slowly paced movie populated by mostly despicable characters doing despicable things. And if you're looking for an inspirational or highly wrought denouement, you will be disappointed. For many, the ideological tensions I've outlined will not be enough to \\"save\\" this movie or make it something worthwhile. Personally, I found it compelling after I was able to see what problems Anderson is poking around.phy convert.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not a bad game but over too soon. Would like more levels and a tutorial would be helpful to others not used to this type of game

B0063IH60K|4.0|I find this to be very entertaining and great graphics, also great for passing the time while Waiting in line or at the doc's office etc. THe price was also very good.(free is good). Thanks for this great game. Phil.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This is one of my favorites. Excellent cast. Well played. Strong technology.  Leaves you guessing from episode to episode. Made me wish I could travel to Eureka just to be a part of that place and be able to experience the technology and be a part of each episode as it developed. I was never able to get enough.
034580404X|5.0|This set is so much more than a sexual thrill.. There are elements of control and why people work and click the way they do. It is full of surprises and unexpected turns. I was sad when I turned the last page.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|I've been a fan of Maysa ever since she was the lead singer of one of my many favorite groups Incognito and she can never steer me wrong. I have loved every CD she has had as a solo artist and this one is now in the collection as well. As quoted above, definitely my summer CD of 2013.
B0026SCMNM|3.0|I thought I had already read this book; however, it is just another book about an individual coming to the United States.  It was pretty much day after day the same thing.  I wouldn't go and buy this book again.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great book really liked how it was written, will read more of Lee Child's books. Liked Jack  a good guy
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I did not get this movie.... It made no sense to me.  What was the moral to the story?  I just didn't get it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have to say that for not having any special effects with lots of explosions it is very interesting<br />Like the old days it relies on real human interaction to keep you going
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I like that it is really easy to set up and use. The sounds are clear and the size is practical.
B0040UAYI4|1.0|Don't buy it.  If you don't have a 32-bit PC, you can't program it, turning this into an utter waste of time and money.  Its utterly incompatible with modern 64-bit PCs.  Trust me, SAVE YOUR MONEY.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Sometimes you pay for a game and feel cheated because its to short or cheesy. Not this one. Great graphics and story line. Well worth it. I truly enjoyed it !
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I just like being able to check the weather whenever I want, especially  during the rainy, and storm season. Good App
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I loved the ending how his treasure was at his home all along<br />and how he found true love Fatima
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What a magnificent follow up to Hosseini's first two books.  Many fascinating characters lead intertwined lives in this book I  didn't want it to end.  From Afghanistan, Greece, France and the USA  we follow the struggles, heartaches and joys of the wonderful characters. I can hardly wait for his next book.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Ten perfect tracks. Kanye proves to be extremely talented yet again. His flow is undeniable and the lyrics are pretty good. I love the sample he used on the last track as the bass shakes the neighborhood. This album doesn't fit in with the typical rock/metal music that I listen to but I am a fan overall. My only complaint is that the album is very short. You get lost in the tracks but very quickly it comes to an end leaving you wanting more. Good Job Kanye!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|We are expecting a multi player update in 2013-2014, this isn't official but after a question answered by the maker he said that after an update that would be a good enough update to last a while (maybe that's 21.1? The current update) he also said that after that update it would take (x) Roman numeral number 10 amount of months after that update to make multi paperwork
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This may be their best album yet. I love how nice this flows together. A very good listen if you are a fan of any of their other work. Catch them on tour to be blown away!
0425263924|4.0|I really did like this book however I would have liked a better ending? I felt it (the ending) was a bit 'flat'? You know when you actually say 'Is this it?' I really didn't want a cliffhanger but just something with a little substance. I love Eva and Gideon!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun, exciting, easy to play, hours and hours of  excitement, hard to put down, good for all ages. This game rocks
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Saw at the movie theater and had to buy it as soon as it came out! Definitely worth getting the Blu-Ray... the colors and effects are beautiful!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Whenever which is every time I play the app freezes and I lose my credits.  The app freezes on both the fire and my ipod.
B000R8YC18|5.0|exlnt a highly recommended a must have for any movie collector, one you'll watch more than once and then some...
B00821OX98|4.0|I like scifi and so far this show is working for me. It's a good fix between seasons of Walking Dead
B000IEXVCC|5.0|This is one of the best films I have ever seen, It's a cult classic in my opinion and no movie library should be missing it…a must see for everyone at some point in life.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have never read a Sparks novel since I mostly read non-fiction but I liked this book.  I thought the &#34;twist&#34; added a cool novelty to this love story.

B00B9JDBSO|1.0|I'm a fan of many different kinds of music and even experimental music, but this is a jumbled mess. I Love the knife previous albums so much that I bought this a few days after release without previewing the tracks. I guess the joke is on me.<br /><br />I'm hoping that this is just a detour and not the end the end of the gorgeously dark melodies we heard on silent shout(some of my favorite music of all time). This album is unlistenable in the car or on headphones. I don't really have the patience to listen to 20 minute static tracks with no crescendo or payoff. The sounds are interesting at times, but not really that revolutionary. It comes off as self serving and more of a statement than music.<br /><br />80% of the album is too grading for my tastes, I don't like to be \\"challenged\\" by my music. This might be what happens when you spend too much time in German nightclubs. I listened to some of the Oni Ayhun material and didn't like it. I guess I should have thought of that BEFORE buying this.<br /><br />It could probably be said that \\"hey bro you are missing the point of this album\\". While I do find The knife interesting for their forward thinking viewpoints; That is not enough to make me a fan. You have to include good music to convey your message. I wish that they would have been a little more subdued with their approach here.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Location tracking?  Really?  Zero respect for the consumer and / or user.<br /><br />Please correct.  Uninstalled.<br /><br />Fix and I will consider reviewing.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's such a good game for educational use as well as a time waster. I've sat on this game for hours and always had something to do. I as an adult have learned some cool things about the ocean and its living beings.
B002RUA524|4.0|I am on our yacht just a bay from where this is set and it is so good to be reading it while here in Corfu close to the Durrell's old home.  It is easy to imagine all the antics that went on.  I enjoy the writings about the eccentric family, but as a nature lover it is particularly interesting to read of Gerald's discoveries and existence along with his &#34;animals&#34;, insects and so forth.  Amazing book!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I like using this app better than my laptop and since I don't have a smart phone right now this was a good way to go. Reloads and updates pretty fast.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Wants my location and wants to read my phone records. A lot for a game don't you think? Privacy ... does the developer know what that is? Would not trust a free game to do this, let a lone a paid one.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|In general, the concepts are OK, ie part of the success of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs was because they happened to be born at the dawn of the computer age. However, beyond this statement of fact the content and substance that would support this premise is either missing or very weak. In my opinion, it was not well written.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have this play when I go to sleep. Crickets are my fav. Coild ise some more sound other than water. Seems to have alot of that
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|I seriously question the reason why this game needs to know my exact location via my gps. Hence why the 3 stars.<br /><br />However the game itself is quite fun. Basically you try to line up your marbles in a greater number than the enemy and push them off the board. However you can only push with up to 3 marbles.
B000IKNZMM|4.0|I really enjoy movies done by George C. Scott, and this is included as one of them.  Its a good story of what might have occurred.  You have to enjoy period pieces to appreciate the fact that the American actors are not even putting on the pretense of German accents.  Given the fact that history tells us how this story will end, the movie does not carry the suspense of other fictional stories.  Nonetheless, worth the while.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game but can't figure out how to play multiplayer with my brother. We are on the same wifi network but 1. before the update, it didn't work, for some reason. 2. after the update, we can't figure out how to play together, period. Other than that, my bro and I love the game and can't stop playing it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game because it's a little tricky and it has this little thing to it that makes you good at the game.
B00C0UHGLO|2.0|not fun for me but could be fun for others and for all of you who say that it spies on you if you are on kindle you can turn location based services off!! DUUUUHHHHH!
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|This is my first Demi Lovato album. I'd heard her songs on the radio and immediately fell in love. I wasn't disappointed with this album at all. Demi Lovato may be one of the best singers right now. Her range is spectacular, and every note is breathtaking. I can't get the songs out of my head. Great artist, great gal. I recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I practically got this app when it first came out. I was a little dissapointed, but it is so much better now. It has a long way to go, but it is on it's way.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am enjoying this game.. keeps the mind busy... some are challenging. a few are pretty easy. hope there are many more levels.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|been waiting too long. Big fat deal! Twenty five minutes not done loading !Amazon can be fair and load the game!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|This game was good but kinda difficult. It is fun but kind of annoying when it wouldn't do the controls right. Ill give this game a 4 star because it was fun and had a biggish veriety of things. (I also agree with Bridget)
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I love novels with a literary foundation and this has it all. Read it then bought it. Very Well written.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|For a free game, I was very pleased.  They advertise and encourage you to buy nonsense to help you win the game, but I expected that.  They do make it increasingly more difficult to progress through the game without buying equipment but you can repeat a few levels to level up.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game.
0143034901|5.0|Just loved this book, even more after I visited Barcelona and stayed in one of the streets mentioned. Well worth reading the series.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This holster fits the kit lenses (18-55 and 55-200). The longer lens fits tighter but still OK. Side pockets are useful for holding a spare battery, remote and other small objects. Internal pockets (zipper and mesh) are very small, but good a cleaning cloth and perhaps extra UV filter. Overall a great holster for taking a minimal DSLR setup afield.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This was a great movie with excellent acting. This is definitely worth purchasing and you can't go wrong with the current price.  Can't believe I waited so long to see it. Best performance I have seen from Will Smith.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|If you're into ANY rpg style game, this is highly recommended. I've been looking for a card game like this, and to find a free one is amazing. I recommend spending am your runes on new card sets, fyi.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun for adults and kids. Very addictive and hard to put down!  My ten year old son and I loved this game. We can't wait for more levels to be added!
B00017LSK8|3.0|Was not impressed I prefer the color version of this film. The colors were not rich in this as I expected.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|One tough automatic in a good looking package! I don't know how they can sell them so cheap. The build and material quality is off the hook!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|To play this game longer than 5 min at a time get ready to grab your pocketbook. Energy to do anything is going to keep you spending money like I have never seen on any other game. What a shame too. It is enjoyable. Just not worth the investment. Uninstalling.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Have been looking for this movie for a while. Don't think you need to spend a lot on movies that are older. My husband really likes this one and I could afford the reasonable price.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got it since it is simmer and I still need to keep my mind moving. It's both totally fun and makes me think, which is what my mommy wants. I like it because my little brother is getting ready to go to public school and he needs to learn harder things. I would recommend this to everyone over the age of seven, unless they are very advanced.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love hidden object games and this one was good. Great graphics interesting story.  Puzzles were just right at least for me I do not like puzzles that require advance degrees to solve.  The only reason I did not give it a five was length  too short for the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first, the premise of kids killing off one another made me NOT want to read this story. Then the intrigue of gov't in the future and they manipulate humans to respond to human life made me dive right in! It took me 5 days to read the first book.....needless to say, I couldn't put the book down. Go Katniss and Petra! I can't wait to see what happens in the next book! I heard this book was required reading for some middle schools so it's a subject of that age and older to read. Love how the book was written through Katniss and her point of view and feelings. You'll feel for her too for sure.  Read, enjoy, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Android was a great idea!  An Open Source mobile OS offers so many possibilities.<br /><br />Sadly the Android Devs don't see it.  They would rather nickel and dime children with IAP scams and spy on their customer base to make a few bucks.<br /><br />As soon as Windows mobile is a little bit more mainstream I am saying goodbye to Android permanently.....nit shirt enough was its lifespan.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This is a copy of yoga Boca two and its boot leg it sucks this is so bad I pefer you don't waste your space or time downloading this
B002M87V0A|1.0|Was happy to see that if I purchased the blu-ray version that a months instant video usage of the video was included with the purchase.  This was the reason for ordering.  Well after getting half way thru the video the movie stopped streaming.  So a couple of days latter I decided to stream the rest of the video - IT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE OR INCLUDED IN MY LIST!  Beware what was promised was not delivered.  We were only able to stream about an hour of the video - then it was pulled!  We did not choose to stop the movie it was a streaming problem.  And certainly the one month viewing promise is a complete lie!<br />This review has nothing to do with the Music Man - but has to do with what was promised with the purchase of the blu-ray by Amazon.  If this was suppose to be a one time only viewing then why would a problem in stream knock out the video?  Beware!!!
B000FC2L1E|3.0|But way to much incredulity and not enough history for my taste, even though I know that the thesis of this series of books is based in science fiction.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have been enjoying watching the original Star Trek Series on my Kindle since i got it and I have to say the picture and sound blows me away. Just awsome.
1609613937|5.0|It finally made sense why eating dairy and meat is extremely bad for people.  Read this book and discover why the Western diet causes cancer, heart disease, diabetis 2, etc.  E.g., 1 in 5 men in US get prostate cancer and in countries where plant-based diet is consumed, only 1 in 10,000 contract the disease!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Masterpiece indeed. This show is a perfect balance of drama, history, and intrigue. It is a thoroughly enjoyable period piece that will have you coming back for more.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Totally awesome get it if you want a very very very good app but when I play the wizard lord special mission it freezes if I summon the super Phoenix 75% of the time but still 5 stars
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Performs as expected. I haven't overclocked it. Probably won't need to with what I do on the computer. The orientation in the instructions could be a little bit more detailed of better markings on the processor.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game and would recommend it to anyone that likes doing puzzles. I would definitely buy this app.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it's the only one I seem to play anymore it's very addictive and fun to play
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Pre-ordered it and am considering ordering another. Cole has incredible flow throughout the entire album. The final three tracks of the album cap off the greatest work that was released on June 18th, 2013, which is a big statement. Born Sinner is Cole on his best. Born Sinner is rap at its best. If you don't like this you don't like the genre.<br />Top 6 Tracks in order of album:<br />Power Trip<br />Runaway<br />Chaining Day<br />Crooked Smile<br />Let Nas Down<br />Born Sinner
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Won't let it down load every time I get rid of a app it says the same amount of MB.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I loved LOTR, so I expected to at least like this. I barely made it through the first 20 minutes. It was full of \\"dizzying\\" shots that had nothing to do with anything, cute funny characters who were neither cute nor funny, and no discernible action. Save your money, and your time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great app.  I really enjoyed the challenge.  a great game for young and old.  I can't wait for updates.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE the new update,  version 7.1 Water, lava and empty buckets .Also TALKING!!! ilove minecraft too. it was 7.99 it went down a dollar!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is my favorite makeup game and I love makeup games you should get this game you will love this game
B0052GVGYG|5.0|Second generation Allman Family sound.  Susan's voice and Derek's guitar blend in a beautiful harmony on all tracks.  Southern rock.
1401938906|3.0|I asked to see yellow vehicles and saw a number of yellow Hummers the next few days. If I had the patience to concentrate a bit I think I could do the rest of the experiments. this book is easy to read, short, and to the point. the language is understandable and the author encourages the reader to &#34;just do it.&#34;
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|It is a good movie with quite a few twists. I don't think it is for young kids say under 8 because there is a more adult tone and jokes.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|God Bless Scott Gorham and Ricky Warwick. This is easily the best Thin Lizzy album since Chinatown. Fantastic musicianship all round. Great songs and a nice bottom end production. A must for all the old (and new) Thin Lizzy fans still out there.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like the book. Read it every day until I finished it, my husband 'liked'it to. I am ordering the next one now.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A wonderful rendition of old classics brought to you in a completely new way LOVE IT !!!!!! You will not be disapointed
B0083SBMBM|5.0|great movie, limited special features.....actually next to no special features. but played great, got here quick, awesome movie, action packed!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The quality of the DVD and the CD are top notch. The 1st CD is a great buy but this is a MUST !!!!!!!!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|One of the best Disney movies of all time! Has extra features, great redone picture quality. Songs are great. What else can you say? Its the Little Mermaid!!! My nephews loved it, stands the test of time.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Just seeing my son play with the Lego Minecraft with a big smile, makes this toy truly a collectible item.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I am digging the hell out of this album.  Such a great body of songs.  Creedence could be a bit stiff musically; this album has a great core band of Kerry Aronoff on drums, David Santos on bass, and Bob Malone on keyboards, supplemented by great musicians in Nashville and LA.  Fogerty's in good voice, with a great roster of guest vocalists.  It comes with a touching booklet: Fogerty writing reminiscences for each song; he's a good writer.  Yes, part of the pleasure in listening to the album is nostalgic, but it's nostalgia done up right.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this season because the characters decide to explore their attraction.  Too many series drag it out  until you lose interest and stop watching.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|This movie was not what I expected since Maggie Smith played a leading role and she is an amazing actress.  The plot was rather predictable and I'd hoped it would have more humor.  Also, the language was not good. The best part of the movie was the music which was beautiful!
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Love Tom Hanks and expected this to be a great movie. It was just to convoluted; to difficult to follow. We did not even finish the movie.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Takes a lot of space, but worth it in my opinion. Easy controls, great graphics, fun armor/weapons. We'll just have to see how long it stays entertaining.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun GaMe But I Am Concerned About The Multiple Reviews That Say I Will Be Forced To Pay To Continue.  Is The Developer Working On Other Options?
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This is a well made version of the classic tale. The CGI is rendered beautifully. It is not as dark or spooky as the original &#34;Wizard&#34;, but it's a solid story and it builds up to a great finale. It is most likely appropriate for children 8 years and older, so it can be a family viewing.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is my mom and I favorite movie and was such a good mothers day gift for her! She loved it thank you!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a wonderful escape. Great characters. Wonderful story line that draws the viewer back episode after episode. Very excited for next season to start!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game makes you think and figure out how to get the door open. You will spend hours trying to figure on how to get out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just such a well written show - plus get to talk about it with all of my friends. Can't wait till season 4!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I enjoyed this story so much I had a difficult time putting it down until it was finished. I would recommend this book if you enjoy like reading a good suspense.
0743289692|5.0|This woman, without anger and without judgement, shows us what Islam is and what Islam can do to a society that is ruled by it.  But her journey is not to a different religion but to her humanity and atheism.  I was floored by her strength, her intelligence and her choices.  And incredible story of 21st century enlightenment that must be read to be believed.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This is a book I couldn't put down. This poor child came out of the spoils of war and became a better person through love, understanding and patients.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I honestly expected more from Kanye. There are a few good songs, but the cd seems rushed. By far not his best work, and I am disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was fun I played it on a lot of plane ride so I can't believe I lost so many times I think it was the turrbulence
B00899E5B4|5.0|I have been a fan as long as I can remember. This album is awesome, it's classic JW with a little techno, and a little soul thrown in. Highly recommended!!!!!!
031603438X|5.0|It's amazing this guy can remember as much as he has. He kept incredible notes and I believe every word he wrote. His relationship with Charlie Watts is especially interesting. I've given this book as gifts and the feedback I've received rates as excellent. Richards will surprise most people, like me, who know little about this gifted musician and former drug addict. What's truly remarkable is that the guy has been drug-free for decades and few people believe it. He kept copious notes throughout the years and tells his story with precision and compassion. My entire perception of Keith Richards has changed for the better because I now see him as a man of honor and integrity. I believe most of us who read his story have come to the same conclusion.<br /><br />Great job man!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was tempted to give a 4-star rating but the smart pods and other traps lurking at every step were too much of an exaggeration.  But I liked the conclusion  and the way the heroine managed to settle the score. I guess one would like to think that our species will eventually progress to more civilized and humane forms of society but that may just be wishful thinking.  Overall, I enjoyed the trilogy and I would recommend it to any true fan of Sci-Fi .
159463176X|5.0|Great read!! Loved The Kite Runner (my favorite). This one is almost as good. Interesting characters and nice writing bringing the reader nicely through time (s).
B00CW665VI|4.0|This twist on romance, love and lust from the male perspective was both enlightening, funny and fascinating. You know how sometimes you wonder what the guy is really thinking?.....well, here it is in print. I really did laugh until I cried. This story provides several options for your enjoyment; the male perspective, the female response, a love story and humor in one of life's struggles. Enjoy!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just downloaded this game.  However it does seem like one of the better mystery. games.  The graphics are great.  Looking forward to playing and seeing what it's all about
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game for Android. I have spent countless hours playing it.<br /><br />Every time I get a new phone or tablet, I install it and have to beat it all over again... which I love and hate at the same time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is a bummer they it stops at 10 rooms.  wish there were more.  hope they come up with more soon.
0061733199|5.0|Excellent read. Good stuff in this book.<br /><br />Also, good to keep for reference.<br /><br />No BoB or camping pack complete without it!
B002OB9KPE|4.0|This is my first Transatlantic album.  As a fan of Spock's Beard and Marillion, I though I'd give this CD a chance, when I came across it in my local record store.  Like many of the other reviewers stated, I'd agree that this is heavily influenced by Neal Morse.  It could have been an older Spock's Beard CD.  The album is riddled with his signature crusty but benign lyrics, with intermittent references to his religion, and coupled with more than occasional cliches.  On the other hand, Morse is a superior tunesmith, and the melodies and symphonic harmonies are a joy in many passages.  But this CD really shines with the rhythm section.  I started to believe that the bass player is stifled in his role in Marillion, as his playing is top notch here, all through the album.  I'll disagree with some of the other reviewers regarding the drumming, which while quite up front and robust, complements the bass playing seamlessly.  The pair is enough to make one focus less on the sub-par lyrics, and really enjoy the tight back end.<br /><br />I believe that if they added a lyricist, this could be a 5 star album.  While I am not religious or christian, I have no problem listening to lyrics that are inspired by a person's religious beliefs.  If they are inspired, that is.  Unfortunately, the lyrics start out mediocre, and spiral down from there.  By the end, \\"dancing with eternal glory\\" is quite tiresome, cliche, and trite.  The uninspired lyrics take away from the overall quality of the melody, arrangement, and otherwise excellent musicianship that this album exhibits.<br /><br />The first CD in the 2 disc set is The Whirlwind, a 78 minute epic, that runs pretty much continuously without a break.  The piece is broken up on the CD into separate tracks, but musically runs straight through.  Despite the lackluster lyrics, this is a fine example of turn of the century modern progressive rock music.  The 2nd CD, or \\"bonus\\" CD, offers several additional but unrelated songs that are pleasant enough to listen to, but don't really approach the quality of the first.  I very much enjoyed their rendition of \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\", being an early Genesis fan, and they reproduce this almost note for note.  The modern recording techniques used on this recording makes it a pleasurable listening experience.  The covers of \\"A Salty Dog\\", The Beatles medley, and Soul Sacrifice were also enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, I'll rate this CD set a solid 4 star.  With better lyrics, The Whirlwind could easily be a 5 star.sant enough to listen to, but don't really approach the quality of the first.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved playing this game. each level was challenging yet engaging and I never found myself wanting to throw my kindle at the wall.
B00A6C3JN2|4.0|The product arrive on time and in perfect condition.<br />I no problem on using it.<br />All the software is on-line.<br />Just make sure to have the correct USB cable to connect it.<br />Connection cable is not include with the kit.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie doesn't even deserve one star. I can't remember when I've watched a movie this bad. Reminds of the show Two Broke Girls.
B003L77GG0|5.0|The entire Smallville season is part of our DVD library.  We have watched it over and over and it does not get old.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My son and I had a great time playing this together on a rainy afternoon. Just challenging enough to hold our attention. Well worth the time.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Definitely keeps you busy. It's a lot of fun! Lots of mystery and puzzles together your brain going. Great game!
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Glad I didn't pay to see it at the theater ok on bluray. It just gave me a head ache
B0015AARJI|5.0|OK
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Saw it in the theater and it is better now on bluray I never get tired of this one GREAT
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for adults and older children although it has its difficult parts they are not so hard when you get to the bottom of them
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I have no idea waht the critic's were talking about. This move is great. Lots of action lots of fun too
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Saw this when it first came out and wanted to see it again and again, before the next one comes out.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|Loved this movie when it came out and love it even more that it is now on bluray. LOVE IT
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like the puzzles although several scenes are total ripoffs frompast g5 games. story line is a bit hard to follow.
B004SBQALA|4.0|not bad but not good either i  have no idea what else to say here effects were ok plot was predictable
B000683VI4|5.0|I've seen it several times before purchasing it. Never, never fails to elicit a response from me. Beautiful and tragic, sad and joyful all together. Wonderful movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|A romantic novel from the great Nicholas Sparks.<br />He is true to form in this latest novel with romance, suspense and some tears.<br /><br />A great read!!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This movie is a great companion to The Tuskegee Airmen and although they are both telling the same story, there are enough differences to make owning both of them worthwhile.<br /><br />What a great, proud story of this neglected part of American history.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is an excellent game except for the part where you have to pay for things that you need to play
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Downloaded this game for my niece to play when she comes around but I just can't get enough of playing the game love it enjoy the fun of tapping on all the animals and watching them react especially the mini game of scrat wish I get more egg corns
B0009UC810|5.0|Great silliness - great fun.  Heaped with hilarity from Ackroyd and Belushi.  A simple storyline told with the help of a cavalcade of cameo performances by celebrities from the world of movies, music, and fashion, and underlined with a great musical score of rhythm and blues.
0399157565|5.0|Kay Scarpetta is a wonderful story line and I have enjoyed each and every novel by Patricia Cornwell using this as her main character.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book.  It kept me interested until the very end. I do agree with some that say it is a dysfunctional relationship and in real life no I probably would not condone it, BUT it is not real life and those who read it should know it.  He isn't violent towards Abby, but does have a violent streak.  Not gonna lie this is my new guilty pleasure.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I have always been a big fan of the movie and was exstatic to learn of th e3d release.  Couldn't be any happier with the purchase, and it even looks better on my home 3d than it did in the Imax Theater 3d!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun game and addictive too! I'd get it again! It took a little getting used to but very fun! My grand kids love it!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I think that blt5 should have all the tracks and tower and secret agents like blt4. And the should tell you the trophies and the missions are.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|A must read for any entrepreneur, totally inspirational, an example that there is no limit when the will is on
0385474547|4.0|\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is the perfect book for anyone -- including high school students -- who wants to learn about the fate of traditional African cultures under colonialism.  The novel lovingly reconstructs the mental and spiritual world of the Ibo people at the end of the 19th century, when Britain was extending its colonial control over the Niger river delta.  Africans are put squarely at the center of the story, and not treated as exotic background scenery for white adventurers (the role played by Africans in so many books like \\"Heart of Darkness\\" or movies like \\"Blood Diamonds\\").  Thankfully, the book is devoid of sentimentality or political correctness:  Ibo culture comes across as profound in its own terms, but also warped by violence, patriarchy, and superstition.  Christianity comes across as an improvement, but also as a source of new injustice of its own.  (In one scene an Ibo debates theology with a Christian missionary.  It's hard to tell which culture is more deluded.)  That said, I'm not sure whether \\"Things Fall Apart\\" fully succeeds as a novel.  Much of it struck me as cultural anthropology rather than literature.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|A fun game for very young kids.great for hand eye coordination<br />. This is my nephews favorite game on my kindle.he is so happy when he completes a puzzle.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love my Kindle for Android.  Anywhere I go I can pick up my book where I left off. Truly two great devices in one!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Most awsome MOBA game made! I definatly recomend downloading and trying oit this game, it is a definate must have.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was absolutely outstanding. I bought this book when I really needed a book to relate to, I didn't quite relate to it, but I fell in love, the characters became real people to me and that was one of the most amazing things to me. I really enjoyed reading this book.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is super awesome. It makes feel like the director and I'm finishing up the movie. It also makes you feel like your a fish living  in the sea!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I enjoy playing with the new and rare fish. My son enjoys watching and interacting with them. would love to see fish give back more pearls when feed.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|It's a very accurate account of the guns from world war two, it just needs more guns from nations other than America and Germany.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I really enjoy this CD. It is fun to hear these old songs and new. I like his interpretation of them
B000QCS9NM|3.0|This book is confusing at times because it jumps around a lot, but, in the end, you realize the deeper meaning(s) behind the story. It's tragic and humorous with a sort of twist. Definitely read it a second time around.
1608871819|4.0|As the other reviews read, I too love the movie despite some of the flaws such as the dark over tones and that ending,still a great interpretation of the character. I was very eager for this book before the movie had opened. I own the Superman Returns book by Wallace and thought since this was a better movie, this would be a better book.The Superman Returns book has a lot more information broken into sections like storyboards and effects where this one is lacking those behind the scenes moments. The book has a beautiful hardcover that has grooves of textures,the paper is of a high glossy quality and the artwork is great.For that I give it the 4 stars although you could drop a 3 on it because no you don't get any behind the scenes, you won't see the costume changes and developments that ANY Superman fan would love to see. Storyboards, production art,the cg shots by the green screen, stuff like that is what you look for but won't get. The first almost half of the book focuses on Krypton more than the movie did and you don't really get much of Superman doing those Superman things he does in the movie like some flying sequences or the fight scenes. Maybe to see a few pages of the script would also been pretty cool,it's just page after page of production art, which is beautiful but you want to see other artist renditions and comparison to what ends up on screen. Your gonna have to make a decision on this one if you want to add to a collection of books like these or add it to a Superman collection.If you want to make a wise purchase, wait for it to drop way down in price like the Superman Returns and then pick it up, then you won't feel like dropping the 3 on this.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Alot of good actors. A good romantic heartfelt story,and also very funny a times.Definitely a very good movie! Recommend it.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|After reading the 1st book, I just polished off the second and am now fully hooked... About to download the next... Thanks heaps
B0064X7FVE|2.0|No radar for the Weather app for Kindle.<br />I have this on my android ph and like it.  Would be nice if it worked the same on the larger Kindle screen.
140053271X|4.0|I was very reluctant to give up real books. But after getting my nook I realized all the space I've been saving by not having a bookshelf. I t also makes it easier to read laying down when you don't have to use both heads to awkwardly hold up the book. The nook is very light and easy to carry around with you .
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I have used white noise for years to help me sleep.  Having the flexibility of different soothing sounds is fantastic!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|excellent acting by Jamie & Leonardo and a great supporting cast combine with superb direction from the pre-eminent director of our times
1476715904|4.0|This was a unique story, and it's one that I won't forget soon. The music lyrics and poetry incorporated into the story really ramped up the emotional experience for me as a reader. I love how realistically Will and Lake were portrayed, and I felt my heart aching along with them as they both faced incredibly difficult circumstances with their families. And the ups and downs of their romantic relationship were intense and gripping. Will was definitely swoon worthy --I have a weakness for boys who write poetry. I highly recommend Slammed to those looking for a different kind of love story.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Fun game but be clear. All of the great features are for Apple users only and Kindle seems mostly ignored altogether.  Fix parity issues and I'll change my rating.  I have this game on my Kindle as well as my Samsung Galaxy S3.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Sometimes you have to wait for things to grow but it is overall a very fun game. Also it takes time to build your reef into something good looking.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|this book was well worth the wait. Thank you Nalini for writing such a beautiful story of redemption and love. Even though I had my suspicions about the Ghost it was wonderful to have him identified and to see these characters come to life. My only regret was how fast I finished reading and having to wait to enter this amazing world you created. I highly recommend this book and this series
0714864803|4.0|Culture, History, Geography and of course lots of regional and some modern recipes plus beautiful pictures to accompany all these.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Its probably something I didnt do in the download, or he doesnt like me, he hasent said a word to me! He purr and love having his tummy scratched. I have to find out what I did wrong. No Cat is ever Wrong, only Humans. (I have 3 cats)
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Like I said in the other review I saw the first movie on tv, went to the movie theatre and saw Before Midnight then went searching for Before Sunset.  To my wonderful surprise you had it and I didnt have to buy it, just rent it.  Thank you so much for allowing me to see this wonderful movie on the convenience of my computer!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is much more than a &#34;teen historical fiction reading selection.&#34; The characters are multifaceted and well developed. Zusak's descriptives are rich and create though provoking images. A little more could have been devoted to Liesel's later life and her last encounter with the narrator. Unusual choice of narrator but an excellent one that personifies who we all will inevitably face.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|This CD is awesome!<br />I especially like to play it ALL THE TIME ;-)<br />He has an unforgetable voice..<br />I will definitely be ordering all of his CD's in the near future~
159463176X|5.0|I read Kite Runner, the second book of his which I've forgotten the title of and which I did NOT like very much, and this one.  This book has more of a plot and it's executed very well.  I like Hosseini's style of writing, and I am fascinated by Afghan society.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show!  Just started watching it this year and was hooked by the end of the first episode.  I hadn't even seen the first and second season yet.  I normally don't like British shows, but I can't wait for the next season.
1432794426|5.0|A must read for anyone who has a love of or even an interest in Michael Jackson.  Dr. Moriarty's passion for Michael and his story can be felt on every page.  You won't be disappointed!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another good suspense reading from Vince Flynn's series of Mitch Rapp's action. As usual, simple, straight forward action CIA operatives , bound to eliminate Jihad terrorists and their supporters. For each episode, there is some, but by no means  excessive, background coverage.  Even at time a minimal peak to Rapp's personal life.  Excellent reading for traveling folks that are into spy action dramas.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this game. Was not able to play level 7 because it would freeze on the desk. I hope you get this fixed and more levels.
B0093LINVK|3.0|Installed 128Gig SSD.  Will be fine one day, next day the drive is not detected.  I have to physically remove and then re-install the drive.  The unit then boots from the drive for a day until it disappears and I have to remove/re-install again.  Moved on to an flash-drive with Ubuntu to avoid the problem.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game ..really made u think. Loved the pyramid with the numbers...that was ruff...haven't seen that since high school...lol.. Can't wait til there r New levels :)
1609611543|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. My husband and I have been wheat free for a month now. My husband was diagnosed with acid reflux and eliminating wheat has helped tremendously along with other diet modifications such as limiting other carbs and eating whole foods. He has lost 10 lbs and doesn't have the ups and downs in his energy level. I personally have lost 2-5 lbs depending on the day and my joint inflammation has decreased. I sleep much better and definitely do not have energy crashes. My husband says I'm less moody. I used to get mean if I didn't eat every 2 hours. I feel like a new person. We both are able to get through the work day and our workouts. Would definitely recommend this book.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Can not put my kindle down plays this game constantly .  I even got my daughter hook on this game....Love it its addictive
0307476073|5.0|My niece a 20 something oudoorswoman loved this book. I gave it as a gift and she loved it, related to the spirit of the adventure and said&#34;it was inspirational.&#34;
B00881VLCE|4.0|So far I have only done one but it was easy to do.  I have tried other puzzles via computer and it was not easy to find the pieces.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|This was a great movie. I don't know if it was the mood I was in or not, but I found it suspenseful and creative. It was kind of perfect, in a destructive and crazy way, which relates to the movie.
B00BD6EJRK|4.0|I really like it ! This is a cheaper app.but it works really good for the price ! You should try it !
B0089LOG02|5.0|My great-grandmother rode the orphan train to Michigan.  This book gave me insight as to what her experience might have been.  She's been gone many years, so I can't ask her.  This book, however, has let my imagination flow.  I feel much closer to her now and can now understand why she never talked about her orphan train experience.  Maybe it was good, maybe not.  Read this book if you want to glimpse the life of the orphan train riders.
0374214913|5.0|Blends the love of old books and manuscripts with complex high-tech analysis.  Light reading, but I couldn't put it down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a great waist of time its used for responsibility and its awesome...... i reccomend this to lots of people
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|stupid. just thrown together. nothing great, and if you're going to create something about Oz, you HAVE to make it great and this is just not together. Beautiful CGI but nothing more than that. Fracno just lost my loyalty. He used to be great now he's ut smarmy.<br /><br />so many great and respectful actors but with no life whatsoever.<br /><br />yeah, so I can't even finish the movie, i am so not invested in this that i don't even care how it ends.<br /><br />done.
B008NW67E0|5.0|What can you say about the Mumford Brothers except they are awsome. My son gave me a Mumford Brothers CD and I thought I won't like this music. I was hooked from the first song. Couldn't wait for Babel to be released. I was not disappointed!! Price was right too.
B00827OWO8|4.0|Very good movie that keeps you on thflawse edge of your seat. The movie has a few flaws but overall very good and suspensefull.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Unfortunately for me I watched the movie first then read the book so I was already picturing Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence as the main characters. However, this did not take away from the quality of the book. Matthew Quick does an excellent job of drawing you into the characters. Definitely recommend!
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I won't repeat too much of my other reviews of the BSG music except to reiterate its awesomeness. Bear McCreary is able to do something unique in doing so many types of music so well. He has heart-pounding music for action sequences and melancholic music for the drama. What's even more surprising is that the music works both in the show and as background music for studying. I can leave it on and it never distracts me. \\"Passacaglia\\" is my personal favorite as it really captures the sense of mysticism that underlies the show.<br /><br />If you only get one BSG soundtrack, I still recommend season 4. Alessandro Juliani's singing is superb. Next would be season 3. However, many of the key tracks to the BSG franchise that first appear in season 1 aren't on those tracks, such as the excellent \\"Main Title\\" sequence and \\"Passacaglia\\", so if you want those make sure to get this soundtrack as well.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I got this just to see how how long my battery life would last, but it comes with more! It shows you how much battery percent you have left, it shows you how long you can do certain things until it dies, and it had a battery life line graph! I'm not sure if it drains battery itself, though... If it does, it's not much at all. It works very well for being free!
B00009RDGA|5.0|Excellent movie. A Robert Redford must see. A old movie but a very good one. Nice movie for family movie night
1433537419|5.0|Great quality. Nice binding, beautiful colored maps. The Bible is a great aid for anyone interested in diving deeper into scripture!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|in order to really truly understand and appreciate this game you have to watch this show. I got this app before I ever watched the show so I didn't understand or appreciate this app but now I getbit a lot better and I knelt how great of an app this is!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This movie set is great all my favorite childhood charaters in one but the cases did come a little broken
B004I744AS|5.0|Complete and simple.  Has all the medical abbreviations I have looked for.  Simple definitions with the option of further reading thru a link.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I make videos on YouTube and this mic is definitely good enough for the price range. The only problem is when it gets tangled with having such a long wire, but the I like the long wire since it can go as far as a wireless mic for the same price (and the wired is much better). Great for what I need as a beginner in indie filmmaking
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|It is very cool with the explaining of the weapons. I like the weapons also but they need to put more weapons in it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was absolutly awsome. Sooooo addictive and at times stumped me. But all together a challenging yet awsome and fun game. Cant wait for more rooms!!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I have been a Jeffrey Archer fan for a long time, but what's with the ending?  It's difficult to explain to another reader why the book is exasperating without giving away the end.  The story dragged a bit, but I knew it would have the usual J. Archer end, but didn't expect that.  Is there another Clifton Chronicles that continues?  If so, wish he had said in the epilogue.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It's worth the money could barely put it down it was a great story and I would happily buy any other games like this
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Apparently I'm in the minority in my assessment of this story as it earned an academy award.  This was the slowest moving story I have ever read. I only read it out of curiosity since it won the movie award and now can't believe anyone would read this and think it would make a good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love it except for the keys you have to buy and coins I prefer playing until you get coins
B00821PCJS|5.0|I'm not really into series because I think they lack depth and special effects but even though there are not too many special effects in this series and the effects that are used are kind of hooky the story line is superb and very suspenseful.
0062255657|5.0|The story takes place in the area around Sussex, England with two central characters. The first is our narrator, a boy of seven who is never named and the second is his companion and protector named Lettie Hempstock, who says she is eleven and has been that age for some time.<br /><br />Our narrator in remembering his boyhood home says, \\"I stared at the house, remembering less than I expected about my teenage years: no good times, no bad times. I lived in that for a while as as teenager. It didn't seem to be any part of who I am now.\\" [p4] \\"I was not happy as a child, although from time to time I was content.  I lived in books more than I lived anywhere else.\\" [p13]<br /><br />The story begins with someone apparently trying to give money away with disastrous results. The narrator remembers he awoke choking one night and somehow found a silver shilling had gotten stuck in his throat, but can't figure out how that could happen.<br /><br />We get the idea that the Hempstocks, [Lettie, her mother Ginnie, and her grandmother] really are an OLD English family when our narrator asks Lettie's grandmother, who is referred to as Old Mrs. Hempstock, how old she is and she replies, \\"Old enough...I remember when the moon was made.\\" [p33]<br /><br />But then the story takes a different direction when narrator's mother has to get a job due to financial necessity and therefore hires a housekeeper/nanny, named Ursula Monkton to look after him and his 5yo sister. But it turns out Ursula is more than what she appears to be. The narrator's sister gets along fine with Ursula, but Ursula seems to wish harm upon the young boy for reasons he can't figure out.<br /><br />Somewhat well into the book we get further guidance as to just how unique the Hempstock family is when our narrator sees the grandmother sleeping a long while and asks Lettie if they shouldn't awaken her, to which Lettie replies, \\"It doesn't wok like that...When she gets tired she sleeps till she wakes up on her own. A few minutes or a hundred years. There's no waking her.\\" [p150]<br /><br />With a unique ending which explains the whole situation this is great adult fairytale reminiscent of Stephen King.  With an absence of four-lettered words this makes a great read for everyone old enough to understand the nuances. Kudos to the author.minutes or a hundred years. There's no waking her.\\" [p150]<br /><br />With a unique ending which explains the whole situation this is great adult fairytale reminiscent of Stephen King.

B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Didn't think I would like it, BUT IT'S GOOD.  The acting is good and I thought that it would be predictable but it is actually very intriguing and entertaining for the whole family.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Book reads really fast, has sufficient number of twists and turns to keep you guessing of who did what and why for good part of the book. Corey is very amusing character, even though sometimes getting overboard with actions that most likely simply impossible for a healthy and trained individual, let alone injured cop. But I guess this that makes story interesting as one most likely wouldn't do anything remotely dangerous or challenging in real life.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Why does a paid application have so many invasive permissions? Install this application and waive your rights. I just don't understand? Please explain this to me
B00000IQW5|4.0|This is a wistful story with the ghost of a fire fighting pilot still in love with his girl, and his best friend who has fallen for her, too.  The action revolves around the forest fires they fight, and these scenes are scary.  This isn't Gone With the Wind (5 star!) but I really enjoyed it and it is worth watching more than once.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game!  It has great graphics!  Please give us more games, longer games.  I loved the Myst-like challenges.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Grease 1 is the best high school musical before, because I saw this first song \\"Summer Lovers\\" I like it!
159463176X|5.0|It is hard to beat his fabulous first novel Kite Runner, but this was a very pleasurable read.  He maintains his high standards of writing quality and tells a genuine and unforgettable story giving appropriate insight into the life of the people of Afghanistan.  Hosseini is a top quality writer!
B007V9YF5E|1.0|Gina Carano kicking ass? What could go wrong? Apparently, they can actually make it boring and predictable enough to not even be worth watching. After the first 45 minutes, I was so incredibly disinterested in the rest of the film that I just shut it off. The acting leaves something to be desired, the plot leaves a lot to be desired, and in this day and age \\"just action\\" is no longer a winning recipe for a film.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|Arnold is back!  Fast paced action in this story about a small town sheriff who lives by his principles and won't back down against the bad guys. A thrill ride from the beginning to the end with an amazing cast of characters who complement each other well. Definitely recommend!
034580404X|5.0|I love this series!! It's kind of like Judith Mcnaught with all the drama in it, but with really hardcore sex scenes in it! LOL It's a great read and it doesn't drag!
0553062182|5.0|Wow, this book showed me that my whole life of being sensitive to stimuli, it wasn't just &#34;me&#34; like there was something wrong with me, it was &#34;me&#34; like I was more in tune with my surroundings. This book made me relax into the fact that there is a very good reason why I am uncomfortable in situations where there is too much over stimulation and exactly what IS too much over stimulation!  I have talked to some of my closer friends about this book and realize that they, too, are HSP's.  Side note: bamboo clothing is very comfortable to wear when you are very sensitive to how clothes feel on your body!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This was a great movie. However-- considering that he was a collage graduate,  It was unfortunate that he was so ill prepared for going into the Alaska wilderness. If he had done the proper research,  he would have been so much better off. It is amazing that that bus still sits there & is being used by hunters today. For anyone who is interested,  the book is also a great read.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I love the concept that less &#34;stuff&#34; can equal more money and more time. It sounds like a great trade off to me! This book is a good motivational tool to help you do it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app was so awesome the more you play it the more graphics you get like my favrite the tunnel!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I initially thought that I was ordering a different movie with a similar name.  As I watched I realized my mistake and was at first annoyed.  Upon continuing to watch I first thought this was a bit slow.  As I continued to watch the movie grew on me.  There was some wonderful character development and I began to care about the characters and their lives and where the plot was going.  I ended up engrossed in this movie and appreciating how it dealt with the lives and situations of the characters.  Well put together and this addressed some universal issues worth delving into.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Fun experiments that open your consciousness and prepare you for manifesting in your day to day life, fun read, would recommend
B000MAH5O2|4.0|I really only had to read a chapter for the class I was taking, but I actually found this book extremely interesting and was compelled to read more. Definitely planning on finishing it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book showed all aspects of Steve Jobs, the good ,the bad and ugly. The author did a great job of showing the true Jobs! I will recommend t o anyone who was interested in Apple.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It started well but about half way through it seemed as though the author was still trying to figure out how he was going to end the book.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Simply put, this might be the best album released in the past decade. Certainly Kanye's best that will be a classic hip-hop album to listen to for generations to come.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Every once in a while a movie can rivet your attention and keep your brain going at the same time. You are continually thinking, \\"What is he going to say or do next?\\". An added bonus is the acting is excellent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome . It is definitely worth the 7 buck . Minecraft PE is the awesomest game ever .
B007YMN432|5.0|The disc quality is excellent, and the content is great, I like all the songs. definitely sounds great. buy it if you know of music.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I put off watching the movie after I heard people say they did not care for it. If you are expecting Dorthy, Totto and the wicked witch under the house then you may be a little upset. Still, if you watch the movie for the suspense and blot out the old movie you can enjoy it. The movie was a bit nutty at some points, but all in all, not a bad movie.<br /><br />I give it four thumbs up
B00821OX98|5.0|This is exactly as good as &#34;Jericho&#34;<br />Remember that one?<br />They produce this series WAYYYYYYYYYY too slowly, but what they produce rocks, the characters are interesting, and it IS possible to forgive the terrible CGI.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I didn't fully read the entry in the kindle store when I downloaded this title for free. I expected a more in depth look at Nikolai Tesla than was in this short volume.  The high points of Tesla's achievements are covered briefly, but the main thrust of the book is to show the reader some traits of genius. The work is obviously biased towards Tesla and does not present a balanced view. You get what you pay for.
B002BEXENS|5.0|A masterpiece! Groovy organs and horns. A truly super sessions it is. I have played it a lot since purchasing it.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I think most of these reviews were written by Neil Gaiman's PR people. I just dont believe that many people gave 5 stars.  This book is ridiculous and it took all I had to finish it. This &#34;adult&#34; book is written in the point of view of a seven year old boy. It should have been in the children's section. What a waste of money!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed playing this. The higher levels made you think. Worked great on original kindle fire. Looking for more like it
0425263924|4.0|It's hard to believe that we're three books in and just scraping the surface of Gideon and Eva's relationship. This was a fun and quick read, and I love the author's surprise at the end! I would absolutely recommend this trilogy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a bit tricky but still fun. This is much better than 100 floors!! You should buy this app!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I am an 17  year old student doing this for a summer assignment, and it took all I had to hold back tears. It was a very sad but heartwarming story that everyone should read. Although some words maybe confusing you eventually catch on. One of the best books I have ever read.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Five stars, perfect, amazing, wonderful, outstanding, good, great condition, got me hooked on TCW plan to buy them all, THANKS!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great app that entertains both a 10 yr old as well as an adult and can be used by 2 people working together.  We are looking forward to more levels.  Thanks.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|As I am writing this, there are nearly 700 other reviews, so I'll keep it short.  I watched it because nothing else was on, and I had enjoyed \\"Sniper\\".  I thought it would be like that.  At the time, I hadn't watched Marky Mark, and thought he was probably a bad actor who got into that industry due to having been popular in a boy band.  Boy, was I wrong.  I've watched it about three times now, and will probably watch it again.  It's that good.  The only downside to me was that I don't like Danny Glover as an actor, and his politics in support of Hugo Chavez are tantamount to treason.  That's overstating it but I feel that strongly.  Anyway it's a very good movie -- highly recommended.
B007EZJKS2|1.0|I thought I was ordering the actual written book, but this is cartoon version.  The description does not state this and is very deceptive.  This is the first time I have felt ripped off with an Amazon kindle order.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed helping find items to get out:)  The game is an Interactive I spy game! My kids rate it awesome.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|no instructions with this but figure it out or go to utube if you get stuck...best ever app....you will be a structural engineer when you complete the levels...!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a great physics game. I could spend hours playing it. I first started playing on my wife's HTC One. It's a lot better on the kindle fire hd though.
B003K16PAU|4.0|Orwell comes in with his characteristic ability to observe and remark without grandiloquence or excess. A quick, light-hearted read that delves into larger issues of poverty -- its message remaining just as relevant today.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is awesome, it's so cool, I'm and archer guy it's really awesome I know that I've said that a lot but that's how good it is
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The best book I've read in a very long time. Beautifully written, thought provoking and deeply moving. Hosseini is one of the best writers of our day.
1476734941|5.0|Bought this for my wife after watching Michael Mosely on PBS.  It really works, without too much sacrifice, and the suggested recipes are really good.  So you have a low calorie day, twice a week, but you always know that the next day will be back to normal.  The general guidelines on healthy eating don't hurt either.  Certainly recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|For a free app, this one is really good.  I like being able to set multiple locations.  It is very easy to switch from one to the other.  I also like that alerts and temperature appear at the top with the Kindle information.  The radar is so so, but detailed enough for you to see what is going on.  Great app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really fun game that stretches your brain and makes you be logical as you try to move from place to place. It can, of course, also make you crazy when you get stuck.
1446302474|3.0|Most of the designs are so very similar with some variations in the detail. Looked for more distinct unique techniques.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|I love the halo story, books, games and movie.  Movie was great, wish it was longer, and that they will make more movies
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Cannot wait for the next book! Hooked and addicted! One of the best novels I've read in a while! Amazing!
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|not bad but not great. at least its rated R. plenty of shoot them up scenes. worth watching once if u have seen the rest of the die hards.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators is very much In the &#34;Grisham style&#34; and takes the reader on an up and down ride throughout the story.  I think it is better than some of his more recent books and more in line with his earlier writing.  I enjoyed it very much.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|I was really disappointed.  With an actor like Denzel Washington, why do they feel the need to include graphic nudity and horrible language.  I  mean, I can understand a butt shot or a cuss word or two for effect.  But the amount of nudity and language in this film was completely unnecessary and detracted from the story line.
0321701763|5.0|This has been an excellent book. The directions are clear and easy to follow and I am learning a great deal. Well worth the money.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very fun game, if you leave it sit over night, you tot a lot of money! Very reccommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it keeps me busy when I am bored even though it is not like the real horses that we have it is still fun!
B004QX07G4|4.0|I recommend this product to anyone who likes animals,kids,Ellen, and witty jokes.  It's an easy read.  Also you can just pick up the book at anytime and start reading and not feel lost.  It's very random
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Loving this.  It allows me to keep a journal, notes, and any other information I need to write down.  I love that I a not restricted to just one notebook but can create as many as I need for whatever the purpose is I need it for.  My only concern would be that because this information is stored in the cloud and someone could hack it and then steal  said information...
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I love this movie and always have.  I had to order it so I can watch whenever I want!!!  Arrived in great condition and on time!  Thanks!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I grew up playing uno. This computer game app is wonderful to play and I can spend hours engrossed trying to beat it.  I especially like the tournament mode.  Although the application gives you the impression you are playing with others, nothing beats a good card game being played with real people in real life!!!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|The version in other market is 1.0.13 and has not track location . Devs team do not update this game in amazon .I think amazon have to request devs to update it
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great way to look at different ideas for decorating or fashion.  I enjoy this application very much.  Fantabulous!!!
B0045I3EJC|5.0|This was a delightful adventure into another world of fantasy and the possibilities of the literature of movies.  I will watch it many times over to delve into it's magical premise
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think there should be a demo version for the kindle fire version, because me and my mom share an amazon account, andnmy mom dosent want to pay for minecraft
0062124293|4.0|Moran is very British, so have your British/English dictionary available. Her journey through womanhood, which begins in early adolescence, and continues to the present is very explicit, so not for those of you who would be offended by the use of profanity. BUT, don't let that ruin your enjoyment of the book - in fact I thought it added to the content. Frank and hilarious, read it with the above cautions in mind.
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|it's just terrible...uhhhh...hem, uh, it's, well...just don't, not even if it's free, really, i highly recommend you move along, there's nothing to see here
0385349947|4.0|While I am 56 and a seasoned veteran of corporate America, I found useful information in this book. No matter your age, you can take her advice and lean in. I also gave it to my niece who is in college - I want her to get a lay of the corporate land and give her an edge as she starts on her career. I know there are detractors who say Sandberg had advantages because of her upbringing, ability to go to an Ivy League college, etc., but don't let that take away from her message. We all can lean in and advance our knowledge and careers.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|It is OK to watch and ease your mind of the cares of this world.  The story could be a little more real.
B000002GBB|5.0|Always a STYX fan. Enjoy the perk of having it on &#34;Cloud Player&#34;. along with other music purchased from Amazon.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I have always loved this book. I re-read it at least once a year. I am glad to see that Salvatore is still putting new books out there. I will get to them as soon as possible.
B0007VCZ50|4.0|While Sting can never capture the impact The Police hold on a live show, this band he puts together warrants some praise in putting up with him and his cast of misfits that follow him around, yet, its interesting to see him work a song, as he does in Bring On The Night. The film also reveals emotional and personal footage with the birth of his son Jake to the tune of &#34;Russians&#34;.<br /><br />The music is clean and jazzy, perhaps in Branford Marsalis and keyboardist Kenny Kirkland along with drummer Omar Hakim, this is what will happen when you throw in soon to be Rolling Stones bassist Daryl Jones in the mix.<br /><br />These are all strong and talented artists mating with one of the industry's leading players and producing a sound which I believe is what Sting really wants to convey at this point in his career during the mid-eighties, but hasn't been able to since, &#34;The Dream of The Blue Turtles&#34; and &#34;Nothing Like The Sun&#34;.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|The National is a great band, and this album shows it. Like their previous albums it has a unifying &#34;style&#34; that ties the whole album together, and is definitely distinct from the styles of High Violet and Boxer. If you're looking for a continuation of either of those albums, this is not it. But if you like and appreciate the differences between all The National albums, you will love this record.
0143117130|5.0|I loved this book.  Bridget Jones is every single girl, insecure, always going after the wrong man, and not understood by her parents. It was the British version of \\"Sex in the City\\" with bad clothes.  I loved her personality, the human side, clumsy and with a lack of polish that made her so endearing. A wonderfully entertaining read, it made me realize that the quest for companionship is not only universal, but all the side relationships (friend, parents...)  and the drama that goes with them  are as well.  Highly diverting.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|its not what i thought and for app illerate older folks its confusing  not understanding how to navigate .  make it easier to use
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A friend got this book from one of her customers and passed it on to me. I'm very happy she did so. This was a fun read.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|good app i recommend for all of you, also it is free and working without problems in all plataforms and equipments....
B00785P2QC|3.0|fun game. but slow to earn money. to upgrade and some upgrades are expensive.  designed to make you spend real money. to get ahead in game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good app i recommend for all of you, also it is free and working without problems in all plataforms and equipments....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great way to work your brain. It's fun and addicting encouraging you to think outside the box.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|good material, i recommend for all of you buy this accessory. The price, utility and materials are very good and very nice
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it more than 100 floors. Hope there is an update soon. Easier than 100 floors but still challenging and fun.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|good app i recommend for all of you, also it is free and working without problems in all plataforms and equipments....
B003G4W49C|3.0|Very good read, good pace easy to read. I could remember feeling the way ended felt in relation to adults when I was a kid, feeling as though I understood much more than they would \\"allow\\" me. Very honest a bit dark but very relevant for the young modern generation.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|We are now referring to games and apps as &quot;artisanal&quot;?  The game is alright and would probably be fun for kids, but seriously... artisanal?  I choke back a snicker when chain restaurants refer to their cheese or meats as being artisanal... now apps?  So lame.
B009VL28W2|4.0|First off let me explain. I have a REAL home theater, not a little cheap \\"home theater in in box\\", or a sound bar! I have a Sony ES receiver(7.1) and Definitive Technology(7002's up front, 2002 center, BPX 1.2's on the side, and Pro Monitor 1000's in the rear) all the way around... with a PS3 and a LG 8600 series TV.<br /><br />I think the video is just fine, but the sound lacks until you get to \\"Sad But True\\". It is muddy and the vocals are to high, it gets better, and then around \\"Enter Sandman\\" it gets better, and is right on for the last song which is \\"Seek and Destroy!\\" The \\"bonus\\" tracks sound better than the full concert although a little heavy on the bottom end.<br /><br />Metallica is one of my favorite groups and the use Clair Brothers(who is big bucks) for their sound company on the road, wish they would of spent a few $$ more for the production of the DVD. All in all it is good!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have tryed all the different coin games and this one is by far the best one out there! Don't waste your money on any of the other coin apps.
B00AFPVPDG|4.0|At first, I was captivating by the stories in the book. I couldn't put the book down. Then, I got difficulties to stay focused with the example. But I do think this book is worth reading and very interesting.<br /><br />You are avid to be knowledgeable but you don't have 10 000 hours at your disposal to be an outlier?<br /><br />The author has made the calculation. Ten thousand hours equals eight hours of deliberate practice every day for approximately three and a half years, with no breaks, no weekends, and no vacations. Assuming a standard 260 working days a year with no distractions, that's a full-time job for almost five years, assuming you spend 100 percent of that time exerting 100 percent of your energy and effort.<br /><br />It is pretty overwhelming.<br /><br />But What about 20 hours?<br />Josh Kaufman explains what you can expect to achieve in 20 hours and how to organize yourself. Granted you will need a bit of practice and probably struggle by yourself as the author doesn't deconstruct his brain that much and clearly has experience in organising himself and finding his information. But with good will, it is doable for everyone. I think.<br /><br />Who can't spend 20 hours doing something? These 20 hours can change your life if you break the pattern of procrastination and just do it.<br /><br />Give you a chance. Give you 20 hours to try. I am giving it a try. It works.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I purchased this dvd as a gift during November. I was a great deal at only $5. Black Friday deals on Amazon rock!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Great album overall, this duo keeps re-inventing themselves over and over again.  I know several people were upset because it is a different album than their previous works, but why would you want the same sound from them over and over again?  This just shows that they've grown as a group and as artists.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a refreshing take on a pretty formulaic genre.  I enjoyed it and have already recommended it to friends.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Liked it a lot. Characters were believable and consistent with the franchise. Good pace and interesting story. Familiar characters with new introductions.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I enjoy Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man due to his ability to be arrogant yet likeable. #3 is action packed as you would expect and the technology aspect is interesting and plausible. Sure, it was somewhat predictable in some spots, but it doesn't spoil the movie and Iron Man's interaction with the other characters is still entertaining. Ben Kingsley is great as usual.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|Needed a way to keep notes on my kindle. I am still trying it out.  So far so good, no major complaints.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|Really an added plus for MacBook and GarageBand. A great alternitive to the expensive gear that serves the same function.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game.  Challenging but not impossible.  Some of the &quot;things&quot; are hard to see on my kindle (too small).
B00C061I3K|5.0|Its a new twist for Daft Punk but I like it this is a CD i can listen to from start to finish always liked Daft Punk and still do after this CD. If you haven't gotten this CD get it if your not sure if you should get it anyway
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|&#34;Warm Bodies&#34; started out a little more awkward than I thought it would be, but it quickly drew me in with its humor and its unusualness.<br /><br />I am normally very scared of zombie movies (even Zombieland was too frightening for me), but this movie was mostly endearing, and I wasn't often clutching the arm of the person next to me. So, if you're not normally into zombie flicks, give this one a chance. It was a good date movie.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Very action-packed and paranormal scenes that are heart pounding. It is a movie that leads back many many years before to follow up to the current time in the movie.
B0013WJGJ0|2.0|I remembered watching this movie as a kid and thinking it was super amazing. As an adult, it fell short of expectations.<br /><br />The romance between Bruce Wayne and Vicky Vale was pretty thin, and there were some extremely cheesy moments during the action scenes. I was honestly embarrassed to show this to a friend who had never seen it.
B004G6009U|5.0|Love this movie! Well written story line & music as well. A classic Disney movie. A great family film for all to enjoy
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|If you're attracted to big men with dreamy eyes and long hair, this movie is for you!<br /><br />I loved the guy who played the Huntsman, and since he was on-screen a lot, this movie was wonderful.  And to be fair, Snow White had some pretty kick-ass qualities and the evil stepmother/Queen was pretty darn scary.<br /><br />I would have given this a 5-star rating if it hadn't been for the scenes with the Dwarves. They were just really odd and cheesy; one of them was blind but seemed to have an extra sense and could tell what was going on all the time, there was a lot of time wasted wandering around an enchanted forest, and I guess we were supposed to feel sad when one of the dwarves died, but the emotional connection really wasn't that well-built.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart's acting in this film was far better than her acting in Twilight, so overall, it was worth watching. But I might choose to fast-forward through the scenes with the dwarves when watching it in the future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the best game ever!  we love to play on the go.  we recommend this game for all ages.  ok.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game I always want to play it. I hope they keep this game for a long time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is really fun and addicting glad it Is free hope they get new levels it is really super fun
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like the new format. It makes it much easier to so the long term format. One, two, three.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Need more levels a fun and challenging game. Needs more rooms and more items to get before getting to next level.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I think the most disturbing thing for me was that Pat spoke and thought as though he were mentally handicapped, not mentally ill.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I are enjoying this wonderfully done English Masterpiece Theater series.  We can't wait for season #4 to be available. The characters are interesting.  The depiction of the relationships between the servants and gentry is interesting. It gives insight to a way of life of years gone by that was unknown here in the USA.
0812983459|4.0|Rachel Joyce carefully weaves a story of family dysfunction which has the reader experiencing both shades of sadness and alienation-- and shades of promise and hope.<br />There's a lot to ponder in this book -- for men and women equally.  The whole concept of the pilgrimage is a bit tiresome toward the end, but I wouldn't let that hinder me!
0071771263|5.0|nice
B00457WZEI|4.0|I love animals and always like books that give the animals' view. I cried several times but all in all,it was a good book.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I enjoyed watching this with our family..Miley Cyrus and Emily Osmet are great Actresses. I recommend getting this one. Shipping was fast and on time.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I enjoy playing. Needs to be a little more interactive.  Wish it was a little harder. Made more money after a mission so I could buy more
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly.  It is a \\"not able to.put down\\" book.  Loved the ending.  The best of his later works.
B007712XAU|5.0|The summary said it was used, in new condition, but it was in fact brand new.  What's not to like.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Fantastic  especially if an SO A  Fan of FX  From season 1  thru 4  I personally thought  The Sons of Anarchy CD #2  Wasn't as good as this one  left out to many songs  iike in a soldier's  eye  etc
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love how I kept getting goose bumps. I absolutely would play it again! I seriously recommend this game if you like a brain busting challenge... I only wish it were longer.... it only took me 2 hours to beat.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|An excellent start for those interested in exploring the Horror  genre. The use of photos throughout the story worked well. Crisp writing and good pace puts this well crafted novel  into &#34;recommended for teenagers and pre-teens.&#34;
B004UID2LC|3.0|This is an excellent app for the Kindle Fire, but there's a glitch with downloading mp3 files.  If you download a song it'll use the thumbnail of the song you download previously.  So you'll have two of each thumbnail and will need to rely on the title only.  Also, if you're downloading a video, you're not allowed to exit the app or else it will stop downloading.
B00AATV046|5.0|This is not a movie review, but to us this movie is one of our Christmas favorites. The order was shipped and arrived ontime without any problems.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|The DVD that is the actual movie was terrific. I viewed this first in the new series, then went to the movie theater to see the current flick. Pine is a great Kirk. The actor who portrays Spock looks enough like the original to be his son. It was not like a prequel because it is set many star dates later so the viewer is not subjected to the main characters as little children.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Love this game, it is way more fun than I would have expected! I would definitely recommend it. My kids enjoy making matches, even the youngest can match based off of pictures.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was so wonderful I think I'll read it again. A book hasn't touched me like this one since &#34;Cutting for Stone&#34;.
B0089LOG02|2.0|I didn't like the bad language in it and so didn't read very far. Wish I could know about this before buying it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Mr. Grisham kept me turning the pages to see how this elaborate plot unwinds. Everything falls into place a little to neatly at times, but overall a good read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good start to this game. Some rooms were frustrating but eventually completed. only 10 rooms right now. hope for more soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game!It lasts a long time. If you're thinking that it's a ripoff of Temple Run, it's got more characters, more upgrades, it's harder to get coins,and it's harder overall. This game is great for your kids if you don't want them to play Temple Run because you think it's too graphic. Although I think that Temple Run is a cool game, Subway Surfers is awesome!
B00CC1JXYE|3.0|It's okay but does not cover phone the way I want to and it does not hug the curves of the phone
0399250395|5.0|I teach music and movement in PreK  and elementary schools.  I have a multi lesson curriculum for this book that is very exciting for my students.  I just discovered this book and shared it with my classes after we completed all our work on it. They LOVED it!  The pop ups and movable pieces are beautifully designed.  This is not a book that I would  leave for very young classes to play with since it is delicate and I prefer to use it as  a special treat for a class.  It's an expensive investment but definitely worth it.
B000OLROWC|5.0|This is just a great movie for all ages. Watch and enjoy... save and share as the younger kids grow up!!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|It's addictive and challenging and I love it!! If you are searching for a game that will keep you entertained, you've found it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is a fun game you build and make a city so if you like games were you build a city this is the game for tou
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and love this app. I don't need it for the percentage but love to use it to know bow much time I have on internet browsing, reading books, and let's me know the last time I charged it. (To get the percentage on your Kindle Fire 2nd generation,  slide down the menu thing. Tap &quot;more&quot;. Tap &quot;Device&quot;. Then, switch &quot;Show Battery Percentage In Bar&quot; to on. :)
B00BLF9FOK|2.0|When picking up a movie DVD of this kind, one shouldn't have too high an expectation which I didn't.<br />I expected a 90 min. light-hearted action film of Schwarzenengger specialty.<br />I was greatly disappointed.<br />The story is an old hat, messily written and edited.<br />It is primarily an action film with a lot of shootings and noises but totally lack of suspense or tension.<br />It is not even funny.<br />My heart sank when Johnny Knoxville appeared in his usual \\"Jack Ass\\" self.<br />Fine actors like Forrest Whitaker spent the whole film running around and looking distressed and<br />Michael Pena worked as an extra?<br />Don't waste your time.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love the books even more than I do the tv show, and that's saying something! What an imagination he has.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|Ms McLorin Salvant's voice is lovely, soulful, sexy, strong, and playful.  She is reminiscent of great jazz vocalists like Billie Holliday,&Sarah Vaughn but completely her own voice!  This CD lifted me up and put a lasting smile on my face!  If you haven't heard it already DEFINETLY, DEFINETLY listen and if you have heard it  I know you'll be going back for more!
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|Such deception, the fact that Will Smith is a remarkable actor After Earth did him injustice.  It takes away his style of acting to the lowest level, by giving in to a story where Sci Fi had it's beginnings.  It's an awful plot that makes Jade take a step back into his acting career vs. moving forward.  A doomed planet Earth off limits to the commander and his tribulation, but totally different story when they hard crash into earth make our present world look like Roses.  This movie sucks! Half a star for me!!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I watched this movie before I bought it and didn't think I would like it. I LOVE IT!!! This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I also got it at a great price on here.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Well first off it always freezes and make my kindle fire run slow. Also it made it to where I had to get a new kindle cause everytime I turned my kindle on it played the same song. I don't recommend this!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is the bomb! This game is kinda like temple run.<br /><br />EXPLANATION:<br /><br />&middot;You have to dodge different things such as blimps, missiles, jets, moving trucks<br /><br />&middot;You have to collect stark tokens<br /><br />&middot;You have to defeat villains<br /><br />&middot;You have to complete missions<br /><br />&middot; You can unlock different suits for Tony<br /><br />It's a pretty cool game that after a while you get addicted! I hope you like it!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This has given a path to follow when I talk to them because l am very shy. Thank you very much
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think this is a great game that people should get. I recommend this I game to people of all ages. First, when the angry birds game came out I thought that it was terrific, but always wished they made a game where you can be the pig. And now, finally then made one!<br /><br />Now here's the explanation of the game:<br /><br />You have to help the pigs build vehicles and that sort of thing so they can get to the finish line.......<br />I know what your thing, this game is going to boring,but it's not, it's a fun game and after you play it a while you get addicted. And if you like angry birds get this game.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I have always loved Eagles music. Their lyrics describe real feelings good or bad that people have. My kids know their music by heart just as I do. I expected to enjoy this Dvd..it went beyond that. I absolutely loved it! Don Henley sings and looks stunningly good. I have to say that first. (ok slight crush don't tell hubby). When he does \\"Wasted Time\\" he obviously feels it. I just love his voice.<br />  Glen Frye owned it too. In performance and looks. Song after song. Singing it with feeling. These songs are his and no one can sing them like him. People have tried and they may do good then by the end of it you think 'but they are no Glenn Frye'. Really.<br />  Joe Walsh obviously enjoyed being back on stage. His skills are also unmatched. Again a unique voice with rifts that make people say 'WOW'.  I had never heard \\"One day at a time\\" which he wrote and sang. AWESOME. (High five to you Joe)<br />  I would like to make it clear. This is not about going down memory lane. Its about music that makes me feel good. Its about music that you play loud in the car and sing along at the top of your lungs.<br /><br />This is just a great performance by all.  I give it 5 stars for a great concert and 5 guys that look great doing it.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|the officesuit pro 7 is a must have for any kindle so please stop ruining it by updates when it was A-OK in the first place
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and I am really looking forward to more levels being added.  The level of difficulty was just right; challenging but not too difficult.  Thanks for a great game.
B0083SBM7Q|1.0|There is no Blu-ray movie at all!!! When fed into the player, it says &#34;no disc.&#34; The Disc 2 - DVD Feature Film Bonus is ok, in fact we are watching this now as I write this comment. Hence the &#34;I hate it&#34; comment. Please I want to send this back!<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />mariapaz ramos englis
1490313370|4.0|I'm a longtime reader of Altucher's blog posts, as he seems to just \\"get it\\" in so many ways.  It's rare to find someone who is so smart, yet to practical, and who writes in an accessible, funny way.  I think this book has solid content but longtime readers of his blog should know that a lot of this is repurposed content.  There's nothing wrong with that, necessarily, but it's just something to be aware of.  Also, the writing isn't exactly what you'd expect out of a \\"book\\"; it reads more like a string of blog posts with unclear connections.  Still, with all of that said, the actual content is thought-provoking, compelling, and -- especially for someone new to his work -- eye-opening.  You'll be better off for having read the book.
0452289963|5.0|I love this book and have read some of it more than once.  I had a book club at my home when Eckhart and Oprah had their show on line.  We all met once a week to discuss each chapter and how it effected our lives. I have since bought  this book for friends.<br />I just purchased this book now for my Granddaughter.  I think it will be perfect timing for her.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this for my daughter when she was nearly two. She loved it and I think it helped her build some better hand-eye coordination. She couldn't play Angry Birds, but after playing this for a while she learned the skills needed to rock some piggy's.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Loved it,please make more! It was not so easy where you get bored,but not so difficult where you lost interest.
B004SBX112|3.0|I have Android on Droid 3. Updated ages ago on AB Seasons and AB Star Wars. Amazon fallling waaaaay behind for apps I paid for, which were free on Google Play. Why stay with Amazon Kindle if this keeps happening?
B003L77G8I|1.0|It's a great show, but the worst product I have ever had the misfortune to buy.  Wish I could return them and get a full refund.  What a waste of money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic series so well-done in so many ways. The only thing I don't like about Downton Abbey is waiting for season four.
B0053O89IS|1.0|Great show, but the DVDs haven't gotten any better than the 1st season, wish I never bought these.  Not one DVD worked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun to play. I wish it had more rooms. I don't know what I'm going to play now. I love that it is free!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|You will experience hatred, sorrow, excitement, joy, and the plethora of other emotions that represent the human condition. Read as you like.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the most awesome game in the world its way more fun then the first I spent three hours playin
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is different than anything I've come across so far.  There are no hints.  If you leave the game, every gain in that area is lost.  I found this game compelling and challenging.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was anxiously waiting for the third crossfire series to come out and what a terrible storyline from the author. There was no rising action, no character conflict like we see in the other two crossfire series. It was dragging out between Eva and Gideon, with half of the book just detailing the sex between Gideon and Eva and all the raunchy details. How many times do we have to read all the different ways the two have sex and how many times Gideon tells Eva he needs her??? After a while I skipped over all the sex scenes since it had nothing else to offer. Also where did this reporter come from all of a sudden? Do we really need books 4 and 5 to get to the final storyline on how messed up Gideon and Eva are but still manage to &#34;for the moment&#34; stay together???  I can't believe Sylvia Day went from two great books to such a crappy third. Was her had even in writing this book at all? I can't believe I wasted the time and the money on this book. Shame Sylvia, you threw a piece of crap at your fans.
0440246318|5.0|I saw the book on sale at a Dillon's store. Thought I'd give it a look. I'd never read Child nor seen the Reacher movie, so it was an introduction. What a read! Next time I was babysitting my grandson, I asked him to speak for a minute without using the letter \\"A.\\" Had to tell him how. When his dad got home, grandson challenged him to speak the minute. He couldn't. I'm hooked.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Well produced and written.  Of course the author found fit to provide an &#34;out&#34; for most of the situations giving satisfying resolution to difficult problems.  It appears to have accolades worldwide.  Certainly depicts a bygone era in many parts of Britain that always had a fascination for many who marvel at the world which was a fools paradise with no vast wealth to support the charade of knights and lairds of old and which only exists in the palaces of the oil sheikdoms and a few other world spots too.  Change is the essence of the universe.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I thought the author did a great job in wrapping up a super series.  The characters kept their personalities throughout and that made it easy to keep up interest.  It flowed along very well and I had a hard time putting it down.  I was sort of sad with how some of the individuals ended but it was to be expected when you are up against so many super bad entities.  I think it will be a while before I find a series that I can keep reading from start to end and stay engaged throughout.
0345803507|5.0|Great set of books ,couldn't put them down..Came in themail asap..  Just happy with the whole thing. Will order more of that kind
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book full of twists. The Type of book you can't put down. Can't wait to read more books by Gillian Flynn!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|This is an excellent collection, but that's all it is. No booklet, liners, or anything else--just the CD (in cardboard sleeves) and the box they come in.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not a bad way to waste some time. Puzzles aren't that difficult but do require a little thought. Would be a good game for kids.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this is a good game to help you with your memorization skills and you also have to think really hard to get past all 10 levels.
B00D7NRHX0|1.0|I bought this movie based on reviews here, and couldn't be more disappointed. It's just a plain stupid production about gravity and upside down people on different parallels portraying infantile little tricks you can do between upright and upside down people to bring these worlds together. Illegally, of course. Movies don't have to make sense to be enjoyable, but this really tests that bleeding edge. Makes you wonder who comes up with this kind of stuff, or worse yet, agrees to dump money into it. Now I need to go watch another movie to shake this one from my head. Where did I put that Spice Girls movie I've been wanting to see?
0307740919|5.0|I love Toni Morrison! And if  you do, too, you're gonna love this book. It's her traditional writing that encapsulates those trails in live that change your vision, but not your purpose.<br /><br />There was no, 'and everything will be better' ending, but a flicker of hope was lit that gave you hope. I LOVED this book. I just wish it was longer.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Everything is this package is great.  I watch the bluray rather than the DVD and the sound is perfect.  The video shots cuts too often at times but you can still see Jimmy's fret/finger work most of the time.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Gonna pop the popcorn and watch some sci-fi.<br />I expect it to be wonderful.<br />I had a super 8 camera as a kid.<br />Then I worked 30 years as a TV news photographer.<br />I will understand this.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|This is a real classic.  The music is perfect and really adds to each scene.  The audio tracks sounds great and enhances the action.
B005KELR3A|3.0|Overall serves its purpose.  Just wish it said it had cosmetic defects like the big 6\\" cut through the outer rubber layer.  All in all it works.
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|Some of the cuts are good, especially when Joe's playing is featured.  I bought this CD based on the two songs that Beth did with Joe on his Beacon Theater bluray.  I'd have to say that she/they were much better there than here.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The costumes, the drama, the soap opera all nicely packaged in beautiful scenery with  class divisions of a different age falling by the wayside as the times do change.  Did I mention the costumes?  Maggie Smith gets extra kudos as the acid tongued dowager.  She's hysterical.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My family loves this game, not disappointed in our purchase,but when we got to Cloud City it kicked us out of the game :( I wonder if anyone else is having the same problem? This is sad since I did pay for the game.
044024613X|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  My book club had a wonderful discussion about the murder gene, the role of parents,<br />the court system, etc. I would recommend this book for a quick read.
B0063M22QO|1.0|This keeps showing up and I don't order it, what is the deal with this ap  Needs to go away
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really really enjoyed this book. I have already talked about it with my daughter and will be purchasing several copies for nieces and a few of my girl friends daughters. I will also recommend it to my book club.  I feel this should be recommended reading in high school, definitely by college level for both female and male students.<br /><br />As an African American woman I could  not help but see the many many correlations in our experiences.  There are sooo many instances in the book where \\"female\\" could have been replaced with \\"black\\".<br /><br />Thank you for a book that is not only informative, but also a good read.<br />V. Irons
B00884GR0W|4.0|This game is great, but I think there should be some changes. For example, creatures should be able to spawn without the use of spawners, except powerful creatures and boss monsters, but humans should be able to spawn on their own. Also, you should add wooden tools. Also, players shouldn't be able to mine with their bare fists. And it would be great if you added optional side quests. I'm not trying to criticize your game. I just want some more features and to make the game have a fair difficulty. I would appreciate it very much if you apply these updates to the game.
B00BYISRC0|4.0|I don't know if its my player. But i think sides 1 and 3 are a bit out of sync or tune? some parts of the track are slow. I still have to check if its just my player. But i got some other vinyls and they play well with the same player. so im assuming that my trouble will find me copy is defective.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this is a really good app it lets me know when I should charge my kindle and how much battery power there is left
014241493X|5.0|I love John Green books, and this one does not disappoint. Very interesting characters and story line. I simply couldn't put it down. Green has a way of pulling you in and allowing you to feel something.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I do so love Neil Gaiman' s books. One may  think of him, King, Straub, del Toro, and wonder what it must be like in their minds with imaginations such as theirs. This book was great, and left the reader with as  many provoking questions as it did answers. I only hope it's not so long before his next one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is great to say the least. I want more levels sooner than later.hopefully sooner. I love this game.
0743487486|4.0|This is a great read to shake up your perspectives.  Alfie knows how to push the boundaries in order to consider any movement for change in the way we parent.
1250007208|5.0|Wow, I was not expecting to like this as much as I did. I mean, Cinderella/cyborg mashed together? That's just weird.<br /><br />I still have no idea how Marissa Meyer managed to do this so well, but she DID. It was amazing. I love Cinderella retellings, and this is one of the best I've ever read. I would say best, but I still can't tell if I liked this as well as or better than Ella Enchanted.<br /><br />Cinder is an amazing main character! I love her. She's a strong heroine. She sticks up herself when Adri treats her like dirt. She's a Cyborg. (I wasn't exactly sure what a cyborg was going into this story. I thought it was just a robot, but it's not. According to Google, it's 'A fictional or hypothetical person whose physical abilities become superhuman by mechanical elements built into the body.') SHE'S AWESOME.<br /><br />Prince Kai was also a great character. I loved how he was willing to do anything for his country. He was a truly selfless leader.<br /><br />I would like to say that there were 'huge plot twists', but that is one thing I can't say. I actually guessed the plot twists by around the fifteenth page. But this story doesn't need a ton of 'wow, I didn't see that coming!'-s to make it good. The awesome characters and the unique twist on Cinderella make it a wonderful story anyway, so I was able to overlook the obvious foreshadowing.<br /><br />Also, this is one book where I loved the way the author explained how the world got to the point it did in the book. Normally, I like when the author leaves it up to the reader's imagination, but I thought it was really interesting how Marissa Meyer explained what had happened in the future.<br /><br />If you haven't read this, do it! This author is one 'Meyer' I will never be ashamed to love.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can You Escape is a very good game. Needs more rooms, but hopefully more are on the way. Keep it up MobiGrow.
B004GYY714|4.0|I listen to TuneIn Radio every day at work.  I can select from radio stations in Britain to comedy stations in the USA.  The sound quality is terrific.  The only down side is that because it is streaming, there are occasional moments where the streaming stops for a minute or two - but I think that is more of a problem with the network than TuneIn.  I like it a lot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Please make more levels! This game was so much fun! I can not wait for more levels! Really have to use your head on these puzzles.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I have contacted the company for information on why this game has the permissions listed.  Will update review upon reasonable time if given an answer. Until then, I see this as a data mining app.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|As long as you keep the &#34;In-app Purchase&#34; function on OFF.  You can let your child play the game with no worry about surprise charges.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I am not a big fan of zombie movies and I am pretty sure this is the first and probably last book I'll ever read about zombies.  I was intrigued by the title.  I'm also one of those crazy people who likes to read the book before seeing the movie and I knew my husband would want to go see the movie.  Over vacation while traveling I would read it out loud to share it w/my husband.<br /><br />The interview format did not excite me, but I kept reading anyway and found myself becoming very interested in the premise.  As mentioned earlier, I am not a big fan of this genre, but the author did a great job describing what would/could probably happen if something like this really could happen.<br /><br />While reading and discussing the book, we weren't sure how the book would be adapted into a movie.  My husband felt it would make a better HBO mini-series.  I believe he was correct.<br />We enjoyed sharing it.  There aren't' t too many books my husband would enjoy having read to him.  This fortunately was one.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It was a very creative game I highly recommend it :) :) :) :) :) :) :) &lt;3<br />And  it also has very good graphics and the different non noms where very cool
B000EPR7NE|4.0|The music itself is gorgeous and just as we remembered from the movie.  So we give the music 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I am taking one star off the review for the liner notes.  There is a beautifully produced booklet of liner notes, about 8-10 pages or so, and there is absolutely no information about the music -- what the composer used for inspiration, nothing technical about how he went about getting a religious / medieval tone or mood to certain pieces, if he knew what scenes he was writing the music for when he composed it.  And absolutely no time lengths are given for the different tracks.<br /><br />In the liner notes, there is nothing but page after page of movie production credits from the head cheese right down to who wiped whose ass.  Nothing about the music. I have never seen liner notes for a soundtrack like that before in my life.  Insane.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's one of the best puzzle games I have ever played but it's to short I wanted to keep going! Please hurry and make the next part of the game!

B005EI86JU|5.0|Great book.  The author speaks in terminology you can understand and provides two or three options, including his reasoning and  recommendations for setting up  the Nikon D7000.  Takes time to allow the novice or advanced photographer to understand the nuances of this GREAT camera.  I uploaded the Kindle version, which is great for reference rather than lugging a heavy book around, however this is a MUST HAVE BOOK!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game and very challenging. Keeps you wanting more. Go ahead and  download. You wont be disappointed. Ready for updates!
B00C8985DU|5.0|Still fresh after all these years. Romantic but musically powerful.Some video material is very interesting. This CD confirms why I have been a Macca die-heart fan...for ever!
B00992CF6W|3.0|For starters I love this game. My cousin has it on her ipad for FREE. I would love to get this game for my kindle fire but it costs $7! 7 dollars is crazy for a game. I would buy it if it was something like $1.99 but it sadly isn't.
B009X00E18|5.0|Works exactly how I needed it to. Like the hands free that I can prop it up on the table and not have to hold it.

B001DHE9KG|5.0|I'll not give myself out as a music fundy, but I've seen serveral DVDs and have a number of her CDs. To me it is a pleasure to watch this young singer and I love her &#34;Young sort of naughty&#34; approach in some of her performances, Especially the Bath Festival on DGG where she performed with Elina Garanca, another of my New favorite singers. I use to attend Operas at the Chicago Opera House and has long ago decided not to go as a critic but rather to enjoy the performances of the singers!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I have heard a ton about this movie and was so excited to watch it. It was thrilling, informational, and funny until the end. What a masterpiece of a film. Truly deserving of the accolades that it was received.
1593974760|3.0|\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is the second audio book in Orson Scott Card's Ender series.  Like its predecessor, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" won both the Nebula and Hugo awards for science fiction, and went on to also win the Locus award.  All three awards are voted on by readers and are considered to be the most prestigious awards in the science fiction genre.<br /><br />\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" was, perhaps, not as exciting as the first audio book of the series, \\"Ender's Game\\", but it had a more thought-provoking story, and the characters had a little more depth.  That's not so surprising, Orson Scott Card himself explained that this was really the story he wanted to tell, and \\"Ender's Game\\" was more of an introduction.<br /><br />Just as with \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" was read by a full cast of narrators.  Once again, the names of the narrators were not mentioned anywhere in the recording.  The narrators all did a pretty good job and I think it shows extremely poor taste by Macmillan Audio not to mention their names.<br /><br />This audio book is available on Audible.com, and their listing gives the name of two of the narrators, David Birney and Stefan Rudnicki.  I also recognized Scott Brick as one of the readers.<br /><br />\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is another good piece of science fiction.  While not quite as exciting as \\"Ender's Game\\", this audio book has a deeper meaning.
B008Y1YKE4|2.0|I have grown weary of the hyper-action CGI movies of late. I'm in my mid-twenties and prone to enjoying a good kids movie, especially of the Christmas variety. This movie was too cynical to be enjoyable for the whole family, and wilder than anticipated. Sorry for being a Debby Downer, I plain didn't enjoy this highly-regarded film.
0545091020|5.0|Far in our own future there is a terrible calamity that leaves the entire world ravaged and decimated.  From the ashes of that destruction rose a grand and shining city called Panem, in what used to be North America.  Surrounding the city of Panem were thirteen outlying districts whose sole purpose was to work.  Year after year, the poor people of the districts worked so that the citizens of Panem could enjoy easy and lavish lifestyles.<br /><br />Eventually, the districts grew tired of that arrangement and rebelled but they were no match for the technology of Panem.  Armies of Peacekeepers from the city ravaged the first twelve districts leaving them even poorer and more bedraggled than before.  As an example to the others, District Thirteen was completely destroyed leaving nothing but a barren wasteland where it once stood.<br /><br />To make sure the remaining districts never forgot their place the rulers of Panem created the Hunger Games.  Once each year, one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen were chosen randomly from each district in a ceremony called the Reaping.  The twenty-four \\"contestants\\" were thrown together into a tremendous arena.  The miles-wide playing field contained all types of terrain: forest, grassland, lakes, and rivers.  The object of the games was to survive and to do so the players had to battle not only the elements but also each other, all for the amusement of the citizens of Panem who watched the event on television.<br /><br />This year marks the 74th annual Hunger Games and 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen of District 12 steps forward to take her little sister's place, in accordance with the rules of the game.  District 12 is the poorest of all the districts and has had only one champion in living memory so no one expects much, but Katniss is going to give them a show they will never forget.  Katniss learned survival at an early age when her father died and it was up to her to hunt and gather food for her family.  She will learn, however, that survival will mean more than just shooting straight with her bow and arrows; she will have to win over the ever-watching citizens of Panem.  Unfortunately, she will also learn that becoming a hero makes her a threat to the rulers of the Capital City, and they have a harsh way of dealing with threats.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins really did a nice job of creating a world and giving it a plausible history.  The idea of a game show where the contestants fight for their very lives reminded me a lot of Richard Bachman's The Running Man, where political prisoners were forced to battle it out on live television.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a very likeable heroine.  She found herself thrust into extreme circumstances, but she never gives up.  Her supporting cast are all believable characters as well.  Suzanne Collins does a good job of introducing the characters and making them behave in a realistic fashion and, more importantly, making the reader care about them.<br /><br />Carolyn McCormick did a decent job of narrating The Hunger Games.  I can't say that there was anything special about her narration but I don't have any complaints either.  Come to think of it, she reminds me a little of Carine Montbertrand who narrated Scott Westerfeld's Uglies audiobooks.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is the best audiobook I've read in a while.  Good story, good character development, it's all here.  Suzanne Collins proves to be a fairly inventive writer and I like her vision of a post-apocalyptic world.will learn, however, that survival will mean more than just shooting straight with her bow and arrows; she will have to win over the ever-watching citizens of Panem.

B005HSL626|1.0|I erased this after a couple of hours, because the game would quickly become unresponsive and 'lock up' my tablet, which could be only remedied with a restart
0545101417|5.0|Seventy-five years ago the great and majestic city of Panem created the Hunger Games.  Once a year, a boy and a girl would be randomly selected from each of the twelve outlying districts of the Capital City and forced to participate in the games, a brutal battle to the death, in which there could be only one victor.  The Hunger Games were created to serve two purposes: to entertain the lazy and bored citizens of the Capital and to remind the outer districts who was in charge.<br /><br />Last year, when Katniss Everdeen of District 12 stepped forward to take her younger sister's place, she considered it her own death warrant.  That was okay with Katniss, though; she would rather face certain death in the Games than watch her little sister go through it.  Katniss and her District 12 counterpart Peeta teamed up to help each other through the Games knowing full well that only one of them could survive.  When the pair found themselves to be the last two survivors they were more surprised than anyone.<br /><br />In defiance of the Games, Katniss and Peeta made a pact; this year there would be two champions, or there would be none at all.  They filled their mouths with poisonous berries and prepared to swallow.  Realizing that this was no bluff, the Game Master quickly declared that for the first time in history, the Hunger Games would have two champions.<br /><br />Katniss had no idea what her one small act of defiance would do.  The downtrodden peoples of the twelve districts found a spark of hope in her courage and small rebellions began to break out.  The rebellions spread through the districts like wildfire and soon the Capital City had its hands full maintaining order.  The President of Panem knew that the only way to squash the rebellion and restore order would be to get rid of its symbol, Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />The following year, for the 75th annual Hunger Games, the President changes the rules.  Instead of each district choosing its two tributes at random, he announces that they must choose tributes from among their former champions, knowing full well that Katniss and Peeta are the only two champions district 12 has had in the last twenty-five years.  The president knows that Katniss' chances of surviving against 23 other champions are almost non-existent.  What he doesn't know is just how organized the rebellion has become and just how far the malcontent has penetrated into the Capital City.<br /><br />Wow, I'm really getting into this series!  Catching Fire is the second audiobook in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games series and I can't wait to read the third and final audiobook, Mockingjay.<br /><br />The more I read about Katniss Everdeen, the more she reminds me of Tally Youngblood, the heroine of Scott Westerfeld's \\"Uglies\\" series.  Both girls found themselves thrust into extreme situations far beyond their control, and both rose to the challenge, becoming symbols for others to follow without even realizing it.  Suzanne Collins does a great job of creating characters that we, the readers, really care about.<br /><br />Carolyn McCormick is a good audiobook narrator.  Not great, but good.  Her pacing is good, not too fast and not too slow, but I would like to hear her read with a little more feeling.<br /><br />I'm glad I picked up The Hunger Games and Catching Fire from my library; this is the best story I've read in a while.

B00908DDZM|4.0|I bought this for 2 singles that I really enjoyed, and most of the songs are good but there is definitely a distinctive, and somewhat &#34;preachy&#34; message in many of the other songs. I understand his songs are a reflection of his story and history, but there are quite a few tracks on the CD that aren't similar in style/content to the ones I bought it for.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved it.<br />The author breaks it down for you in simple terms from his own dismissal of the afterlife before his experience to his current efforts to make things work.<br />He does not get into the mystical aspect of it, but does it as it is to be expected of a methodical scientist - from observation.<br />Read this book with an open mind and with the understanding that he is presenting facts that are, at least until now, impossible to refute.<br />Enjoy the book.
B005ZHB84U|5.0|This was a good representation of the movie, it followed what was actually recognizably used in the film and had the &#34;key songs&#34; I was looking for.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is the best texting app by far! You can send pictures, messages, and have group or single conversations!! It also lets you see when it's been sent, delivered, she received. I also love how it lets you see when the other person/people are typing. The only things I would change is,<br />Be able to send videos<br />Erase individual messages except for entire conversations.<br />But other than that, kik is my favorite app on my Kindle Fire. :D

B0053O89WY|5.0|We only had access through season 4, since unfortunately you still can't get Big Bang through amazon, hulu, or netflix (for free anyway), so I happily ordered this season and we were excited when it arrived so we could catch up on all the action from Season 5!
159463176X|4.0|This was a very good book.  I didn't care for it as much as his two previous books.  May been because there were so many characters to follow but I would recommend it as a good read.
B0081L391C|4.0|Yes, I know, I am one of the old-timers who used to watch the series 20 years ago. Therefore, I was pretty interested to see how they were going to connect this movies to the precursor. The creators definitely deviated drastically from the original, but this does not mean that we got a film that is undeserving of praise. On the contrary, I found myself watching a production that had me laughing out loud and causing others in the plane to look my way to check if I was unstable.<br /><br />When Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return to high school as undercover agents, things had changed from the times when they were students. Jonah used to be the nerd and Channing the stud, but the new environment has turned things on their head. This of course provides with plenty of opportunities to create hilarious situations, and those opportunities are not wasted. The fact that the two main actors can deliver comedy at the highest level definitely helps in this regard.<br /><br />Besides the fine humor, I thoroughly enjoyed Ice Cube's performance. He plays the role of supervisor of the undercover group and his over the top acting goes well with that role. But maybe one of the finest \\"jokes\\" in the movie has to do with the link to the old series. When Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise made their brief, but memorable, appearance, things went from good to pretty great.<br /><br />This is one funny comedy, and if you have watched the original series there is enough to keep you reminiscing about the old times.

0738737909|2.0|I ordered the kit because I was very excited about getting this beautiful deck of tarot cards. When it arrived, I had a feeling something would be \\"off\\" because it just seemed there was so much rush and hype. The packaging was nice - the box with the magnetic opening - but really I didn't need that, because ultimately I put my cards in a bag anyway. I wondered how much extra I was paying for packaging. I chose not to open the cards based on other reviews of them sticking and tearing a bit and I'm glad I didn't. Instead I paged through the book and I loved it - especially since it was in color - a big plus in my opinion. But therein was the disappointment - as I looked through the book with the pictures and card descriptions, there were publishing / assembly errors. Hasn't anyone else noticed this, or did I just get the only misprint? (Hard to believe - recheck your books.) The Major Arcana section was fine, and so was the section on the Minor Arcana. However, when I turned to the section on the court cards only one court card page existed (I don't remember which one because I returned the kit).  The rest of the section was a REPEAT of the Pentacles Minor Arcana cards! I chose to not even open the deck after that. I probably could have enjoyed the cards without the book but I find it is always helpful to understand the author's interpretation. I won't repurchase it. Amazon makes it ultra easy to return items and this kit was shipped back the next day and I was refunded. I'll continue to look for another deck. The pictures of the cards were incredible at least in the book - but I do agree with some reviewers... nothing really new here when it comes to a RW interpretation. I like my CM Gateway to the Divine Tarot and my Shadowscapes Tarot decks for their alternative interpretations to my  Waite deck.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Let's get this out of the way, I really like this album; maybe even love it. My issue with it (if you can call it that) is it's way too much Jerry Cantrell (Boggy Depot and Degradation Trip flavoring) than the AIC we've all come to love.<br /><br />By now, you've got me wrong. I straight up love Jerry's solo stuff and I know he's running the show now in AIC, so why wouldn't it sound more like his solo stuff. However, BGWTB had that AIC's sound that people have cut their teeth on. I'm not sure what changed (and frankly, why should I care), but if you didn't like Jerry's solo stuff, but loved AIC, I think you're going to be disappointed with this outing. Off the top of my head, there are maybe 3 songs that have the AIC sound, the rest are all fit for a Jerry solo album.<br /><br />So you're probably thinking why on earth I should care; great music is great music, right? Right, agreed, but Jerry brought Duvall into this band, not to just sing Layne's part in concerts, but to contribute musically and lyrically to the future on AIC. I thought BGWTB was an excellent start and that this album would hit the ground running making Duvall's presence even more known. Not the case on this album, in fact Duvall's writing credit on this album (I'll be the first to admit I don't have a clue how album credits are given outside the obvious ready their name on the sleeve) I think are on one song; Phantom Limb, and the whole damn band contributed to that.<br /><br />It shows on the album as Jerry has taken 95% of the lyrics. I think the times when Duvall sings without Jerry on this album can be counted on one hand. Why even bring him in? What's his purpose? I don't know. Does my rambling have a point? I don't know. I do know if you want to legitimize someone's role in this type of situation, you go balls out. His role is so small on this album, he kind of seems like just a shill.<br /><br />I don't want his role to be like that. BGWTB was a really solid AIC album with Duvall holding his own. They have every right to sounds however they want, but Duvall barely has a role on this album. If the album was changing because Duvall's creative influence was being felt, that'd be fine with me. I just don't think that's the case, I think we got an AIC album where Jerry did the entire bit, and so what we got was another Jerry Cantrell solo album.<br /><br />Ultimately, that's fine by me. I love Doggy Depot and Degradation Trip...
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|This is actually a really great album.  It's a great mix of groove and rock.  I highly recommend checking it out.

0385344228|5.0|Although I've seen this book on the New York Times bestseller list, I didn't become interested in reading Defending Jacob until my book club chose it for our monthly read. I already felt, by the title, this book would play with my emotions and I wasn't wrong! Defending Jacob was a complete page-turner that left me conflicted down to the last line of the book.<br /><br />Incredibly well written, this is a haunting story that is both thought provoking and emotionally disturbing. It raises the questions that most parents are not prepared to answer, let alone think about: What would you do if your child was accused of murdering another child? Also, who do you blame when you are too busy to see what is right in front of you the whole time? Author William Landay explores in great detail and with extreme sensitivity what happens to a family and community when a stellar citizen's son is accused of murdering his classmate.<br /><br />The story opens with a grand jury inquiry and Andy Barber is on the witness stand. It is unclear in the beginning, what are the exact circumstances of the proceedings, but what is clearly being implied is the prosecution has no case. The author then reverts back twelve months prior to the grand jury proceedings. He allows the readers to glimpse the relationships between the Barber family and the community that would ultimately turn their backs upon them in their greatest time of need.<br /><br />When Jacob Barber, the son of longtime Assistant District Attorney Andy Barber is accused of murdering his classmate, Jacob parents are in disbelief. As the evidence mounts against Jacob, his mother Laurie starts to question whether her son could actually be a murderer, while Andy is unwavering in his belief that Jacob is innocent. Throughout the trial, Laurie sits by herself because she is alienated from her friends, yet like most of her friends, she begins to believe Jacob is guilty she keeps her conflicted feelings to herself. It's not until Andy is forced to reveal some hidden secrets about his past that Laurie is unable to suppress her feelings. Laurie feels betrayed that Andy never told her his darkest secrets. Andy continues to believe the past has nothing to do with Jacob's innocence.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is a truly suspenseful story that makes you love, hate and hopefully come to understand that as parents we sometimes make choices to save our children, when in fact we are actually hurting them. I absolutely love this book, and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a well-written, great book.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams make a great father-daughter pairing in this story of baseball and family.  JT is lackluster as ever, but do you expect anything different?
B00BCX2F66|4.0|I didnt give it five stars for the following reasons...<br /><br />1) The red faux suede can get dirty easily, and I haven't found a way to get it clean thoroughly.<br />2) If you do drop your phone, ( I'm not usually a clumsy person, however it happened for the first time since I got this phone), The front cover can open as its dropping and if it lands screen side down there is nothing to prevent the screen of the phone.<br /><br />Super sleek, professional looking case. It isn't too bulky and keeps the phone looking thin. It is built well and works well when flipping over to use as a stand for music or videos. I don't have a problem with my case coming off of my phone like some others have experienced.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game has been fun Intel i beat it in a few more day's so i will play Intel i beat it<br />and tell my friend's about this game Intel then
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|The game might have had some potential but it has no need nor business in knowing my location.<br />If you don't want to perceived as a purveyor of spyware,  don't publish apps that ask for more perms than are needed.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|the game is fun. I do wish pearl's were a bit easier to get though. all in all a fun little game to pass time.
B00555X8OA|5.0|it will change the way you see things in your life. You can't simply miss on that opportunity to improve the way you take decisions
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's a fun game, it has loading issues,and in-game issues. It's pricey on upgrading and evolving the creatures. I always been a fan of dinosaurs and fun trying to build a cool Jurassic park. Coins are somewhat easy to collect, Dion bucks are little harder to come by. Unless spending real money.which I haven't or intend to. Would give a 5 star rating, but due to minor issues a 4 star is suitable
B00915G6WQ|4.0|Not proud of it, but we love this series.  Some seasons are better than others.  This is better than some, while not as good as the best.  Still, since it is the next to last season--it is a must.
B00BS3EMNY|3.0|I was sorely disappointed by Caro Emerald's second album.  While I was hoping to get more of the modern 40's style music that was present on her first album, this one takes a dramatic leap into the future with 50's and 60's style music, though not necessarily in a good way.  They've tried to make it more poppy rather than keeping to the roots of the style, and they're trying way too hard to do so.  I found a few songs on here that I do like, such as &#34;One Day&#34;, but songs like &#34;Coming Back As a Man&#34;, which I found to be almost offensive with it's lyrics (what are you really trying to say with this song, Caro?), and &#34;Pack Up the Louie&#34; are a far cry from the chill sounds of the first album.  If you are looking for something completely different with this Caro Emerald album then you won't be disappointed, but if you're looking for a similar style to &#34;Deleted Scenes From the Cutting Room Floor,&#34; then it's best to look elsewhere.
0425263916|4.0|I feel like Silvia is giving us just enough to keep us going. Mention of spanking, but no spanking.  We find out Gideon killed a man but we don't get any play by play of the killing.  Day tells us later after the fact, but it would have been nice to hear Nathan threaten Gideon with the pictures.  It's like here is this shell of a story, and details could give it excitement, but she doesn't want to put in the effort and time to write in detail.<br /><br />I will admit that this second book is some better then Bared to You and Entwined With You, but not by a lot. There were incidents in this story which moved the story along but the incidents weren't told as they happened and with an edge. It was more so explained by other people. I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall when Trey and Cary worked out their differences. She did a great job writing about Eva and Brett's first encounter after 4 years, and Gideon's reaction to seeing them together. The scene evoked feelings and I hope going forward into the fourth book that she takes the time to write exciting scenes play by play, and not through a character retelling what happened.<br /><br />Definitely read it especially if you have read the first.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|fast paced fun. addictive game. levels seem a bit short for the amount of ads but they go fast. worth playing again and again.

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I have enjoyed a number of Nicholas Sparks' books, especially Safe Haven, but this one really didn't turn me on. It was a bit of a predictable reunion of teenage sweethearts where the flame had not been extinguished over 20 years and a lot of pretty unnecessarily lengthy padding about what had happened over that time.<br /><br />Dawson Cole was an abused kid from the wrong side of the track who became friends with Amanda Collier, a rich and pretty girl. Of course they fall in love but the relationship was broken by pressure from Amanda's dominating mother. Dawson fled his abusive home and moves in with an Tuck who runs a local auto repair business. Even then his dreadful criminal family still keep him under their thumb and force him to pay them most of his earnings.<br /><br />Despite an unnecessary spell in jail Dawson picks himself up and becomes a successful rigger on an offshore oil rig. Amanda goes off to College, marries well and has several children but is devastated when one of her daughters dies at a very early age from an inoperable brain cancer. This puts huge strains on her marriage and she takes solace by befriending Dawson's old mentor Tuck. Dawson and Amanda meet again when Tuck dies and his solicitor tells them that needs to see them about his estate.<br /><br />The meeting of the former sweethearts was well written but the amount of background about their lives and their families was a bit over the top. The plot, especially where it concerned Dawson's family and their continued hatred of him was hardly believable as were the supernatural aspects which popped up throughout the story.<br /><br />All in all it was an OK book but certainly not one of Sparks' best.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a great crime drama with an unexpected ending.  I highly recommend it.  It was highly  recommended to me and it exceeded my expectations.  I look forward to reading other Landay books.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|So much better than the one before. This movie kept the children content. They laughed, talked and sat still. This is definitely a movie for children.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|very clever but far too complicated for  most of us -- especially us older ones: I found it very difficult to understand.
B005ES1DW2|4.0|My son is 8 years old and he is very tall. Also he has  big feet which is kids size 6 or 6.5. For kids crocs the biggest size of youth is 4 or 5. So i have to buy his crocs from men's shoes. His feet are growing so fast, so I want to buy little bigger than his size. It was way more bigger than I expected. However, the quality of this crocs is much softer and more comfortable than classic one. If it was fitted perfectly, I will give 5 stars.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It was easier to see the play on the computer but I will get used to it on my Kindle!
B000YENUI6|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />Noticing that this film was from David Cronenberg and also had Viggo Mortensen in a prominent role, I sat down and said to myself, \\"Well, I hope this is as well-done and gripping as Cronenberg's [[ASIN:B001R2NPRA A History of Violence]].\\" But EASTERN PROMISES is even better. . .<br /><br />This film is intelligently plotted, intelligently played, and does not rely upon gore, ultra-violence, or other cheap sensationalism. It keeps its audience spellbound with believable characters, immediate realism, surprises, and other vital ingredients. On the down side, like many \\"thrillers,\\" it also has an anti-hero who sometimes appears almost superhumanly tough and crafty; unlike many films, however, it makes clear that he has definite limits. There are also some small loose ends that are not too glaring.<br /><br />I recommend EASTERN PROMISES without reservation to anyone who generally likes this sort of thing.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I want to be able to use OfficeSuite Professional 7 but not sure how to go about it yet.

B005DD7H50|5.0|Limitless was a provocative, intelligent entertaining movie! It challenged me to think about my own limitless possibilities which are inherently mine  as well as the limitless possibilities that belong to everyone.  What is it that slows down that connection between where one stands and where one could uniquely be.  Excellent movie makers from writers, director, producers, actors were superb!

B00CFA222M|4.0|This movie will not win any awards. But it is a perfectly fun movie. I admire the CGI, the story line, and the overall tone it has as a movie. Is it the best? Again no it is not. But its a great adaptation of the story of Jack & The Beanstalk.<br /><br />Jack The Giant Slayer stars Nicholas Hoult (Beast in X-Men First Class) as Jack. He is a young farm boy who, while trying to sell a horse, is abruptly put into a situation with a lovely princess played by Elanor Tomlinson. Now, be mindful it is not until after these course of events that Jack is given a mysterious bag of beans by a monk, and therefore begins a movie that is not only engrossing as it is funny, but the actors do one heck of a job bringing Jack the Giant Slayer to life.<br /><br />Ewan Mcgregor plays Elmont; his acting helped this movie a lot. We have Stanley Tucci as Lord Roderick (there has to be a bad guy in the midst). Also we have Ian Mcshane(played Blackbeard in Pirates of the Caribbean 4) as King Brahmwell. As I previously  said, the acting in Jack The Giant Slayer is really good.<br /><br />I enjoyed and had a good time with this movie. Bryan Singer is one really good director,(notably with the first two X-Men movies) and while this is not a highlight in his career or a A+ movie, Jack the Giant Slayer should not be ignored. My final rating is:<br />  3.5 Stars

0316023744|4.0|Anthony Beevor's The Second World War is the only book on World War II I have read that covers the complete war from beginning to end. He covers all the major theatres of the war including China, Pacific, Burma, Europe and Africa.  This is very detailed, yet Beevor manages to keep the narrative moving.  Beever just doesn't cover the strategic side of the war, but also in graphic detail how much the war cost in human lives.  He graphically describes the war crimes of the Japanese, Soviets, and Germans during the war.  Beevor also does a very good job of decribing the major players of the war on all sides.<br /><br />Any World War II history buff should try to read a complete history of the war.  Beevor's should be highly recommended.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Flynn has an undeniable ability to bait her audience in the first two pages of a book. She spends the rest of the novel reeling you in, and giving the line slack, then reeling you back in, and giving you slack over and over until she has caught you. You emerge from the engulfing mystery like a fish out of water - gasping for air, completely surprised, and greeted by the devilish grin of an author that knows exactly how to hook you, reel you in and devour you entirely.

B0067EKYS6|5.0|I've seen Baz Lurhmann's The Great Gatsby five times (so far). The sets, costumes and cars are brilliant; the pace is dizzying; the excess is intoxicating; and the overall visual thrill is exhilarating. This film has moved me emotionally in ways that amaze me. It fills me with hope and it makes me sad. At times, it brought me to tears.<br /><br />The hope comes from Lurhmann's portrayal of Gatsby's vision: Gatsby sees himself as a son of God, who has unique purpose in this life, despite being born into poverty, and he's determined to live that purpose and his life to the fullest. Gatsby shoots for the stars and lands among them knowing nothing can stop him, aside from himself.<br /><br />The sadness comes from that fact that Gatsby does destroy himself. He shifts his eyes away from growing fully into being the person he is destined to be and allows his eyes to become intoxicated with Daisy Buchanan. He then becomes obsessed with having the one thing in life he cannot possess: Daisy. And this is the beginning of the end for Gatsby. I also resonated with the great sadness of Daisy when she lamented the loss of all of the precious, beautiful things in life that fade away so quickly and never return, like youth and love.<br /><br />I've never been a great Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but he shines brilliantly through an amazing portrayal of Gatsby. He's the perfect Jay Gatsby. I can't imagine any other contemporary actor playing this role so well. And in my mind, Robert Redford's Gatsby fades to gray against DiCaprio's Gatsby. I believe DiCaprio's Gatsby will become the gold standard. All past and future portrayals of Jay Gatsby will be compared to DiCaprio's--and they'll all come up short.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was also amazing. In particular, Tobey Maguire, who has the weight of the movie on his shoulders as Nick Carraway, is really magnificent in portraying the innocence, vulnerability and honesty of his character.<br /><br />If it were up to me Gatsby would sweep every awards ceremony. I can't wait for the DVD release! This is THE masterpiece of 2013.p every awards ceremony. I can't wait for the DVD release! This is THE masterpiece of 2013.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can also, now that the Realms update is out, play on servers with other people around the world! This is a great app and I think 7.00$ is cheap for an app this good! New updates make this game greater and greater all the time!
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|Love it. So many different rooms for go to, things to do. I'm always watching for new Dr. Panda games this gets A+ from me and I've only tried two rooms. My nephew is gonna love this one. When I visit he greets me than asks &quot;Tanta, Did you bring your Kindle?&quot; He loves Dr. Panda games most out of all the pre-school apps I have. I can't wait to show him this game. Thank you Tribeplay for your awesome Apps job well done!!!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Jcole did more then I expected on this album!!! I love it!! From the beats to the lyrics he has the best album this year!!
B00D8RYV52|3.0|I have all the Dr. Panda games for my nephew. I've been waiting for some to be geared more towards boys although girls will love them too. The Garage game lacks something I was thinking it was more like a car repair shop. The options are a bit boring. Most other games have other rooms or option with the room. I'd like to see car lift to look under car, change tire with tool, fill tire with air, oil change, wash window with squeegee, fix headlight, fix a dent, put away tools away etc...... Game gets an okay from me but not a wow. Handyman is way better. I don't think he will play this as long as he does other Dr. P games. He likes games with more options &amp; interaction. This particular game could use some improvements. Like I said its ok not great.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|Not impressed at all! I have come to expect so much more from Mr. west! The beats are loud and ok, but not feeling them to much! He has about 2 songs on the whole album, thats not saying much because he only dropped 10 tracks!! smh
1452110581|5.0|I'm a sucker for cat books, but I'm pretty good and limiting myself from buying the bazillions of cat books in the world.  Invest in this one.  It's witty, it's dry, it's well written.  It makes sense to anyone who owns a cat.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|If you want to enjoy the happiness of being alive, or to cry for a lost love, or simply to enjoy the gipsy style of the Gipsy Kings they are simply SUPER. I got a cassette from them about two decades ago, when I still lived in Peru. When I moved to the USA my cassette stayed at home. So from time to time I enjoyed visiting www.youtube.com and listened to some of their songs. One day I wonder WHY! Why not getting a CD that I could play in the car. Call me crazy but I have been enjoying the same CD every morning when going to work, like charging my batteries; and the same story when driving back home, as re-charging my batteries again. The percussion is amazing, listening to the guitar is just a masterpiece in your ears, rhythm, strength, tenderness, .... it is amazing how many different and opposite emotions their music can convey.
B009CYCF5I|5.0|The best from her, as usual. She continues with realness and originality, in her lyrics and the music she creates
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The graphics are great and very accurate to the characters in the movie. There are many fun games to play like the one where you fight piranas. Over all this is a fun village building game that is good for almost all ages.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started reading the book after having seen Season 1 on TV.....book is really great and but long....can wait to start the second one.
B001MM28JG|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Clean humor and family friendly. I haven't watched that many SciFi movies but still find this satire very funny. The cast is great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great puzzle game that encourages exploration and logical process. So.betimes it is a little difficult to tell Exactly what the item in your inventory is but that is a minor complaint.
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|A good strategy game that's like checkers with a twist. The goal is to knock a certain amount of your opponents pieces off the board. The default is 6 (with the beginning tutor level being 1), but  in the settings this amount can be changed (1-6). Unlike checkers, where you move one piece at a time, with this game you can move your pieces in groups of three and in every direction. There are three modes of play: 1)by levels where there are several different levels with around 10 different stages to each, 2)free play where, like the first mode you play against the computer with three different board set-ups to choose from, 3)duel player, which is the same as the previous choice only you can play against a friend on the same device.<br /><br />I was questioning myself as to rate this 3 or 4 stars for the following reasons: went from a 3 star for what a simple game of checkers would be to a 4 star for the twist and added challenge of the game. I could (or some would say should in this case) change it back to 3 for the invasive type of permissions for this type of game. As others have said there is no reason why this game nets network and gps information.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I got hooked on the HBO Series . But I know the books are much better than TV. I met a young lady on an airplane and she commented that so much is left out of the TV version, that I should read the books. I am nearly half way through and am looking forward to finishing so that I can get the next installment.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Sebold shares a horrible event that is life changing. While reading her story, one realizes what a common, sickening crime this is, that effects ones' psyche forever. Alice Sebold is an incredible writer which makes me read her books, even when the topics are uncomfortable.  Reading is one thing, to see her story on film is too much for me to enjoy (it took me a couple of days to get over seeing &#34; The Lovely Bones&#34; in cinema form!)<br />I would not want to see this book made into a movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Never doubt the effect a story like this can have on an adolescent mind. God bless the men like Ender in this world.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have been using Accuweather for several years now starting n my computer and now on all my smart devices.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app is fun and I have a great time playing it. :) :)<br />my cousins love it to we played it together
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book for the hunger games had a good ending.  It was not as I expected because of that twist at the end.  Good reading material for those who were following the Hunger Games story.
B0089XH38M|1.0|This app always wants to update itself, but the update installation process always fails. What's the point of an antivirus program that can't keep up with emerging threats?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked! have the electronic version made reading easier.  I did not have to carry the physical books around, which also means I do not have to worry about space for books.  The sequel was a great story too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game iw worth your time and money. it is a must play and is very fun. i will play. this game more then proaboy shoild
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kiddo and I love to team up and look for clues together on this game.  Lots of challenges.  Lots of fun!
B0085YOD1A|3.0|This app is nice but it just provides the basic info I could get under the settings.  Would be nice if it gave you a warning when the battery was low
B001NLKT60|5.0|I love the way Larrson  describes everything in such detail.  This book grabs you from the start and does not let go until the end, however this is not for the weak of heart.
1452110581|3.0|Author knows cats but the comments lacked cleverness and originality. An earnest try would be a good description of the writing.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|This is not a bad app like some reviews i saw. It works and you can go to the main page of youtube, you just got to understand the app. Which is not too hard.
0440422973|1.0|A very nerve wracking, annoying book....I chose not to finish reading it. A complete waste, don't bother with this one!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This was the first Miyazaki movie I ever saw. Enchanting and beautiful, I am proud to have this in my movie collection.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My cousin recommended this game for me. When I bought it, I loved it!! The only thing is, You have to buy the &quot;full version&quot; before you can do somebody. Otherwise, it is awesome.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I purchased this movie for my kids who are 3 and 7 and they love it, as do my wife and I.  They watch this movie over and over again.  The animation is fantastic, there is action, friendship, drama,  and compassion.  Great lessons about other living creatures and respecting the balance between people and nature.  I have bought a lot of other Hayao Miyazaki features such as Castle in the sky, my neighbor Totoro, the borrowers, and Kiki's delivery service, all of which are #1 picks in my family.  I highly suggest, if you have children of any age, to check out these Hayao Miyazaki and Disney collaboration films.  They are hidden gems.  The great thing about them being less known is we have a unique movie library for my kid's friends to be amazed at, although I do hope more people can enjoy them I kind of like being the only people on the block with these movies.  Usually they got borrowed for one time, and after that the borrower's buy them themselves.  These movies are all keepers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game!  It has a good level of difficulty, not too easy or too hard, and it forces you to think out of the box!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As with all Reichs' tales, the twist and turns are a-plenty and intriguing.  You know it's good when you really cannot figure out the conclusion and need the explanation of the denouement to put all the pieces together.  Wow!  Another scorcher!<br /><br />Kate
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was a great read. It teaches us that adults and children need to be loved. The ending was great. It broke my heart the way the children were treated by the nuns and priests. In the love does conquer all.
B009B53LA6|5.0|Couldn't wait till No doubt brought out music again. And they nailed it. All the songs rocks.<br />Cant wait to see what they come out with next
B00785P2QC|5.0|Lots of fun and keeps me entertained. I like how the city still operates after you ...leave the app. Good progression of goals
B0090CMMIC|5.0|Heard Bones on the xm octane countdown. So I checked thee guys out Then for about a month I listened to all the other songs.<br />Then bought the album here. And its very good. I give it 5 stars..
B003L77GG0|4.0|After 9 great seasons I was super excited to see how the finished off Smallville and probably had too high of expectations. The story flow in Season 10 just seemed to be all over the place and the last episode wasn't the best season closure episode I have seen. Overall still worth buying for any Smallville fan!
B00AO686MY|5.0|Great classic and the video and sound are great on my Plasm and stereo sound system....if you love this classic and have a good HD TV and stereo... go for it
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|absolutely boring plot. Halfway decent special effects and visuals. Overall gigantic waste of time. If Disney does this to episode 7 we will all cry.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good to watch especially during the network summer reruns.  Originally we started season 1 on Netflex, then went to Amazon for Season 2.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series!  Real characters that can translate to any time or situation, but unique for this story!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and challenging game. its not so hard that you get stuck and cant move on. it really keeps you thinking. fun for lots of ages.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book was a huge page turner! I loved it , but the ending was so sad! I am totally going to read more of Jodi Picoults books!:)
0525958002|5.0|John Taylor has a very intelligent writing style, and is very honest about himself, his personal life, and his life on the road with Duran Duran.  An easy, enjoyable read.
B001RCD2DW|1.0|1000 HRS BURN IN, WHAT A JOKE, THEY SOUND THE SAME CRAPPY THAN THE VERY FIRST DAY, PLEASE, BUT ANY OF JBL AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE WITH AKG, I OWN 22 PAIRS AND THIS ONEAS ARE THE WORST AND MOST EXPENSIVEly these are my opinions, but I'm betting if you're a fan of the 7506, you'd probably form close to the same opinions as I did.<br /><br />UPDATE....  I HAD to come back and change the stars to five... Im burning in headphones and I can hear already improvement... sound is not as loud as my sony 7506 or audiotechnica 50s and it wont be, but this cans have a special sound that I cant describe... clear and u can sleep all night with them without problems or pain<br /><br />SO, NOW after 2 weeks i god Fiio E09k amplifier and the problem is still the headphones,(i lowered satars to 1) i do have to turn the volume up to 75% to get the same  sound  thet i get from my sony or audiotechnica 50s on volume at 25% only on amplifier..<br /><br />I guess people is over rating this because they haven not tried something else... for 260 dlls you get a huge headphones, they look and feel like cheap made in china stuff, and it does not matter how long you burn in this cans, they will never get bass like any of my other 5 pairs,,GUYS if you are truing to get this headphones to use with your phone, forget about it, you wont get almost no sound a all.... i do have to keep them, I dont want to pay 20% re-stocking fee..
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Good game when you're bored. However, you will always beat the game. My daughter and I enjoy playing this daily.
B00932A4XE|2.0|This was rather boring and predictable. I am so thankful I did not pay for it! I would not watch it again.
B004XZR63M|5.0|A good book with a lot of ideas and examples. Not for everyone but surely anyone wanting to better themselves will take something away from it.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I think the book was &#34;oversold&#34; to me.  If I had no pre-existing notions, I may have liked it better, but I had big expectations.
B00005RYKU|5.0|Saw this move when it came out years ago I loved it then and still feel the same about.  It had me on the edge of my seat more then once.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|The characters in this novel are beautifully drawn, difficult and unsettling, especially the manipulative young sister who turns childhood naivety and innocence on and off with light switch suddenness. Excellent read.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|when I grow up I want to be a barber so I downloaded this game so that I can start learning now I am only 13 but I know for sure that I want to a barber after I graduate college and get my degree
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Good plot, nice star cast and pretty entertaining overall. Tom Cruise gets a bad rep, but he has done a pretty good job playing Jack Reacher.
