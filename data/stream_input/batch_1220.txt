0451228731|5.0|I'm not too wordy when it comes to reviews.  So this will be short and sweet.  This was an excellent book; a \\"I can't put it down\\" sort of book.  The sequel is falling in that category as well.  A richly created world with an interesting concept to wrap a story around.

B005HPA2XI|4.0|Some initial words on the DVD content of the Limited Edition version:  If anyone is expecting a long \\"making of\\" documentary like the one included in the \\"Crack the Skye\\" package, you may be a little disappointed. Yes, it does include such a program, but it is very short compared to the previous release, clocking in at only a few minutes. Beyond that, a song by song commentary is also included, but it is only Brann Dailor sitting outside on a chair (presumably at night time), giving his thoughts on each track. No other band members appear in these segments. The music videos included are the \\"Black Tongue\\" clip, which was available online for some time and is essentially just the artist creating the album cover's wood statue/head. Also included is the totally hilarious \\"Deathbound\\" video, which is a grand violent spoof of the old children's show, \\"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\\". Oddly, again Brann is the only one who appears, and only in the very beginning before the puppet mayhem begins. The remaining video is billed as a \\"psychedelic visualizer\\", and it is only for one track, the song \\"Stargasm\\". For some reason I believed that this trippy screen production would accompany the whole album, much like the website version, but sadly it does not. That wraps it up. No official video to \\"Curl of the Burl\\" or anything else. I don't want to express that anything here was not well done, but there is just not enough content compared to the previous release.  As for the album itself, at first take the songs are shorter and perhaps less developed than those on \\"Crack the Skye\\", but the brutal intricate beauty is well intact. Brann's drumming is truly epic in scope. The full sonic assault is occasionally melded once again with spaced slower movements, making the album as a whole flow as a timeless voyage.  Overall, the album is not as urgent or edged as \\"Blood Mountain\\" or earlier releases, but certainly a work of art from masters of the craft. A great addition to the Mastodon bodyof work.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I was a self confessed couch potato but Jillian's workout has changed that forever.  So I recently had the life analyzing 40th birthday and I got a little money.  Part of the analysis was seeing changes in my body I wasn't too fond of.  I decided to put a little of the cash towards yet another exercise DVD.  Oh yes folks I have bought many over the years but they get used once or twice and left to gather dust.  This DVD is different!  You can do this!  I love this workout so much.  I can feel muscles I haven't felt for years but I'm still able to carry on with my every day life without being crippled by sore muscles.  As a mother that is very important to me.  The best part of the DVD though is Jillian's tough but kind encouragement.  \\"you're getting strong\\" \\"you're as light as a feather\\" etc.  It seems a bit silly even writing that but it somehow has gotten into my had and now I really do believe, yes I CAN do it!!  If you've been sitting on the fence about buying this, I say go for it, it will be the best $20 you ever spent.

B005HGZV6U|1.0|A few years ago I bought the DVD of this wonderful piece of art. \\"Interstella 5555\\" indeed is a masterpiece in animation combined with excellent House Music of the brilliant French band \\"Daft Punk\\".  Sadly, the picture quality of the DVD never came up to the high standard of the the music and sound - the picture was always very blurry, the colours weren't that bright at all...  So I was very excited when I read about the release of the Blu-ray version of this audio-visual experience...  I live in Germany and so I was able to get my hands on the Blu-ray a few weeks earlier than the American customers - and I strongly doubt that the USA will get a different transfer of this film.  When I started the movie, my excitement turned into disbelief and then into anger - I had to press \\"stop\\" on my RC.   I had to look at the label of the disc in order to be absolutely sure that I hadn't taken a DVD out of the Blu-ray amaray box by mistake.  The picture quality sadly hasn't improved at all - on the contrary: Now you are able to see an ugly judder effect and lots of aliasing added to the known blur and softness issues of the DVD picture.  If you are expecting HD quality, then under no circumstances buy this disgrace of a \\"Blu-ray disc\\":  Your old DVD copy is even better than this sad excuse of HD material!  It's really a shame of an upgrade...  If this wasn't enough: Please be prepared for some loud \\"searching noises\\" coming from your BD drive/player at the beginning of each movie chapter.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|I'm reviewing the books not the format (Kindle edition worked just fine). I like detail as much as the next person but things seemed to drag on forever, veering into \\"Dallas/Thornbirds\\" and \\"Family Tree\\" territory. You didn't want to skip so as not to miss any important plot point (don't worry).  There are no heroes in this book, maybe a reflection of real life but it makes it impossible to root for anyone in particular, by the middle of book two I could care less who won. The dwarf at least has a sense of humor, which keeps his dialogue interesting, everyone else is dreary.  I enjoyed the story as a whole, but it was like a small slab of excellent cheese spread over an enormous cracker. Should have been 2 books at most (now there's a fifth). HBO's done a fine job of condensing it for the TV series, pacing is just right. Never thought I'd say this about any book, WATCH THE TV SERIES!!

B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I am a reader of all books. I was looking for a self journey, but had been unable to find one written well, but this book was written so well.  The journey you with this man is unlike anything I have read!  There are some areas I was not as interested but wanted to keep going until the end. My mother was a addict for 10yrs and I never understood all she went through...Clarification was given and a new respect for my mother because of it!! A MUST READ!!
0553582038|2.0|Sooooo disappointed.  I loved the first three books and kept waiting for this one to capture my interest.  Sounds like the newest addition just adds to the overwritten, told-not-shown, barely-edited spiral this awesome series has devolved into.  'Tis a pity.
0679441018|3.0|Although Anne's excellent writing style comes shining through in this book, I found the story line more than a little bit hard to swallow.  I think I would have liked this one better if there had been more involvement with some of the other vampire's.  The majority of the dialogue is between Memnoch and Lestat with only a little bit of interaction with the others.  I was actually sad to see Roger's character leave the story as he gives it some spice. For those who haven't read the story yet, I won't go into details, but I found some of the interactions between Dora and Lestat to be quite disguisting, and those who have read the book will know what I mean.  That could have been left out of it completely!  All in all, I left feeling a little confused about the point of the whole thing.  The note from Memnoch returning Lestat's eye, confused me.  Was the note really from Memnoch, and what was the purpose?  Just to get the veil into the world so that people would believe in God again and make Memnochs job easier?  Don't know if it was or not. All in all, it is a decent read, and I will recommend it, just not one of my favorites.
0061438294|5.0|Joe Navarro's book is like putting Sherlock Holmes's observation skills into your brain. All these things the body is wired to do to tell us how it feels and thinks and for so long I've been ignoring it. The things it reveals in just the first chapters:<br />Leg shaking - how the lower body is the most truthful part of the body, shows excitement, distrust, discomfort, and when you have to pee!<br />Mouth actions - why we bite our lip and what it shows<br /><br />This book is very dense with tactical advice. Interspersed are stories from the field where these observations made the difference.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable read and very useful. Doesn't come off as dry or too scientific, though there are numerous entries in the bibliography to papers and books backing up the authors' statements.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this for poker players too. Some tells can't be hidden!

B005H5H3LW|5.0|[[ASIN:B005H5H3LW Space Battleship Yamato [2010, Japan][Uncut Slipcover Edition] DVD]]<br /><br />  Well here goes Nothing. What can be said about watching an old favorite of mine be turned into a live action movie. The Plot is solid with minor changes between the show from the 70's to modern age. Granted some folks may not like reading there movie as it comes with sub-titles but I have no issues or problems with that. The special effects help to accent the movie. The character acting is also solid and doesn't feel forced. Granted no Emmy nominee's or anything but still a good sci-fi romp. If I have one complete about the whole thing was the over use of the Wave Motion Gun. But hey you can't have everything. All in all though it is worth the money.

0385534639|4.0|I rushed out and bought this book the day it was released.  I had been seeing and hearing a lot of Buzz surrounding The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and was anxious to see what it was all about.  While clearly the author can write great imagery and has a very unique plot to unfold here, I think the story is lacking where it matters most- in the relationships between the different characters.  Honestly, much of the time I couldn't keep the different people straight (especially when they were referred to by their last names) When I did want to read more about specific person or relationship, there just wasn't any more to read.  I can't go into detail without wrecking the plot, but I would have liked to have seen more between Poppet and Bailey for one)<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me- The mysterious night circus that appears without warning and happens to be run by dueling magicians is a fantastic idea and interesting story, it just fell a little flat for me because I didn't get to know the characters as much as I wanted to.  I kept thinking that this book would make a great movie someday and this may be one of the rare exceptions where the movie ends up better than the book.<br /><br />Overall, I am glad I read it, and even stayed up late to see how it all ended... I just think an amazing idea fell a little flat because the character's personalities were not all that memorable. If I could rate a book 3.5 stars, I would- but I cannot bring myself to rate it lower than a 4 because it was so unique.

They loved to act out and sing along with the story each time, even though they already know what is going to happen to Pete the Cat.

The tune is simple yet catchy.

B004X2M3SI|3.0|Season 5 with Matt Smith is by far the best of the new Dr. Season 6 has its moments. However, I am amazed by the acclaims this new series has rousted. Season 5 & 6 are the only seasons I would even approach suggesting are worth purchasing. What they cost on Amazon instant video is far cheaper and you can pick out the better shows which are few and far between at times. Still, I can honestly pull out the vintage Dr. and watch, then turn around and find these so called 'New' shows are just rehacked from the old Dr. Even in Season 6, the writers do try to weave a constant story stream through the whole season so maybe I should not expect fresh stories since that seems to be all they can come up with for re-inventing Dr. Who. Dr. Who was an interesting icon of science fiction for British TV and the BBC, yet the bottom line was dollar signs and they hacked the Dr. up just like their horrific Cybermen renditions. Where are the supposed rules and regulations regarding these epic horror feasts that run amok on the air?     Dr. Who is still an icon in the science fiction field and will still be around for a long, long time.  The New Dr. however has no endurance and a really beefed up intro theme song adds little appeal, when these New Dr.s will only be remembered for the time they are run. The best advice here is save your money and borrow from the friend who did not read reviews or, at least, make sure its really, really cheap. $2 an episode is better but for some episodes that is way too much. Dr. Who did save people and planets once upon a time and people need heroes just not villified heroes. You can't have it both ways without having chaos and chaos is what you have here.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is one of those bands that I did not immediately get into, because I was not a fan of Nirvana, and I thought this was just that -- another version of Nirvana , BOY WAS I WRONG.  Without going into this review too deep, this album is possibly their best one since \\"In your Honor\\".  Although I think they wrote two of their best songs on the last album \\"Pretender, and Let it Die\\".  This album features tons of great tracks without any filler.  If they decided to, they could release every track on this album as a single, and have a hit.  Some of my favorites from this album are: Bridge Burning, Dear Rosemary, and I should have known.  The producer of this album (Butch Vig) stated that \\"I should Have known\\" was a tribute to the late Kurt Cobain, but I never made the connection myself.  Anyways any true Rock fan will enjoy this album.  Even someone as old as me.

0375759069|3.0|Instead of my usual practice of measuring a novel (or a restaurant, for that matter) by its own pretensions, I have given Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White three stars because I have been tempted to compare it to the work of the author's contemporary and friend, Charles Dickens.  If you read reviews by other readers, on amazon and elsewhere, you will find that many of them complain of The Woman in White (TWIW) being boring, too wordy, \\"two hundred pages too long\\".  I never found the book boring, but I did find the first 550 of its 664 pages tedious; there's a difference.  TWIW has exactly as many words/pages as is necessary to work out the author's plan -- but he does try one's patience for the duration.  The plot of TWIW is intricate and definitely over-the-top, but never confusing.  The characters, while frequently also over-the-top, are carefully drawn and psychologically realistic; at least one of them is quite humorous -- if you don't mind the fact that he is distasteful.  The problem many have with this book is that they never read far enough into it to appreciate either plot or characterization -- they are exhausted by the flowery prose of the author.  Now granted, much of that flowery language is the result of the author's narrative device: the characters tell the story in their own words, and anyone familiar with expressive practice during most of the 19th century knows that More is considered Better.  Just think of the difference in length between a Mozart symphony and one by Brahms or Schumann.  Did the latter two composers have more to say musically than Mozart did?  Emphatically no; the expectations of audiences demanded longer expression.  Think only of the disappointment Lincoln's audience felt after hearing his address at Gettysburg: to them, it was shockingly brief.  In that address, Lincoln used just as many words as necessary to express his ideas.  Wilkie Collins, in TWIW, used just as many words as necessary to tell his story.  As to my comparing Wilkie Collins to Dickens: having read TWIW once, I will not need to read it again.  I now know the plot, and, while some of the characterization is delicious, I probably will not want to wade through those 664 pages (in the edition I've used) again.  In the case of any of Dickens' novels, I return to most of them about once a decade.  I always remember the story quite well, but oh, those magnificent sentences.  I can get repeated enjoyment from the way Dickens expresses ideas or describes scenes or people, no matter how familiar the plot.  If you have been discouraged by my comments from attempting TWIW, I'm sorry.  It is worth reading for the careful way the author has each character reveal him/herself.  Read it while you're young and apt to be Romantic [sic].  The typical story of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl in the end, coupled with Victorian suspense and evil machinations, is probably too familiar to this senior citizen.  In its day, offered as a serial, it was a smash hit: women in danger, devilish men controlling their lives, intrepid hero to the rescue... Rather insignificant in the century after 9/11, but a wonderful visit to 19th.

034552554X|5.0|I have been fascinated by the Victorian era for as long as I can remember. As best I can recall, it probably started when I began reading 19th century British novels back in fifth or sixth grade. The culture as described by Dickens and Eliot and so on was rich in detail and full of curious customs that were intriguing. Much, much later, as a graduate student, I made the 19th century British novel one of my speciality areas.  When you mention the Victorian era, most people think of excess. Images of Victorian fashion with an excess of flounces, ruching, ruffles and so on come to mind. We think of the \\"gingerbread\\" trim on stately homes. Or perhaps images of Victorian interiors such as a parlour filled with intricately carved furniture and fireplace mantels, Oriental vases filled with peacock feathers, paisley shawls from India draped across pianos and tables, a heavily embellished crazy quilt of rich fabrics across the back of a sofa. Such images are, of course, drawn from the better known lives of the well-to-do portion of the population. Victorians loved, not excess, but detail in craftsmanship. They were intrigued by the designs of the various cultures the expanding British Empire encountered. Those who could afford to indulge in such pleasures did so. This same privileged class also greatly enjoyed entertainment that included, beyond the usual fondness for classic arts, games, mysteries of all sorts, and intrigue. There were various courting games and practices (often referred to as 'conceits') such as the Language of Fans, a type of flirting in which specific movements of a lady's fan advised a would be suitor of her inclinations, the Language of Gloves, gifts of R.E.G.A.R.D. rings and so on.  The Language of Fans and gloves and REGARD rings have vanished but a vestige of something called The Language Of Flowers remains with us today in the common knowledge that a gift of roses is intended to be symbolic of love. A charming little book, The Language Of Flowers,illustrated by the famous Kate Greenway is perhaps the best known of surviving books that purport to assign meanings to various flowers and plants. This symbolic system of communication was very popular in Victorian times and formed a well loved part of courtship. Ladies would delight in receiving and deciphering the messages contained in bouquets and nosegays. I've owned a copy of Greenway's book for many years and I once had a sideline creating silk floral arrangements for weddings using it's symbolism. I included a card with each arrangement to explain the wishes conveyed by the flowers. Naturally, when I read Pump Up Your Book was representing Vanessa Diffenbaugh's debut novel, The Language Of Flowers, I was eager to read it. My thanks to Pump Up Your Book and the publisher, Ballentine Books, for an advance reading copy.  Diffenbaugh does not disappoint. She grabs the reader with the first line: \\"For eight years, I dreamed of fire.\\" Stop; don't read any further. Fire is a powerful symbol in and of of itself. We know what it is, what it can do. The word alone is enough to start adrenalin flowing, isn't it? With that line, the reader enters the present day world of the principal character, Victoria Jones. It is Victoria's eighteenth birthday and she is about to be emancipated from the foster care system. The birthday greeting she is given by the other girls in the group home provides a vivid glimpse of the world Victoria is about to leave. It also causes the reader to wonder what it is about Victoria that warrents such behavior.  Victoria is not a character the reader instantly loves. She is not charming, beautiful, or especially talented. Victoria does not communicate well or relate well to others. She is angry and unpredictable. It is only through the alternating chapters that offer glimpses of Victoria's past that the reader gains a little understanding of the reasons for her behavior and feels more compassion for her. Near the end of the first chapter, Victoria does something that brings the light of hope into the darkness and draws the reader closer. About to head out into the world on her own, Victoria leaves a gift of a purple dahlia for each girl at the group home. She knows the girls won't understand her secret language but it's important to her to leave them a message of hope for their futures.  Victoria's own future is uncertain. The foster care system isn't set up to adequately prepare foster children for a life on their own. Although Victoria is allotted three months in a transitional home before being thrown entirely on her own, she doesn't receive the guidance or training she needs to make her own way. She ends up homeless, living in a public park until a local florist gives her a chance at employment and discovers her talent with flower arrangement.  Once Victoria used the language of flowers, learned from a foster mother, to express sentiments best left unspoken in the world of foster care. Sentiments like grief, anger and hate. This takes a turn around as she discovers in her florist work a gift for helping others by creating arrangements based on the language of flowers. Here again, hope asserts itself. The interactions with customers who need her special gift, a budding friendship with the florist, Renata, and a few others Renata introduces her to, cause Victoria to begin to have hope for herself.  When a trip to the floral market with Renata introduces Victoria to a young man (Grant) who seems to understand her secret language, Victoria's world expands further. This reader, who did not like Victoria at first, was carried along learning about the young woman as she considered her past, re-evaluated actions that had brought her to this point, and explored the new feelings awakened by the developing relationship with Grant. What does Victoria decide about what family means, second chances and the possibility of redemption? You need to read the novel yourself and find out first hand.  I know of at least onecritic who argued that the novel's ending was too sweet, too much light after so much darkness. However, we are too familiar with horror stories about the foster care system and while it definitely needs improvement, as the author can attest from her own experiences as a care giver, don't we need a little light in the darkness? Let us remember that the human spirit is capable of enduring much and still bringing forth it's best qualities. Or, as Diffenbach's site asserts: \\"Any one can grow into something beautiful.\\"  Vanessa Diffenbaugh, thank you for a good read! I send you a bouquet of Canterbury bells (gratitude), laurel (in recognition of your success), sage (good health and long life), Lupine (imagination) and forsythia (anticipation of your next novel).[[ASIN:034552554X The Language of Flowers: A Novel]]

076790382X|5.0|I'm not sure what other people expected, but this collection of humorous essays is top notch quick read material perfect for airport lounges, commuter rail, and other commitment-less venues. Written for an English Magazine upon his return to America after a twenty year absence, Bryson compares Yanks to Brits, skewers our foibles, and has some laugh out loud moments. I was not offended by the sarcastic tone, any more than I am offended by Sienfeld's observational humor. Written over  ten years ago, these pieces still bring a chuckle and are still fresh.i love the fact taht they are a collection of columns, and as such can help you pass a few moments but require no intellectual commitment.

B004EPZ07K|5.0|It's always hard to adapt a superhero character from comic book to movie. People may differ in opinion, but as for me I found this movie wonderful! I even preferred Ryan Reynold's Hal Jordan from the more serious comic character. I think he was fit for the role, he gave life, fun & wit to the character, and he presented adequately the inner personal turmoils of carrying the responsibility, although doing this in a fun way.<br />I liked also to special effects, having watched this movie at the theater in 3D. The plot was multi-thread. All in all a very good, fun movie which I enjoyed, being a comic book reader since my childhood. And yes, I would by the DVD when it gets released!
B005HPA2XI|4.0|Since Mastodon's critically acclaimed 2009 release, Crack the Skye, fans have been eagerly waiting for their latest album in production, The Hunter. This will be the band's second non-concept album. Although officially being released Sept. 27th in the U.S., the band released a visual album premiere a week early, hence this review. So let's get down to it.<br /><br />Does 'The Hunter' live up to all of the fan's hype? Like their previous albums one after another, does it raise the bar and push new limits in depth and diversity; further evolving their sound? Well, here's my personal opinion:<br /><br />I want to start off by saying that this album is the most unique of all Mastodon's previous works. Their music has once again evolved and changed. Well is this for the better or worse?<br /><br />While the album retains the band's heavy metal and sludge sound, it sounds slightly more commercial and mainstream. It seems the band is trying to push their boundaries and experiment with a new range of chorus and rifts being synthesized, but at the same time, aiming more for the radio or the general public for casual rock listeners. I can imagine this album drawing a much wider fan base because of the change in sound. Of course, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I feel like Mastodon has opened up a door which will allow them to further explore and evolve their music in the future.<br /><br />The Hunter gives the listener the power and adrenalin from Blood Mountain and it's predecessors, while once again refining and focusing the band's sound like Crack the Skye. The lyrics/vocals are maniacal yet hauntingly beautiful at times. The album starts off with \\"Black Tongue,\\" throwing us into a fast pace surge of metal, reminding us what Mastodon is all about; rocking hard. Followed by \\"Curl of the Burl,\\" probably consisting of the most recognizable chorus of all tracks throughout The Hunter.<br /><br />After those songs, I was completely thrown off guard. Blasteroid, Stargasm, and Octopus Has No Friends, almost have a western/metal/psychedelic touch; taking hold of your temporal lobe, launching you through space throughout the galaxies and undiscovered depths of darkness back down to earth. These feelings and sounds radiate throughout the entire album. Instead of a deep meaningful theme, The Hunter is spontaneous and random, and best of all, it works. After all of the unexpected but thrilling twists and turns, the album comes to a close with \\"The Sparrow,\\" the longest track on the album and probably the most delicate and refined; an ending filled with beauty and wonder.<br /><br />The Hunter is Mastodon's most collaborative album and it shows. It's also their first album where Brann Dailor (drummer/vocals) actually sings an entire song: \\"Creature Lives.\\" My one complaint is that Brent Hinds (lead guitarist/vocals) didn't sing enough of the choruses. His voice was 'back up' most of the time while the only song you can clearly and distinctly hear his voice is the title track. To me, his voice is the most unique in the band; giving the music flavor and variety. None the less, this album is no disappointment! I recommend this album to almost any heavy metal listener and I'm sure Mastodon fans will be pleased. I look forward to the official release Sept. 27th and I know this album will be blasting in my truck for months, hell, years to come.<br /><br />Key tracks: The Hunter, Dry Bone Valley, Creature Lives, The Sparrown/metal/psychedelic touch; taking hold of your temporal lobe, launching you through space throughout the galaxies and undiscovered depths of darkness back down to earth.

030726999X|1.0|This was the first book I purchased by this author and the first for my Kindle. As hard as I tried, I was unable to get into this book. For starters there were too many characters introduced in the first chapter(pronunciation of names was huge challenge)and I lost track. Still determined to read this highly recommended book, I continued to read and found myself going back to reread paragraphs. In the end I lost interest and was unable to finish the book (un-break my heart). Wish I could trade in for a more likeable book. Oh well, You win some and you loose some..

0385732554|4.0|The Giver  Jonas is a kid of the future, which is neither all \\"high-tech\\", or \\"full of pollution\\" like some might expect. The government has quite a way of protecting bad things from happening to the future. Thy took away color, music, weather, pain...and choices. In other words, they took the meaning of life away. Only one, soul person even has memories of these past goodnesses, which are passed down to one \\"reciever\\" after another. What does the reciever of memory become once he is replaced? He becomes \\"The Giver\\".  WARNING: spoilers follow!   Eventually, Jonas finds out that if he is released, the memories are transferred to the people. He finds out if he is washed away in the river to the land of elsewhere, he can give the people what is rightfully theirs to have.  Spoilers end here.  You might be wandering why I gave this book 4 stars. Well, I guess I should admit that it is a pretty heavy book. Now, I don't mean as in a tragedy. I mean, with all that the government takes away... it can sink your heart pretty deep. I, personally, am not one for heavy books. If it's too heavy, just make sure you read to the the end.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|I really debated on this set because of the price and almost opted for the experience edition. I am glad I didn't. As several have pointed out the marbles, coasters and scarf are silly and IMHO beneath a band such as Pink Floyd. Mine will probably never be opened. The fake ticket stub and backstage pass are worthless and a waste of money along with the silly \\"collector cards\\". It almost cheapens the whole experience of this box set. As another review pointed out all of these \\"extras\\" are piled in on top of the first 4 discs to the point you have to empty the box to get to them. I am guessing most buyers of this set may look at them once and then never touch them again other then to move them out of the way to get to the CDs/DVDs. They could have easily left them out and dropped the price and I would have never have missed them. It's really the thing that kept me from giving this one five stars.  All that being said once you get down to the discs this collection is fantastic. The Emersion edition has both of the first two discs but I think the real gem here is the Blu-Ray audio disc, especially if you the high end gear to play it on. The entire album comes to life on the Blu-Ray. You can hear Gilmour's hand move along the strings during guitar solos. The same with Waters' hands on the bass. Nick Mason's sticks hit the cymbals and you can hear the tick of the wood hitting metal. In Time you can close your eyes and point to each and every clock. If you didn't know better you would swear you were right there in the studio as the album was being recorded. Everything is just as it should be for this album. I have the 24K Gold CD that has been my DSOTM reference CD for years and the Blu-Ray version is even better.  The live sets are a great addition as well. Nice to get a proper version after all of the bad bootleg copies that have been floating around the internet for years.  I am looking forward to spending the next few days/weeks really exploring this set.

B005CM9DX6|4.0|So needless to say, I've been waiting for Opeth to take this direction, permanently, for years.  I like the death vox plenty and I love Opeth's heavy material just as much as anyone.  However, it seemed like a bit of a waste to not use a singing voice like the one Michael Akerfeldt has or to use his melodic capabilities on his guitar to craft every part of every song vs using so much album space on sweet metal riffs.  Akerfeldt always loved prog more than metal, he just wasn't man enough to admidt it until now.    However, they seemed to get so tickled and excited to ditch the metal thing that they forgot to put as much time into the song structures.  I know the feeling, you're just so excited about your new vintage guitar rig that everything sounds great and you feel like you can do no wrong.  There's genius in this album for sure, I just wish the genius was also in the arrangements rather than just the passages.  I can just picture the studio environment, everyone is excited in making the drums sound like 70's drums and fixing up old guitar pedals you wanted as a kid and figuring out what type of riff you should have the Jethro Tull like Flute solo over.  Meanwhile, there's a mess of riffs and sections that need to get arranged into complete songs and next thing you know, you have 3 weeks to write the rest of the album so you lay down scratch ideas and say that's good enough for Jazz.    Heritage is what came out.  Opeth is known to write albums 100% in the studio with little time, little budget and lots of technical issues.  However, that worked when they were making another Opeth Record, there was formula to their madness before and Akerfeldt could write Metal Album Of The Year material in his sleep after nearly 15 years of doing just that.  With this, they haven't developed their new method with their new sounds.  No matter, I like Heritage in this new type of \\"rawness\\" in the fact that you can detract so much of the feeling the band had while making it.  There's soul in this record but its the spirit OF the music rather than a spirit IN the music if there ever was such a comparison.  All in all, it's a top 4 Opeth release for me.  I just had higher hopes for it considering I think this is the direction the band should go in and the sound I appreciate the most.
B005EHNMWM|4.0|From the opening sounds of Art of Almost Wilco is announcing that once again you've come into their world, their sound and it's quite a place for your ears to find themselves.  The six very talented musicians that form the band have produced a work that is challenging, comforting, gritty, smooth as silk, introspective and pure pop all within the same 56 minutes.  Items of note include I Might's retro keyboards, the quirky super catchy chorus of Dawned on Me, Tweedy's existential statement on dying that begins the furious fadeout of Born Alone, full on Rock 'n' Roll complete with handclaps in Standing O and Dylan's shadow over verses on the very fine One Sunday Morning which closes the album out with 12 minutes of a rolling little guitar line, flourished out with piano, chimes and perfect percussion to create exactly the mood of a Sunday morning where eternal questions are dealt with.  Each Wilco project is unique, this one maybe more so than the last two, so comparing to what came before is a moot point but with Fall coming on this is a welcome companion to the season's change.<br />The four bonus tracks have some interest but I can understand their not being included on the full cd.  I Love My Label, a worthy B Side and Nick Lowe cover, is an homage to Wilco starting their own label, the other three including an instrumental and alternate version of one of the album tracks are solid but with the near perfect sequencing of the album they would not have added to a work that is one of year's best releases.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Perhaps calling this latest work from unofficial Prog scene director Steven Wilson \\"Album of the Year\\" is perhaps fanboyism.  However, it's clear that this album received more time and attention from it's creator in order to produce a complete work, a complete and cohesive album that still transcends genere's and musical styles.  Insurgentes, Steven Wilson's first solo record and the work that precedes Grace For Drowning, had some incredible songs on it. But Insurgentes seemed to have more \\"mood\\" or noise pieces that after 2.5 dozen listens tend to get skipped by even the most avid Steven Wilson listener. Grace For Drowning however, provides so much more content, so many more complete songs that are beautifully arranged and sequenced on the album that you can easily pass the one hour and 22 min listening to the whole work from top to bottom without really getting bored. Each song is interesting and complete here.  I will agree with the first reviewer that posted here in that Raider II, the 24 min long epic track on Disc 2 ends up being a little bit of an outlier for this record.  It's actually quite a fantastic piece of work and a tremendous adaptation of the early King Crimson 'sound' from the late 60's and early 70's.  However, it's long for the sake of being long and perhaps a 12 min long edit of the song would sit better with the listener as what is recorded.  After the song seems to end for the 3rd time and you look at the time remaining finding another 10 min, it's extremely tempting to skip to the next track.    But Raider II's over indulgence is just like of those long, gentle speedbumps that are so easy to drive over on an otherwise beautifully paved stretch of musical highway.  That highway also goes through some sweet mountains. In the fall with the leaves looking cool. During a super awesome sunset. In the Magic Schoolbus but with that weird, evil horned and hooded M. Knight Shyamalan-type character that Wilson has all those pictures of on the website sitting in the back making you uncomfortable and making your hair stand on end when you go through tunnels on that same highway.  Mainly because you're afraid he's going to light that flare of his and make things look scary.    If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the video for the song \\"Track One\\" on youtube.   I'll also add that Wilson suggests in some recent interviews that Grace For Drowning is the \\"sister\\" album to Opeth's recent release \\"Heritage\\"  Having listened extensively to both, GFD starkly different from Opeth's release  but much of the inspiration for both albums come from the great progressive works from the early 70's and I can agree with that.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Machine Head seems to have one thing in mind on the new album:  Heavy Metal.  Each track avoids sounding influenced by current trends in metal and achieves a timeless quality due to the unapologetic focus on creating a true heavy metal album that will stand the test of time.  While some people will call this a masterpiece and others will say it's only average, very few will argue that it's not good.  I was skeptical about Unto the Locust hearing Robb Flynn give interviews about how he brushed  up on his classical guitar and took vocal lessons.  Here we go, I thought, some pretentious attempt at being \\"serious,\\" that will just come off sounding forced and generic.  I'm ecstatic to have been proven wrong by the Machine Head powerhouse.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is another very, very solid MH album to add to the roster.  Robb has become excellent at injecting melody into his songs without losing one bit of the heaviness.  His classical influences are given a decidedly metal stamp, seen most clearly on the track Be Still and Know.  The classic-metal guitars are blended perfectly with a traditional MH groove for a track that is reminiscent of the Empires album, but with a thrashier edge than that release and even The Blackening.  Every song on `Locust' just screams metal, from the opener, I Am Hell, and its blistering speed that recalls A Nation on Fire, to the crushing Pearls Before Swine, which again uses melody to perfection in creating powerful metal.<br /><br />I could nitpick some of Robb's clean singing, which isn't always as great as people around him probably tell him, or a chorus here and there that sounds a bit radio-catchy, but it would be exactly that...nitpicking.  No, Darkness Within, the \\"slow\\" track doesn't quite live up to Descend the Shades of Night, but it's still awesome, with some nice acoustic work that builds up into a semi-heavy song, with a very heavy middle.  And songs like the pre-released Locust and the excellent Be Still and Know bring to mind Through the Ashes of Empires more than any other MH album, at least in my opinion.  Yes, this one is a success for a hardworking band that seems to have finally found an identity after years of hard touring and soul searching.  Fans of this band should not be disappointed.the Ashes of Empires more than any other MH album, at least in my opinion.

B004K583KA|5.0|This is a marvellous boxed set.  It's marvellous on two accounts.  Firstly,  by listening to a such a collection you realise Bach's enormous achievement: one is continually surprised and delighted by unique strokes of genius - the fecundity of Bach's imagination and invention is truly staggering.  Secondly, there is Rilling's achievement in producing an integral collection of such consistency.  Naturally, with its production over a span of many years, some evolution in style is evident, most notably in the solo singing, but this does not detract from the quality. Rilling's interpretations are sympathetic and are  always sensitive to the words, so important in the Bach cantatas.  There are many brilliant performances of the obligato instrumental parts and in the continuo.  Last but not least, the chorus sound is consistently good:  various choruses have been used, but in  none of them have I detected that unpleasant squeezed-up, dry-as-dust  singing that that seems to be strangely fashionable; at the same  time, Rilling's choral forces are fully able to tackle fleet or coloratura passages at least on a par with the best.    This is an Amazon bargain not to be missed and could seriously enrich your musical life!

A new set of twin boys (12 weeks old) and a 3yr old girl. I don't think I ever would have know just how important the food I was feeding them was until I read this book.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I haven't seen The Lion King since it came out on VHS and my boys are about the right age now to enjoy it.  Watching it on Blu-ray was absolutely amazing.  The colors were so vibrant, the characters amazing and everything in general about the movie was so much more than I remembered.  Its hard to believe this movie is 17 years old!  My husband couldn't believe all the songs from the movie as all of them were (are) big Disney hits.<br /><br />What I love about the Blu-ray/DVD combos is that I can keep the Blu-ray version in my house and the DVD in the car.  This version also has some great Bonus Features and something called \\"Disney Second Screen.\\"  I had never heard of Disney Second Screen before, but it is awesome!  You just choose that as the version movie you are watching and you open an app on your Laptop or iPad.  Then as you watch the movie on your television you can interact with scenes on your laptop or iPad.  There are animation screens, games and other fun activities you can do while you are watching the movie - it is great for kids for ways for them to interact and it is great for adults who want more from the movie they have seen a million times.<br /><br />Whether you have seen \\"The Lion King\\" before or are new to it, seeing this remake is worth it.  The quality is amazing and I love that I can now share it with my kids.

A bit round about but can be done. I agree it would be nice to be able to do this directly rather than the step around currently needed.

Maybe all, I gather. We tend to jump and assign it the #4 meaning, and in this case it is only part of the plot, not the most important.<br /><br />This novel is consistent with all the other Reacher affairs (again, used in many ways). After having read \\"Son of Sam\\" and loved it, I was comfortable with a younger Reacher. Then I remembered that in The Enemy Lee Child takes us back to Reacher's days in the military police.

I really liked this one!<br /><br />The Affair sets a different tone which could even be seen as \\"lighter\\". The characters are well developed, and I wonder how Reacher manages to always get involved with the only \\"spectacular\\" woman in most of the novels in this series.<br /><br />I also liked 61 Hours, even though some readers complained that it \\"moved along slowly with lots of description and very little action...and there really was no ending\\" (just one example), I thought that it showed a mature and thoughtful Reacher.  Then came Worth Dying For, which was somewhat far fetched... BUT, back to the current topic, The Affair, where the train becomes a metaphor of Reacher's life -- always running, almost always on schedule, seldom leaving the rails.<br /><br />I am not happy that every time he moves away and forward (or backward), but I guess that is what this series is about, and Reacher cannot stay in one place with only one woman (although it almost happened once, in Tripwire).

B005HPA2XI|5.0|Ah, Mastodon. It would appear these guys can do no wrong. They continue to evolve while retaining their signature sound. On \\"The Hunter\\", the Atlanta quartet seamlessly mesh the old with the new, with a few surprises thrown in for good measure. The end result is absolutely stellar. From chaotic intensity (opener \\"Black Tongue\\" is sure to become a fan favorite) to otherworldly beauty (\\"The Sparrow\\" must be heard to be believed), \\"The Hunter\\" is everything I'd hoped it would be...and then some! Kudos to Mastodon for their music and passion.

B005PKLKBI|5.0|I'm still shocked regarding the ending and the implications it's going to have for Walt and Skyler. The tension in this episode slowly builds to become the most shocking and terrifying conclusion yet in any Breaking Bad episode. Although it seems to tie off some loose ends from \\"Salud\\", \\"Crawl Space\\" throws further down into the dark world that Walt has inadvertently (or directly?) caused everyone he knows and loves to be cast into alongside himself. Cranston deserves to get the Emmy for this episode alone. Breaking Bad caught up to its usual pace in the last episode and now it's cruising at break-neck speed with no place to stop and no need to.

B004LWZW4C|3.0|I'm not a geek fan of the series in that I've never read the comics, however I have enjoyed the prior films including the last one, Origins: Wolverine, where Mr. Jackman was just complete rage after the murder of his wife. This one is a whole new cast of actors, the next generation if you will, that I did not know previously from other films. I don't know if this is perhaps the first of a trio of prequels to come. There are a few cool scenes such as the ending w/ the warships and the blackbird. I did not like the brief cutesy cameos, that Tinkerbell mutant, or the cheesy matching uniforms though. I wish this series didn't have to be kid friendly pg-13. I think they could be a lot better if allowed an R rating and perhaps even an unrated version when released to DVD/BD. It was just ok for me, didn't live up to the crazy hype. I wouldn't buy it, a good rental though.....Now please feel free to bash my review and resort to some type of personal attack. Thanks :)
0553807919|5.0|I have a 1 year old daughter and was hoping this book would help me communicate with her and build her mental resiliency.  It does that and so much more.  WIthout getting lost in needless academic discussions of learning and (bio)psychology, the book provides very concrete insights and recommendations for improving a child's ability to be mentally strong and healthy, and cope with stress.  It also provides extensive example dialogues and scenarios involving a parent and his/her child; these dialogues are very realistic and display the various author-introduced techniques in action.  Frankly, I've already begun to implement these with my 1 y/o and I'm seeing results.  I think this is the best strength of the book - you are provided a brief background discussion of the topic (e.g., dealing with latent memories), and then an example scenario and actual dialogue of  a parent using that insight to solve his/her child's issue.  Immensely practical.
0749942010|4.0|I love mysteries & this one doesn't disappoint. I ended up picking this one for my bookclub book. There was a point in the book where it got a little slow, but then it picks up & I couldn't put it down. I'm hoping that Rosamund Lupton comes out with more books. I really like her writing style.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I FREAKING LOVE THIS BOOK! There's just no other way to say it. I started reading it and all I wanted to do was read this book without stopping but of course I had to go to work, so not doable LOL! However, I finished it in like three sittings and as soon as I was done with it, I started reading it all over AGAIN! That's how much I loved it. I'm in the process of re-reading it and I'm taking it slower savoring every second. This book has me smiling all day as it pops into my mind and maks me sigh and daydream. It's simply wonderful. Perfectly written with it's wonderfully flawed characters and messy relationships. I can't wait to read this writer's other books which I had also inadvertently already purchased because they had caught my attention but now that I have read this one I'm really looking forward to reading; once I get over my love affair with this one that is. Get this book and read it, you will love it.

B004RE29PO|3.0|Use EXTREME caution when buying either \\"Alien\\" or \\"Aliens\\" on blu-ray in the single disc formats. There are virtually NO BONUS FEATURES included. All of the great bonuses are only available in the big Blu-Ray box set that has all 4 Alien films (which sucks because most people dont want or need Alien 3 or 4). I waited until \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" were available individually and after purchasing them, was disappointed to learn that the bonus stuff wasnt included. It really sucks. I guess its a good way to force people to cash out for the box set. I wish the companies wouldnt do that kind of stuff.

B004X5SCY4|5.0|Beth Hart is one of the most powerful female blues/rock singers to emerge since Janis Joplin and she recently recorded a new album in collaboration with guitar maestro Joe Bonamassa entitled 'Don't Explain'. After crossing paths out on tour and previously working together making 'No Love On The Street' for Bonamassa's recent `Dust Bowl' album, it soon became apparent to Bonamassa that his guitar would provide the perfect foil for Hart's vocals. Almost inevitably Don't Explain was recorded earlier this year at Village Recorders, West Los Angeles in California, drafting in Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley to produce & mix an album full of soul covers interpreted as only Hart & Bonamassa could, giving new blood to classic songs!<br /><br />'Don't Explain' showcases Beth Hart baring her heart and soul on vocals & Joe Bonamassa playing guitar as only he can, delivering classic songs from a golden bygone era that belonged to divas like Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin and Etta James coupled with more contemporary numbers worthy of inclusion. Backing band is the same Bonamassa successfully assembled for his album 'The Ballad of John Henry' featuring Anton Fig (drums & percussion), Blondie Chaplin (guitar) & Carmine Rojas (bass) with Arlan Scheirbaum joining them on keyboards.<br /><br />'Don't Explain' immediately has Hart pleading for mercy, probably just as Ray Charles would have imagined when he first wrote 'Sinner's Prayer', and the thought invoking Tom Waits song 'Chocolate Jesus' is so sassy, it would not sound out of place sung in a Parisian nightclub! Next cue piano for a flawless rendition of Melody Gardot's sultry jazz ballad 'Your Heart Is As Black As Night' and add slow blues guitar to make it complete. The Bill Withers song 'For My Friend' is transformed into the ball breaking blues/rock anthem that perhaps it was always meant to be, and portrays just what an incredibly versatile voice Hart really has. The next two remarkable covers of 'Don't Explain', made famous by Billie Holiday and 'I'd Rather Go Blind' immortalized by Etta James, sum up exactly why this album was conceived in the first place. Another Etta song, 'Something's Got A Hold On Me' also gets a worthwhile makeover here followed by one of the most passionate and sincere versions of Brook Benton's 'I'll Take Care Of You' that you will ever hear. A superb remake of 'Well, Well' provides the one duet on this album with Joe & Beth taking over Delaney & Bonnie Bramlett's vocals. Somehow this recording wouldn't be complete without the soulful sound of Aretha Franklin, and that is accomplished on the final track with a rework of her fabulous 'Ain't No Way', that is given all the reverence it truly deserves!<br /><br />'Don't Explain' is where sensational singer Beth Hart and gifted guitarist Joe Bonamassa world's collide to pay homage to some of the greatest artists and most beautiful music ever made... simply breathtaking!d Rather Go Blind' immortalized by Etta James, sum up exactly why this album was conceived in the first place.

B005HPA2XI|5.0|This is by far my favorite Mastodon album. I think many people detest to much, and criticize things they don't need to, just because it's not a carbon copy of a past album. Why do you want to keep hearing the same ole record over and over, or want the band to make it. Get real, it's called progression, and Mastodon have done just that. I wasn't actually that fond of some of the old stuff because of Brent Hinds gruff type vocals, i love the clean singing much better. This album has it all, the songs are dynamic, versatile, stylish, progressive, trippy, and just overall creative as hell. Every single song is singable, and has some of the most catchy choruses, and riffs you will dare to hear. Here is my usual run down track by track. This music should be an inspiration to all. It certainly brings back the good ole days of raw, inspired rock that started the metal/rock movement in the first place. Mastodon aren't the easiest band in the world to describe, but i'll do my best. :P  1. Black Tongue-Actually starts with an old school Testament type riff, then goes into a dark ride of complex music and lyrics. Mastodons music is hard to describe, especially since they are hardcore Acid users lol. But i try. Also a very good middle break, with soothing, ghostly vocals, in which they chant \\"you've run out of lies\\". The solo is awesome, no they aren't dream theater so don't expect six string sweeps, or anything close. It's just amazingly melodic, and dark, and goes right up and over with anything Metallica, CAN'T do anymore. (wink)  2. Curl Of The Burl-No I have no idea what that means, i do know he says, \\"I killed a man, cause he killed my dog\\", so maybe it was a poodle ha. This song is a replica of old Steve Miller band, and  vocals sounds EXACTLY like him. Very catchy tune. A bit more on the happy trip side. Groovy. :)  3. Blasteroid- Probably the only song i don't really care for a whole lot, has a bit of screaming and is very hard to get into or understand. Blasteroid however was a video game from the 80's, similar to Asteroids. From what i remember it was in arcades only. leave it to these guys to make a track about that!! I'm the 36, and close to their age, so i know these things.  4. Stargasm- Do i need to say more, stars collide, oceans ride, we have a Stargasm. Starts out heavy, vocals are a bit buried in the mix. Beautiful entry and chorus though. Get drunk or high and listen to this one, and sail to the universe.  5. Octopus Has No Friends- I guess he squeezes them to death. Very complex drum work, as in most of the tracks. Great chorus. What the song is about? Perhaps smothering people and making them not like you. Or an obvious acid trip? Not sure, great song though.  6. All The Heavy Lifting- Great solid stomping Sabbath type track. Very good guitar work as well. The chorus sounds familiar, but is none the less massive. \\"Just close your eyes, and pretend that everythings fine, just close your eyes, i'll tell you when\\". Premise? Getting someone else high?  7. The Hunter- Absolutely brilliant, and beautiful in a very 70's classical rock fashion. Slow ballad, dark and dreary. Right up there with Stairway to Heaven. Relax, have a beer, and float away.  8. Dry Bone Valley- Very ELP type beginning with guitar sounds, then goes off into a classic sounding Mastodon song. Very Sabbath like, they do a good job at emulating Ozzy. But make it sound modern just the same. Also has a very Alice In Chains feel to it (Facelift).  9. Thickening- A strange jazzy groove laden type song. About making good thick spaghetti sauce!! No, not really. Has an Opeth mixed with Gothic overtones, mixed with some Metallica Black Album sounding vocals. Good tune.  10. Creature Lives- Mastodon are definitely Steve Miller fans, this song starts with the sonic keyboard storm that Jet Airliner did in 1975. Then it's just basically a silly song about a creature who no one likes, but he likes himself. Sounds like The Beatles, very much so. HA  11. Spectrelight- One of the heaviest old school sounding tracks. Sounds like something off of the first few albums. Very Metallica driven, and thrashier than any of the others.  12. Bedazzled Fingernails- A very trippy strange Tool meets Type O Negative song. With a more upbeat tempo. Not the best track, but still very solid.  13. The Sparrow-Love Pink Floyd? Well this song should be dedicated to them, if you didn't know it, you'd think it was Pink Floyd. Enough Said. Classic.  So i think in some aspect this should get it for album of the year, their are lots of contenders, but few with the creative, heart and soul passion Mastodon have. They have really evolved, and lets hope this is a taste of the future. Because i love what i'm hearing. Other good albums thus far.  Anthrax-Worship Music  Machine Head-Unto The Locust  Opeth-Heritage  Dream Theater-A Dramatic Turn of Events  Chickenfoot III

B00008GKEG|5.0|Being a big Beatles fan, I had to have my own copy of the Beatles Anthology.  It's a must for any die hard Beatles fan.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|When I first became a serious fan of Incubus, it was just as they released their Morning View album. It was a huge success and it happened to be a pretty radical departure from the band's funky hard rock sound.  My favorite thing about the band at that point is that there 3 major albums (SCIENCE, Make Yourself, Morning View) sounded very different from one another, yet had enough in common to make a great mix if you put everything on shuffle. Incubus was a fresh, unique alternative rock band. While I love the songs from their following albums (A Crow Left Of The Murder, Light Grenades) I felt like they became slightly stagnant or predictable.  Mike's guitar sound in particular sounded the same on every track, where he toyed with different sounds on the earlier albums. After a long break, Incubus returns and they seem to have their creative batteries recharged. I decided to soak this album in for a couple of months so that I could give it a proper review.<br /><br />This album is another departure for the group, and it leans much more towards the alternative than it does the rock. In fact you won't find anything heavy on here, this is a very mellow album. I already knew that going into it because Brandon Boyd had mentioned it on the group's website, which is why I wasn't shrugging in disbelief like everybody else asking, \\"Where's the heavy stuff?\\" I miss the sounds of SCIENCE and Make Yourself, I really do, but I also love Incubus' mellow side and if this allows them to evolve further, then more power to them. The album's first single, Adolescents, is definitely the least shocking song on here. It's a good tune, but it almost seems like it would've been a B-side from one of their last few albums.  It doesn't grab you instantly, but it was probably released as a single to warm people up to the mellow sound and not frighten them off with something radically different. I think my favorite song on the album is the title track, which starts the album. Brandon's vocals are incredible, the music is uplifting, and I can really relate to the lyrics. The next track is called Promises, Promises and it might throw you off at first with its upbeat piano melody meshed with guitar. The vocal melody is quite catchy though, and it'll be stuck in your head before you know it.  Friends And Lovers is a cool tune. As the title suggests, it's a romantic tune, and in a way I think it wouldn't have been out of place as one of the more experimental songs from Morning View.  Thieves is another strong track, if nothing else just for being catchy, althrough I feel the lyrics are a bit preachy for Incubus.  Isadore is a good song and it meshes well with the rest of the album, but it's slightly forgettable. Even now I'm trying to remember how it goes, but I know I liked it. The Original is one that I personally love. I'm not sure that it will grab many other people, but I always turn up the volume when it comes on, there's just something catchy and soothing about it at the same time. Defiance is simply Brandon's voice and an acoustic guitar.  This song is interesting because it sounds like an acoustic version of a heavier song.  I can easily imagine this being a rocker like Nowhere Fast or Clean, and it's possible it was intended to come out that way, but this acoustic version allows the flow of the album to keep going.  Then we have In The Company Of Wolves, which is easily the most interesting song on the album, at least for a lot of people.  The song has 2 parts.  There's the first half which sounds very Pink Floyd inspired, not just because of the chord changes but it's also easy to imagine Roger Waters singing it.  Then the second half breaks into Brandon whispering over a reggae bass line.  It's very cool!  Switchblade is kind of a head-scratcher. It's not because it sounds so weird, because it could pass for something from Light Grenades, but it's just so much cookier and energetic compared to the rest of the album.  The album ends with Tomorrow's Food, and I initially dubbed this the weakest song on my first listen.  However, it's grown on me quite a bit and now I like it more than 2 or 3 other songs on here.  It's kind of spacey and weird, but with a happy tone.  If you have the deluxe version of this album, you get 3 live songs; Surface To Air, Dig, and Pardon Me.  Pardon Me sounds like most of the live versions we've heard, but Dig is interesting because they mixed it up a bit and made it much quieter.  Surface To Air is a B-side from the recording sessions for this album.  It sounds very good, in fact it frustrates me that the studio version wasn't included on here because I bet it would be one of the stronger tracks.<br /><br />So there you have it!  You don't have to like Incubus' new style, but if you check this album out, just keep in mind that it is in fact a new style...which is something that I think drew most of us to this band in the first place.initially dubbed this the weakest song on my first listen.

B005C5A6C0|3.0|I stumbled upon Machine Head and their debut album back in 1994 when i was 19, Burn My Eyes was a breath of fresh air to metal. Many people criticized Machine Head for being a \\"Pantera Clone\\" back then, but i found little to no simularities. I've watched Machine Head progress and fall by the way side with a little bit of trendiness, but i always stick by them no matter what. I think the two lesser albums in their catalog were Supercharger and The More Things Change(which neither sucked, just not their strongest efforts). Upon going back to their metal roots back in 2003 with Through The Ashes Of Empires i became excited once again, and really got back into listening to the band. Then with the release of The Blackening, i thought, wow, MH just keep getting better. Even though i was actually a bigger fan of Through The Ashes, mainly because of the shorter songs, and slick production. So what do i think of Unto The Locust? Well, it has its great, good, bad and worse qualities. First off this is not a slagging review, just a simple honest one from my perspective and what i hear. I'll give my opinion then go song by song. To start off the album is far to short, and i was hoping the bonus tracks would be MH original unreleased tracks. The Sentinel (Judas Priest Cover) is less than stellar and i would have liked to see MH do a Sabbath song instead, if any. I have no idea who's original song Witch Hunt is, but it's pretty bad. Another bad thing is the fade outs, why? I really don't get this, although it's not a major deal, just a strange one. Also Flynn must be going through some hard times, because this is an extremely depressing album. But Rob is a personal kind of guy, and i like that. Just don't listen to it for inspiration if your in a morose state of mind.  The songs are very well arranged, and the production is top notch. Flynns voice is in the best shape ever (he stated in an interview he had taken vocal lessons and some clasical guitar as well), which is why he also hits some highs you've never heard him do before. Many tracks also follow a Death Metal vibe, yes you heard right, DM. This is definately the \\"heaviest\\" album MH has ever done, does that mean it's the best? Well, not exactly. Here's a quick run down of each song track by track. With pros and cons.  1. I Am Hell (Sonata In C#)-(The Good) A very interesting latin chant at the beginning which is \\"suppose\\" to mean Blood Saint, although when you translate it, it has various meanings. Not sure on that one. After going into one of the most crushingly heavy riffs MH has ever done, Rob Flynn gives his best Death Metal overdubbs, with great scary results. Although the lyrics leave something to be desired, it's a great song. It runs off into a chaotic fast paced thrash song, with a good chorus by Flynn, and his strong vocal dynamics. Also as with most tracks on the ablum there is the integration of the Amon Amarth single string double picking style. Also a very Slayer(esct) solo from Demmel. Very melodic though. (The Bad) Fade out at the end. Odd.  2. Be Still And Know- (The Good) Very Iron Maidenish beginning, strong drumming from McClain(as usual). Pretty interesting main riff, pretty decent chorus, has a lot of single string notes during the chorus, which may prove difficult to play live. Good solos, although some are direct blue prints of Asthetics Of Hate. (The Bad) Not really that catchy, although it does rock. Not a classic.  3. Locust-(The Good) Strongest track on the album, the one that peaked everyones curiousity about the whole album and set the bar high. Best slide melody riff i think i've ever heard, no kidding. Excellent dark vibe, and the whole song just works as a whole. This definitely has the best solo break, which starts out soft then goes off into a pummeling groove laden direction. Nothing bad to say about this track. Although i thought McClains drum sound was a little better on the \\"advanced mix\\" of the track from back in July. Oh well.  4. This Is TheEnd- (The Good) Right next to Locust as being the best track. Starts off acoustically then shoots into \\"mild\\" blast beats from McClain, yes you heard correctly. The beginning soft parts almost sound like something Metallica would have done in the 80's. The chorus is stellar from Flynn, and some of the best vocals on the album. You would swear at the starting riff of the song that you were listening to Amon Amarth, which is pretty cool in itself. So all in all just a great song. Nothing bad. Good solos as well.  5. The Darkness Within- (The Good) Shows off Robs Vocal Talent, melodic. (The Bad) Weakest track on the album, has a Coldplay vibe to it, just heavier (somewhat). And Rob has admitted to being a big fan of them. (The worst) Rob took the album before it's release and let Trivium hear it on their bus. They said THIS SONG was the best song Machine Head have every written. Enough said.  6. Pearls For Swine- (The Good) Just an overall good MH song. Starts out this time with an At The Gates type feel, then kicks into regular MH. I think the band have been listening to a lot of old school melodic death metal it seems, which is fine by me. No more Alterna Tracks!! Great Drumming from McClain, some of the best of his career, with cymbals and off time beats. Also speaking of the death metal vibe, the ending is just awesome, epsecially the ending riffs which are a definate tribute to Cannibal Corpse, who figured? (The Bad) Another Fade out. sigh.  7. Who We Are- (The Good) Decent song, nothing special, not sure how i feel about the kids chorus singing at the beginning. Very depressing and hopeless sounding. Althought the song gallops along with it's double bass. Also some backing vocals from Adam Duce. Strong riffs and solos though. (The Bad) Just an overall weak feel and that the song was rushed. Not a good outro for an album. Once this song ends, the album is over and your just kind of left wondering, why isn't there more. It's almost like the album wasn't completed.Like a good book, that gets cut off to quickly.  So that's about it. Machine Head have managed to pull off another good effort. As i said there are some flaws within certain tracks, but nothing major. The only thing is some of the stops and starts with the harmony guitar parts sound a lot alike. The new death metal vibe might throw a lot of people for a loop. But overall it's good. Not great. Most people are claiming how groundbreaking and epic it is. I wouldn't go that far, it's certainly far from their best, but has a lot of nice new things to listen to. Also to end this, quit comparing it or wanting it to be The Blackening 2, why does everyone want a sequel, it's not a Saw film. They did TB, so let it go, time to move on. I get so tired of hearing that. I was in a band myself, and we \\"never\\" wanted to top, or make a duplicate copy of our last album. That's just stupid.  So i give it 3.5 out of 5. Though Amazon doesnt give you that option.

Must have been amazing to be on set when they filmed it, they all look like they are having so much fun. I have re watched this series 3 times now.
B004BRP7R4|3.0|This album sounds as though it were rough cut to a great album that we'll never hear.  Josh's voice sounds beautiful, but sometimes strained and unpolished (You hear him gasp for air on more than one occasion, especially while listening through headphones).  It's almost as though he hadn't yet fully rehearsed the songs.    Regardless, the orchestration is beautifully arranged and I could like the different direction had it been executed with a little more care.
0756404738|2.0|It's almost unbearable that two of the best written, mature, and engrossing fantasy novels (The Name of the Wind and Game of Thrones) seem destined to have their sequels devolve into Jordanesque gobbledygook.  While the prose of Wise Man's fear is enjoyable thanks to Rothfuss's talent, it shamefully wastes an outrageous amount of time on things we just don't care about, while failing to develop the main story.  For example, why does Rothfuss think we need to know everything about the ettiquette, customs, and beliefs about human reproduction of the Adem?  As most of the other reviewers, I was an outspoken evangelist of The Name of the Wind.  Not only was that book fabulous, it had the award-winning appeal of almost guaranteeing you that it would be a trilogy (and no more).  But after The Wise Man's Fear, I realized what the Fear really was - that Rothfuss would turn this into a never-ending series of novels that focus on mundane details without any type of resolution.  If you haven't read this yet, I'd recommend skipping until the next one comes out, checking first to see if somewhere on the cover it says, \\"Third (and Final) Day of the Kingkiller Chronicle.\\"
B000088E6D|2.0|As a caveat, I should say this is the first Michael Buble album I've listened to and I haven't listened to any of this kind of music recreationaly (any kinds of jazz) but wanted to give it a try by listening to one of the top selling artists in this music category.  Another caveat, I only listened to the first 3 songs then gave up.  This sounds like music my grandparents would make love to.
B0037ODU3U|3.0|Awesome movie, i loved this movie as a kid and finally decided to check it out on blu ray. It had two extra shots of gore, when the yes man is being shot by the ed 209 in the conference room and when murphy's hand is draining in blood. Well written, the story does not lag or speed or do you feel as if you've missed something, truly well written. Also well acted everybody did their characters justice. Well directed, the action sequences do not disappoint. This movie gives you that \\"real\\" feeling, just like the new action hero movies do. They are dark, deep ...they're not cartoonish or gay. In a way this movie was ahead of its time during an era of real gay movies and even then swept into the nineties of gay movies. Finally in the last 5 years or do hollywood if FINALLY giving those \\"real feeling\\" movie such as dark knight or ironman. As far as i remember robocop has been the only film of the era with those elements. Action, \\"real\\", dark, entertaining (not gay it was the eighties or nineties remember?)   As far as the blu ray goes, eh. Quality was terrible, but the best your gonna get from the original footage. Very grainy. Looks like you can get same quality as the dvd but on a blu ray disc. Still, its blu ray and id rather own blu ray than dvd any day.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|These DVD's are fun to watch, especially since the original commercials are included, along with the other acts that appeared on the same shows as the Beatles.  Even with the age of the original tapes, they have been remastered and cleaned up and the picture is a good quality considering the technology at the time.
B0012GMWCU|4.0|Good strong blues.  We have all heard these tunes before but you may be surprised that this monster of the blues is the one who was \\"first\\".  As the old saying goes,The blues had a baby and they called it rock and roll\\".  Yep this is the daddy......
B005IZLPMY|4.0|The DVD/BluRay cover calls Captain America the \\"best super hero movie ever\\"<br />I don't know if I'd take that honor away from Richard Donner's \\"SUPERMAN\\", but coming in second place BEHIND that classic is a pretty amazing feat.<br />Captain America didn't need the goofy 3D treatment I was forced to see it in. I look forward to watching the BluRay at my home without the stupid goggles (Other than the ones I use to see normally).<br />It was better than I expected and will stand next to my Superman BluRay.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Let me start off by saying yes, this album rocks. I am one of the Machine Head fans that have been waiting with anticipation to hear how they were going to follow up their masterpiece, The Blackening. I have listened to it a few times now, and it is definitely overall, a heavier album. Is heavier better? That all depends on the mood you're in when you listen to it. So far, I do not like it as much as I did The Blackening, but I will do my best to judge it solely on its own merits and not try to compare it to what is quite possibly the magnum opus of all metal albums.<br /> For me, the low point of the entire album is the first song, I Am Hell. While it is probably the fastest, most brutal song on the album, it's all over the place with its pace and I just can't get into it. It seems like it's almost too ambitious. It's a shame as it is the longest song on the album (no 10 min plus songs this time) but hopefully given time I can find the rhythm in the song and enjoy it. This is the only song on the album I didn't really like.<br /> Be Still And Know is the second song on the album and to me, this would have been a great song to start out with.  The guitar work in this song is almost hypnotizing. I look forward to seeing them play this live whenever I get the chance, as it is a great head banger.<br /> The third song on the album, Locust, is the song they released early for the Mayhem Festival, and although that version was called the Advance Mix, I don't really hear any difference between that and what's on the album. It's a very catchy song, and the drum work is phenomenal.<br /> My current favorite song on the album is This Is The End. Coming in at just over 6 minutes it's one of the shorter songs on the album which is funny to say. Everything from the intro to the outro is pulse pounding Metal at its finest. This showcases how they have evolved since their last album. It wasn't until this point in listening to the album that I started to really get into it.<br /> Then all of the sudden it sounded like I was listening to the radio. I sat drop jawed for a moment, listening to the fifth song on the album, Darkness Falls. Then I started to get into the melody and then, in true Machine Head fashion, the metal kicked in and they started playing more music that would make most rock station DJ's cry like little baby girls. This is definitely the slowest song on the album, but it's good. It's really good.<br /> They continue the album with another brutally fast metal song, Pearls Before The Swine. I have no idea what this song is talking about, but it's cool and it has more structure and flow than the comparatively brutal first song, I Am Hell.<br /> The final song on the relatively short record is Who We Are. (For the bonus CD/DVD edition, there are two cover songs, Judas Priest's The Sentinel and Rush's Witch Hunt, as well as an acoustic version of Darkness Within) This song starts out with Machine Head's kids (which you learn by watching the accompanying DVD) singing a catchy chorus, just before you get blasted with some more amazing metal riffs and drums. I really want to emphasize how awesome Dave McClain's drumming sounds on this album. In the DVD it says he got a new drum set, but unless that set came with bionic arms and legs I would say he just got more bada** at playing the drums than ever before. This song is catchy, it's brutal and it's awesome; a great way to close out a fantastic album.<br /> Now, I want to close out by saying that, while I didn't like this album as much as their previous album, it is still a fantastic metal album that I don't even have to think twice about giving 5 stars to. I would also like to note that it took me a few listens to get used to Machine Head's new sound on each of their last two albums prior to Unto The Locust. The great, and sometimes not so great (The Burning Red anyone?), thing about Machine Head is they are constantly evolving their music. These guys know how to make amazing metal albums and this is the second album that Rob Flynn has produced, which really shows how much they know about making music. I would highly recommend anyone who is a fan of great metal check out this album, you will not be disappointed!cond album that Rob Flynn has produced, which really shows how much they know about making music.

0470901071|5.0|I already did the courses of CCNA and now Im preparing CCNA certification. First of all the book was on time and in shape. Im now at the middle of it and the best things for me are all the questions at the end of each chapter and also all the questions and cards that are in the CD. I think that if you answer all of them correctly, you will pass the exam! I will tell you in a couple of months....

0452289963|5.0|Almost everyone in my family has a copy and they re read it again and again. It is a book that doesn't get old, it isn't preachy, and you don't have to read the Bible or go to church to understand... you don't even have to be Christian.  Eckhart Tolle is such a wonderful person and this is a well written book. Everyone should have a copy.
B0033780Y0|3.0|As Peter Freestone was part of Freddie Mercury' s inner circle  I was curious to read what he had to say about his former employer. It is a loving, detailed memoir written from the perpective of someone who took care of everything, from the wardrobe to ushering a lover out of a hotel because Freddie found a better option. The author must have been very fond of Freddie Mercury who comes across as a caring and loyal friend but also a very private man. If you want more details on music, this is not the book for you. If you want to find out more about where and how Freddie lived, you will find plenty of details. I have enjoyed reading this account of Freddie's  life but it left me with a sense of 'is this all there is?' The definite biography on Freddie Mercury has yet to be written.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|i watched all in chronological order for the first time, found it to be quite mesmerizing how my perception of characters of events changed. they felt deeper and more meaningful. i didn't mind any of the changes really, and frankly think most of them improve the films, han not shooting first still feels a lil weird to me, but not because i don't agree with the change (although i do think it was fine the way it was before), i just think the change is poorly done, and never really looks right. otherwise i still love the films, and appreciate it even more as one whole film and as a story of anakin. i wish there were more extras focused on the prequels, and i wish all the previous bonus features for all the movies would have transferred over to this release, but the special features that are here are very satisfying. the video and audio is great throughout, never looked or sounded better.  get it.
B00024I2Z4|1.0|I was really excited, I had bought a \\"used\\" Mulan movie. I understood I was buying a second hand DVD movie. Which never really bother me, but when I finally got it in the mail. I open it, and their was a small scratch on the dvd. Now, like I said I know I was buy a used one, but I didn't know they would sell one that has a scratch on it. So I played the movie just to see if everything is ok. Then I notice in the middle of the movie it wasn't playing right. So now I will be returning it.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|You don't have to be a new generation fan to appreciate the special edition versions or the prequels.  My introduction to Star Wars was going to see Return of the Jedi in 1983.  There are certainly things I like/dislike in any of the movies, but even the originals weren't perfect. Adding in a NOOOO into Return of the Jedi does not diminish the film- The slapstick ewoks, burp jokes and the slightly less enthusiastic acting already did that.  Does any of this make it a bad movie? No. It is a very good movie, but flawed since the beginning. Same things goes for the other movies as well.  These are not supposed to be perfect movies, but fun movies for children and their parents to enjoy.  For every good alteration Lucas makes, he makes a pointless one.  So there really is no \\"perfect\\" version of any Star Wars movie, except for perhaps this version of The Empire Strikes Back. If Lucas added in Roger Rabbit to the background of one of the scenes, then sure. Give this set 1 Star. But all the changes are within the Star Wars universe.  Getting back to the set- They did an amazing job with the picture and sound quality.  It is night and day from any previous release.  There is enough bells and whistles to please any fan.  The special features are also the best I have seen for the series.  The nearly 1 hour of deleted scenes from the original trilogy is a treat.  You can't tell me that these angry fanboys who claim to be \\"true fans\\" wouldn't be interested, since this is the first time they have been released.  The original 1977 version of Star Wars is not included here, which is what launched this whole thing we know as Star Wars.  That would have given the set 5 stars, However, I gave it a 5 to counter all the moronic 1 star reviews on here.
B000RLCJ5Q|5.0|Unbeatable.The CD covers the music of the progressive punk-rock era of the late 70s/early 80s of a band who,actually differently,survived.From the early stages of the British version of the debut album through the succesful era in 1983 with the singles \\"Rock the Casbah\\" and \\"Train in Vain\\".It could have included \\"Julies in the Drug Squad\\"(from the 2nd album \\"Give em Enough Rope\\")but maybe that means buy the other albums- they are too worth it.But for those who simply want a collection with the best of one of the best bands ever,this is unbeatable.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|I'm new at high end photography so I can't really compare this product with similar ones however the shopping experience was perfect, as always with Amazon the ordering was easy, delivery was earlier than predicted and the product was exactly as advertised.    I'm very pleased with the results of using the 'external' flash with my new Nikon D5100.  It expands what I'm able to do and creates much better lighting than the built in flash.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|If you're a fan of the Jack Reacher series, you already know that Lee Child is currently the undisputed master of the unputdownable thriller. When it comes to narrative momentum and expertly wrought tension, his only rival is the late, great Dick Francis.<br /><br />However, the last two Reachers - though good - left me a bit cold because I was getting tired of the \\"Reacher stumbles into small-town corruption\\" formula. Fortunately, THE AFFAIR flashes back to his army career, where he faces his true arch-nemesis, the military bureaucracy, and we learn why he decided to drop out and become a toothbrush-packing drifter. Even though the novel is mainly set in yet another bleak small town, I'm happy to report that Reacher is back to form. This latest adventure delivers the expected page-turning excitement, plus a few other bonuses:<br /><br />* Both the beginning and the end are better than usual. Child tends to be too abrupt for my taste. Here he takes the time to set the scene at the Pentagon and ease past the climax in a very satisfying way.<br /><br />* The love interest, the ex-marine sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux, is Child's most entertaining female character so far. She's not just there to be Reacher's girl. She has an extra dimension and is important to the story.<br /><br />* The \\"midnight special\\" train that roars past Carter Crossing every night is an ingenious device Child uses to ratchet up the suspense, provide a menacing undercurrent, and structure the complicated action in a clear way. It's the most impressive example yet of Child's narrative skill. Plus, choo-choos are just plain cool.<br /><br />A new reader to the series may find the staccato rhythm of the sentences a bit off-putting at first, and Reacher's tough-guy terseness here and there verging on self-parody. But they're essential ingredients in Child's hugely enjoyable, impressively consistent franchise. Overall, I rank THE AFFAIR with the best of the series, up there with PERSUADER, ONE SHOT, and THE ENEMY.THE ENEMY.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love the Supernatural series and just gotta have all the seasons. One of the best parts is the gag reel.
030788743X|3.0|As someone who wasted countless hours during the 1980s playing games on the Atari 2600, I enjoyed this book.  As the novel goes along, the pop culture references become a little too obscure, and the plot becomes a little too formulaic.  Overall, however, it's a fun read.

B004ZNARH4|2.0|Floyd / EMI really missed a chance here. This really could have been something truly incredible, but alas it's truly overblown and lacking in substance worthy of its ticket price.  Granted there may be a small percentage of fans out there that want a bit of memorabilia, there's nothing wrong with a bit of fun, but surely not when it's at the expense of the remainder of the package. I would imagine the vast majority of fans out there who are prepared to fork out the top dollars for a set such at this want quantity and quality, gimmicks I imagine would be well down the list.  In terms of what is provided here the live at Wembley set from 1974 really does sound astonishingly good, absolutely miles above even the soundboard recordings readily available for share from this era. However as this is also available as part of the 'Experience Edition', the question is what does one get that makes this upgrade worthwhile?  The 2 DVD's / 1 Blu-ray discs are chocked up with surround versions of the album and replications of the projections (concert screen reels) played on the big screen behind the band at the time. The fact that this is what makes up the majority of 3 of the 4 bonus discs (to the Experience Edition) is IMHO what lets the Immersion set down big time. Firstly the SACD version of the album is readily available and to my ears absolutely flawless. It simply has to be one of the best hi-res surround sound releases on the market, so i can't imagine there would be too many folk out there that would actually be excited by, or need further surround sound versions of the album. [EDIT] I've since learned that SACD is not a particular big market in the US so this might be the first chance a fair section of the Floyd audience get to hear the James Gutherie surround sound mix - in which case feel free to give the rating here an extra star as this actually becomes an integral part of the box set for you and really is an essential listen. [/EDIT]  The concert screen reels are pleasant enough, but can really only be seen as bonus material as there's no concert footage of the band playing to go along with them. What would have been ideal is to present a full DSOTM performance on DVD with these concert screen reels provided as a bonus angle. In fact this set is totally void of *any* footage of the band performing DSOTM (except for tiny snippets during a 25 minute doco that was made to promote the SACD release of the album back in 2003). What live footage we get is of Careful With That Axe Eugene and Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, and this is so good it's actually heartbreaking that no further footage was dug up, restored and provided.  The set is rounded out with another CD, and it features an early mix of the album by Alan Parsons, presumably before Chris Thomas was brought in. It's an interesting listen and great for fans buying the box set as no doubt they all know the album back to front. It's an aural version of spot the difference. Speak to Me hadn't been spliced together as an overture yet, Clare Torry is absent from Great Gig and the track is 30 sec shorter. Hearing the naked version of this song really highlights what a lift it received from her vocal improvisations. The dialogue interspersed throughout the final mix hadn't been added as yet here so it's also interesting to hear the album stripped of that, but when one is so used to it, it's quite noticeable in its absence. No heart (drum) beats bookend the album, rather a Moody Blues-esque mellotron-like chord commences the album, and a fade out of the final chord of Eclipse rounds it out. Also apparent now is how much effort was put into the final mix in terms of building the suite of songs that finish the album to a full climax and release. The segues of Any Colour You Like, Brain Damage and Eclipse kind of limp together here, but on the final mix each songs entry packs an increasingly bigger punch building a memorable finale to such a deserved classic album! The earlymix whilst solid enough shows the band making an obvious improvement on Meddle, but still trying to define themselves. There's no doubt had they released this early mix it would have sold well, but it would certainly not have taken the band into the stratosphere the final mix did.  The remainder of the bonus tracks on this CD are definitely worthy and warrant inclusion in this set. The Hard Way (from the aborted Household Objects project) which, whilst not pre-empting any of the sound of Wish You Were Here, sounds years ahead of its time. In fact if the track had managed to get a bit of a groove happening it could almost be a proto-Massive Attack sound. I can only assume the synth-like sound is actually the wineglasses that are often made mention whenever the band refers to the session. It's a great sound and alone makes this track worth listening to more than once!  Two demos are included: Us and Them is just Rick plonking away on the piano (without vocals), and Money simply Roger on acoustic guitar giving a very earnest vocal performance (which I actually love!) His original splicing of money and cash register noises is tagged neatly on the end. The true highlights of this disc are the 3 live tracks from 1972. The band at this point were such an amazing live band and these tracks really highlight the jam-nature of the band at this point free from the controlled song structure they imposed on themselves as they became a bigger phenomenon. The Mortality Sequence contains just one run through of the chord progression that became Great Gig, the remainder being a lovely chordal improvisation from Rick on the organ. Any Colour You Like is relaxed and has beautiful playing from Gilmour and Rick, then Nick starts increasing his frequency of drum fills and the song for 30 odd seconds is totally rocking! The Travel Sequence appears in both live and studio form, and I assume was dropped from the album in favour of On The Run (they both share 16ths on the hi-hats) and for being another instrumental. It would have been filler on the album itself but makes for a great outtake/bonus track!  However the high points of this disc again highlight what could have been! Why not another full set of DSOTM? Imagine if this box set contained the prototype live version (from 1972) as well as the aforementioned '74 Wembley set. I'd gladly trade my marbles and scarf for that!! Who in their right mind wouldn't?? The sound quality of the '72 tracks featured here isn't as strong as the '74 set, but I doubt there'd be too much complaint about that, it's still miles above bootleg quality and very enjoyable. I guess tellingly the 3 tracks supplied are all instrumental, so perhaps messers Gilmour and Waters vetoed their vocal performances from this particular gig. If that's the case that's a real shame, being a bonus feature I could live with the vocals being off mike, cutting out, or even being a bit out of tune. It definitely wouldn't be a deal breaker.  Finally the last real let down of the set is the booklets. The two booklets enclosed should have been reduced to one, and a further booklet should have been commissioned by EMI giving extensive interviews with the surviving members of the band (even interspersing handpicked quotes from Rick) and session engineers. There's no discussion of the live material (audio or visual) or concert screen reels, no discussion of the Household Objects project or the dropped Travel Sequence track... All of which would have made killer (not to mention essential) reading.  Genesis really set the benchmark for reissuing their back catalog and genuinely giving their fan base what they wanted in terms of a value packed upgrade. 2 box sets issuing much in the way of live tracks and rarities, followed up some years later by solid sonic upgraded surround sound mixes for each album that came with bonus DVD's of interviews/making of docos + TV appearances and concert footage (some broadcast quality interspersed with some bootleg quality, but at least a document for fans to enjoy) Those wishing to dive in for box sets were rewarded with further bonus tracks and DVD footage + essay booklets. All in all a pretty simple and satisfying benchmark to at least try and reach.  Alas with Floyd we have been given gimmicks and a just a taste of what could have been a truly worthwhile and immersing experience.
186230291X|5.0|I was mesmerized by this book's unsusually clever writing style and I couldn't put it down. It is another holocaust story, and therefore sad and heart-wrenching, but definitely worth reading. Knowledge of the German language helps to appreciate the book.   HOWEVER, this is NOT a book for children. There are other holocaust stories more suitable for young (middle school) children, such as When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit by Judith Kerr or Count the Stars by Lois Lowry, just to name two of them.
630542828X|5.0|A very well-acted movie that shows the results of hubris - whether in the courtroom or otherwise.  Robert Duvall is especially good in this - a great, realistic performance.  Travolta is good, also, but just a little past believable in this role.  I recommmend it for all aspiring lawyers.

0385491026|5.0|When artist Elaine Risling returns home to Toronto for a retrospective art showing, she has mixed feelings.  After all, her childhood memories still haunt her, with parts seemingly irretrievable.  So what will she discover upon her return?<br /><br />Buildings that have disappeared, new businesses that have cropped up to replace them, and the memories attached to the once familiar landscape stand out in stark relief.<br /><br />Elaine's childhood included a gypsy-like traveling about with her entomologist father, and the family camped out in tents.  Then would come the months in an almost normal home, but without the normalcy she sees around her.  Her fears, her insecurities, and the differences she can feel within must somehow convey themselves to the three girls who call themselves \\"friends.\\"  Is there any other reason for the torture she suffers at their hands?<br /><br />But years later, only parts of this history remain in her memory, slowly returning in flashes.<br /><br />The language and images of [[ASIN:0385491026 Cat's Eye]] were haunting, unforgettable, and reminiscent of some of my own childhood experiences.  Who hasn't felt, at one time or another, the insecurity of not fitting in?  Who hasn't been bullied or taunted?  Reading Elaine's story, from the past to the present, brought these old memories back in full force.<br /><br />Combined with the visual images of the art showing that depicts many of those childhood moments, the language in Atwood's story had me rereading parts because of the sheer magic of the words.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|This CD is great.  When Chickenfoot arrived in 2009 with the excellent dayview cd and the \\"Get Your Buzz On Live\\" DVD/Blu-ray, they got noticed by rock music fans.  The question with all sophomore CDs is will it be equal or better than the first?  While I am not ready to say it due to the limited plays so far (the first was on my car on heavy rotation for a long, long time), this new CD sounds promising.  It is growing on me with each play.  Standout tracks are Lighten Up, Alright Alright, Dubai Blues, Come Closer, Different Devil, Up Next, Three and a Half Letters, Something Going Wrong and the excellent hidden track No Change.  The rest are also great, so bottomline, this is a CD to be heard from start to finish.  As attested by the excellent Get Your Buzz On Live, Chickenfoot is a band best served live, as their musical prowess comes forward tenfold, so I will be eagerly waiting for the new tour starting out this november and any subsequent Live DVD/Blu-ray.  Extremely recommended.

The new VH recording will never be as good as it could have been without Michael Anthony's bass, voice, & stage presence.  VH needs to humble themselves & get Mike back before the VH album & tour, once the Chickenfoot recording & tour has run its coarse.  Wake up Ed & Al, end the legend properly!

I didn't see it.  I thought it was not very good at all.  I mean it was okay, and as a past reviewer said, it was cheaper than a gallon of gas, so I guess I got what I paid for and it took up time on my airplane flight.  Other than that, I have nothing great to say about it.  It was on \\"okay\\" short read , but I think Mr. King should stick to his novels.

B004UXUSPA|5.0|The best movie of the summer.  If you have ever visited Paris, you will be enthralled with this delightful escape through the sights, art and literature of the golden age of Paris. Owen Wilson sparkles like the Eiffel Tower in his Woody Allen role as the unexpected visitor back in time to the Paris Arts community.  Kathy Bates portrayal of Gertrude Stein and her routine counsel with Ernest Hemingway and Pablo Picasso among many others were like an updated intimate peek into what were in 1920's Paris, simply everyday artists lives. I anxiously await the release to DVD.

As soon as the movie came on, I was like \\"why are they starting the movie in the middle of the book??\\", but I soon got over that and got into watching.  I just didn't \\"feel\\" the connection between Jane and Edward like I did with other adaptations.  With the Cirran Hinds version, 1/2 way through the movie is was so obvious they were in love, not so with this one.  If I'd never seen the others or read the book, I'm sure I'd have felt like \\"when did that happen??\\".  Judi Dench, as always, gave a stellar performance.  She is one top-notch actress, one of my favs.  but, when Jane goes back to Thornefield and finds it burned out and abandonded, then suddenly,completely out of no where, Mrs. Fairfax \\"appears\\" to tell Jane what happened?  So NOT believable.  it's been abandoned by everyone but her??  it would have been so much better to just allow Jane to find out as the book laid it out.  and then we came to the end. *sigh*.  I felt cheated, \\"is that it???\\".  There was so much conversation between Jane and Edward in those last pages of the book, that they could have used in the movie and not taken up too much more time.  at least in the Hinds version just before the credits rolled, you see Edward and Jane strolling with their baby and looking so happy.  This one just left me feeling deflated.  I give it 4 stars because over all it is a very good movie, and the acting and the musical score was outstanding, but the directors/writers/producers could have done so much more for so little more running time and made it a much better movie.  I've decided not to buy this one.

0307279189|4.0|I bought this book thinking it would be an instructional book on how to run in the way we were meant to by nature.  What I got instead was excellent story telling and characters I that I was attached to.  I drank up every page, wanting to know what was going to happen next.  There was one chapter that went through the science and I found that extremely convincing too.  I highly recommend this book for a quick and exciting read.

B004XNGKBS|5.0|On my Motorola Atrix this app is very smooth with no lag between my handwriting and the note. You can customize the pen, text size, color, and line width. It would be nice if you could customize the paper color.  This app is so easy to use and smooth. I just love it.  In the future, I'd love to be able to add photos to my notes. Thanks for a great app.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|I reduced the timeout on the app and it works fairly well on a 4.3&quot; screen, but can't handle very long words. You pretty much have to use shorthand to get things in. I would really recommend against it if you have a phone with a smaller screen. my recommendation would be to port the code to Honeycomb and forget the phone market. I've got similar apps for my iPad that work great with a stylus added. Through in the ability to export the notes to a PDF and you've got a winner. Not worth $3, but definitely worth $1, and maybe closer to $2.
1416955070|4.0|When Clary goes to a club, and witnesses something that no one else can see. She knows that something isn't right. Jace, a Shadowhunter, takes Clary into this new world. In which Clary is a part of more than she could ever imagine.<br />She meets some very interesting people. And ends up having her best friend Simon, by her side along the way. Although her is not always willing or wanting to do some of the stuff.  There is one person who  makes a bigger impression in her life then she ever imagined.<br />With her mom missing. All this new information that Clary has to process, and learn about herself and her family. She is left with allot of Questions that need answers. Answers that she don't want to accept. And some life shattering information, that may keep her from the boy who she really likes.<br /><br />I read this along with 4 or 5 (maybe more) other people via Twitter. We decided to do a read-a-long. Although I was probably the LAST one to finish. (I had forgot about some books that HAD to be read.) But, I finally finished!<br />For the 1st part and some of the 2nd part of City of Bones, I was having mixed feelings about the book. I liked it. I just really and honestly could not get into it. I think it was the explaining of everything. I understand we want to know everything, but *whew* it was alot to take in at one time. BUT, after I have thought about it. I am really actually glad that book 1 did that. Left more room for action in the remaining books, since we know everything about the world now, I think.<br />Now, as for getting into the book. I would say after page 280+ I was hooked. My raiting went from a 2 to a 5 in a matter of minuets. Because even through out the \\"world building\\" I still wanted to know more about the characters. In which I loved! I cannot wait to find out more about Clary, Simon, Jace, Alec & Isabella.<br />The ending of the book, really? Like...... Really? WOW.<br />I mean I got some information in the last couple pages, to where I wanted to tear them out so that ending would have been non existent. Maybe only for me. But, that ending made me so mad I chucked my book to the wall...(yes, I wanted and did inflict personal pain upon this book) *eeek* I feel bad NOW, but in the moment I was so torn. Distraught. Heartbroken, as to what happened!  Now in book 2. I am hoping this is NOT true. You know I can't tell you what IT is. Big Spoiler. But I can VENT about \\"IT\\" all day long... Because you will have to read it to find out. And you should.<br />I really enjoyed this book. Even through the slow parts.<br />I will be sticking with this series, and continuing the adventure with the gang.

0385534639|5.0|This story has so enchanted me that I don't even know where to begin my review.  I won't retell the story line. You will find it in other reviews. Let me say instead that this book is absolutely wonderful. It is rare that I so enjoy a book that focuses more on plot and setting than characterization. That is not to say that the characters are weak, not at all. The characters, both main and secondary, are fully drawn and easy to identify with. But, the setting is so well drawn that it is truly a character itself. I felt as if I could step into the pages of the book and enter the circus. The descriptions are detailed, yet do not bog down the pace of the story. The fantasy world created by Morgenstern is strange and beautiful, completely enchanting. I am a grown woman, and I have not wished so much that a story world were real since I was a child.   And, the plot... It is well paced and complex... something you can really sink your teeth into. There is a great deal in foreshadowing, symbolism, and hinted at details and meaning for the careful reader. Some reviewers have said that they couldn't put the book down and read through it quickly. That would not be my suggestion. I think one should take one's time reading this book. There is so much detail to absorb.  As soon as I finish this review I will read The Night Circus again. I know I will pick up on even more of the detail and wonder of this book.  If you are reading this review either someone told you about this book or something about it sparked your interest. Read it! You will be glad you did.

B004ZN9Q3K|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 VERSION and THE 2016 PINK FLOYD RECORDS REISSUE ***<br /><br />As the four longhaired Prog Rockers of Pink Floyd sat on a bench holding hands up to their faces and giggling as the camera snapped their hidden visages in 1971 – I doubt any of them would have thought then that they’d end being a 'limited company' in the future - the decidedly English lads now just as corporate as the machine they so raged against throughout the whole of the Seventies. Which brings us to the mighty &#34;Meddle&#34; album and its &#34;...I'll Climb The Hill In My Own Way...&#34; brand of music now re-issued yet again on CD in 2016...<br /><br />UK re-released 8 January 2016 – &#34;Meddle&#34; by PINK FLOYD on Pink Floyd Records PFR6 (Barcode 5099902894225) is a straightforward 6-track reissue CD using the Remaster from 2011 and in fact the same barcode. It's once again housed in a gatefold card digipak, has a stickered sleeve (on the outer shrinkwrap) and 12-page colour booklet (48:51 minutes).<br /><br />The original version of this Remaster was released 26 September 2011 as a 'Discovery Edition' single CD on EMI/Harvest EMI 50999 028942 2 5 (Barcode 5099902894225) – this 2016 version on Pink Floyd Records uses that 2011 remaster and the same artwork. The 'Discovery Edition' sticker is gone as is the horrible 'green Ds' reinvented CD artwork that came with the 2011 issue – that's thankfully been replaced on the CD with the Cow's Ear cover artwork of the original LP.<br /><br />1. One Of These Days [Side 1]<br />2. A Pillow Of Winds<br />3. Fearless<br />4. San Tropez<br />5. Seamus<br />6. Echoes [Side 2]<br /><br />PINK FLOYD was:<br />ROGER WATERS – Bass, Guitar and Vocals<br />DAVID GILMOUR – Lead Guitar and Vocals<br />RICHARD WRIGHT – Keyboards and Vocals<br />NICK MASON – Drums and Percussion<br /><br />Released 30 October 1971 on Harvest Records SMAS-832 in the USA and 13 November 1971 in the UK on Harvest Records SHVL 795 - original UK vinyl copies of PINK FLOYD'S &#34;Meddle&#34; came in an untitled textured gatefold sleeve. American issues were titled and featured reversed artwork on a hard-card sleeve - the back of the UK cover put on the front.<br /><br />JAMES GUTHRIE and JOEL PLANTE have carried out the remaster on this and all 14 albums in their catalogue at the Das Boot Recording Studios in Tahoe in California (Guthrie is a Sound Engineer associated with the band since 1978). The original 1st generation master tapes have obviously been given a thorough going over because it truly feels like each song has had a staggering amount of time spent on them worrying out every single nuance possible. The audio result is truly impressive. Those Discovery Edition Remasters have been reused for all 14 of the January 2016 reissues.<br /><br />On the 1995 remaster - the six-minute opener &#34;One Of These Days&#34; took ages to arrive and even when it did it was somehow dull and lacklustre. How things have changed - when the huge synth riff kicks in about 2:50 on this 2011 version - the sound is incredibly clear - allowing you to hear crashes and bangs going on in the background that I've never heard before. Then the sort of Piltdown Man voice says &#34;One Of These Days I'm Gonna Cut You Into Little Pieces...&#34; and all Hell breaks loose - Gilmour's guitar indeed sounding like a musical chainsaw. It's revelatory genius and in that uniquely peculiar Pink Floyd kind of a way.<br /><br />But even that is trumped by the awesome clarity of the forgotten and hugely underrated &#34;A Pillow Of Winds&#34;. Put simply - it sounds 'beautiful'. The jaunty &#34;San Tropez&#34; and the rather pointless ditty that is &#34;Seamus&#34; are both the same - so clear and renewed. The 23:25 minute Side 2 opus &#34;Echoes&#34; has hiss as it opens on sonar pings - but luckily Guthrie and Plante have allowed it to breath instead of using some no-noise dampening technique. So when the funky break takes place at about seven minutes (now being used by Dance DJs in the UK as a mix in sets) it sounds just HUGE. It's impressive stuff, it really is.<br /><br />But on this album my heart has always been with &#34;Fearless&#34; - issued as a B-side to &#34;One Of These Days&#34; in the USA and other European territories. It seems like I've waited literally 40 whole years to hear this fabulous song in such clarity (lyrics above). It's a genuine wow - and reminds me of a club I used to go to in Dublin called The Grove in the Seventies when they actually used this song as a 'lurch' (a slow tune in Ireland). As it fades out to the Liverpool Football Club fans singing &#34;You'll Never Walk Alone&#34; (a no.1 UK hit for Gerry & The Pacemakers in 1963 and adopted by them as an anthem) - I'm in floods...<br /><br />I wish I could say the same for the staggeringly unimaginative packaging. The 'Pink Floyd' logo you see in all the photos advertising these new reissues turns out to be a sticker on the outer shrink-wrap that gets lost the second you unpeel it. The card sleeves are like The Beatles 09/09/09 EMI reissues - glossy and flimsy - so they smudge with finger prints the second you open them and are easy to bend and crease. The Discovery CD label with its pointless generic artwork (a sort of Turquoise and Pale Green for &#34;Meddle&#34;, a garish Red and Pink for &#34;Obscured By Clouds&#34; etc) has thankfully been replaced with an artwork picture CD (no Harvest Records logo) but again it has no protective gauze sleeve so it will scuff on repeated plays (I’d suggest you protect it with a paper inlay).<br /><br />But the skimpy booklet is the biggest disappointment. Although it has the lyrics (like this is a major improvement) it seems little different to the 1995 issue. It has no history on the album, pictures of European and Worldwide 7&#34; sleeves, the different US artwork etc. OK - it does look nice and does the job adequately - but that's all. It's a lazy-assed approach and undermines the sterling work done on the sound front. And there are no outtakes either...and man would they have been worth a listen.<br /><br />Still – with the truly beautiful sonic upgrade – Floyd’s &#34;Meddle&#34; finally gets the five-star sound the album has always deserved - albeit housed in 3-star presentation. But at least these 2016 reissues have a decent price (under eight quid in most places for a single CD) and come accompanied with their VINYL variants for the first time in decades – each beautifully reproduced 180-gram Vinyl LP featuring fully restored artwork and also reasonably priced compared to what Near Mint originals would set you back.<br /><br />Unique music from a unique band - a pillow of winds indeed...on this album my heart has always been with &#34;Fearless&#34; - issued as a B-side to &#34;One Of These Days&#34; in the USA and other European territories.

B004LWZW4W|4.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes is on the surface a far fetched fantasy flick, but I have to give credit to the film makers because they have made it as believable as it is possible to make such a ridiculous idea. I like all of the Planet of the Apes movies because they are good fun. This one was a real stab at making a serious version and thanks to the brilliant special effects and a very tight script it never really stretches believability (not while you're watching it anyway). You could pick holes in it all day if you really wanted to, but what's the point?   It's a fairly slow paced film but it never gets boring thanks to the great acting and effects. Definitely worth a watch.

B004ZN9R6G|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 VERSION ***<br /><br />30 seconds into this 2011 remaster of Pink Floyd's \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" and little will prepare fans for the sonic assault that will hit them - it's incredible. Where has this sound quality been for the last 40 years? But I wish I could say the same of the truly naff and skimpy packaging. Still - to the details first...<br /><br />Released 3 June 1972 in the UK on Harvest Records SHSP 4020 and 15 June 1972 on Harvest Records ST-11078 in the USA - original UK copies of the vinyl LP came in a round-cornered textured sleeve with a sticker on the front advising that it was \\"Music From La Vallee\\". The movie by French filmmaker Barbet Schroeder is about a group of young people seeking a mythical valley in Papua New Guinea which on maps is \\"...obscured by clouds\\". This 26 September 2011 version (27 Sep 2011 in the USA) on EMI 50999 028943 2 4 is a straightforward 10-track remaster of that Soundtrack album and comes in a gatefold card sleeve with an 8-page colour inlay inside (total playing time 40:34 minutes).<br /><br />Mastered by JAMES GUTHRIE and JOEL PLANTE at Das Boot Recording Studios in Tahoe in California in 2011 - the original 1st generation master tapes have been given a thorough going over (Guthrie is a Sound Engineer associated with the band since 1978). In fact - each song feels like these experts have spent a staggering amount of time worrying over every single nuance - because the audio result is truly impressive.<br /><br />Highlights include the opening track \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" (the first of four instrumentals) which fades in with a synth and drum beat - and when it turns on the power at about 23 seconds - the audio is like a punch in the face - clear, warm and swirling around your speakers with amazing presence. \\"When You're In\\" is the same though this time with Gilmour's guitar to the fore. \\"Burning Bridges\\" sums up the languid feel to so many of the lyric songs - it feels like someone relaxing with a nice bottle of wine in rural France (lyrics above). The acoustic guitars of \\"Wot's ...Uh The Deal\\" are gorgeous while the clarity of \\"Childhood's End\\" has made me hear instruments I missed before (Gilmour's solo in particular comes at you with an energy it's never had before). \\"Mudmen\\" and \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" are the other two excellent instrumentals and even the hissy (but lovely) \\"Stay\\" hasn't had the air sucked out of it by some no-noise techniques - the two engineers have let it breath. It's all impressive stuff, it really is...<br /><br />I wish I could say the same for the staggeringly unimaginative packaging. The 'Pink Floyd' logo you see in all the photos advertising these new reissues turns out to be a sticker on the outer shrink-wrap that gets lost the second you unpeel it. The card sleeves are like The Beatles 09/09/09 EMI reissues - glossy and flimsy - so they smudge with finger prints the second you open them and are easy to bend and crease. The CD itself has new generic artwork that's repeated in different colour variations throughout the series - a garish Red and Pink for \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", a sort of Turquoise and Pale Green for \\"Meddle\\" etc... It has no relevance to the original albums whatsoever (where's the original Harvest label they've used on other reissues or the colourful inner bag?) but also has no protective gauze sleeve so it will scuff on repeated plays.<br /><br />The front artwork of the original LP is a soft-focus blurred picture of a man in a tree in the rain with the EMI/Harvest logo in the top left hand corner. This new variant drops the logo and has a darker looking picture that to my mind completely looses the aesthetic feel of the original. It just looks wrong somehow. In its favour - when opened the new gatefold shows a beautiful colour still of men on horses being greeted by natives and some other film shots background the lyrics (lead actress Bulle Ogier is on Page 3). But the skimpy booklet is a huge disappointment.Although it has the lyrics (like this is a major improvement), it has no history on the album, pictures of the band etc... The album produced 7\\" singles in the USA (\\"Free Four\\" b/w \\"Stay\\") as well as a myriad of European and Worldwide picture sleeves - but again no show. Ok - it does look nice and does the job adequately - but that's all. It's a lazy-assed approach on behalf of EMI and undermines the sterling work done on the sound front. I hate to come across like some nick-picking fan boy here, but it would have been nice to actually 'discover' something on this so-called 'Discovery' version. And there's no outtakes either/no DVD of the film...<br /><br />To sum up - five-star sound with 3-star presentation - but with an opening salvo price of less than a tenner in most stores - and the truly beautiful sonic upgrade thrown in - the casual listener is advised to dig in, rediscover and enjoy.<br /><br />Die-hard fans however might want to wait for the Japanese Editions that will inevitably arrive in 2012 on the far superior SHM-CD format (a better make of CD playable on all players). With their faithfully reproduced artwork and audiophile reproduction - they may give your bank manager a cold sweat - but they will absolutely be the ones to get if the best is all you'll accept.<br /><br />\\"Obscured By Clouds\\" seems to have always been the runt of the Floyd litter and I've never understood this - it's a cohesive work and contains some of their most musical compositions. Hopefully this flawed reissue will draw many newcomers in...<br /><br />I've just listened to \\"Meddle\\" too and it's even more astonishing.

B005CM9DX6|3.0|Hey, Everyone Knows whose an Opeth fan that this c.d is different from the rest. Being a fan of music, i can appreciate the talent and direction the c.d has gone in. But because I'm largely more interested in more rock/metal sounds, this c.d isn't one that i'll play again and again like many other Opeth works. Let's be honest, if you're an Opeth fan, you're gonna buy, or find some way of listening to this c.d. If you're a beginner Opeth fan, and are interested in them because you've been told of their metal-ness, start elsewhere.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I love sci-fi of all kinds, but I think this TV series is in a class of its own.  John Noble as Walter Bishop is great and the story lines are so \\"out there\\" it  makes you stop and think. As always quick shipping and customer service.
0385534639|5.0|This book was enchanting, captivating. It pulled you in and wouldn't let you go. When I was growing up, I loved to go to the circus. The characters are deep, emotional, and poignant. I was wary after all the hype before the book even came out. I got a sample sent to my kindle and was hooked. Typically I don't like to spend more than 10$ on kindle books, but I couldn't resist. The author paints a beautiful picture of the circus and I felt like I was there with them. I recommend that you all pick up this book.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I enjoyed the singles from this record, so I decided to give the new Alice In Chains a real listen.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Amazon's CD prices are very good, especially with PRIME!  In a world of _Tunes online I really appreciate the superior sound quality and completeness of the entire CD.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the former AIC, but an open mind is always a must when a great band changes members.  Enjoy!
B004SBBDB2|4.0|This is a simple device that transfers some (and only some) functions of your iPod, iPhone or iPad to a larger television screen or bigger, louder speakers.  I recommend this item for what it is advertised to do although I will have to play with it a little more to see if the glitches being experienced and described below are a product of this cable or my other electronics.  It will display the photos and play the videos stored on Apple devices and streaming video from online services effectively to a larger television screen; however it will not replicate your entire iPod / iPhone / iPad screen.    Getting photo slideshows on my television was very easy.  I also easily played several short videos I had filmed with my iPod Touch without any issues and streamed a movie from an online source with no problems.  However, when I tried to play some music videos from iTunes the video on my television screen froze up and required me to hit the play button on occasion on my iPod.  When I tried to play my music from my iPod via my television speakers, I was also unsuccessful.  I tried this with both the component and audio connectors all attached as well as with just the red and white audio connectors but had no luck either way.  It is always hard to tell if this is a problem with the player (the iPod), the cable (this product) or the receiver (in this case a 52\\" television).  I will play with it some more and post an update if my results change.  Plus, I am interested to see what other users' experiences are.  When I could get the intended source to play, both the video and audio exceeded my expectations.    I actually prefer the black color of this item to the white color that comes stock with Apple branded accessories and that is only one advantage. The AV cable is listed by the manufacturer at 6.5 feet and it measured 80.5\\" from tip-to-tip when I measured.  One side of the cable is a shiny 30-pin part with an Amazon Basics logo that attaches to your iPod / iPhone / iPad.On the other side of the cable are six connections (one Type A USB, red and white analog audio connectors and finally red, green and blue component video connectors). Each of those six connections is shiny black in color and has an Amazon basics logo.  You can use those connections to connect your iPod / iPad, iPhone to your television equipped with component video connections and analog red and white audio connections.  Or, you can use this cable to connect your Apple product to your stereo using the analog red and white connections. This cable is a high quality build. The connector tips feel really durable. Perhaps most impressive is how easily the 30 pin connector attaches to my iPod. It just glides right on and right off with no hassle (it doesn't have those locks that click in; however, it functions just as well with less aggravation). Plus it is easier to grip with my large fingers. That is not always the case with the stock Apple cord or a few other aftermarket cords I have purchased. I also love the Amazon frustration-free packaging. It comes in a nice sturdy cardboard box that is easy to open and I will reuse the box for other purposes.  I think other than the glitches I have had, two things clearly need to be rethought on this product.  First, there is no clear way to differentiate between the red analog audio connection and the red component connectors.  They look identical and have no label whatsoever.  One has to follow the lines to their stem to ensure they are connecting this the right way.  Second, putting a Type A USB connector on the cable is great since it offers the user more options to power their Apple device; however, putting the Type A connection right next to the component connections and analog audio connections does beg the question of how convenient it will be to use the Type A connection if one is attaching this to five other nearby connections behind a large screen television?  It seems the Type A USB connection would have been more appropriately placed on the side of the cable with the 30-pin connection.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I'm mainly reading technical and training documents on my Toshiba tablet. This is the only app that will fill the page with the formatted text and not zoom in or out when I turn the page.<br /><br />Unfortunately it shares a problem with them all. It doesn't center the page, so after turning a page I have to manually center it. This seems like a basic readability issue that should have been solved before adding bells and whistles.<br /><br />Another nice thing, it also loads an instruction sheet on first boot.<br /><br />Silly idea, but I thought since it cost more it'd be better than the free or less expensive ones. That said I used an Amazon credit so won't complain too much.

B004ZN9J0K|5.0|Pink Floyd's second album always suffered from sonic problems.<br /><br />While the recording was done at EMI Studio's Abbey Road from January 1968 to April 1968, the same studio where 'Piper' was recorded, the band's arrangements became more complex, especially in the case of Rick Wright's two songs.<br /><br />James Guthrie's remastering of 1968's 'A Saucerful of Secrets,' to these ears, sounds like nothing short of a rebirth of the album 43 years after its release.<br /><br />Consider \\"Remember a Day\\" and \\"See-Saw,\\" the latter which has tracks for piano, bass, drums, vocals, etc. and mellotron, plus assorted other instruments. Yet every song here benefits in some way from the remastering. \\"Corporal Clegg\\" sounds more menacing and bizarre than ever.<br /><br />\\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" still sounds eerily mystical, but the experience of listening to it seems more personal. The same is true for the title track.<br /><br />Syd Barrett, who had contributed so much to the band's first record, is now relegated to the final, famous track, \\"Jugband Blues,\\" which opens with \\"It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here/And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here.\\"<br /><br />This is the third version of this album I've bought. Hearing this cleaned up version really is a treat.<br /><br />Two minor nits: I'm a bit disappointed upon pulling out the disc from its digipack that the powers that be didn't reprint the striped \\"Tower\\" label. That would have been a nice touch.<br /><br />The other drawback is it's a digipack.<br /><br />On the plus side, the CD comes with a 12-page booklet and lyrics, some of which I still contest; for example:<br /><br />\\"Marigolds are very much in love/But he doesn't mind.\\"<br /><br />I always thought this was<br /><br />\\"There he goes so very much in love/But he doesn't mind.\\"<br /><br />\\"There he goes...\\" makes more sense to me because he hasn't yet picked up his sister to go to the playground (in to the \\"See-Saw land,\\" which I believe is a metaphor for childhood innocence).<br /><br />\\"Marigolds are very much in love?\\"<br /><br />Okay.

0385344325|5.0|Well, all of you Reacher Creatures* - do you have your copy of Lee Child's latest book - The Affair - yet? It releases today!<br /><br />I don't bother reading the flyleaf or any pre-pub reviews - I just want to dive in and experience the latest Jack Reacher book (#16  without any inkling of what's going to happen. So....for those of you who feel the same, you may want to stop right here. But I'll tell you this before you leave - it's good, darn good, really darn good. You definitely won't be disappointed.<br /><br />For those of you who can't resist a little peek... keep reading. Lee Child takes us back to the beginning of the end of Reacher's military career. Yes, we get to see into Reacher's past and have his back story filled in. How and why did he leave the army? Where and why did he start travelling so light?<br /><br />\\"I remember the date, of course. It was Tuesday, the eleventh of March, 1997, and it was the last day I walked into that place as a legal employee of the people who built it.\\"<br /><br />\\"There was a lot more to leaving the service than getting a job. There were houses, and cars, and clothes. There were a hundred strange, unknown details, like the customs of a remote foreign tribe, glimpsed only in passing, and never fully understood.\\"<br /><br />Reacher is sent to Carter Crossing, Mississippi, to be a second pair of eyes for the Army when a local woman is found with her throat slit. Everything points to a Ranger on the elite training base just outside of town. But the deeper Reacher digs, the more dirt he turns up. There's been more than one death and everyone from the Pentagon to the Army and the local sheriff seem to have their own agenda and their own idea of who to blame....<br /><br />Lee Child has created a character that appeals to all readers, men and women. He's the quintessential hard boiled hero. No backing down, his own set of morals and tough as nails. He has a firm moral compass, carefully delineated lines on what's right and wrong, but has no problem using questionable methods to get to the bottom of things. He's big, strong, smart and....well.... kinda sexy too. We get to see a much more personal side of Reacher in The Affair.<br /><br />The plot is multi-layered and intricate, keeping me guessing until the end.The dialogue is short, sharp and witty. Really, all I can say is that I absolutely loved it. And, I'm a little in love with Reacher too.<br /><br />\\"The sun was out, and the air was warm. There were miles behind me and miles ahead, and plenty of time on the clock. I had no ambitions and very few needs. I would be OK whatever came next.\\" \\"I picked a road at random, and I put one foot on the curb and one in the trafic lane, and I stuck out my thumb.\\"<br /><br />And this reader cannot wait to see where Reacher lands next.<br /><br />* I'm not sure where this phrase originated, but thanks to Jess for passing it on!the bottom of things.

0525423273|5.0|I have read so many great reviews of this book but sometimes books are not always the same for me as for others.  In this case, I have to definitely agree with the majority.  I really loved this book.  The characters were great, the plot was great, everything was great.  There are few books that I can say that about.  Anna is such a great main character (one of the best besides Katniss I have ever read).  I can really relate to her having to deal with a new place and school because I had to move to a new place and start at a new school my sophomore year of high school.  However, I can't imagine having to deal with a whole new language.  She handles it pretty well and makes friends quickly (something I wish I would have been able to do).  One of those friends is Etienne St. Clair.  Anna and St. Clair hit it off pretty quickly but then there is the problem of him having a girlfriend.  Etienne is a great main character as well and you can tell that he falls for Anna pretty quickly.  Things go back and forth for them like they always seem to in high school relationships (at least that is what I've been told).  The whole flow of the book is great and the supporting characters help to drive everything along well.  A companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss called Lola and the Boy Next Door is coming out in September and Stephanie Perkins has hinted that because it takes place in a certain city and certain people are now in that city they will hopefully show up again.  The thought of that makes me very happy.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a really great love story and a great contemporary novel.

0062112430|3.0|I have not yet read Lauren Oliver's other book, Before I Fall, but it is on my list to read.  I heard such great reviews of this book and so I thought I would check it out.  I was a little disappointed to say the least.  I really enjoy most dystopian fiction and even though the concept of this book is very original, I could not get into it enough to enjoy the book.  Lena is a good main character but I found myself irritated with her often.  Growing up in that type of world must have been hard and she has dealt with a lot in her short life, including the death of her mother.  She is so close to getting the cure for deliria so of course she has to meet a guy that she falls in love with.  I did not particularly enjoy their relationship and found myself skipping over a lot of those paragraphs.  Lena's best friend Hana was pretty annoying as well.  She was so wishy washy with her feelings and thoughts throughout the book.  I really felt that this book was too long and too wordy to build up this story.  It really makes me reconsider reading Before I Fall.  The ending ticked me off so much that I wanted to spit nails.  I believe there is a sequel to this book but I am not sure that I will pick it up.

B004T6OEHG|5.0|Notes from San Fransisco is a great Rory album, if you don't put him in a box. Yes, it is different from Rory as we know and love him most. He used a producer for this album and it shows in several ways. Some songs have unnecessary, \\"poppy\\" intros and Rory even uses guitar effects, including fuzz box and wah pedal, something I have not heard on any of the 20+ other Rory albums I have. On one song there is an interesting double tracked vocal which, again, gives it an uncharacteristic pop flavour.  Despite this there are some excellent tracks. My favourites are tracks 9 - 12: Fuel to the Fire, Wheels Within Wheels [Alternate Version], Cut a Dash and Out on the Tiles. In fact I regularly listen with great satisfaction to those 4 tracks over and over. Out on the Tiles uses a great sounding \\"Hendrix\\" chord which I think out-Hendrix's Hendrix.  The live album is good, but not great. It shows the direction Rory obviously wanted to take in paring the band down to a threesome and going for high energy/hard rock versions of his current and past repertoire. Don't get me wrong I am a through and through Rory fan but after 1978, probably due to the punk influence, he left his more bluesy and 'softer' side and if you want ENERGY you will love the live album too. For me though, it's too much of a change from his earlier versions.  All said, I recommend this to all Rory fans, both pre- and post-1978 fans will get a great CD from this package.

B003ZHVJFK|2.0|\\"Tekken\\" (meaning \\"Iron Fist\\") is a live-action film of popular fighting game series. Some of you will say \\"Not again.\\" Back in the 90s we saw terrible \\"Street Fighter\\" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and more recently, equally terrible \\"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.\\" Good news is that at least the leading star of the new film Jon Foo can do martial arts action, if not as charismatic as Jet Li. Bad news is, well, none of the filmmakers seems to know how to shoot action scenes.   \\"Tekken\\" is set in the near futuristic dystopian world. North America is under control of the powerful Mishima Zaibatsu, which also hosts a martial arts tournament \\"The King of Iron Fist Tournament.\\" Having lost his mother Jun (Tamlyn Tomita), a young fighter Jin (Jon Foo) enters the \\"kill-or-be-killed\\" competition, seeking revenge on the man who is responsible for her death: Heihachi Mishima (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa).  The story is silly, I know. But all we want is exiting action, and the film has a few decent set-pieces in the first half of the film. Luke Goss as Jin's manager is pretty good. Kelly Overton as Christie Monteiro, a fighter and love interest (yes, she is) is not bad. I also admire Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa for not refusing to do the character's unique hairstyle.  [Minor Spoiler in This Paragraph]  However, the film gets worse as it reaches the film's underwhelming wrap-up. Action scenes become repetitive. Characters tend to repeat the same moves, and worst of all, martial arts sequences, which should be the center of the movie, are interrupted by gunshots ... twice! And as to the Williams sisters, one of them just stands and does nothing else. I don't see the point of turning a video game into a film in this way.

His stories are powered with a knowledge and understanding of real science that goes far beyond most writers of this genre. His over 50 years of writing produced an amazing array of books and stories, comics and magazines and inspired so many others. This book represents a great collection to get started with if you do not know his writing, or creates a wonderful feeling of nostalgia if you do. While his writing is certainly not the best out there the stories are original and engaging like few others. A must buy for all who like science fiction.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is a fantastic debut novel by a writer to watch.  While not a perfect novel, it ranks high on my list for the year.<br /><br />The novel opens beautifully:<br />The circus arrives without warning.  No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers.  It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.<br /><br />The book is about a contest between two illusionists who have been trained since childhood by their masters.  Set in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the players, Celia and Marco, spend their lives battling in a game, the rules of which they do not know.  The forum for the contest is a circus, Le Cirque des Reves, a travelling circus that opens at nightfall and closes at dawn.  Celia's father, a famed illusionist, takes custody of her as a young child and trains her for this contest.  Marco is plucked out of an orphanage and trained by a mysterious man.  In the circus, they create magical (not slight of hand) illusions that dazzle attendees.  The contestants know they are in a contest but don't know each other (for at least a while) and are inextricably bound to each other.  Over the course of the novel, they learn about themselves, the contest, others affected by the contest and each other.<br /><br />The writing beautifully captures the magical and ephemeral quality of the characters' existence.  The novel jumps through several time periods and to many different locations, further creating the feeling of an illusion.  The chapters are well constructed, not too long, and full of movement.  At no point does Morgenstern wander into long (or short) boring narratives.  Morgenstern is a painter, and her novel feels like it is a painting.  She masterfully employs color to create moods.<br /><br />Where the novel came up a bit short is at the ending.  It was good and brought closure but it lacked the richness that filled the rest of the novel.  In an interview, Morgenstern said that creating scenes and images are her strength, not plot.  For a debut novelist, she admirably handled all of it but the plot came up a bit short  at the end.<br /><br />Usually, I do not love \\"magical realism\\" books.  This is an exception.  The advance buzz for this book was immense; the novel held up to expectations.  Comparisons have been drawn to Harry Potter, Twilight and other magical universe books.  I would recommend reading this book.  It is enjoyable and will be the first of many from Morgenstern.and images are her strength, not plot.

B004XNGKBS|4.0|I've actually been using this app for a while now prior to getting it on Amazon with an older Android device that has a resistive screen and a stylus. This is the best note-taking app I have found for hand-written notes.  It works well, with a clever system where you can write full-sized words, but when you finish writing, it shrinks down your text to fit on a line of the page.  Unfortunately, the interface is pretty unpolished, and really kinda ugly. Also, writing on the screen still definitely takes some getting used to, it's a very different experience from writing on paper.  Overall, well worth the purchase, as when you find yourself scrambling to write down a phone number or other short bit of information, nothing beats the speed of just scribbling it down.

B005DKLPF6|4.0|The Hunter is the long-anticipated follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:B001R4MEYS Crack the Skye]], one of Mastodon's finest achievements in their career. After exploring the limits of progressive songwriting with complex arrangements, excellent vocal melodies, and a perfect balance between heavy and melodic passages, the band decided to pursue a different musical style with their new release.<br /><br />This album marks an important step in the band's evolution. It was mixed and produced by Mike Elizondo whose resume includes non-metal artists like Dr Dre, Eminem, and 50 Cent. Worry not, though, the mix is spectacular and the sound clarity amazing (though I prefer the more dynamic production on their earlier work by far). However, Elizondo has definitely pushed Mastodon into writing shorter and less complex songs with heavier emphasis on melodic chord progressions and hook-filled arrangements. There is not a single song that reaches six minutes; the writing is more immediate and to the point. Actually, many of the songs are around the three-minute mark, with \\"Blasteroid\\" being even shorter: a punk-infested drive, simple yet powerful guitar work, and melodic vocals balanced out by aggressive singing make up the composition.<br /><br />The stylistic change in the band's sound and style cannot be entirely attributed to their new producer, however. They also have a new cover artist and they've changed their method of writing. While albums like Blood Mountain and Crack the Skye were painstakingly composed and took a long time to produce, The Hunter was recorded in only a few weeks. Also, the songs were largely written on the road while the band was on tour with Alice In Chains. The album sees Mastodon liberating themselves from conceptual boundaries. Rather than exploring more complex themes and writing everything under that theme, this time around, they've written songs that are independent of each other, songs that stand on their own.<br /><br />The band's enigmatic lyrics and approach to constructing riffs and melodies is fully intact with a few exceptions. \\"Curl of the Burl\\" starts with the line \\"I killed a man cause he killed my goat,\\" a song whose swaggering groove was possibly inspired by a Queens of the Stone Age track. There are more overt references to their inspirations: I hear lots of Neil Peart-like drum fills by Brann Dailor whose performance is uniformly stunning on this disc. His playing on \\"Octopus Has No Friends\\" is impossibly tasty, and his tone is amazing. The song deploys an epic build-up with powerful vocals and deep-in-the-pocket rhythms. The way the cascades of guitars work to the anthemic chorus is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />The band also pays tribute to Pink Floyd in more than one track. \\"Stargasm\\" (with lyrics about sex in space!) is informed by Floydian synth swells eventually dissolving under thunderous drum attacks and liquidy instrumental passages while \\"Creature Lives\\" is unlike anything they have done before. It mixes tons of sampled voices, lots of keyboard effects, odd tonalities, and deep bass notes to achieve a unique sound with syrupy vocal lines, but honestly, it's not what I expect of Mastodon. I love experimental music, but I consider this one among their least interesting.<br /><br />There are also similarities to their previous work. The band continues to pen personal lyrics as they did on Crack the Skye. The title track is about the unexpected death of guitarist Brent Hinds' brother while hunting (actually the working title of this album was Brother, but the band decided to go with The Hunter eventually). With acoustic guitars from the shadows, keys mistily creeping through the song, and plaintive vocals, the song morphs into a Lep Zeppelin-inspired blues guitar solo that consumes you. And the lyrics will scar your soul.<br /><br />Similarly, the final track, \\"The Sparrow,\\" commemorates the loss of a friend of the band's. It is extremely personal, as the lyrics \\"Pursue happiness withdiligence\\" are her words. This is arguably the finest closing track on any Mastodon album due to its emotional breadth.

0553801473|5.0|I was quite skeptical because I did see so many bad reviews. However, I LOVE THIS BOOK. For me, this is the best one in the series. Martin truly delivers with a climatic ending.Unsure why so many didn't like it. I will give no spoilers, but if you can appreciate a truly great work of art, than read this book. One of the best written fantasy books I've read in a long time.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Grace for Drowning eclipses Steven Wilson's first solo album both in scope and composition. It covers a broader spectrum of sounds. While [[ASIN:B001O2ZW1A Insurgentes]] was heavily inspired by Wilson's love for 80s new-wave music, borrowing musical traits from Talking Heads, Joy Division, and The Cure, this album harkens back to the early 70s, with songs being highly experimental, much darker, and a lot more progressive.<br /><br />Having worked on a lot of early King Crimson material lately, there is no denying that some of the influence has crept into Steven Wilson's songwriting vision. This album is more daring in its approach to melody construction and flow. There are a lot of jazzy elements with extended passages for improvised instrumental bliss. Thanks to the jazz-inflicted drumming, there is plenty of dialogue between the soloists, but the Steven Wilson sound is fully intact. The compositions are characterized by dense soundscapes, but each piece is fragmented with lush, easier-to-digest instrumentation. The tension-filled \\"Sectarian\\" involves utterly dark acoustic guitars underscored by eerie percussion, tense silences, weird stop-start riffing at once bringing to mind a strange marriage between Univers Zero and Thinking Plague, but the second half is very accessible due to the sudden shift of mood highlighting the blend of the jazzy piano and Mellotron swells.<br /><br />Some tracks start and end abruptly while others serve as shorter pieces that tie them together. Wilson sets melting pianos and rising synth modulations against melodic constructs. However, the tracks lack tonal centres, and there is a vast array of electric and acoustic beats with shades of texture placed into sparse arrangements. There is no hierarchy of pitches focusing on a central note. Rather, the notes function independently of each other without adhering to tonal principles. This obviously makes some of the songs a more demanding yet at the same time more rewarding listen.<br /><br />At face value, some fans may write the album off as meandering, too slow, or too long, but this album seems very defined beneath the surface. Yes, it is long, but Steven Wilson chose to spread it over two 40-minute discs, rather than cramming it all onto a single CD. He hopes fans will tackle each album independently instead of trying to take all of it in at one sitting. The first disc is a little more song-oriented while the second one is darker and more experimental. That said, there are songs on each disc that are coterminous with each other. The short two-minute instrumental \\"Raider Prelude\\" on the first disc is actually just a foreshadowing of the 20-plus-minute progressive epic \\"Raider II\\" from the second CD. This monstrous composition recalls [[ASIN:B002LLE3PY Lizard]]-era King Crimson in terms of ambition and breadth. Replete with Jordan Rudess' electric piano interludes and Mellotron-infested sound manipulations, it boasts cascades of guitars resolving with odd-time signatures under hypnotic, trance-like passages. All the while, Theo Travis' coiling flute and sax lines weave in and out of the dissonant composition, deconstructing it to its calm finale.<br /><br />Do not listen to this album in hopes of figuring out in which tunes the stunning list of guest musicians play. Jordan Rudess' contribution to the album is very uncharacteristic for him. His Grand piano on \\"Deform to Form a Star\\" sounds nothing like he's done in Dream Theater, perhaps because the song puts the piano in the back in favour of Wilson's stunning vocals following a silvery guitar solo. Similarly, Tony Levin's bass is utilized for a strong low-end here. Unless you're a crazy fan of King Crimson's criminally underrated album [[ASIN:B000VQQMIW The ConstruKction of Light]] and the dazzling [[ASIN:B00008BXJF The Power to Believe]], you won't notice it's Pat Mastolotto playing on the Blackfield-like \\"No Part of Me,\\" whose instrumental break is punctuated by Trey Gunn's heavier-than-everything Warr guitar.<br /><br />The only song that will give away its guest is probably \\"Remainder the Black Dog\\" with Steve Hackett providing his unique, gorgeous fretwork. Hackett is easy to distinguish because of his tone and phrasing: he juxtaposes fusion-inflicted notes with dissonant melodies before allowing a groove-locked bass solo to shake the very grounds you stand on. It's a killer song that evokes Wilson's work on No-Man's [[ASIN:B00008J2RB Returning Jesus]] in places, but this one is more chaotic and heavier.<br /><br />Also, there is the beautifully crafted, chilling dark pop of \\"Postcard\\" which sounds like Blackfield crossed with Steven Wilson's 'daily life' lyrics delivered over a haunting piano-acoustic guitar theme and the more modern-sounding \\"Index\\" where Wilson emotes spoken vocals with narcotic melodies and Mastelotto's rolling drum beat accompaniment. All throughout, the mix and production are ingenious, possibly Wilson's best.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album is inspired by stories of people who have had near death experiences, particularly with drowning. It is about the state of calm one gets into after the struggling, but the title may also be a metaphor for 'drowning' in the stress and speed of modern city life, which has been the subject matter of many of Wilson's recent songs.<br /><br />If I were forced to make a choice for a single album in the experimental progressive genre, I would be torn between this album and Garden Wall's Assurdo. Grace for Drowning is some of the most beautiful music I have heard this year. Beautiful in a strange way.<br /><br />(This is also a very personal album for Steven Wilson. In the liner notes, he dedicates it to his father, who he lost earlier this year.)ill give away its guest is probably \\"Remainder the Black Dog\\" with Steve Hackett providing his unique, gorgeous fretwork.

B005IY3DP2|4.0|When I first heard Velociraptor (?), I was rather disappointed to say the least. Besides the strange title and blah cover art, it felt lazy and pretentious. The jaded rock star disease had set in.  NOW,(thankfully) after a good mass of listens without annoyances, I've done a pure 180. It's excellent to say the least. If you're having problems with it at first, keep listening and will soon notice the very tasty and subtle genius.    I'm hoping the band will be taking a nice long holiday before the tour of the states in '12......there will be a tour in the states, right? RIGHT?!!  HOT CUTS:  Let's Roll Just Like We Used To...A perfect opener.  Days Are Forgotten... Nice and crunchy! Mmm...not quite sure about the pygmy/blues impersonation to close song though.  La Fee Verte...A no apologies Beatles rip that's perfectly Kasabianized.   Velociraptor.....Weak title, but a sweet and punky 2:51 minutes.  Acid Turkish Bath...No idea what it's about, but it's a beautifully constructed song.  A Man Of Simple Pleasures...All I can say is 'meme-roos'...great cut.  Switchblade Smiles.....A total Kasabian scorcher.  WARM SLICES:  Rewired...Starts out like ZZTop, (super scary) but as usual, they pull it all back in and save it.  Neon Noon....All's well except for the synth in this one. IMNSHO.  JURY STILL OUT:  Goodbye Kiss....It's a bit cheddary, don't you think?  I Hear Voices...Cannot make up my mind as at first it reminded me of Depeche Mode just after they finished shooting up. Now, if I can get beyond the 1979 drum machine, it's slowly grows on me like a moss.  Nevertheless, Kasabian has done it again.  Thanks guys.

0545259088|4.0|Let me start by saying I adored this series!!! However I did feel a bit unsatisfied and even a little cheated at the end. It actually still left me wanting more. I wish there would have been more of a conclusion I needed more of an ending and less left hanging. I am kind of hoping that maybe the auther will come back to this book and maybe write one more to show us where our beloved characters are in life and how they are doing. I can only hope that that is why she left us hanging and wondering. It was a very good book just the ending left me saying no way is this really  how it ends. That said it is still one of my favorite series. I loved how Maggie made me fall in love with Cole and Isabel even when I didn't start out that way!! Thanks for the amazing books I can't wait to see what else you have for me to read:
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I've been saying forever that George Lucas' strategy is simple, keep updating the original Star Wars movies (4-6) and p*ss off the fans who keep buying them over and over.  Eventually he will release the original special editions (AGAIN) because the fans WILL BUY THEM AGAIN.  Booya, he just released them and will make another cool couple million.  I haven't bought a single Star Wars DVD, still watching the old VHS.  Don't worry, the ORIGINAL ORIGINALS will come soon.  George Lucas, taking advantage of the fans for every penny they have.  What an angel.    From the grapevine, these releases are coming soon too:  The Complete Trilogy 3D/HD/Blue Ray (Special Editions Only)  Individual Movies 3D (Special Editions)  Complete Trilogy (Special Features and Interviews)  Complete Trilogy #10 (Updated scenes and new 3D scenes)  Complete Trilogy x14 (Original Trilogy in HD and 3D sequencing Editions)  The Special Edition HD/Trilogy x3 (with bonus features, DUH)  And guess what?  The fans will buy them again.......and again........and again........and again.  ..and you know I'm right......
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have never laughed so hard. This book portrays both her hilarious attitude, and her inspirational outlooks on life. From the first page, my gut hurt from laughter, and it continued throughout all the pages. Her pop culture references and funny metaphors provided my life with excitement. Never before did I think that reading about someone's life could be so funny.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Blues rockers Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa collaborate on this offering of soul covers and the result is pure magic. Considering the quality of the originals this was a gutsy project. It's a delightful mix of soul, blues, rock, jazz and gospel. Beth burns with passion and sings her heart out and Bonamassa's playing is impeccable.   From the opening track of the bluesy Sinner's Prayer with the great guitar riff and Beth's out of this world vocals you know you're in for a treat. Some of the songs are sultry ballads with string arrangements and beautifully haunting guitar. The tongue-in-cheek Chocolate Jesus is pure fun. For My Friends is a powerful blues rocker. I'd Rather Go Blind is amazing - emotive vocals and guitar build to a crescendo. Something's Got A Hold On Me is upbeat times a hundred - some real gospel/soul - and if it doesn't make you want to dance, you must be dead. I'll Take Care of You is a beautiful ballad with a brilliant guitar solo at the end that catapults the energy level. Well Well is incredibly catchy and the only duet on the album.   It's hard to pick highlights because the entire album is a highlight. Beth's vocals are outstanding, sassy, fun, versatile and always right for the song - whether she brings out all the power and rasp of her voice or sings as smooth as silk. Joe's playing is stunning, flawless, pitch perfect and nuanced. The vocals and musicianship are really unparalleled. This is a masterpiece and I can only pray there will be more to come from this partnership.   The covers are as follows: Sinner's Prayer (Ray Charles w/BB King), Chocolate Jesus (Tom Waits), Your Heart is as Black as Night (Melody Gardot), For My Friends (Bill Withers), Don't Explain (Billie Holiday), I'd Rather Go Blind (Etta James), Something's Got a Hold on Me (Etta James), I'll Take Care of You (Brook Benton), Well Well (Delaney and Bonnie), Ain't No Way (Aretha Franklin).

The other tracks are on my IPOD also; however, Layla is the one that stands out.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|Like all fruits how can one say which is better? Thus, the obvious comparison of Hanna with Dragon Tattooed Girl trilogy and Kick-Ass girl all of which, to their credits, showed unique and creative storytelling. But, if a choice has to be made then Kick-Ass has an edge with the awe/cool factor. Their are several reasons why this female assassin fell a little short of five star greatness such as the following: First, the background story seemed a little holey as in too many holes to be totally coherent and thus envelop the viewers. Second, the genetic manipulation could have been more educative, which that field is, and less dumb photo montage and thus make the story more believably incredible. Third, for a girl of such potential she seemed to vacillate between super skill and super dumb actions/decisions. Fourth, the action scenes which are what the movie ultimately is to be judged upon were stereotypically bland and inconsistent. Fifth, the alternate ending should have been added after the final kill.   On the positive side the cinematography was creative with angles, field of view, light and color. The locations and sets were outstanding from Finland to Morocco and finally a little Grimms' bad wolf as the final set. The story was creative despite the holes. The acting was excellent especially Saoirse as Hanna who showed good athleticism which is a bonus for a lead female actor in an action film. In fact, her sprinting technique indicates a potential track star.   Sequel would not be a bad decision.
B005ELZKWS|4.0|It's annoying to me when people say \\"it's good, but it's not like the last album\\".  But when it sounds like the last album, then people say \\"oh, they're not creative.  It's a copy of the last album\\".  Well this is not stagnant by any means.  Considering that Chickenfoot is basically a side project for all these guys, I'm impressed with their creativity.  And toss in there that Chad Smith recorded the new RHCP album then jumped back over to record Chickenfoot III, and is now getting ready to tour with RHCP.  I loved the first album a lot.  It did feel to me like just some guys getting together and having fun, nothing too serious etc.  This release however seems to have more thought put into it.  They've taken on a few current subjects in an interesting fashion, i.e. the current unemployment picture for a lot of people.  This one also feels like they've stretched their wings (no pun intended!) a bit lyrically and accoustically.  It's not all \\"volume maxed out\\" type songs.  One track \\"Somthing Gone Wrong\\" which has some accoustic guitar that I had to back up and listen to again.  It's good, damn good.  Then there's Sammy's vocals.  He's gone and pushed himself a bit.  Some lower tone vocals on a couple tracks surprised me that he'd even go outside what seems like his comfort zone.  All in all, I'm once again thrilled that I could buy great rock music for a reasonable price.  Yes, I said \\"buy\\".  I actually BOUGHT the CD/DVD combo at a local electronics store.  I could have got it for free easily, but I've come to the point that if an artist gives me great entertainment at a price that is reasonable, I'm buying.  And given the exhileration I had at the Denver stop on their first tour and for the price? I'm all over it again next round.  Keep it coming 'Foot! I'm hooked.  Just don't start charging $100 for tickets through Ticket*astard with their rediculous fees, and I'll keep coming and bringing my friends!  This isn't Rolling Stones type music. They've been irrelevant for more than 20 years but people still buy tickets.  The 'Foot on the other hand is showing on their second release that they're creativity hasn't faded a bit.  Satriani's guitar...well, what can be said that hasn't been said?  Amazing stuff, leaves me almost speachless.  Anthony's bass playing is always reliable, but he comes out a lot more on the vocals side on this disc and it sounds great.  Seems to add more depth to the songs.  Not much ado is made of drummers these days, but I have to say that I believe Chad Smith is on par with the likes of Neal Peart, Charlie Watts, or Carter Beauford - all of which are amazing drummers in my book.  Smith is able to switch between bands with very different styles and put together percussion sets that fit artistically and beautifully.  Hagar just seems to weave his vocals all around these rock hero's without ever stepping on anyone.  He's a master of that I've always felt and his talent shines better on this disc than the first release in my opinion.  More creativity, more range.  More impressive.  The DVD that came with my CD consisted mostly of videos that had already been on the band's web site, but there is still some extra stuff that is worth viewing.  It's fun to hear them talk about the writing and recording, but they are also giving a sales pitch.  I guess I'm ok with that considering what I've paid for some great rock jams from these guys.  I have to say, I'm usually not impressed with heavy marketing of things like music but I have really enjoyed the web site, the commercial I saw on tv the other night, and I alway enjoy Hagar's overly enthusiastic sound bites.  If I had his talent, I think I'd live my life just like he is.  If you liked the first CD, you're going to like this one too.  Just don't expect it to be a carbon copy of the first disc.  Even old rockers like to explore new ground.  Go out and buy this one, it's well worth it.  You'll get a free pair of 3D glasses as a souvenir!

B001FSDOZO|4.0|I am going to admit that I wasn't much of a Nickelback fan until the All the Right Reasons album. This one is almost as good. There are several songs you can jam to on this album. I have read a lot of reviews that state that these guys are \\"too generic\\" and their songs lyrics are \\"amateurish at best\\", but I have to disagree. Nickelback's track record is solid and this album only justifies their status as one of the best bands to ever come out of Canada. I'd give this album a little higher rating, but a few songs are a little too risque for younger listeners.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus won't be the same without Andy Whitfield.  He was the heart and soul of this series.  That said, if you never had the opportunity to watch this on Starz, get this DVD of the first season.  It is amazing to watch for women as well as men.  Very beautifully done, some intense scenes but nothing too bad to keep from watching it.  RIP Andy......
B005K2KCPG|5.0|It seems that anything Sammy Hagar is involved with has an energy and vibe that just makes you want to party.  I mean come on, the guy is going to be 63.  That's why he's called the Red Rocker.  This album is no exception.  It has that same energy and coupled with other band members of their own stature.  It's a no brainer this is a Superband of rock! Great album, it's a must have!  Andy'5150' - Cincinnati
B0058VA2U4|5.0|With Joey B back at the helm handling the lead vocals what else could this album be but truly epic. This album has killer riffs, excellent song writing (although the album sat on the shelf for like 3 plus years) and lastly it is simply the best work from Anthrax since \\"Among the living\\". Really this album could have been entitled \\"Among the living 2\\" but I am glad the group went with another title. This is the 3rd best Anthrax release ever only ones that are better are \\"Among the living\\" and \\"Spreading the Disease\\". Best tracks are \\"Judas Priest\\", \\"The Devil you Know\\", and lastly \\"I'm Alive\\". How could anyone score this album anything but a FIVE seriously come on Anthrax was really the last true metal band to come out of the \\"U.S\\" in the late 80's that was part of the thrash metal moment.  Some say they were part of the rap metal movement but having two songs over four albums that were semi rap related doesn't classify a group as rap metal. Anthrax is a thrash/speed metal group and will remain that way to the end.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I loved this book - to me it was the grownup version of the Twilight saga in that it had a lot more substance to the storyline.  Yes it is essentially a love story but throw in history, academia, wine appreciation, art & literacy appreciation and wonderful supporting characters and I found myself reading a book that I didn't want to put down.  I can only assume that Deborah Harkness is writing the sequel because if she isn't there will be a lot of disappointed readers out there that are currently desperate to find out what happened next to Diana & Matthew!
B005CGI4EG|4.0|Everything is as described by the previous review. All the seasons are on two giant spindles protected by a cardboard on top of each spindle.

B005IY3DP2|5.0|Songwriter Sergio Pizzorno has been stating that Velociraptor! is Kasabian's \\"jukebox record,\\" and on the first listen, I understood what he meant.  To me it feels like a Master's Thesis in rock and roll; Kasabian's take on almost every genre for the past 50 years.  There's the electro-club dance piece (\\"I Hear Voices\\"), the hip hop influenced one (\\"Days Are Forgotten\\"), the techno-industrial headbanger (\\"Switchblade Smiles\\"), the 80s hair-band big rocker (\\"Re-wired\\").  With such a wide range of styles, there is something for almost everyone to appreciate.  But the truly amazing thing about Velociraptor! is that it is such a unified work for something so ambitiously diverse.  It gelled for me immediately, but I know a number of people who have said that it's a grower, that it takes a few listens before it really starts to impress.      There are two things which hold it together - the first and most obvious is the quality of the songwriting.  Serge Pizzorno is the man when it comes to writing catchy rock hooks.  But it's deceptively simple - a deeper examination reveals the subtle touches on every piece: a syncopated handclap, the sound of a typewriter, a burst of orchestration, a new attention to the gorgeous harmonies created when Pizzorno's soaring voice wraps around Meighan's earthy vocals (as in the chorus to \\"Let's Roll Just Like We Used To\\"), or the opposite, when Pizzorno's dreaminess is grounded by Meighan (\\"Acid Turkish Bath\\").  Each song is built around a melody, simple, pristine, a big chorus seemingly heading to an apparent culmination, only to have the listener's expectations confounded when the piece twists in an entirely different direction - or two, or three.  It's like the movie plot you know you've seen before, which then takes a sudden left turn to a conclusion more satisfying for the surprise.  Kasabian has often been accused of being derivative, but that's just careless listening.  The band may be unafraid to flaunt its past influences, but they gain new meaning in this different context, in juxtaposition with other influences - which is Pizzorno's real genius.  He's a mad scientist in a rock and roll laboratory, splicing together genes from Britpop, traditional Middle Eastern music, even Motown to create rare and beautiful chimeras.  This has always been Kasabian's method - on Velociraptor! it's raised to a new level of artistry.  The other impressive aspect is the way the album is structured.  It starts with a gong and a piece about boyhood friendships (\\"Let's Roll Just Like We Used To\\").  It ends with ethereal synths and a piece contemplating eternity (\\"Neon Noon\\").  In between, it ranges from hot sex (\\"Re-wired\\") to heartbreak (\\"Goodbye Kiss\\"), from world-weary dissolution (\\"La Fee Verte\\") to mature self-assertion (\\"Man of Simple Pleasures\\").  All this sounds so serious - but it's set against a background of over-the-top rock grandstanding, and quite a bit of cheeky humor.  The album is punctuated with the occasional dinosaur growl from Pizzorno, while Meighan delivers the infectiously silly chorus of the title track, \\"Velociraptor/He gonna find ya/He gonna kill ya/He gonna eat ya,\\" with an intensity appropriate for the second coming of Mick Jagger.  And Velociraptor! isn't beyond a sneaky gut-punch...the placement of the punk-pop title track after the dreamy \\"Fee Verte\\" is sheer genius - yes, Tom and Serge, I'm awake now!  I usually consider myself queen of the mix tape, but I'm very reluctant to listen to any of these pieces out-of-context - I want to hear Velociraptor! in its entirety.  I've actually been trying not to listen to Velociraptor! too much, for fear I'll tire of it...but I realized this morning that it doesn't matter since it's been playing in my head straight on from the first time I heard it.  I suppose that's the biggest compliment you can pay to any record.

Each distrusts the other but soon need to protect each other's back from a dangerous cover-up as the military are uninterested in the facts; their preference is for a local hillbilly to take the rap.  However, Reacher becomes incompliant when he learns Janice is the third female to have been killed by this slasher.<br /><br />The latest Reacher thriller (see Worth Dying For) is an exciting throwback tale to when the heroic vigilante was still in the Army.  Ironically though going back to the case that led to his leaving the military, there is not much new added to the Reacher mythos.  Still the story line is fast-paced and filled with action as Reacher learns what happens to officers doing their duty with personal courage vs. those with DC connections.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B005NA3B8U|4.0|says it all. was a huge fan of the arcade version of this back in the day, thrilled to find it. the only constructive criticism I have, keeping it at 4 stars, is better graphics.  all in all, easily worth 99&cent;, the best space game out there.
B0034G4P80|5.0|The packaging was excellent and the movie was of great quality. i will purchase other items from this company in the future.
B005HPA2XI|4.0|Mastodon's discography is filled with long, progressive concept records. [[ASIN:B001R4MEYI Crack the Skye]] doesn't have a song below five minutes, two of them even cracking ten minutes.  They've said from the beginning that The Hunter was an intended effort to let loose a little bit. So I'm not surprised that it's as inconsequential as it is. The music is still damn good and the album is full of great hooks and fun moments. But this is a band that I know can produce more so I can't help but have a hard time wholly embracing The Hunter. If this is something they needed to get out of their system so be it. I can see it working well in a live setting and in the end I'd rather they do something like this than burn out faster than they should. But I don't think I could listen to much more than an album or two in this style before starting to lose my faith a bit.
1595828095|5.0|I got an advanced reading copy of this book through NetGalley.com.  I had seen Berni's artwork before and was anxious to read some of his stories.  I really enjoyed this and now I wonder why I never read anything by him before!<br /><br />This collection of Bernie Wrightson's work is broken into three parts.  The first contains Bernie's independent works: The Black Cat, Jenifer, Clarice, Country Pie, Dick Swift and His Electric Power Ring, Martian Saga, and the Laughing Man.  The second part contains stories that were featured in the Creepy Stories series of comics: The Pepper Lake Monster, Nightfall, Cool Air, Reuben Youngblood-Private Eye, and The Muck Monster.  The third part features Bernie's covers from both Creepy Stories and Eerie Stories comic book collections.<br /><br />There are some wonderful stories in here and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It made me want to go out and by more things by Berni.  His stories have a very HP Lovecraft or Eager Allen Poe feeling to them; in fact some are retellings of stories by those writers.  Some highlights for me were Black Cat (a wonderful creepy story about a black cat that drives a man insane), Jenifer(super creepy but strangely ironic story about what happens to men who find Jenifer in the woods), Martian Saga (a hilarious poem about a man landing on Mars), The Pepper Lake Monsters (about a man fighting a sea monster, again very darkly funny), and The Muck Monster (only color story of the bunch, Frankenstein-like story with a twist).<br /><br />These stories are pretty much all horror stories/poems.  They are very dark and many of them have a very morbid sense of humor about them.  Lots of irony in these and I was definitely laughing out loud a few times.  I guess if you have a bit of a twisted sense of humor you will really enjoy these.<br />The artwork is creepy and absolutely amazing.  So much detail and such beautiful drawing.  The mood of the drawing fits the stories perfectly.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful collection for both fans of Berni's art and for people interested in the horror end or fantasy or urban fantasy.  The artwork is fantastic and the stories are dark yet ironic and humorous in turns.  Definitely worth checking out.  See below for brief summaries of each story included in this collection.<br /><br />The Black Cat - Wonderfully done.  Creepy story about a black cat that drives a man insane.

B005C5A6C0|5.0|The word masterpiece traditionally applies to the single greatest work of an artist's life. For instance, even though I personally prefer [[ASIN:B000002H2H Ride the Lightning]] the vast (and I mean VAST) majority would say that [[ASIN:B000002H33 Master of Puppets]] is Metallica's masterpiece. I would be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't believe [[ASIN:B000N3ST9I The Blackening]] to be Machine Head's masterpiece. It's the best album of the last decade, let alone their work. Well, I stand before you a conflicted man because I think Unto the Locust is best described as a masterpiece too. I don't know if I could put it above The Blackening, at least not yet. I've had four years to sit on and enjoy that album over and over again. But Locust is at the very least yet another major and important album from the Bay Area Kings and cements their place among the the major thrash bands like Slayer and yes even Metallica.   Whereas The Blackening felt very cohesive stylistically and blended together nearly perfectly Unto the Locust is a much more divided album stylistically. There are acoustic guitars. There's a children's choir (made up, I'm told, of the kids of the band members). The album begins with a full out sonata with three movements. Machine Head doesn't have anything left to prove to us. They've overcome the dark days of the [[ASIN:B00005A46S Supercharger]] era and are headlining major festivals like Wacken Open Air. Unto the Locust is an expression of that confidence. They're free to play around with what ever styles and methods they choose and they do so wonderfully. This is some of the most blistering, intense metal you're going to encounter. Dave McClain's drumming is INSANE on this album, particularly in the album closer Who We Are. Robb Flynn is more assured vocally and has begun to bring clean vocals into the mix with great success. I can't say Machine Head can do no wrong. They have in the past more than once. But instead of becoming bogged down they haveovercome and are now a major name, one that should be now permanently associated with the highest caliber of this genre's talent.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|bought this at a local music store for the same price listed on amazon.  the original tag is $160.  this is NOT worth $160.  Frankly, disc 6 is my favorite and i'm happy to hear a pre-dsotm edit.  loved having \\"that hard way\\" loaded up along with the other gems on this disc.    the marbles? wtf? the scarf??  the coasters (that only a fool would crack into and use)... too many odd gimmicks.  the books, while they look nice and pretty are a joke.  honestly, the die hards that will buy this set will want the music - old and \\"new\\"  the music outweighs the novelty.  collectible marbles though?  did i miss something?
0385528752|5.0|These guys have a heck of a franchise.  Their books are terrific.  Easy to read, informative and you feel like you can take the information and do something. Can't wait for the next book
030745455X|5.0|(NO MAJOR SPOILERS) This section of the trilogy, even more than the first book, rides completely on getting to know the personalities involved and how each one approaches the A-story. I'm seeing lots of complaints of too much exposition; I assume from those who require lots of action sequences to hold their attention. Instead, the suspense comes from what you know of the characters involved and how each one reads, or grossly misreads, the other. This one centers more around Salander than the first and we get many more glimpses into how she came to be the person that she is.<br /><br />As with the first book, if you're looking for lots of action this is not for you. It is however a fantastic psychological ride. What is this person going to do about X? How did that person react to Y? Once again, we get to know the personas not as much through what they're feeling, but more what they're thinking and doing. Definitely a unique writing style!<br /><br />To that end, I've been rather disappointed in the Sweedish versions of the films - Noomi Rapace's outstanding characterization not withstanding. Perhaps that is because the core plot, on its own, is not particularly unique as mysteries go. What gives this story its dimension is the exposition, which is difficult to work into a 2-hour film. This story most definitely works far better as a novel than as a movie.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Two years after the bachelor party in Las Vegas, the \\"Wolf Pack\\" jet to Thailand for Stu's wedding to Lauren. The plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however goes seriously awry.<br /><br />The guys go down to the beach for a quite drink with Lauren's younger brother Teddy and wake up in Bangkok with NO idea how they got there. They find part of a finger with Teddy's ring on it and set out to find him. The Wolf Pack go from one disaster to another as they go deeper and deeper into Bangkok's dark underbelly. (Ken Jeong) is great as the hapless gangster.<br /><br />Make sure to watch the credits at end of the movie so you can see the how seedy the BKK night-life really is.<br /><br />Endless gross humour, f-bombs, violence and a drug dealing capuchin monkey.
B004EJUMT2|4.0|Sounds amazing blasting through some good speakers.  This is the kinda album you listen to VERY LOUD.  Love the guitars: thick, heavy, crunchy, and sometimes pulled back to allow the melodies to take over.  That's another intriguing thing about this album: how surprisingly melodic it is while still retaining it's metal elements.  One of my favorites this year!
0198326769|4.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was given to me by a dear friend. She was so impressed with Bruno's story that she wanted to share this heart-wrenching story with me. I found it to be both powerful and sad. I recognize the curiosity of this young boy and his desire to have a friend. His innocence and unawareness of what was going on right before his very eyes is endearing. His acceptance of his new friend Shmuel and the closeness that follows after he discovered \\"The Dot That Became a Speck That Became a Blob That Became a Figure That Became a Boy\\", grabbed my heart.  Shmuel was every bit as endearing as his own innocence shone through his every word.<br /><br />I read with pain and grief how these inquisitive little boys managed to figure out how they could play together. The fence that separated them no longer was an issue as the two eventually became one when Bruno donned the striped pajamas.  The Boy in Striped Pajamas taught me a valuable lesson. There are different kinds of fences in life that separate us from each other. In our confusion or lack of insight, we can lose sight of our true priorities and stop looking at each other through the eyes of a child. When we do, we lose sight of the true meaning to life.  The naivety and love that these two young boys shared during such tumultuous times was very refreshing to me. I wish that there could have been a happier ending but in the end, they were together.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|The product was shipped on time and was brand new. There is little to say, other than Blu Ray Discs are the highest standard of movies available and this item fits right in with the rest of the platinum content on my Blu Ray shelf. A greatly entertaining and classic film.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|So I agree this is realistic. Most of us have not been given a terminal prognosis, with an almost grown kid and a wife to leave behind. With just a science teacher's salary, and meager useless pension + benefits for them. So we dont know the depths of his desperation. His one older kid, almost grown has special needs of a physical nature. This means Dad needs more to provide, to help his son keep ahead of his physical challenge. Plus,a suprise 'change of life' baby is coming. How the lead goes from being a science teacher to the depths of what he ends up in.. is an astounding story. I am a cynical person, I find most tv and movies to be overdone or dumb. I like maybe 3-4 other TV shows. 'Lie to Me,' 'Mad Men,' the new show about a woman on the Chicago Police Force (Sept.2011) and 'House,' generally when House is at his worst. I only wish the show House did not make all pain patients seem like addicts. There are endless vets and so many other people who have real pain, and use only medication that a doctor allows. Breaking Bad has characters we can recognize, and also bits of ourselves or putz-es we have known, as well as many of the present stresses and threats around us now.  To me the subject matter is so well presented, we realize just how desperate some people are.. its not just words on the 10 o'clock news. Fear, joy, rage.. supressed emotions.. underlying thoughts..its here, its big, cant believe it showed up on AMC! A marriage where the wife does not even know her husband is terminal.. she drifts away from his moodiness. Her suspicious sister in law fans the flames. Husband is torn to shreds, seems to be dying and yet is working, traveling.. its wrenching /a show this gritty- on tv?/ who woulda thunk. I have watched it from the first episode, week by week, on AMC, until now. Yes each season is as compelling as the last. The language, the suspense, the bizarre yet believable..is continual. Its full of stunning challenge and deadlines, threats, and people caught up trying to squeak thru the worst situations.  I would not recommend it for kids..maybe about 18 years old would be better.. -if you could keep kids at 18 away from it.  That is, unless you thought your kids should see Sopranos butchering people constantly. I found Sopranos sickening and fictionally too glamorous/repetitive butchering as the price for a big home- ('so what, who cares!') But Breaking Bad is also splotched with violent bits. Volatile is the word used here on Amazon. I fear some younger people would think since one guy is not dead, and is making money, it could be a 'cool' lifestyle, instead of life and death at every turn, not exactly a lifestyle. I guess we watch and are greatful we are not this family.t up trying to squeak thru the worst situations.

B003EV6DBM|1.0|Anything I buy on here that is not 100% perfect when I buy it brand-new gets a one star rating.  That's what happened here.  I was watching the discs in order, and when I got to #3, there were skipping playback issues.  I took the disc out and looked at it, and it was gouged.  So then I looked through the remaining discs that had never been removed from the jewelbox yet ... of those, disc #5 had the same issue (the gouge on #5 looked incredibly similar to the gouge on disc #3).<br /><br />So: brand new item, 33% ruined right out of the box.<br /><br />Therefore: 1-star.<br /><br />Great show, great acting, great stories.  Terribly flawed disc manufacture process.<br /><br />I'm sending the entire thing back.
B005M1QMJA|5.0|I am a huge fan of court room drama's - Boston Legal (the whole show) [[ASIN:B000EHSVBE Boston Legal - Season One]]- was one of my all time favorites! So I was glad to find another courtroom drama, with a much younger cast and have loved all the episodes so far! Gabriel Macht fits the role well!<br /><br />We don't pay for cable TV, I get all my entertainment from Netflix, Hulu and Amazon VOD - and this is the first show that I subscribed for on Amazon and my wife watched one episode of this show and now she is hooked too!<br /><br />But haven't had a new episode for quite some time now, don't know why - did Season 1 get over after 12 episodes, so abruptly?
B002TG3C8A|5.0|Anything Rammstein is always amazing.  This product is better than amazing.  The album itself goes back to the older days in music style of Rammstein so that is a plus.

0142419400|4.0|This isn't the kind of story I normally pick up. I'm too much of a fantasy/urban fantasy fan to find a ton of enjoyment from a normal high school drama book. But this story came up on so many \\"best ofs\\" lists, I just had to give it a shot, and I certainly don't regret it.<br /><br />This truly is a story about a young woman, sent to a boarding school in France. It's about her relationships, about growing up, and ultimately about finding love. There aren't any other more intense plot themes, which was something that initially disappointed to me. There's no mystery, suspense, no masked man murdering fellow students, no ghosts haunting the halls, or vampires stalking the streets. So don't look for these elements in the story. Go into it expecting a life drama, and you'll love the book.<br /><br />The characterization in this story is lovely; I felt all of the characters were very realistic, likeable, and well thought out. Anna was a gem. She's smart, funny, and a joy to get to know. I loved seeing the world through her eyes. Her Mc. Dreamy love interest, Etienne, was truly swoon worthy. This is really their story. There were times I felt like smacking both of them, but I never felt like they were acting out of character. They stayed true to their personalities, and acted in ways I found believable. The growth of their love left me teary eyed and swoony many times along the way, and the end of the story is promised to bring a sigh out of just about every female reader.<br /><br />While I still prefer my psychotic murders, deranged ghosts, and hungry vampires, I'm very happy I took the time to read this delightful love story, and I highly recommend it to people that enjoy life dramas with heavy romance elements.
0441013597|5.0|Volume one beats Herbert's others hands down.  With intriguing political plays and fascinating twists, Dune stands alone as a stunning fantasy. Those who enjoy it might find \\"Destiny Feared\\" by K. D. Snyder a great read. Both authors are among my favorites.
0439023521|5.0|This story takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting.  Civilization has been patched together after some disaster, men gathering together for safety under the iron fisted rule of a totalitarian government.  Once a year ever district in the government has is required to provide two teenage candidates selected by lottery to take part in the Hunger Games - a sort of gladiatorial survival challenge. The winner of the games secures wealth and fame for themselves, and food and supplied for their home district for a year.  Hunger Games centers around two such \\"tributes\\" selected from a small, out of the way mining district sent to compete and die in the Games.<br /><br />Our first tribute is Katniss. It's hard not to love her.  From the earliest moments in the story we see her strength.  She's the sister that stepped up to provide for the family when her father died, and her mother was crippled by grief.  She's the one that willing volunteered to go to her death in the Hunger Games in her sister's place.  She's noble, strong, selfless, and a complete bad ass.  She's not soft - life hasn't allowed her to be.  She's actually quite brutal at times, but we find ourselves loving her despite that.<br /><br /> Then we have Peetra, the male tribute, who is kind, honest, gentle, and well spoken.  He has the heart in this story.  He's compassionate, and understanding, but seemingly soft.  Basically the perfect complement to Katniss.  I loved the interactions of these two characters - how beautifully they balanced one another.  Peetra was by far my favorite character in the whole series.  His unconditional, selfless care for everyone around him, his kindness, and his loyalty were inspirational.  At every point in this story and the ones that followed, you could rely on him to be a reliable moral compass.<br /><br />Ultimately the story centers around these two.  There are a host of well written and amazing side kicks too though - standouts for me were:<br /><br />Cinna, Kat's stylist who transformed her into a small down mining girl to the Girl Who Was on Fire.  More than any other character, I think he's what got Kat through the first part of the story.  I loved his quite care, and his seeming silent support for the rebellion.<br /><br />Rue - the tiny little girl from the agricultural district that Kat befriends during the Games.  Her sweet trust and care for Kat were so beautiful, and the most heart wrenching parts of the story centered around her.<br /><br />I could have taken or left Gale, Kat's childhood friend in this story.  He seemed more of a background character to me.  And I had a love hate relationship with Haymitch, Kat's grizzled, alcoholic mentor.  He really set me off on the wrong foot initially, but really grew on me through the story.  I loved how he and Kat seemed to understand each other's unspoken messages.<br /><br />There is not a lot of romance, especially in the first book.  There seems to be genuine care between Peetra and Katniss, but you are left constantly wondering how much of that care is real or feigned for the sake of the cameras.  In this story I felt Peetra's care was genuine, and Kat's was growing, mostly unbeknownst to herself.<br /><br />I have zero complaints with the world building in Hunger Games - which is often a point of complaint for me, so well done Ms. Collins! :D The world is dark, and brutal, not quite as much so as Enclave, but close.  I felt the author did a great job making everything very realistic and understandable.  I saw the logic behind the districts, the way the government was organized, and even the Hunger Games themselves. While initially sending kids into battle seemed silly, after I understood it as a punishment for rebellion and a chance for those kids to earn enough food to feed their whole, starving district it made perfect sense.<br /><br />Plot wise, Hunger games started off a bit slow for me - the author had to spend quite a bit of time explaining the world, establishing thecharacters, and dealing with their histories.  As such, many of the first chapters of the book centered around memories.  But around the time Peetra and Katniss were sent to the games, I found myself completely pulled into the story.  I loved the way the author described the challenges in the Games.  I literally hung on her every word through the entire experience.  And there were moments of such heartbreak and beauty.  I cried numerous times throughout the story.  By the end of the book I was completely emotionally drained, filled with both sorrow and triumph.  It was a masterfully written story that started slow and built steadily to a cathartic end.  I truly loved this book.he book centered around memories.

B003INFU2O|1.0|I never had this on vinyl or CD, but the album brings back fond memories that I can more or less remember. When I saw this picture disc, I had to have it. The quality of the pressing is so bad, I removed the LP from the turntable in less than 30 seconds in fear of destroying my $200.00 stylus!
B005F82X48|5.0|My girls and I love this CD.  I had to make several copies of it for them because they would not stop fighting over it.  I always get a kick when I go upstairs and hear them playing different songs from the same CD even though thier rooms are right across from each other.  In a world with over hyped let downs this CD will not disappoint you.  While some songs my sound like some other chick bands not all the songs will sound like that band (paramore) and lyrically are much better.  I like the fact that I can let my kids listen to it without having to sensor it.  Great CD!  Share it!  Enjoy it!
B005ELZKWS|4.0|After surprising the music industry and fans with their unexpectedly successful commercial self-titled debut (2009), Chickenfoot is back with their second album \\"III.\\" While the name of the band and the album's title may be a bit silly for obvious reasons, \\"III\\" will surely be very well received by old-school rock fans and long-suffering Van Halen fans in particular.<br /><br />Unlike the debut, when I listened to \\"III\\" I didn't think \\"super-group.\\" While I enjoyed the band's debut, the new album just seems to have a better flow and now the band sound fully cemented, much like with Velvet Revolver and Audioslave's later albums.<br /><br />Hagar, now 63 years young, is still a powerful vocalist. Maybe his voice isn't quite as smooth as it once was, but he is still a great singer and is certainly an elder statesmen of rock. Joe Satriani's playing on this album is obviously top-notch and will delight any fan of guitar rock, yet he never tries to ham-it-up or make it sound as though his playing were the centerpiece. Chad Smith and Michael Anthony provide an exciting rhythm section and, as always, it's great to hear Mike's background vocals (don't know how VH will pull off making an album without those harmonies).<br /><br />\\"III\\" gets off to a good start with the melodic \\"Last Temptation,\\" which sounds like hard rocking Van Hagar meets \\"Badmoterfinger\\" era Soundgarden. \\"Alright Alright\\" has a great sing-along chorus and wouldn't be a bad choice for the band's next single. \\"Different Devil\\" is a by-the-numbers balled, but it's pretty and effective. \\"Up Next\\" has a bit of a Zeppelin flavor and some particularly catchy guitar work. \\"Lighten Up\\" was a \\"grower\\" for me. At first I thought it was sort of filler, but I liked it better with further listens. The song may be slow to build-up, but it has a great pay-off. \\"Come Closer,\\" a bluesy balled, shows a surprisingly honest, sensitive side to the Red Rocker and reminded me of \\"Young Girl Blues,\\" a Donovan cover from his 1976 debut \\"Nine On a Ten Scale.\\" The almost spoken-word \\"Three and a Half Letters\\" offers some social commentary on the plight of down-and-out honest Middle Americans who can't seem to catch a break. While Sammy might be quite wealthy, he has always had an honest, every-man quality and the song comes off effective and sincere. \\"Big Foot,\\" the album's first single, took a few listens for me to really enjoy. Now it's one of my favorite songs on the album. It's nothing ground breaking, just a meat-and-potatoes, infectious, slinky hard-rocker that Sam/VH fans will dig. \\"Dubai Blues\\" is another good mid-tempo rocker which moves the album along. The album closes with the semi-acoustic, bluesy rocker \\"Something Going Wrong.\\" It's a very good song, although kind of a down-beat way to end the album. The bonus song \\"No Change\\" is a good rocker, but it's message about how \\"they lied\\" about all sorts of things made little sense to me. Still, it's a cool song.<br /><br />\\"III\\" may not be a masterpiece, but it is a very, very good album. \\"III\\" isn't just predictable comfort food for aging rock fans either; it gives you what you might expect at places, but also challenges the listener. If you like Van Halen and classic rock in general and are dismayed by the lack of quality music out today, \\"III\\" will give you a fix of what you need.cale.\\" The almost spoken-word \\"Three and a Half Letters\\" offers some social commentary on the plight of down-and-out honest Middle Americans who can't seem to catch a break.

1401929281|5.0|Initially purchased the Kindle version and realized this information was not only good, but probably the most powerful technique that I had ever encountered. Feeling that the information was a little confined on my Kindle, I bought the book and also attended a class.  In that class I had a release of an negative unconscious belief which was replaced with a positive belief, that altered my appearance- and I was and continue to be so much lighter after that. Key to reviews is how effective is the book's information. Personally facing a situation of being a long distance away from home for up to a year, I utilized the thetahealing technique from the book to manifest a job at home with my family.  The results that occured in less than two weeks were a complete and total success. Since that time I have not only attended another basic class in which we cleared unconscious beliefs, but also experienced at least six sessions of thetahealing therapy to clear and replace personal negative unconscious beliefs with positive ones. The results are that I am calmer, happier, more confident, relaxed and patient. Learning to go into the theta brainwave state takes me into a deep state of altered consciousness(much more than alpha), and with it one can, as the author states, create at the molecular level. This technique can be used for healing, manifestation, and I believe lead to effective spiritual evolution. Bottom line, this book is a portal to instant tremendous, loving and powerful change which occurs through the utilization of the technique described in the book.  It is life changing.
1609611543|5.0|I had been gradually putting on pounds and decided enough was enough.  Now I am very nearly 40, and my friends told me this was normal, but I was determined to try to lose it anyhow.  So I did what conventional wisdom recommends- I joined the gym and started working out 4 days a week at lunch, and replaced my usual restaurant or leftovers lunch with a turkey and whole wheat sandwich with fat-free mayo.  Sounds like a foolproof plan to lose weight, right?  Wrong.<br /><br />I actually GAINED weight and started to feel horrible- tired, fuzzy-headed and unable to think clearly, and stomach problems.  I had no idea what was wrong, and after 3 blood tests, neither did my doctor.  So I started reading- all kinds of nutrition and health books.  Nothing made any sense till this popped up as a recommendation on Amazon- thanks no doubt, to the search engine that remembers what you've been looking at.  When I read the reviews for this book, I KNEW what the problem was.  I had more than doubled my intake of wheat! (I have never liked bread much and rarely order sandwiches when eating out.  So I bought it and read it.  It was intriguing, horrifying, and it made entirely too much sense.  Now this book IS technical, but for the first time in my life I feel like I understand how food affects my health and my weight.  I decided to try it.<br /><br />Update- in the first month I lost 9 lbs.  That doesn't sound like alot, except that I wasn't really very heavy to begin with.  I am five feet tall, generally considered slim even at my heaviest, and my goal was 16 lbs which is two dress sizes.  I lost 3 more pounds in the next 2 weeks, and 3 more in the next month.  My husband says I look hot, and my parents were slack-jawed at my transformation.  Here are the pros and cons of this diet:<br /><br />Pros- I count NOTHING- not carbs, not fat grams, not calories.  I eat all I want of the unlimited foods, some of the limited foods, and avoid the forbidden foods.  It's easy and it sure beatscalorie counting.  I am never hungry.  I feel great- I have tons more energy- even when I didn't get enough sleep for whatever reason.  I don't crave carbs or sugar anymore- I eat out quite a lot, have gone to parties, baked cookies with my kids and had little urge to cheat. I have even reduced my caffeine- I just don't need an after lunch pick-me-up anymore.  And I finally know what food is right for my body- because I feel it on this diet.  I can eat chocolate, bacon, and butter, and drink wine with no guilt.  My IBS and allergies are 90% better.  I can't tell you how wonderful it is to wake up with a clear head and no sinus headache every morning.  The difference in my allergies is so marked that my eye doctor asked if I had changed allergy meds because my eyes were not red and irritated as usual.  He couldn't believe it when I told him it was a result of giving up wheat.<br /><br />Cons- The food on this diet is expensive.  Sugar and wheat are cheap filler foods and when you stop buying them you will feel it at the checkout.  You will have to change the way you cook- and you will nearly have to cook if you aren't already.  It's hard to wrap your head around the concept of this diet- its hard to believe that fat is better for you than fat-free products (which are generally loaded with sugar and wheat) but I know its true because I feel so much better.  I thought I would fit back into my old clothes but I lost so much weight, I have to buy new clothes because all of my old ones are now too baggy.  Is it worth it- YES!!<br /><br />***Final update- its been more than two years now.  It took me only 3 months to lose 17 lbs- a pound more than my goal of 16, and 14% of my body weight. I am now a pound lighter than I was when I graduated college- nineteen years ago!  I am not planning on quitting my diet- ever.  This is just how I eat now.  I feel healthy, energetic, and younger than I did two years ago.  I am getting a better feel for what I can and can't eat.  Rice and steel cut oatmeal is okay for me, and a few corn chips or tacos now and again don't bother me either.  Fruit is fine except bananas, which make my stomach hurt.  I haven't gained back a single pound- and I threw all the \\"fat\\" clothes away.  I have never felt this good- I am never going back to eating wheat.<br /><br />Tips- you will want to buy a glycemic index counter to go with this, so that if you are going to cheat you can do it wisely.  I have an occasional fun sized snickers bar or Reeses Peanut butter cup and maintain my weight easily.  Nobody can be good all of the time!!  Before you run out and buy bunches of snacks- I have a cabinet full of diet-safe snacks that I haven't eaten because I'm not hungry between meals anymore.  Save your money and buy them as you need them.
B0057MFA42|4.0|I've been waiting for years for Geffen to release this, and I'm thankful they finally did. The video and sound blows the footage from LIVE TONIGHT! SOLD OUT! out of the water, and it's been remastered to HD. You get two viewing options: Original Full Frame, or Anamorphic Widescreen. That's great. What I am disappointed in is that the DVD has extra's, the Blu-Ray does not. With the DVD you get the four music videos from Nevermind (Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium, and In Bloom). The Blu-Ray does NOT have these videos. That's a shame. Usually you get more features from the blu-ray. I'm not sure if this was an error or if this was intentional on Geffen's part. I bought the Super Deluxe Edition and the Blu-Ray since the Deluxe set only contains a DVD of the show. Just thought you'd like to know.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|Fair app with done deficits: 1.  I can swype faster than this program writes. 2.  My handwriting is not very legible (not a fault if the program, granted, but I suspect most people's handwriting is sub standard. 3.  Controls just aren't intuitive - if I write rapidly it ends up placing one word per line instead of next to the previous word I wrote.  Sorry - I  uninstalled after 2 minutes.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I use music to relieve stress as I have a very active 6 y/o little girl and am the primary caregive of a husband that is 36 with active leukemia as well as hold down a full time job as a RN. Music helps me kept it real as well as takes me to a place where I can relax. Lady A 's music is one of the best to listen to and I would recommend this album and previous to anyone!!! Keep em coming Lady A!!!!!
0061673730|1.0|I agree with all the 1 star reviews here, which make for fun and rewarding reading, unlike this over-hyped waste of paper. At 88 pages I cannot and will not read another word. After all these years, and so many people telling me I had to read this, I finally picked it up at a used bargain book store, and I want my dollar back. The author's ramblings on motorcycle maintenance are sleep inducing, unless I suppose you enjoy motorcycles, and all this massive book is, at least from the first 88 pages I have suffered through, is a boring road trip, void of any sign of plot, used as an excuse to paste on philosophical rants, which make me think a root canal is not such a bad thing after all.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|Kind of disappointed with the overall movie.  I think the best parts are all used up in the previews. At least the Amazon pricing makes up for the lack of overall entertainment.
B002436WFI|5.0|If you are a Pratchett fan and read his books, you will love this morsel like the best chocolate in the world.  My favorite character is Two Flower...the first tourist. With the exception of the socks, I have looked just like him while visiting the hinterland of Florida.  It was delightful to see my imagining of the characters come to life in such a wonderful way.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Good movie with plenty of laughs, an assortment of characters,  and an interesting twist to the plot.  Worth purchasing at the Amazon price.
0778328821|2.0|This is the story of four women: Lydia, a cancer survivor who opens a yarn store, and her first three customers/students, Jacqueline, a society matron, Carol, a business woman trying to get pregnant, and wild-child Alix. The book takes us through their lives and how being in a knitting group together changes them.  This was, by far, the most predictable, formulaic book I've ever read. As soon as every woman's story, and those of supporting characters, was laid out, I knew exactly what was going to happen with each main character, and, sadly, I was right.  It's a fine story if you're looking for a comfortable, female-centric feel-good novel. But don't come to this looking for any depth. It's very simply a light, happily-ever-after.   As a yarn-crafter, and member of my own crafting group, I wanted to love this book. I'm a little sad that I didn't.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I've been a Bonamassa fan since the Bloodline days and never heard of Beth Hart so I took a chance it would be pretty good and it is AMAZING. The band plays great and plays what the music calls for,sort of has a old school vibe with a new school sound to me and Beth's vocals are perfect for it,I just hope this isn't the only disc they release together.

0307408833|3.0|This is my first product review on Amazon, but I've been baking out of this book for almost 2 years now and thought I'd put my opinion in.  First of all this is food porn at it's prettiest. No doubt about it, the pictures alone inspire cravings and the hope that your confections will turn out as heavenly as they are hyped up to be...but none of my cookies or cupcakes look anything like the pictures in the book.  The vanilla cupcakes were very \\"vanilla\\" if you will. There was nothing special about them...in fact they were bland and dry all the times that I made them...however they are useful seeing as how they can be transformed into the \\"crumb base\\" that you can easily turn into macaroons...so if you have the time to bake an entire batch of cupcakes just to get some macaroons then go for it! (The macaroons are actually VERY tasty and moist). The vanilla frosting was also bland and not as thick as you'd like a frosting to be (my friend politely and creatively described the taste as something like \\"flavored water\\"). I've never tried making the chocolate cupcakes for whatever reason, but I have made the chocolate frosting. It had more flavor than the vanilla frosting, but again not thick enough for my liking.  I made the pumpkin muffins once with high hopes...but the muffins turned our VERY BLAND and way too moist...almost soggy.   Of course I tried to make the banana bread, and like EVERYONE has discovered it spills out of the pan and takes forever to bake (I read on their website that you are only supposed to fill the loaf pan half way...maybe they should put that in the book). The first time I made it it was overdone on the outside while still being goopey on the inside...so I decided to try putting the batter in muffin tins instead and it was perfect! I'd suggest making banana muffins our of your banana loaf batter...it's much better :)  I've made both the sugar sweetened brownies and the agave ones. They are both moist and tasty, but the sugar sweetened ones (of course, the ONLY recipe in the book with white sugar) were my favorite of the two.  I've made the gingersnaps, chocolate chip cookies and double chocolate chip cookies. One thing they all have in common is that they usually come out pretty flat (which I don't mind because I like a crispy cookie). The gingersnaps are ALWAYS good, the plain chocolate chip are OK but usually end up too well done around the edges...but the double chocolate chip cookies are AMAZING every single time I make them!!! They are so moist and chocolaty and perfect, definitely worth the effort every time!  I've never made any of the spelt recipes because they are NOT gluten-free, and they don't sound too good anyway.  Overall I guess it was worth the money for me considering how many times I've baked the double chocolate cookies...but their are definitely pros AND cons to this book.
1401230067|4.0|Liverpudlian occult investigator and magician John Constantine's first solo adventures (he'd been introduced in Swamp Thing by Alan Moore, Rick Veitch, Steve Bissette and others in the mid-1980's) get a new collection here, with two stories from Swamp Thing added to the volume.<br /><br />Writer Jamie Delano really made the character his, giving Constantine an even more jaded and cynical bent. But Constantine, a dangerous man who gets his companions killed, a lot, nonetheless fights the malign schemes of Heaven and Hell alike. And protecting humanity requires a lot of booze and a lot of cigarettes. And a lot of politics. Thatcher's Great Britain and Reagan's America are the primary settings for Delano's initial 40-issue run on the title, and both places are drenched in blood and intimately and intricately tied to the apocalyptic plans of Heaven and Hell. Good times, good times!<br /><br />Delano had a real flair for twisted updatings of traditional supernatural threats. His demons are stockbrokers in souls and day traders in damnation, literally at points. Soccer hooligans get transformed into hideous monsters. Computers strain to reach the shores of Heaven. Heaven has put a new group on the board, the Resurrection Crusade, believing it destined to create the next Messiah. Hell has countered with the Damnation Army, led by long-time Constantine nemesis Nergal.<br /><br />Constantine also faces an ancient hunger demon in New York and a horrifying resurrection of Viet Nam veterans in the American heartland when he's not stalking the nightmarish streets of jolly old England. John Ridgway's art is, for my money, the best Constantine ever had in his own book -- grimy, realistic, grotesque. It perfectly suits Delano's exploration of Constantine's damned yet heroic psyche, and the terrible new ways evil works in the go-go 1980's. How Hollywood got a Keanu Reaves movie out of this is anyone's guess. Highly recommended.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|The criticisms of Chickenfoot's self-titled debut (including shallow, half-baked lyrics and a lack of depth) cannot be said of Chickenfoot III. Better songwriting, a good deal more depth both musically and sonically, plenty of late-1960s/early-1970s classic rock vibe, and slicker production make for one hell of an album, and this sophomore effort marks a definite and big step forward.   The highlights: Last Temptation, the opener, is hard, bluesy, and chunky, with a good dose of attitude and a guitar solo that comes out of nowhere. Satriani must have been thinking Hendrix when he wrote the music for Up Next, a dark, thumping song with one hell of a guitar solo. Lighten Up is even darker, and might be seen as Chickenfoot plus Deep Purple; it has a killer hook and a killer vibe. This is a big damn song with a lot going on. Big Foot, on the other hand, is a straight-up, no-BS driving tune with some funny lyrics. Dubai Blues: Sweet groove with a sweet, bluesy, dirty hook and excellent back-and-forth between the vocals and Satriani, who provides a couple of solos that are among his best. There are three songs that tilt toward the lighter side; Different Devil, Come Closer (a great, soulful track), and Something Gone Wrong show Chickenfoot's deeper side. The album closes by kicking things back up, with a hidden track called No Change -- push past the political lyrics, and you'll find a killer song with a killer vibe that showcases everyone in the band giving 110%. And that's the essence of Chickenfoot III: Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, Mike Anthony, and Chad Smith all have had amazing careers full of amazing moments. Here, the band sounds as tight as any other band in peak form. Chickenfoot III will stand as one of the best things any of them has ever done.   I will say it again: This is one hell of an album.

B000PHNHMQ|1.0|I've had this nailer for about 6 weeks now. I bought it to finish off a bathroom in which I'm installing cedar boards on all the walls at a 45 degree angle. Looks very nice. The nailer worked fine with short wire brads, 1 inch or so, but the 1 1/2 inch long nails seem to jam the Makita about every 5 or 6 nails! I have to disconnect the air hose (for safety) unload the nails, check for any dirt or dust (there usually isn't any) then reload the nail cartridge, close up the nailer, reconnect the air line and fire another 5 or 6 before this scenario repeats. Perhaps I need to increase the air pressure? I'm using 90 PSI now which drives the nails deep enough now, but maybe it needs more air pressure? Anyway, if I could fix that problem easily then I'd rate this product at least 4 out of 5 stars. As is, about 2 1/2 stars. Update: I tried increasing the PSI of air to 116 the max the tool recommends, but it made no difference. I chose to return the unit as defective and ordered a Hitachi model to replace it. The Hitachi is the #1 rated unit of its size, BTW. Based on my experience and after reading of many others experiencing the same failure mode as I did, I can only say you should avoid buying the Makita unit. Based on this more complete information, I am lowering my rating to one star. I'd give it 0 but you need at least one star to get your review published.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I love everything Hugh Laurie does and I know he can sing and play but who knew he could make such a great recording of the Blues? I guess the question should really be: Is there anything he can't do well? He is an amazing talent and this is a fantastic CD.
1609611543|4.0|This isn't a diet book...it doesn't contain pages of meal plans and shopping lists, exercises, or day-to-day schedules. It's a book that covers both scientific research and the author's (a cardiologist) anecdotal observations about a diet containing wheat. Much of it discusses the affects of wheat on the body for anyone, not just celiacs, in great detail. He offers suggestions to work around wheat, but it is not a complete source if you're looking for a do-it-yourself lifestyle of wheat-free eating. I've read Dr. Davis's blog for years and watched how he has gone from 'what's this thing that wheat's doing to everyone' to 'wheat is a bad thing for the modern man to ingest', and it has been enlightening and educational. His book is also. I had hoped it would have more lifestyle examples of how to substitute wheat and grains meals, and more easy-to-make recipes, but it is still a worthwhile read. He gets a little out there in medical terminology at times, but it is still understandable. I highly recommend in addition to this book that the reader locate an online forum such as LowCarbFriends or some other discussion group for recipe resources and support if one is thinking about taking wheat out of their diet. I am convinced Dr. Davis's hunch is correct - that wheat is not good for us - because of my own experiences in eating it and not eating it. I encourage everyone who struggles with their weight and/or blood sugar to take charge of their own nutrition (don't leave your health to the USDA) and try this.

1609611543|5.0|I'm a woman of well...er...a certain age.  I've been eating a low carb diet for nearly 3 years now and not only have I lost weight, but my health has improved substantially.  This book provides another piece of the puzzle as to why low carb eating has worked so well for me and also has presented me with the science to back up my experience that grains -- particularly wheat -- are poison to my body.  I was shocked to learn that the wheat eaten today is not the wheat of my ancestors -- not even the wheat of my childhood -- but a laboratory produced hybrid created for high yield and foisted on the public with no research into its effect on the human body. Profits before health -- hey, that's the American way, right?  Who cares if we get sicker and fatter?  Certainly not big Agra. Read this book, eliminate wheat from your diet and watch how many physical aliments melt away.  Thank you, Dr. Davis!
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I had been telling my 10-year old son about how awesome McGuyver was, so when I found out all the seasons were available on amazon, I bought this for him to see for himself.  Although I can't sit through even a single episode myself because of how corny it is, my son is totally hooked.  We can't seem to keep enough duct tape and paper clips around the house...
6301449142|1.0|The seller was great, a 5 star rating, but the picture of the VHS tape is not right. The amount of video tape is actually one third of the amount shown. The box picture is correct, but the VHS tape picture is the SP speed version, not the EP speed version that I received, and can be seen on Ebay with the same box picture but with the correct EP VHS tape picture that's sold with that box. That should be made clear. The EP version is obviously very bad compared to the the SP version. This is not the seller's fault. Amazon should correct the picture mistake.
B003QCCS36|5.0|The first several times I heard \\"Beg Steal or Borrow\\" on the radio, I found it eerily haunting and loved the pedal steel, but couldn't figure out who was singing it.  I couldn't even tell if it was a man or a woman.  After discovering the artist was Ray LaMontagne, I downloaded several songs from the CD, and quickly found I couldn't stop listening to them, so I got the rest of the album.  I listen to it every few days and enjoy it more with each listen.  Although I like the album in its entirety, my favorite songs are \\"For The Summer\\" \\"Like Rock & Roll and Radio\\" and \\"Old Before Your Time.\\"  The recording quality and production are superb, and the pared-back, uncluttered arrangements are the perfect vehicle for Ray's voice.  There is also a magical timeless quality about this music that takes me back to my childhood.  Something about this album feels just like home to me.  It really sounds like it was recorded in a forest in Maine.  You can almost smell woodsmoke coming out of the speakers.  Long live The Pariah Dogs.
B005EZJ3MW|1.0|This album doesn't sound anything like Demi Lovato. What in the world ... I loved her other albums- I felt they had a rhythm you could sing to and really enjoy. I ripped through the whole Skyscraper album and came away not liking any of the songs. Too drastic of a change for Demi- I want to hear awesome, revved up ballads with her beautiful voice like \\"Here we go Again\\" or her higher pitches lilting with jazzy songs like \\"behind enemy lines\\"- not her voice drowning in auto-tune and hard bass.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|After the blockbuster success of their last album, I was a little nervous that Lady A wouldn't be able to follow it up properly, but I was wrong. I love Lady A for their ability to create beautiful harmonies and a sound that is not too pop or over the top country, and that exact sound is the essence of this album. If you liked their last two albums, this one will not disappoint. If you have never heard any Lady A songs except for Need you now or Just a Kiss and are wondering if this album is worth it, I can assure you that it is. Without doing a song by song breakdown, I will tell you that my favorites are We owned the night, when you were mine, wanted you more, and as you turn away. But truthfully I absolutely ADORE almost every single song on this album.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I use it all the time to sync with my work and personall  calendars.  I have never had a problem.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I enjoyed reading the Hunger Games Trilogy, but what seemed unrealistic to me is that there is not the slightest vestige of religion evident in the society depicted in these books. I think it safe to say that virtually every human society has some form of religion, so why does this one not even hint at religious belief?  I also found it strange that adolescent children could kill other human beings with almost no feelings of revulsion or guilt. From what I've read of real-life killings, even in self-defense people usually puke their guts out because killing another person is such a violation of one's human nature. Even hardened soldiers find it difficult to deal with the deeds they are required to commit in the heat of battle, so it just doesn't seem very believable that kids in the Hunger Games could slaughter one another with only the slightest twinge of conscience or remorse.

B000784WMW|4.0|I have seen three versions of Jane Eyre, but this is by far the best. It only varies from the book a little bit. One of the times it didn't follow the book is when Jane is told Helen doesn't have long to live, then it just cuts to a tombstone that has Helen's name on it.  Other versions show Jane getting in bed with Helen and Jane crying or screaming when she finds Helen is dead.  In the book, however, Jane sleeps all night with Helen and is carried away in the morning, to find later that Helen had died in the night.  But almost everything else in this version is accurate.  The only other thing I don't like on this DVD is that the 30 minute episodes have to play the music to come on, and then at the end of each episode it plays the credits to go off, then the next episode has to come on.  This would be better if it just made the movie flow with no interruptions.    There are 11 episodes, so the length is 5 1/2 hours, which is good because it takes that much time to get so many details of the book into the movie.  Timothy Dalton makes an almost handsome Rochester, but he plays the part very well.  I would recommend this version to anyone who has read the book and likes the Jame Eyre movie to follow the book.
B005MMYCY6|3.0|I found this film, because it was a competitor at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010. Over the years it seems that a special kind of movies make their way to Sundance - it's like a sort of genre. One thing, which obviously really matters to the jury of Sundance is that those movies should have extraordinary characters. I would go so far to say that they all should be character-driven. \\"Hesher\\" makes no exception. That's the good thing about it. It really gives the actors substance to show what they can. I loved watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance. He really built a character, who fascinates right from the start. All this aggression, brutality, primitivsm, but also over-the-top self-confidence make me curious about the Hesher-character. The other actors/characters fulfill their role to dramatise the picture and most important they bring Hesher to ground. The comedy moments get depressed by the people around Hesher.   This movie is definitively a drama and really really depressing. Even Hesher can't change anything about it and so I think there are moments, which don't fit into this depressed enviroment. I cannot feel a unity in the story and the way it's told. The change within the plot developes too late. I was always waiting for a new direction. Some situations just somehow repeat, of course differently, but the mood kept the same and so the situations for TJ, the young boy and protagonist. In fact the movie couldn't really decide what it is. Is it a realistic drama or a tragicomedy? Even if the difference isn't so big it's crucial for my feeling while watching it. In the end the movie left just confusion for me.   \\"Hesher\\" is a real strong drama with entertaining elements and deep characters but there are lacks of credibility and there is no emotionally authentic storyline  3/5 stars  Plus: For Metallica and Motörhead fans there are some special moments in it

AS A UH1 HUEY PILOT DURING TWO TOURS IN VIETNAM I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AND ALSO THE MOVIE AS THE BEST REPRESENTATION OF THE WAR EXPERIENCE IN VIETNAM.

B000001FZK|5.0|I'm usually not at a loss for words, but in the case of \\"Laughing Stock\\" it's difficult to add much to the already impassioned reviews that have been posted here.  This is extremely poetic, multi-dimensional music - if you can get on it's wavelength, it will deepen with every listening. This is transcendent music. The improvisational approach really captures a timeless perspective, and Mark Hollis' deeply felt, haunting vocals make this a recording to return to for many years to come (great for a spiritual recharge).  Certain rare recordings are outside of genre and typical stylistic approaches, and when combined with real inspiration are able to make a fundamental connection with the listener - all that's required is an open mind and an open heart.
B004WJRJ18|3.0|As much as I enjoy the fact of having this LP in my collection, it is a very rare situation when a record sounds worse than a CD. I have the anniversary UK edition and it sounds great so I expected the LP to sound even better, but instead the sound is flat, the songs are different in volume and it somehow doesn't rock. I remember how great the original LP was, even though the recording itself was not ahead of it's time. This is also an American version with introduction on Speed King cut off completely, and while I can understand some critics towards the guitar madness, cutting off the brilliant organ intro doesn't make any sense to me. So if you expect the greater sound out of this, pass it for the AE cd or try to get the original press on ebay. If you have both like me, it is still great to have it in your collection.
0451219597|1.0|I was so looking forward to this story. All the reviews above were so good and the story seemed compelling. Even the first chapter was invigorating. But then everything bogged down into soap opera and very one-dimensional characters, mainly in that of its heroine Flick. I wouldn't let this woman drive me to the grocery store, much less lead me into battle with the Nazis in France. Follett has a great disregard for women, as can be seen in each and every female character in this book and in \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"The Eye of the Needle.\\" His most fleshed out characters are the Nazis, which is frightening in itself.  The reference to Charles Busch in my title is that he would play Flick to the hilt and at least get some humorous value at this tasteless story.
B005EHNPRO|2.0|Hi,   I bought a vinyl copy of this album from a local record store, and it was brand new and sealed. On the front, there is a sticker that says \\"Includes FREE CD of this entire album\\".   After opening it up and taking everything out of this brand new package, there is NO CD to be found. This is entirely in the realm of \\"first world problems\\", but it's quite annoying nonetheless.   I just don't understand why they have to lie? I would've bought the record anyway, why get me excited about something just to let me down.  At least I now own a BADASS ALBUM by a KILLER BAND: Wilco!!!  If you have any hesitations about getting this, lose them. Just don't expect a CD because there isn't one.   Peace!

0307716511|3.0|Ok, first of all, I found the writing to be often awkward and the sentences badly constructed. So why do some reviews call it 'literary'? Words with an extra syllable or two in there?<br /><br />That said, I found the plot accomplished and sophisticated. Great idea. But not well executed. Back and forth in time, present tense, past tense..... I think she needed a good editor to come in and clean it up. No great twists at the end, but a perfectly respectable denouement. I was hoping for something bigger, but it's hard to get a \\"6th Sense\\" ending with everything. We're all so jaded now.<br /><br />Bottom line: excellent plot, averagely executed, awkwardly written, but with fine bits here and there. She's great with setting. Not worth the hype, but a respectable enough read.

B000V674P2|5.0|This album captures a period in Blues Rock history in mid-sixties London when Clapton was \\"God\\" to many fans. It is a really good album, I especially enjoy the instrumentals \\"Steppin' Out\\" and \\"Hideaway\\" and Clapton's vocals on \\"Ramblin' on my mind\\". The version of \\"What'd I say\\" is also very enjoyable. For my taste, it is more enjoyable than the Cream albums although the latter were probably more original.
1400052181|5.0|I remember hearing about HELA cells in the 80's in Biology class. The idea of cells that were so strong was captivating. The number of cells that have been grown from the initial sample is astonishing. Helping with the polio vaccine would be a large enough contribution to society, but that is only one of the advances that Henrietta Lacks made possible. I live in Baltimore & have also visited Johns Hopkins Hospital labs, so that made the book even more interesting. I am glad that this author spent so much effort & time investigating the life of the woman who provided such a priceless scientific resource. She shed a lot of light on the scientific research process as well as making her characters come alive. Her efforts finally resulted in justice. In June 2011, Morgan State University awarded Henrietta Lacks an honorary doctorate.
0446691437|5.0|Steven Pressfield gets it.  He isn't writing about an idea, or a set of exercises or drills...nor is he writing about meditating  or day planners requiring masters degrees in origami and Sanskrit.  He is writing very simply about the bottom line. YOU KNOW what you need to be doing in life, so identify and overcome resistance to it (everything that isn't the work, is resistance), put your buns in the chair and go to work.  The truth is, that while Mr Pressfield asks you, in no uncertain terms, to look the demons of resistance squarely in the face, a harsh and somewhat scary exercise for most folks, he also reveals what to do about overcoming them... (and he's right  he also dives bravely into sacred waters and talks about inspiration, and the muse... delicate stuff that, by other reviews, I see ruffles feathers.  However you see it, every great artist, musician, leader... every person you know who is inspired to toil at what they love will tell you that they're called with a small, certain voice to do it, so call it what you will, but it certainly has validity in the arena Mr Pressfield has constructed.   I'm still trying to backtrack to sort out how I stumbled upon this book, because the title alone would have put me off... there's something about it that's too \\"support groupie\\" for my taste.  Nevertheless, the elves at Amazon suggested it in such a way that it nudged me into buying the Kindle version.  Only halfway through, it moved me to buy another kindle copy for a writer friend, an artist Father, and a friend trying to start a non-profit for kids and media.  Then I bought the hard copy for myself.  Unprecedented.  A simple and quite profound read, this book is a wonderful balance of honoring the lovely gift and call of inspiration by removing excuses, going to work and doing the damn thing.  You and the world around you will be better for it.  That's a heck of a tool.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|The packaging makes absolutely no sense. I wonder who put it together because it really doesn't line up with the show at all.

B005HFUQAM|4.0|Finally, after confusing people with the March of the Zapotec double EP, Beirut has released their third, concrete album.  The Rip Tide is decidedly in the same vein as the previous two LPs, and that is what's wonderful about it.  After experimenting with French and Latin influences, Zach Condon has taken further Balkan cues from his debut, Gulag Orkestar.<br /><br />Gulag is the strongest album Condon has recorded; however, Rip Tide matches the quality of Flying Club Cup (#2).  Once more, listeners feel as though they're on a hundred-year-old train, traveling to some long-forgotten old town.  There are more upbeat songs here compared to previous tracks, particularly on 'Santa Fe', 'East Harlem', and 'Vagabond'.  There is also a wonderful throwback in 'Payne's Bay' to Condon's first recording on an EP entitled The Joys of Losing Weight.<br /><br />Although some have disregarded this track, a highlight of the album is 'The Peacock'.  It carries that familiar, melancholic tune that Condon has conjured up on tracks like 'Postcards from Italy' and 'On A Bayonet'.  It is buried at the end of the LP, and has consequently become my favorite track of mid-2011.<br /><br />On an anecdotal side note that the Amazon universe seems to love: I just saw these guys perform tonight.  They are, honestly, a great band.  They are shockingly good at getting to the heart of nostalgic, melancholic music.  Get Gulag, get this, get everything in between and you will, most likely, feel 100x more human than your office cubicle lets you.

I want the original versions on Blu Ray, none of this garbage you keep trying to pedal down people's throats because you think you are so cool now and know what's best for the people.

B0052U6IMC|4.0|I bought this shoe after my Trail Gloves were completely worn down after a couple hundred miles of trail running, and pavement running and walking. I purchased these for more barefoot pavement running. Perhaps this is because my Trail Gloves were completely worn down, but I noticed right away that there is much more shoe to the Sonic Glove. The top is not mesh, so it is a little more stiff and they don't breath as well as the Trail Glove, and the sole felt much more solid. I was expecting these to fit just like my Trail Gloves, but the break-in period was more difficult on my feet, even more so than the initial break-in period for my Trail Gloves. For a week and a half the right heel dug into my leg, and I could not wear these shoes unless I taped up the back of my heel. I found this odd just because the frame is so similar to the Trail Glove. Once I got past the break in period the shoes really began to feel great. I put a 25 mile run in mostly on pavement and some trail, and my feet and legs felt fine. Perhaps this is because my barefoot shoes were worn down so much, but I really felt that this shoe felt more like a \\"normal\\" sole rather than a barefoot sole.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|The year is 2011 and Mastodon have released their fifth full-length studio album The Hunter; an album which has the completely unenviable task of having to follow up the band's previous album Crack The Skye from 2009, which was a bold and defining moment in the band's career that deservedly won the band a wider audience and that cemented many new fanships worldwide.<br /><br />When the band announced that unlike their previous three albums, the album would not be a concept album and furthermore they were using both a different producer and even a different artist to handle the album artwork, many feared that the band might be deliberately trying to distance themselves from the style we have all come to love; luckily that is not entirely the case, they only wanted to make the album fresh and original while still managing to retain much of the signature Mastodon sound.<br /><br />Opening with the storming pair of pre-released track `Black Tongue' and lead single `Curl Of The Burl,' the album is magnificent from the get-go. Rather than attempt to outdo Crack The Skye in terms of progression, Mastodon have completely shifted their focus to other elements within their sound and expanded on those. The Hunter is direct and immediate, seeing more straight-forward song structures, cleaner vocals and steadier beats than any album in their esteemed career, even the guitar and bass sounds are the cleanest and least sludgey on any Mastodon record to date.<br /><br />For many fans; the words `straight forward,' and `steady beats,' may seem troublesome when used in conjunction with Mastodon. Especially if like me, you got into the band for their complexity and astounding virtuoso musicianship particularly in the drumming department.<br /><br />Indeed, some listeners who prefer Mastodon's Sludge influenced sound may be very surprised with tracks like `Blasteroid' or `Dry Bone Valley.' Rather than lash out immediately however, everyone should give The Hunter a fair few listens before making up their minds, after all what people need to remember is that as far back as 2004's `Naked Burn' they have been hinting at this sort of thing, now it has just become much more prominent.<br /><br />Even to assuage fears, it cannot be said that The Hunter is a return to the hardest and most complex territory the band have ever explored. The songs fire ahead with force and power, but are almost all filled with big melodic choruses and driving guitar lines. Just feel safe in the knowledge that the album is not truly a grand departure either; everything still very much sounds instantly recognizable as Mastodon, even if you do have to wait longer between drum fills than on other albums.<br /><br />Keyboards, structural complexity and the proggier elements found on 2009's Crack The Skye or the 2010 Jonah Hex: Revenge Gets Ugly Soundtrack EP do return on a few occasions especially on the later half of The Hunter too, such as one the wonderful brooding Title Track and `The Sparrow,' both of which have that Brent Hinds penned arpeggio feel, as well as the Josh Homme influenced `Thickening,' and the very unique `Creature Lives,' all of which helps bridge the gap between back then and now rather well.<br /><br />For yet more similarities with older material, (as with all the band's studio albums barring their debut) Scott Kelly of Neurosis makes a guest vocal appearance, doing a fine job as usual this time on the up-tempo `Spectrelight.'<br /><br />Ignoring musical direction, the actual performances and musicianship are utterly spectacular. The vocals (now featuring even more from Brann Dailor) from all parties involved have never ever sounded so good and their skill and talent has improved remarkably, in addition to the guitar solos which are some of the most evocative and emotive sounding leads the band have ever produced.<br /><br />As performers the band have taken things to a whole other level with The Hunter; the songs are fantastic, no arguments whatsoever canbe made with the production and overall The Hunter is simply a hands down good album and a real grower too. If you like Mastodon then ensure that you get yourself a copy, you will likely not regret it.<br /><br />*** If you should buy the special edition with the DVD, be aware unless you pick up the correct edition, unlike the band's previous two DVD editions, there is no making of documentary to be had.<br /><br />Instead there are two music videos (for `Black Tongue,' and `Deathbound,') as well as a `Psychedelic Visualizer,' for the album that shows interesting imagery on screen along with the album (if you don't understand just look on youtube) and finally an Augmented Reality experience that works in conjunction with the band's official website and with your webcam to place you within the album art, putting the head on your head for video and photo sessions in the web browser which also has Facebook connectivity etc.<br /><br />This DVD is in addition to the alternative packaging that fits in more with previous Mastodon artwork styles and of course two bonus tracks, `The Ruiner,' and `Deathbound' which are acquired digitally once you have the album BUT ONLY IF YOU BUY IT DIRECT FROM THE BAND'S OWN WEBSITE, OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THEM YOURSELF AT AN ADDED COST. ***a real grower too.

B005K2KCPG|5.0|The subject matter on many of these songs is a bit darker/serious and more complex than their first release but the hook and groove on most of the tracks curls the lip and makes the head nod.  The guys really visit their roots and it shows in many of the riffs Joe has provided.  Backup vocals with Michael seem to be focal point throughout as well which is fine by me. Production is slick and polished. Tracks that shine are \\"3 1/2 letters\\" (spoken word which jumps off the beaten path a bit but really connects  Sammy's voice has held up remarkably well for all the years of belting it but it does seem a bit strained a time or two. Joe is Joe, bow down and grovel. \\"Dubai Blues\\" is straight up taught by pros, listen and learn. \\"BigFoot\\" in non-complicated fun. \\"Up Next\\"  awesome hook and Joe's solo brings back a lot of good memories and makes me smile. Know that every track isn't a headbanger's wet dream, the \\"Foot\\" show a mature tempo on a lot of the tracks. If you are expecting something new and completely different pick it up someday but if you are a fan of Sammy and boys that make up the \\"Foot\\" this album will not disappoint.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Machine Head's highly anticipated Unto The Locust has the unenviable task of having to follow up 2007's excellent zeitgeist-grabbing The Blackening album, which received stellar reviews at the time, was hailed as one of the best records in their career and has already since become regarded as something of a classic album, something that will only continue to grow as time passes.<br /><br />If Unto The Locust receives a lot of negative criticism, it is only because it failed to live up to the unexpected mythic status set by The Blackening, much in the same way that The More Things Change was left in Burn My Eye's shadow.<br /><br />Judged on musical merit, Unto The Locust is a very strong album indeed somehow managing to be both instantly loveable and yet also a grower. Everything on the record is tight and perfectly formed, not a second of the album is wasted... impressive considering how long, dense and complex the record is.<br /><br />The album officially clocks in at seven tracks, only one of which dips below the six minute mark and the album ends up lasting almost 49 minutes overall despite only featuring seven tracks. Repeat listens will allow you to hear different little touches here and there, such as stylish drum fills or guitar licks you hadn't heard before.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the band's previous two albums and want more long songs, more high speeds and more guitar solos with dual guitar harmonies, then Unto The Locust ably provides. Tracks like `Be Still And Know,' and `I Am Hell,' are absolutely full of impressive guitar moments from Rob Flynn and Phil Demmel (and of course not forgetting the usual incredible drum fills from Dave McClaine)<br /><br />It seems pointless listing highlights on an album that only has seven tracks, all of which are great but special mentions should be made for `This Is The End,' is a brilliant mix of crushing heaviness, big grooves a little melody now and again, has a lot of ideas in its time span as well as featuring one of the best (brief but perfectly formed) guitar solos in the band's career.<br /><br />On top of the superb songwriting and performances, the production is absolutely fantastic on the record and really captures the Machine Head sound perfectly. A version of near-title-track `Locust,' was available for a while before the album's release with a different production style, but the actual version on here is much deeper, more energetic sounding and with a different feel on a few of the leads; now the track actually feels a bit more like the band's first two records than it ever did one the advanced mix version.<br /><br />The only significant misstep that the band made is the inclusion of a children's choir on the otherwise excellent album closer which I'm sure a lot of people will hate, and which I'm sure will draw much criticism. The song itself is strong and thankfully this children's section is actually very brief all things considered (even if it does take a few listens before it stops being annoying.)<br /><br />In summary; Unto The Locust is a very good album indeed, and gets better with repeat listens. Machine Head are absolutely on form in terms of songwriting and musicianship and do their best to mix adding new ideas and retaining what made their last two albums so good, the only thing that might stand in the way of this record meeting universal praise is simply the fact that The Blackening already did that.r solos in the band's career.

0865479186|5.0|Goldcare's deals with pseudoscience, quackery, big pharma and skepticism in a very well written and researched book. The book deals with some of the common suspects which have been debunked elsewhere (homeopathy, nutritionists, why smart people believe stupid (weird?) things) and with some more novel ones (big pharma and how drug trials can be designed to skew results) as well as British centric issues (Brain Gym, Dr Gillian McKeith, and Professor Patrick Holford). The latter may not seem as relevant to non Brits but these are very good examples nonetheless. I think Goldcare's book would make essential reading for the lay audience as it is a very good primer on how to approach and evaluate claims. The chapter on stats is particularly useful in this regard. Over all, the book is rather cheeky and entertaining though at times it could be said to be too harsh or condescending (to those not in the sciences).   The book is formidable. Goldcare attempts to find someone to blame for the proliferation of anti-intellectualism and anti-science. More over, he goes to argue that the real danger in bad science is not perhaps the few deaths that result from the use of homeopathy whilst foregoing science based medicine but rather that bad science enables more bad science. To him the culprit is the media which portrays an unrealistic picture of what science is.   Goldcare does a great job of presenting claims made by some and then teasing them apart and showing how people came to accept or belief certain things that are not so.   I highly recommend this thought provoking and informative book.

1844487172|5.0|Beautiful book, yummy eye candy and very informative. Pictures of the real thing are easy to follow (better than hand/computer drawings) and are in clear, sharp focus. Each rose would be a stunning addition to a crazy quilt block, an art quilt, garment, or a small composition. The stumpwork embroidery doesn't tempt me (yet) but the instructions are clearly written. For the project oriented people, Di's Rose Sampler in the back of the book is simply stunning.  Happy crazy quilter, Sherrill in Oklahoma
B003EYVXTG|2.0|I can honestly say I don't see what all the hype is about in regards to this movie.  I thought it was slow, dreary and had a hard time putting the pieces together.  I grew up in this geographical region so maybe that is why all in the movie comes as no surprise to me.  I will admit that Lawrence's performance is quite good, but the movie itself is not that appealing.
B005HG4C4C|4.0|I was a bit skeptical of how it would sound with Mike Portnoy leaving, but the more research I've done on Mike Mangini, I'm quite pleased with his sound and can't wait to see how future albums sound. Mangini is in my opinion, one of the few drummers who can meet the expectations of the Dream Theater sound. I'm really enjoying the album, but wish it was mixed better. The drums and bass weren't up to par in the mix compared to previous albums. Don't know why the band changed their sound.

B004ZN9UZO|5.0|This album is the Floyd's most underrated masterpiece from the 70's. It is just as good as the rest of their post 1970 releases and better than anything after The Wall, but not as well known or loved. Nevertheless, if you like this band, in this album you will find some of their most creepy, artsy, heavy music. Cynical to the bone and no fluff, this is Pink Floyd at their best. All of the songs are classics, but as with any Floyd album, the songs are best listened to together for a full \\"album\\" experience. Here Roger Waters wrote some of his most insightful lyrics and the band as a whole produces some of their most poignant imagery to fit those lyrics. The only problem with the album is that it is made of 2 very short intro/outro acoustic bookends (Pigs on the Wing) and 3 very long songs for the main body of the album. The long songs made culling a single very difficult and thus the popularity of the album suffered for lack of radio airplay. The shortest of the main songs is Sheep, clocking in at 10:18. This makes for a greater commitment needed on the part of the listener, but as with other PF releases, repeated listens become more and more rewarding. In my opinion this is just as good as Dark Side Of The Moon, (albeit more cynical), Wish You Were Here, and The Wall. It's just a different listen. If you love art rock, progressive rock or just intelligent, politically insightful music, you must get this.  I recently bought the new discovery series release of this album and I have to say that I'm disappointed. I previously owned the 1992 remaster of this disc and I don't hear a huge difference between the two. There is some higher degree of clarity for the 2011 release, but it isn't the jump that I expected from 1992 to 2011. I can usually notice a big difference when I get a good remaster. The difference from the original masters to the remastered versions of early Marillion comes to mind. I noticed only a very small difference in the bit rate that resulted from ripping this cd to my computer. Usually the bit rate changes more with better remasters.   I use the Windows media lossless setting. If you rip a cd at the highest possible fidelity and you use an unremastered cd first and then a remastered cd you will get a higher bit rate on the remastered cd because the increased headroom of the sound of the remaster should require a higher bit rate to accommodate. Remasters will typically have a bit rate of 900 or higher. The bit rate will also change if you set the rip setting to a lower resolution, but if you compare ripped cds at the same resolution, remastered cds usually have a higher bit rate than older cds. Usually the bit rate goes over 1 Mbps with good remasters. This is just a rule of thumb, since the bit rate can also be affected by dynamics of songs. Softer songs will have a lower overhead for the recording process and won't need as high of a bit rate to sound good, but you will find that most of the time it applies.  The best way to tell the difference is to just listen to both versions. When I do that I listen to one song off of the old master first and add the new remastered song to the playlist to compare them one right after the other. This is the best way to do this because you don't have a waiting time in between listens while you change cd's in a conventional cd player.  I still love this album and highly recommend it, but the remaster didn't really do it for me. Maybe some of the other remasters are better. Dark Side Of The Moon was remastered in 5.1, so I'm hoping that maybe that will have a greater impact on the cd as well. (Not because the cd would benefit from the 5.1 mastering, but because they might do a more comprehensive remastering job when planning for a 5.1 transfer and also because DSOTM is such a seminal album that it might receive a little more TLC). If you're happy with your old remaster, I don't recommend spending extra money. I also like the cover art and booklet of the previous release much better. They more closely resemble the original.   As a side note, if you want to save some money, you can get this at Best Buy for $11.99 (In California), although someone told me that Best Buy in other parts of the country has it for 9.99.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|This game is fun, kind of repetitive initially though. I'm sure it becomes more interesting once you complete enough levels to unlock the other tools besides the scissors; I'm reviewing the app now because it already prompted me to do so. I would have probably given it more time to grow on me before posting a review, but since they asked.....  Does not scale to fit the screen size of my galaxy tab.  Some parts scale, others don't; looks like it would be a decent visual treat if it scaled properly.

B004XNGKBS|2.0|This app may be useful if you're using a tablet, but on the smaller screen of a phone it's next to impossible to write legibly at a speed where note taking would be useful. Also when attempting to change pen settings the menu disappears so you can no longer see the the slider you are attempting to adjust. Free is the only acceptable price for this app in its current state.

B002Q0F6V0|5.0|If you're a hard core Alice In Chains fan, you won't be disappointed. I give them props for continuing the project without Layne, since he was a major consideration as to whether they should keep making music under the bands name or not. Well, they did the band and Layne justice and were able to stay true to themselves and keep Layne's presence alive throughout \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\". Great album and refreshing to hear vs. some of the lame mainstream \\"rock\\" playing on the radio.

B004ZNA5JO|4.0|Maybe I belong in Pink Floyd Fan Jail after saying this, but on the day the reissues are released, the first one I sprung for was \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". Basically because it's one that I never bothered to upgrade from cassette until now but also because it's a damn good album too.  \\"Signs Of Life\\" leading into \\"Learning To Fly\\" is just a great album moment from my youth. \\"Lapse\\" was the first Floyd album I remember coming out after being introduced to their old stuff as a youngster.  As the tape deck was phased out, so was this album. So I'm listening to it for the first time in a good five years, possibly more.   No, it's not \\"Wish You Were Here\\" but it was the Pink Floyd that was around when I was growing up and I very much enjoy listening to this one again.

B004Y1USJE|3.0|I'm a huge Yes fan and always have been, through all their changes. I have been far more disappointed in Yes in the past then I am right now with this new music, however, without Jon, Yes' music is darker, more predictable, less aspirational and, as odd as this sounds, they make far too much sense and achieve fewer of those high-endorphine blissful harmony soaring moments than seem to defy sonic gravity. This new music feels heavier, without the \\"quickening\\" breath of past incarnations. The innovative syncopations and cool rhythm changes are still there, but, again, predictably so, and Steve Howe sounds like he is being taken along on a ride that he's not sure he wants to be on. This is not as good as Drama, and though gratefully this does not sound like Asia (since Squire is a better musician than Wetton), it is in somewhat of a limbo and suffers from a lack of exactly the kind of leadership Jon brought to the mix. Yes has always had struggles in sounding unified as a band, some combos have more magic than others. This combo comes up somewhat short on magic but it is enjoyable; I much prefer listening to Glass Hammer and IQ these days.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This Blu ray series is absolutely amazing!! I mean it is like you are really there watching it yourself. This series was one of my favorites from the time it came out, even more so on Blu ray. You MUST have this!
B0045HCJRQ|4.0|I've seen this 2 or 3 times; it is far more entertaining than most films out of Hollywood.  Foster was brilliant as usual.    Richard Gere is not that bad.  However, in all his films, he seems to use the same mannerisms and way of strutting/walking that could be identified easily without ever seeing his face.    It did not seem believable that everyone in town is fooled.  Also, it seems that the change of 'yellow Lawrence' into a great and brave guy is hard to believe without any explanation such as a religious conversion.  His progressive attitude on race relations seems to be a Hollywood invention rather than something a Tennessee confederate would display.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|As others have noted, The Tudors may be historically inaccurate, but it makes for excellent entertainment.  I hated to see it end.  This is one of the best series that I have seen.  Everything was perfect; casting, costumes, scenery, etc.  I applaude Showtime for a job well done.  Being neither a historian or history buff, I became compelled to learn the truth of the reign of Henry VIII.  So much history involved, how can one not be drawn in.  The boxed set is beautifully done, although, I had a few glitches with the sound on some of the episodes.  There were 15 discs, but no guide to what was on the numbered episodes on the discs.  The episodes were numbered but not titled.  Although much has been written about Mary and Elizabeth I, I await The Tudors, Part II.  I will place this set along side my sets of Rome and I, Claudius.
B0058VW36U|2.0|Great game.  Great level design, attractive design and loads of fun.  I would rank this in the top 3 games for my phone but.....  What's up with these horrible ypdate problems?!  Like others here, after the update a few days ago I found all of my progress wiped out.  I decided I could overlook that as an opportunity to play the game over from scratch.  The addition of the Toy Box level was worth replaying the other levels again.    ...Then comes update# 2..... After replaying the previous levels again I had finally unlocked the Toy Box.  Last night I saw another update and initiated it...  When complete, my previous game progress had returned but The entire Toy Box level had been removed!  Aaaaaaargh!  Hopefully the developer is working on another update to fix this and chose this second update to revert back to the previous state.  Unfortunately, with no notes or communication to the end user about the update changes we can only guess as to what's going on.  I do like the game but am dissapointed in how these updates have been executed.
0792164903|5.0|SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) is a stunning film that draws the viewer in from the beginning. Tim Burton does a superb job as usual in creating the right environment and atmosphere. The setting for this film is very creepy with the signature Tim Burton 'darkness' that so many of his films has. Johnny Depp shines in this film as the vulnerable, somewhat complicated Ichabod Crane. He comes into town with an aura about him that he knows what he's doing and isn't afraid and wants you to know it. Later, his character is pathetically frightened, and shows a more human side. What I found interesting is how many times a beheading is shown, as if to drive the point home over and over again. This is perhaps a tad overdone, but minimally frustrating. The film is supposed to depict an element of fright, and Tim Burton uses this tactic to reinforce the horseman's eerie and lethal presence, I guess. Overall, this film is a winner, and Burton is once again the master of creating an environment. I recommend this movie, especially around this time of year. 9.5/10

B005IY3DP2|4.0|First off I will say that there is a reason Kasabian is #1 with this album in Britain (their 3rd straight). They are great musicians and write songs that take very little listening to get into. This is a band with layers. You can easily hear their title track Velociraptor! and like it in one listening. You do not need to consider putting it on a playlist, or consider listening to it later to get a better feel for it. You know from the first 30 seconds that the song is good. Then as your listening to the lyrics a smile comes over you because you start to realize that the title is not an effin metaphor, but an actual song about dinosaurs. Its one of those moments that makes you glad you picked up this cd. That to me is the best thing about Kasabian. You find yourself listening to something that is, for the most part, unlike most songs out there. Yet they sound like something thats out there. Makes no sense I know, but this band is one of those groups that will make you enjoy music and make you realize that good music can still be made. I remember the first time I found certain groups for the first time. Its magical. I remember the first time I realized the brilliance of The Beatles, the skill of Eddie Van Halen, the voice of Eddie Vedder, the cohesion of a Strokes song and those moments stick out. Listening to Kasabian is another of those moments and you will not go wrong by not only listening to their latest, but go back and listen to all of their work. You will recognize some songs, then slap yourself for not realizing that this group is not just a commercial playing clip, but a full-blown rockin band who will give you many many hours of enjoyment. Even their radio station visit cover of Gwen Stefani's The Sweet Escape is a treat... Check them out America and give Nickelback a rest for one evening.
0385344325|5.0|With a Few Good Men-esque setting and the depth and breadth of the excellent [[ASIN:1600200516 Chaos and Kingdom]], the latest Child novel (a prequel to the original Reacher thriller) is an intense way to kick off the career of the 13-year-old series based on this protagonist.  The story starts back in 1997 in Mississippi--down the road from a major army base where Reacher is an MP. When a woman's throat is cut behind a local bar, the case goes no where. The beautiful sheriff, who's also a former Marine, isn't getting anywhere in the investigation. Can Reacher make any progress against local police or the obstructive Pentagon officials?  What follows is a expertly-paced mystery novel with an appropriate amount of action so as not to dull your senses and great dialog (this is something I think Child is getting very good at). \\"The Affair\\" is written in first person, so Child is aloud a lot of liberty in framing the story through the eyes of the protagonist and he does it well.  While Child maintains his signature formula, it in no way detracts from the story and there are some unique aspects of this book that I haven't read in any other thriller. You'll love it if you're a Reacher fan or if you just enjoy a well-crafted tale.

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|M. Night Shyamalan seems to have hit his stride in his first film, The Sixth Sense, and despite the fact that he elects to continue exploring the dark side of thought, his recent products have a lot of promise but seem to falter in the endings.  DEVIL is like that.  One wants to suggest that this is his take on Sartre's 'No Exit' but after the film gets rolling it simply falls into the category of another stuck elevator story where the people inhabiting the chamber reveal all the good and bad aspects of human behavior while providing a platform for a little 'the devil made me do it'  chatter.<br /><br />The film starts well enough with gorgeous upside down vistas of the city of Philadelphia. A body lies on the street in front of a glass skyscraper and the police are called - Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) has reported to figure out what is happening - a suicide or murderous fall.  Attention turns inside where five people enter an elevator: a Mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green), a mattress salesman (Geoffrey Arend), a security guard (Bokeem Woodbine), a fussy older lady (Jenny O'Hara), and a young woman (Bojana Novakovic). The elevator abruptly stops between floors and the claustrophobia of the situation begins to wear on the nerves of the five people.  They are watched on video camera and a one way speaker  by two other security guards - Lustig (Matt Craven) and Ramirez (Jacob Vargas).  Strange things begin to happen and one by one the people trapped in the elevator are murdered. Ramirez swears this is the work of the Devil and gradually his fears seem to be true.  The actual identity of the Devil comes as a surprise as does the ending of the film - the lone survivor being connected by history to Detective Bowden's tragedy in the past.<br /><br />The story does well in the category of suspense, and it is populated by a very able cast of actors, but it is the superimposition of moralizing and the need to make the Devil a person that pulls the plug on the intensity of the story.  It has it's moments but in the end it leans a bit toward the silly side.  Grady Harp, September 11's moments but in the end it leans a bit toward the silly side.  Grady Harp, September 11
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|\\"Own the Night\\" is the very first country music album I have ever purchased, and I am so glad I did!  It is very rare for me to truly like every single on a CD, but all 12 tracks on OTN are really fun to listen to, even the sad ballad \\"Cold as Stone\\". My favorite track hands down, though, is \\"Wanted You More\\". I'm a bit of a rock chick by heart. So, the electric guitar that starts off the song caught my attention right away; and, the song continues to be \\"in your face\\" amazing -- all the while covering a pretty serious and sad subject, loving someone more than they love you.  I definitely give \\"Own the Night\\" FIVE HUGE STARS because of the beautiful vocals, fun lyrics, and every track being just plain good! :-)
B0034G4P8A|4.0|In Kenneth Branagh's 1995 film \\"A Midwinter's Tale,\\" low-rent actors labor furiously to stage Hamlet, and one of the funniest subplots involves \\"the cuts.\\" Shakespeare's plays can hold about four hours of story, but modern audiences lack Elizabethan attention spans. But what can be cut, and who the heck do you think you are, editing Shakespeare?   \\"Thor\\" offers the opposite problem -- Branagh must stretch about 40 minutes of worthy story into a summer blockbuster. (Norse gods do not do short subject.) The good half of the movie takes place on Asgard, which is in another galaxy, or on another astral plane, or some such charming nonsense. Thor's father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), rules wisely after having defeated the gods' longtime enemies, the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, in a battle which gave Scandinavia its Norse legends and the Tea Party an explanation for the Ice Age.   Then, in a Shakespearean development, Odin must choose his heir between two seemingly worthy sons: the warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth, perfectly cast) and the cunning Loki (Tom Hiddleston). When his coronation is interrupted by Frost Giants, who are trying to steal back a holy relic taken from them, the mighty Thor defies his dad and leads a magnificent raid on Jotunheim that shreds the delicate peace Odin had built. For his hubris, Odin banishes the unrepentant Thor to Earth and breaks the bond between Thor and his magic hammer, which lies like Excalibur in the New Mexico desert.   The Asgard part of the movie is first-rate popcorn entertainment, full of terrific special effects and PG-13-level good-versus-evil bashing. In New Mexico, the story flags and is only maintained by the strength of the actors. Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings ably play three scientists who aid the banished Thor. These threadbare characters exist solely for plot development, but Skarsgard is particularly effective as a scientist who was raised on Norse legends, but who gave up those childish stories longago.   Fanboys who sit through the closing credits will delight in a final scene that explains the real point of this movie, which is to integrate Thor into the Avengers, the gang of Marvel Comics superheroes that includes Iron Man, Captain America, and Green Lantern. Thor falls far short of the bar set by Christopher Nolan's epic \\"The Dark Knight,\\" but its sights were lower. He may not be Shakespeare's Prince Harry, but Thor deserves a full two hours of story next time around.  Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.

Handrite Note doesn't cut it for me either.<br /><br />On my phone, the input area is pretty small, meaning I can't put much on a line via finger input before I have to stop and wait for Handrite to copy it over to the paper.  Even in landscape mode, I can't seem to get more than 2 or 3 words.  This makes input really really slow, even after twiddling with the option for how long Handrite waits after you stop doodling.  On the tablet, which has a 10' screen, the area is much larger, and I could move along with greater speed, but still not nearly as fast as with the virtual keyboard.<br /><br />Finger input on the phone was just ok, with Handrite mostly keeping up but missing strokes here and there.  On the tablet, it really struggled and often parts of what I was writing were missing.  Going back to correct it was hit and miss, depending on how Handrite determined the delay period.  If I went really slowly, Handrite picked up everything no problem.  But this, again, slowed down the input to an unacceptable level in comparison to just using the keyboard.<br /><br />Hadrite comes with a ton of options, which I always like.  Adjusting the width of the lines used, the color, the paper, showing a handwriting grid for easier following, and a lot more.  But it's missing a help section, which leaves the user to kind of guess or just wonder what things are.  For example, what is that orange circle that sometimes appears on the paper?  How do I copy and paste, or edit out one specific word?  It can be a little confusing, especially when the paste button looks like an undo button, (reverse circle).  Only by messing around did I find out that you need to put in text via the keyboard to name your note something intelligent, and Handrite takes the first text it comes across, even if it's in the middle of the page.  Also, use of the virtual keyboard lacks all spelling checks, suggestions, auto caps, and auto punctuation that one expects when using it as an input.<br /><br />Overall, I found Handrite to be a less than desired note taking app.  It's big feature is too slow for practical use, and without it, it's no more than a average note taking app.ext via the keyboard to name your note something intelligent, and Handrite takes the first text it comes across, even if it's in the middle of the page.

B003O5MO2A|4.0|Blue Oyster Cult was what it's name implies...a cult band. Not a commercial success for the three albums this live album includes in it's set list, the self titled \\"Blue Oyster Cult\\", \\"Secret Treaties\\", and \\"Tyranny & Mutation\\" plus it includes a nod or two to popular tunes of the day, \\"Born to be Wild\\" a B side of their \\"Career of Evil\\" single release, and \\"Maserati GT (I Ain't Got You)\\" as encore fair. Typical BOC of their early days with some of their better songwriting, played with nary a mistake at the show. I've owned, and played 'til it crackled, 2 each of these first 3 albums, made a mono cassette of each of them that I played till it stretched and became unintelligible. The LIVE version here I only played until my sister left the cover (with one record still in it) on top of the tube amp and melted it. \\"Then Came the Last Days of May\\" was of particular interest to me, as a barely teen aged punk who new only the neighborhood and what he'd seen on TV, and wandered along the journey depicted in the lyrics. This covers many songs of the first 3 albums, in one package. Sort of a best of the beginning of... BOC. Bought the commercially produced cassette to play, for this reason, for my car a couple of years later. If you have the chance, buy this. A great band. A nice performance (Eric Bloom's STUN guitar). Plus, if you were old enough to have seen them live at this juncture (I wasn't) they put on one helluva show (guitar orchestra) and it'll bring back fond, albeit, foggy memories, I'm sure. Original analog recording to digital master. Sound quality is much better than my vinyl, degraded as it is, yet shows the technical limitations of it's time. Cool.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|I rented this DVD and was so favorably impressed that I bought the movie for my permanent collection.  The entire production is excellently executed.  Wardrobe, sets, story all seem to be historically accurate presenting a visual \\"fly on the wall\\" perspective to an exciting part of world history.  Cate Blanchette delivers a passionate and soulful performance of her character Elizabeth.  The supporting actors were equally well-cast and delivered believable and engaging performances, enhancing the experience.  Cinematography was excellent, given the difficulty of some of the scene's sets.  I will watch this many times more.  Thank you.
1401929281|1.0|I have read up on brainwaves and how technology and science is being used with them. IE using Emotiv or Nuerosky devices to see the what the brain is doing. Maybe using Mind workstation to graph it. When I found this book I thought it might pertain to how theta is used in healing. (Is such a thing possible?) I was hoping it would be like the book [[ASIN:1591799112 The Energy Cure: Unraveling the Mystery of Hands-on Healing]]. (I love this book) I was hoping Theta Healling would have some science behind it. Proof of concept. Maybe statistics and case studies. But alas no. This book doesn't strike me as anything of the sort. It's more of a 'pray to God and it's done.' She goes over the various brainwaves in brief, but not what tools/harware/software she uses to validate her use of the theta brainwave state. This seems more of a book for people who want to believe in magic/rituals/God then for people who want to learn if and/or what the science is behind theta states and healing. If any exists at all. (Not saying there isn't. Just haven't found any proof yet. The research continues.) The book just goes on and on about her experiences. It's like listening to a person who talks to much but says very little of anything important. My advice is to avoid this sham of a book.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I never thought I would accuse Mr. King of brevity, but this \\"e-book\\" was barely skeletal. Absent was his trademark descriptions and fleshed out characters. It would be a compliment to say this was phoned in. Uninspired at best. Not at all what I have come to expect from this author.
4770031246|5.0|I bought this book after following the blog for a while.  I still refer to the book regularly even though I've had it almost a year.  It has many recipes (most of which are quite healthy, all delicious) and each recipe has several fun variations you can try.  For example, once you master the technique of the  Japanese rolled omelette, she gives a few variations on that to try.  Same with the mini-meatloaves, which are one of my favorite recipes because I can freeze them to eat later.  Many of her recipes you can make ahead, some of which you can freeze.  This is a great timesaver for those who have a lot to get done in the morning.  It also helps prevent my having to eat the same thing days in a row.  Each Bento is also thoughtfully combined, so the meals are balanced and the tastes complement eachother quite well.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to pack \\"real food\\" for their lunch.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|Pink Floyd has consistently been a band greatly concerned with preserving the integrity of its catalog.  Although \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" has been subject to frequent remasters and reissues, the band has never before included outtakes, alternate takes, or demos.  So I was quite surprised by the announcement of these Immersion editions of three of the band's most cherished albums.  On the set for \\"DSOTM\\", you get the (yet again) remastered album, a full live performance, DVD's and a Blu-Ray of surround and quad mixes, DVD's of the films that were shown as part of the original concerts and...here's the bit that still gets my pulse going a bit faster...a CD containing an early mix of the album, as well as demos and alternate takes, and the first release of material from the long-fabled \\"Household Objects\\" sessions (albeit, only one song from that aborted album).  Then I was a bit dismayed to learn about the other \\"value added\\" materials in the set.  Alongside a booklet of related artwork, and another of photographs taken on tour, there is a set of nine coasters (heh?), a scarf (what?) and a pouch containing three marbles (WTF?).  For a band whose legacy is carefully preserved to the point of solemnity (the only band I can think of whose catalog is treated with more museum--or mausoleum--type reverence is Joy Division), these trifles are trivial to the point of mockery.  Perhaps they are  trying to lighten the tone of their image with these artifacts, but these items are quite tacky and are, in the end, really \\"value minus\\" materials.  Even more unfortunately, this lack of focus, and attention to quality and detail, runs through the overall construction of the set.  The aforementioned two booklets are quite large in page size (roughly 12\\" x 12\\"), but are both rather thin and, given they are not hardcovers, are a bit difficult to handle.  And there is a green ribbon divider that implies you can simply lift the ribbon to access the four discs lodged in the back of thebox; however, the flimsiness of the booklets (and the unwieldily stack of combined miscellany) makes it almost impossible to access those discs without emptying the box of its other content.  As for those four discs I mentioned, they are barely secured in shallow recesses within the back side of the box.  I was stunned to open the box the first time and discover all four discs lying lose under the other materials after they had dislodged at some point in shipping.  Disc 1 was scratched but playable, but it just as easily could have been scratched beyond repair.  And, at this price, the discs should have been secured firmly enough to prevent this, regardless.  Also, this is six disc set, so why are the first four discs in these unreliable recesses within the cover, while the last two are in their own sleeves?  Once again, there is considerable lack of thoughtfulness that went into this package--failures of both form and function from a band that used to have impeccable design standards.  So, while this set should have been something that one could proudly display on a coffee table, it is instead a largely useless ensemble with cheap trinkets that slightly damage the band's reputation for me.  That said, there is no faulting the audio and video materials here--those alone completely justify the price.  But those recordings deserve better than this box.  I know I can simply ignore or discard the marbles, scarf and coasters, but I can't ignore the lack of consideration that went into the design and construction of this set.  And although I know the \\"Wish You Were Here\\" set will have similar accoutrements, I still want to ask the band to please not cheapen my deep and personal affection for that album with a set like this.  Whoever designed these Immersion sets seems to have lost their marbles, so could they please keep them out of the next sets, as well?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have not been absolutely consumed with a story for the longest time until I read this... I was excited, scared, happy, sad and enraged! Only a truly well crafted story is able to take me through all those emotions and keep my attention even while my family is in front of the tv.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan about was that the story was written in the present progressive... Call me old fashioned, but I would have preferred the past-tense... I can see why the author chose to write it the way she did, but my opinion remains. (But I'm extremely nit-picky).  Loved the story, though. Incredibly unique. I'm hooked. :)
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I must admit that I was extremely skeptical when I first came upon this. I had never heard of it before and found it by pure chance while scanning the Netflix site.   Having read literally every novel that Jane Austen wrote, I wasn't amused by the idea of this story being butchered for the modern-day viewer. Having said this, I was so pleasantly surprised. It is hilarious! As mentioned by other reviewers, the end does sort of fizzle out in a lame way, but in general I was surprisingly satisfied with the tone of the movie. I didn't find it at all disrespectful to the original literature, it's just innocent speculation on whether or not finding yourself in your ideal fantasy world would indeed be ideal. I would definitely recommend it, though I must say that you probably won't fully appreciate the jokes and characters if you're not really familiar with the novel. So be sure to read or, at least, watch a faithful version of Pride and Prejudice before indulging in this!
0439023521|4.0|I bought this book to read before the movie comes out. I couldn't put it down from the moment I opened the book. It is such an interesting story, with great characters - but it;s violent. Not so sure it's good material for very young readers.
B0000E64TR|5.0|The quality of the music on this iconic album has been reviewed many times on this site but I wonder how many have heard this in 5.1 surround through a good sound system.I own many SACD and DVD Audio discs and this one is definately in my top five along with Roxy Music - Avalon,Steely Dan- Gaucho,Mark Knopfler - Sailing To Philadelphia and Donald Fagen - The Nightfly Trilogy.Greg Penny has done a superb job in mixing this and the other five Elton John SACD's that are amazingly still available for a bargain price on Amazon considering the Roxy Music is now fetching over a hundred dollars in used condition.  The clarity and detail brought to these songs is stunning.On first listen it is a little disorienting with instruments and vocals placed differently on the soundstage but once heard on 5.1 you will never go back.Even `Candle In The Wind' which has been flogged to death over the years is like a new song to me now.The harmonies of Davey ,Dee and Nigel coming from the rear speakers are gorgeous and each song brings out sounds I have never noticed before in the stereo mix.So all you need to hear this is an SACD capable player.Oppo do a superb Blu Ray with SACD and Sony also include SACD in some of their Blu Ray players for bargain prices which means that even though releases on this format are virtually defunct you will not be wasting money if you are in the market for a Blu Ray anyway.  Buy this and all the other Elton John discs before they become collectors only.They are all superb.
0061992860|5.0|As an avid outdoorsman and someone who likes to live by my old Boy Scout motto of \\"Be Prepared\\", I have found it difficult to find a book that adequately tackled the task of combining usable, in-depth survival information with reasonable portability for everyday use.  This book tackles both of those issues perfectly. You can find myriad reviews touting the comprehensive and amazing content of the SAS Survival Guide, however most full-size books take up far too much precious space in a car emergency bag, Go bag, or hiking pack. This causes them to be left out at times, rendering their valuable content unusable when they are needed most, in an emergency. This book, in it's pint-sized form, tucks neatly into any bag (or back pants pocket for that matter!), making it the perfect complement to any preparation kit.  I was a bit curious as to how the content of the original SAS Survival Guide would have to be altered or modified to fit this smaller frame, and was concerned that the readability would be compromised. My concerns were immediately allayed when I found the book to be easy to read, clear in its layout, and outlining the same, easy-to-understand skills that won its predecessor so much acclaim.   If you're going to buy one book to prepare yourself or your family for an emergency situation, do yourself a favor and pick up this little wonder!

That's the kind of CD this is...you do not tire of it.  The words hit home as if it were written about me and my experiences in life. 'Just a Kiss' is my favorite and brings back great memories of that first kiss with my now husband of 26 yrs where we didn't \\"want to mess this thing up\\" or \\"push to far\\".  Lady A you rock.  Hope to see it all live again this year.

0385342039|4.0|The latest book I've just finished reading is Twenties Girl by Sophie Kinsella - a fun, light and enjoyable read.    After the rather disturbing (although truly brilliant), Her Fearful Symmetry, I needed something a little less intense. Something that I could just curl up with and escape into for a few hours at a time without having to think too much.    Twenties Girl was perfect for this. Written by the author famous for the Shopaholic series (Confessions of a Shopaholic etc), her latest novel tells the story of Lara Lington, a 27 year old headhunter who attends her 105 year old great aunt Sadie's funeral, a woman whom she has never met and knows nothing about.    During the funeral Lara is saddened to realise that there is hardly anyone there, no flowers, no setimentality and no true purpose for her or any of the other family members to be there. Nobody seems to know anything about this woman, other than the fact that she is very, very old.    During the service, Lara is visited by a ghost who turns out to be Sadie at age 23. Sadie is a sassy charleston loving girl from the twenties who has very firm ideas about fashion, love and dancing - and isn't afraid to express her beliefs upon Lara.    She tells Lara that she can't rest until she has her beloved necklace back, a beautiful beaded dragonfly necklace that she has had for more than 75 years. The necklace has gone missing and Sadie needs Lara's help to track it down.    Meanwhile Lara is having her own distractions and complications in life. Her business partner has left her to go live in India, her perfect boyfriend has recently dumped her and her business is on the brink of collapse unless she finds a way to turn it around.    With all of this going on in her life, she  now has to contend with a ghost, and not just any ghost, a screeching, bossy, demanding ghost at that.    But although the two 'twenties girls' are as different as night and day, gradually they start to help each other and along the way realisethat they are more alike than they think.    My favourite part of reading this book was definitely the character of Sadie. Sophie Kinsella really did her homework into the twenties era and it's obvious how much fun she had with Sadie's creation. Sadie is stubborn, free-spirited but more than anything fun-loving. All she wants to do is dance, flirt with men, and go shopping for amazing vintage finds.    She really cares about her great niece and goes to quite a few disastrous attempts to help fix up areas of her life. As the mission to solve the case of the necklace (almost like a grown-up Nancy Drew!) grew deeper, each of the girls found out some surprising truths about each other.    The novel had me laughing out loud during certain points and even shedding a tear during others. The characters were so charming and funny, it was sad to see them go at the end. And in a complete twist from the beginning of the novel, the ending is brilliant.    The underlying message of the story is to appreciate our past and understand where we come from. It also highlights significantly the transient nature of youth and how no matter what our age, we truly are just as young as we feel.    This is Chick Lit at its best. Having also read Kinsella's Can You Keep a Secret a few years ago, she writes with wit and humour that makes it hard to put her books down. With this book, her number one formula and probably most moving testament is the depiction of that transcendent bond we have with friends and family, no matter who they are or what the story is they have to tell.

B0058WFO06|5.0|Really Mr Wilson has issued quite a masterwork here. In his many musical projects I thought He was spreading a little thin on the edges these days. My mistake. Grace For Drowning is wonderful for it's breezy and fresh appeal.  But I guess all those hours spent for the 40th KC RM, has rebloomed again. You earned it and we are lucky to  hear Grace For Drowning in it's glory. Favorite cuts Belle De Jour/Track One/No Part Of Me/Remainder The Black Dog.
1402712367|4.0|Today I thought I would write a little about some favourite books of mine which I have loved from a young age.    The first is Little Women, a novel written by Louisa May Alcott which was originally published in two volumes and later turned into one book.    The story follows the lives of four sisters all living together with their mother (they call her Marmee) during the Civil War. The sisters' names are Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy March, and are apparently loosely based on Louisa's own sisters and herself from childhood.    The girls' father Mr March is away at war and is hardly ever home. Because of the war, the March family suffers through poverty but tries to find happiness in the small and simple things in life.    Their wealthy next door neighbour Laurie falls in love with one of the March girls, Jo, who is the family tomboy. The elder daughter Meg is a governess who wishes she were rich, Beth is Jo's pet and is a quiet, shy homebody who loves music, and Amy is the youngest, a selfish artist who often fights with Jo.    The story unfolds to reflect the course that each of their lives takes them through, and the struggles and hurdles they overcome to eventually attain what they all want and need.    During the novel, Meg turns from being an engaged girl to Laurie's tutor John to eventually getting married and having twins. Beth is recovering from a terrible illness which she contracted from a poor family whom she was trying to help, Jo has dreams of writing a great novel and Amy is starting to mature and grow more into a woman every day.    The story is more than 150 years old and yet still resonates with modern issues facing young women today. It explores issues of personal growth through constraints of domestic duties focusing on the conflict that takes place in any young girls' life, namely whether to pursue a career or else look after the family home.    At the time the novel was composed (America in the nineteenth century), women's status in society was slowlyincreasing however progress toward gender equality was limited. Although Alcott doesn't suggest that one model of womanhood is better than the other, she does recognise that one is simply more realistic.    Gender stereotypes are another major issue explored within the novel. The character Jo at times doesn't really want to be a female and is much more like a boy. Likewise, the character Laurie doesn't want to be a conventional man. He wants to pursue music, which at the time was a very feminine pursuit and he prefers his nickname Laurie to the much more masculine sounding Theodore.    The book questions the validity of gender stereotypes to a high degree and warrants that our conventional duties of gender expectations are rarely ever recognised. I find this just as fascinating in today's times as it was then. Perhaps even more so, simply because our perceptions of feminine and masculine traits have become so interwoven with one another that it's hard to judge anymore what we deem to be correct. And yet, the issue still exists and is one of our most controversial debates.    Alcott focuses on other issues as well throughout the novel to draw the story out. The necessity placed on work and the personal satisfaction we attain from doing it is highlighted, the importance of being genuine is also looked at, particularly in the context of coming from humble beginnings and comparing ourselves with well to do people, she looks at music and the interesting relationship we all have with it, and she writes about the concept of teaching, reinforcing the idea that the novel is didactic and we are meant to learn something from the story's lessons.    Ultimately touching upon themes of love, innocence, marriage, illness, ambition but above else family Little Women truly is a wonderful epic tale filled with heartfelt emotion and memorable characters. An absolute must read, for both children and adults alike.    Coming up next in my childhood classics series is a review of Alice'sAdventures in Wonderland.

0061122416|5.0|Paulo Coelho's charming allegory is one of the best-selling books in history, and for very good reason. It tells the journey of a young shepard boy named Santiago who believes that a recurring dream he keeps having is a prophecy propelling him to travel the pyramids of Egypt to locate a treasure. During his travels he comes across an alchemist who tells about personal legends and 'when attaining what you want in life, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it'. Along the way, Santiago learns a lot about himself and encounters all sorts of scenarios from love, opportunity, danger and more.    The story is told as a fable and focuses largely on the quest of a dream and fulfilling one's destiny. A simply-written metaphor for life, The Alchemist offers an optimistic approach to finding out our purpose in life and what the world around us really means.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|I also bought this book due to its high rating here on Amazon. But the characters just killed it for me. The level of psychological, emotional, and financial autonomy of all the main characters regardless of parental or institutional authority seemed wholly unrealistic for your typical 18/19 year-old college freshmen. I understand that Travis and Abby had hard lives growing up (a detail completely contrived for Abby and used to move the muddling plot along, while completely cliched for Travis--father is an alcoholic, he's all tattooed, but he's also in a frat?), but their problems and emotional turmoil felt too mature for the setting. And in reference to that, why even have them in college? Just make them working twenty-somethings. Besides the pointless setting, my biggest gripe was Travis. It seems like the narrator based him on Brad Pitt in Fight Club combined with an overly sensitive and emotional basket case. He was just too many extremes, which made him drippy and clingy and violent and unattractive. Finally, the plot itself lacked chronic tension. Everything was too acute--one drama after the other, like an emergency ward of teen angst. What was the long term conflict?
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|Before I even listened to this album, I had the preconceived notion that it would not be as great as their debut. I was totes wrong! This album rocks! The opening track \\"Love On the Rocks\\" justifies the title of the album and is one of my favorites. I already loved \\"Nothin' But a Good Time\\" and \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" which was the reason why I bought the album in the first place. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is another favorite of mine. This album is the soundtrack to my life right now!

0525476881|3.0|An Abundance of Katherines was my first foray into John Green land. I had high expectations for this book after all I have heard of John Green, and I hate to say that it didn't meet them and here's why:<br /><br />The idea of a geeky child prodigy, Colin, having nineteen girlfriends all named Katherine is stretching the imagination a bit too much. It's fairly unbelievable that he knew that many Katherines in his short life, let along dated them all. Of course if that wasn't the case, Colin would have to think up something other than \\"The Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability\\" for the name of his most important life's work.<br /><br />Secondly, Colin, our main protagonist, isn't very likable at all. He is admittedly self-centered. needy, clingy, whiny, oh and apparently a genius. Therefore, I found myself not really caring about whether or not he got his happy ending. He was just too nerdy. Anagrams, math, speaking other languages; it was all too much to take crammed into this rather short book.<br /><br />When I realized that Colin and Hassan where going on a road-trip at the beginning of this book, I was excited. Woo hoo, my first roadtrip book! The first place they stopped was to see Archduke Franz Ferdinand's grave site in, of all places, Gutshot, Tennessee. Sounds pretty cool. \\"I can't wait to find out all the cool things they see on this trip,\\" I thought to myself. Until I kept on reading and they never went anywhere. They stayed in Tennessee. Not really a road-trip book in my estimation, but then again I have nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />The shining light here is that I enjoyed the writing. It was light-hearted, conversational, and fresh. I enjoyed the realistic teenage conversations (except for the constant use of the word fug, fugged, and fugging, which while at first was cute, became extremely annoying). Even though I didn't care for this one, I'm not giving up on John Green.

B0058WFO06|4.0|After Blackfield's last release, I was getting a little nervous that Steven Wilson was starting to overt-exert himself on side/solo projects and running out of steam. But lo and behold, \\"Grace for Drowning\\" is a worthy successor to \\"Insurgentes\\".<br /><br />Whereas \\"Insurgentes\\" seemed to be going for a very specific feel, \\"Grace\\" is all about branching out into all directions, from Jazz to some of Steven Wilson's most \\"prog\\" progressive music ever-- during select moments like some that occur in Remainder the Black Dog, you might think you're listening to a King Crimson CD.<br /><br />Basically, this has Steven Wilson's usual musical daringness and top-notch production along with all the other elements that made Insurgentes great, like Gavin Harrison's drumming and Jordan Rudess's prodigious keyboard playing. However, where Insurgentes was *relatively* concise, this album could do with some trimming. Raider II on the second disc, for example, is a bombastic 24 minute song that ends up feeling much less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />SW probably could have left Raider II off and kept the whole album on one disc, although there's too many awesome things going on if the first half of the song to make me really want that. Despite a blemish here and there and one big missed gamble, \\"Grace for Drowning\\" is a damn fine album.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I recieved my screwdriver sooner than I was supposed to, which was awesome. It looks just like it does on the show. I've been having some troubles with the invisible ink nib though, but wetting it a bit seems to do the trick. A major plus to this screwdriver is my eight month old nephew goes completely blank when I flash him with it, even when he's crying his eyes out. Overall, great product.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|So, it's finally out and the truth of the matter is that this set is the furthest thing from a 2 star review (as given by many people who hadn't seen it yet). It's very frustrating that people are using the review section as a blog for their rants, rather than to actually review the product. Here's the deal, the films look and sound amazing. Simple as that. The classic films look phenomenal. The prequels look pristine. What people need to keep in mind is this is the \\"complete saga\\", not the \\"complete collection of every version of the films\\". This is the COMPLETE film series of Star Wars, episodes 1 thru 6. Anakin's journey from hero to villain and back again in glorious hi-def. Yes, Lucas has made alterations, enhancements, adjustment, and so on but, and while some are better than others and some weren't at all necessary, it is largely intended to bring all 6 films together so that they feel more cohesive. It's cross pollination. Bring the look of the old into the new and bring the new tech into the old. When people comment about how a film like Blade Runner was released in a set with all previous versions, the comparison is somewhat irrelevant for me. Blade Runner is not part of an ongoing film series that spans from 1977 to 2005.  It's a one shot film (and a classic at that) but it's something that's not ongoing. It's one of my favorite films and it's a masterpiece and a landmark in Sci-Fi but it's not tied to anything current like, say, a Blade Runner 2, 3, and 4.... The intent here in this \\"complete saga\\" is for todays generation and the generations to come to be able to view this (all 6 films) as a complete work, as cohesively as possible. You should be able to watch the newest one (ep3) and then pop in the oldest one (ep4) in one sitting and have it be as minimally jarring visualy (for example, watch the original Terminator and then T2. Completely different look and feel to the overall film quality, not to mention the score, and then, if you're still wantingmore, try comparing the latest entry, Terminator Salvation, to the original). The same could be said for the Alien films. Star Wars is a living, breathing document, not a time capsule. It's a work that spans decades from beginning to end and It should not be relegated to a mere reference point. Lucas' first major change to the series was in 1980 rerelease where he changed it to \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\". From this change, Star Wars ceased to be \\"Star Wars\\". It was no longer a stanalone film, rather, it became a building block for a series. It's always cracked me up how people act as if these changes are something new but we had completely different actors portraying the Emperor between 1980's Empire and 83's Jedi and nobody \\"boycotted\\" the film because he was different. That's a change, people. Let's keep some perspective.  Now for those who say that Lucas has a complete disregard for those effects wizards, model makers and puppeteers who worked on the original films, this is simply not the truth and anybody who actually goes thru this box set can tell you that. This box set celebrates, as much or more than any past release, those people who were behind the scenes. While it is true that some of their work is no longer in the films itself there's no attempt to pretend it never existed. All 3 of the original making of docs are present along with several archival interviews with the people who brought it all to life. It quickly becomes apparent that there's an understanding of history in this set. They went to great lengths to make sure we're seeing the people involved and, ironically enough, a lot of the original shots that have been replaced in the feature show up in the featurettes and docs in their original form. There's so much of what went into making the film and even more behind the scenes of what never made it in originally. I'm not just talking deleted scenes but concept painting and alternate versions of animatics. Dozens of turnarounds of costumes and propsand even close ups of the 'traditional' matte paintings. It feels very much that Lucas and co have a strong respect and appreciation for those who helped him bring it to life originally but as the audience becomes more sophisticated the films must evolve to retain relevancy. At the end of the day, someone who's new to the series will never get fully emerged into the world when they're distracted by the wire going from Sy Snootles mouth to the microphone. They'll never look at the pink blob below the landspeeder and think it's \\"hovering\\".  These films were so far ahead of what they were trying back then, many of the techniques barely worked at the time and have no chance of standing up in hi def today.  Even a lot of the digital work from the 1997 Special Editions (which was cutting edge at the time) has now been updated to keep it relevant. That's the key for this franchise.  Star Wars has transcended being a mere film. It's been embraced and rediscovered decade after decade and the demographic changes year by year. It's as talked about today as much as more recent films such as Avatar are. It's still a topic of discussion. Citizen Kane came out practically the same time on blu ray as this box set and how much do you see people discussing that? Do we want Star Wars to become part of the past or do we want it to be current?  I feel that it's a double edged sword. People want what they saw in 1977 on hi def but they'll not be satisfied with a straight transfer, scratches and all. They'll want it cleaned up I'm sure and then they'll want the wires removed and matte lines toned down but then it starts to be something else, and no longer the \\"original\\", right?  I get the longing for the feeling of \\"nostalgia,\\" honestly I do, but at the end of the day, there's not one version of this film that will satisfy every single fan. I recently was watching the blu ray of Back to the Future and when it ended, it didn't have the \\"to be continued...\\" tag. That was the version of that film I had grown up with and there it was... gone! It was a little jarring to me but I got used to it. I'll always have my memories and I am not dependent upon anyone else to preserve my childhood. Simple as that.  Give this box set a shot. You'll be happy that you did. The films have never looked or sounded this good and you're really missing out if you pass it up because of a couple of tweaks here and there. The core is still intact and that should be what's important.
B004QWKIYQ|5.0|This is the Oz or Australian Tour version that contains the same bonus tracks featured on the Japan-only release.   Here you have all 10 of the original tracks plus the following 6 bonus ones. These being:   1- Just the way you are (remix ft. Lupe Fiasco)   2- Somewhere in Brooklyn (previously only available as a digital download)   3- Talking to the moon (acoustic piano version)   4 - Just the way you are (Walmart Soundcheck version that was recorded in front of a select audience in Las Vegas)  5 - Grenade (Walmart Soundtrack version also from Las Vegas)  6 - The other side (Walmart Soundtrack version live from Las Vegas)  I know that the price is a bit steep but for you diehards this is the definitive version of Bruno's multi-platinum debut album!   I can hardly wait for his latest single \\"It will rain\\" that is slated to be on the Twillight's Breaking Dawn soundtrack slated for release this November.
1440503257|4.0|Fun book!  Whether you are going to try the recipes or not (and most look well worth a shot), it is a fun book with the trivia it adds about the dishes served at Hogwarts that we may not be familiar with.  This is a great romp through English/Scottish cuisine that clarified many terms my other more serious cookbooks never really made clear, such as what a rasher of bacon is and how it differs from a gammon, and what in the word could possibly be called Spotted Dick, which sounds like a horrible disease.  This is a pretty thorough guide to recreating almost every dish mentioned in the Harry Potter biography.  The only thing I have failed to find so far is eggs and sausage; Goblet of Fire.  I may manage to figure that out on my own, with hints about bacon!  A fun read, and a must for my cookbook shelf.  There are many recipes I will be playing with.
0385344325|5.0|I loved this book!  As a rule, I will read anything that Lee Child writes, anything that Lee Child recommends, and anything that Lee Child might even use as a coaster- he's just that good.  This book is probably my favorite of his (It's just SO hard to pick one).  Lee introduces us to Jack Reacher when he was still an MP.  Reacher is sent on a mission to help find a murderer in a small town, and potentially cover up any army scandal.  Lee, as always fills the book with visually pleasing descriptions, strong character development, and helps us see into Reacher's oh so interesting past.  I read this in one sitting- a tough task as a working mom of 5- but it can be done!
0307387178|4.0|A keen exploration into the psychological drama played out in a disturbed, idealistic youth's construction of the world and how he could relate to it.  This book might appeal to many of us older folks of the seventies and earlier, who were fighting the demons we inherited from our parents' generation.  Sure brought back older, less lovely times to me, and the read was sometimes very uncomfortable, but gripping  The sidelines into other lives, other personalities that were drawn into the same fatal choices this young man made were sometimes distracting because the side trip was not clearly stated.  But, once it became clear that the author was exploring the mind-set, rather than the individual, it made sense again.   Not an easy book, but well worth the trouble.  Read and reflect, don't take in too much at a time.  Disturbing, and provocative.  No family is immune from an even like this, as my folks would tell you!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|A wonderful film that reminds us of the evil that lies within every heart and our ability to inflict suffering on others in order to elevate ourselves; as well as a poignant reminder that one person really can make a difference!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|This is the music that Beth was born to sing and she doesn't disappoint. Excellent new effort by one of the most talented and underrated artists today!
0061537969|4.0|I love to read books that contain animals, because not only i love animals, but i find it much more enjoyable to read. I think its challenging to write a story with animals, because the writer need to know about the animals in order to write a good story about them or else its just a fantasy creature. So if they achieved that then, i believe they are a good and passionate about their work so its worth buying the book.<br />One of thing i like is that Enzo, the dog, has human personalities, but still acts like a dog. its humorous yet sad (ladies be warn you'll end up crying)<br />And one of thing i didnt like is that Enzos owner, who is told to be an intelligent men, seems oblivious when it comes to the dog.  I mean Enzo dose all these amazing things that no normal dog would do and even as i read clearly the dog dose intelligent actions, yet the owner is just blind.<br />Overall, Its a good book minus some of the annoying character personalities.
B005CW5E3E|4.0|Wow! Johnny Winter continues to amaze me. This new CD is a most worthy addition to his legacy.  You get to hear Johnny playing duets with an array of today's most talented players. The title Roots means that these are the songs that influenced him.  While there are few liner notes the credits tell which guitar solo is Johnny's and which is Warren Haynes, Sonny Landreth, Derek Trucks and others (including little brother Edgar Winter!)  The music is excellent - but I am going to deduct one star for the lack of liner notes.  We only get the musician's credits and who is playing the solos.  However, I'd like to know more about how this project happened and how they recorded together.  I cut and pasted this from his website:  \\"This recording will include Johnny doing his versions of songs that  helped shape his legendary talent. Produced by guitarist Paul Nelson the CD will feature notable guests: Vince Gill, Warren Haynes, John Popper, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi and more along with his new band.\\"  If you are an old time JW fan you must have this disc. It sounds great but I wish we had some liner notes about the music and the sessions. But, we buy it for the music anyway.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Fun app. I could see this being very useful, also. Does an awesome job at taking my awful scrawl and turning nice, neat little perfectly spaced lines on the paper. Worked well. I had no problems with it.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I love this thing, coupled with a nice bluetooth headset like the motorola S305 and i'm in heaven. Deep part is  it works with the ipod controls including Volume Yeaaaaa..<br />Nice range, very small (only wish is that was some way 2 attach it so i don't loose the thing! I really really enjoy this. i take it with me on every hospital stay. no earphone wires 2 worry about getting tangled with all the hospital tubes and such.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|My first thought was that this is a great idea. I was looking forward to giving it 5 stars. But it just isn't good enough. I have 3 criticisms: (1) My handwriting is bad enough. Shrinking it down does nothing to make it more legible. (2) Nor is this app very quick. I can Swype words into a document file just as fast. (3) It is too hard to get long words into the app without switching to landscape mode. If I squish them to fit in portrait then the app squishes them again, they are unreadable.   3 stars for an attractive app, a good idea, and a good try.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|First off, I get that the entire world seems to love this movie, almost blindly.  In my experience, the people I know who loved this movie the most are those who have not read the books.  I must say I envy them to a certain extent, because it is astounding how any film-maker could miss the cinematic opportunities presented by Rowling's amazing source material.  I honestly don't know where to begin.  Let's start with a single line of dialogue from McGonagall.  She is commanding the statues of Hogwarts to defend the school.  This could have been a powerful moment from one of the most underused characters in the film series (don't even get me started on Order of the Phoenix), but the moment is completely derailed by the line \\"I've always wanted to perform this spell.\\"  The literary character of McGonagall never would have said that.  That line was simply juvenile, and a lame attempt to inject humor into a situation where it simply did not fit.  Then, we have a scene which should have made everybody in the theater want to stand up and cheer, but it was done in such a contrived way, it fell flat.  The scene I am referring to is, of course, the Molly vs. Bellatrix scene.  It was just entirely too rushed, and that little look of self-satisfaction on Molly's face afterward was all wrong.  A battle is still raging around her, her son is dead, and this was the first time she had ever taken a life to protect her child.  That look was wrong for the moment, wrong for the character, just WRONG.  What about Hagrid?  He shows up captured in the forest.  How he got there, nobody knows.  So many fans have been waiting to see the fierce giant come out in Hagrid.  In the books, he was a fighter.  In the films, he is, for the most part, a stuffed animal.  A scene of Hagrid taking out a dozen or more Death-eaters before being overrun would have been EPIC.  And then, in the courtyard battle, to get a couple of great shots of a raging Hagrid throwing Death-eaters around would have been equally epic.  This is where I just don't get David Yates as a director.  How hard would these Hagrid scenes have been to shoot?  You need a close-up of Robbie Coltrane showing some serious rage, then a wide shot of the scale double heaving some death-eaters on wires.  Was money an issue?  It couldn't have been time.  This was the shortest HP movie of the series, and the whole point of dividing the book into two films was so you COULD do this stuff.  Harry revealing himself to be alive should've been the most climactic moment of the movie.  Again, a stand-up-and-cheer moment. And it was completely anti-climactic.  We get a grin from Hermione.  Oh, Harry is alive.  That's nice.  I thought Neville was going to kill Nagini right there in the courtyard.  And in the moment that Voldemort goes down, temporarily weakened by the death of another Horcrux, Harry rises up.  The poetry and power of that moment would have been ELECTRIC.  And it falls flat.  Which leads me to Voldemort's death.  Okay, I admittedly enjoyed a lot of the chase and fighting through the castle between Harry and Voldemort, but it should've ended in the Great Hall, you know... like it did IN THE BOOK.  Instead, Harry defeats him with nobody around.  And how did he defeat Voldemort?  Well, that is a mystery. He successfully disarmed him, and apparently that's all it takes.  Even Voldemort's defeat is woefully underplayed here.  It should have happened in front of everyone, and now I guess they just have to take Harry's word for it.  What is it about main bad guys evaporating into the wind when they die?  There's bodies of dead students, teachers, you name it...  But I digress.  I get the sense that the film-makers and screen-writers think that the only characters we really care about are Ron, Hermione, and Harry.  It's sad to see such a waste of amazing talent and cinematic opportunities.  That said, I thought The Prince's Tale was handled beautifully.  If only the other important plot and character momentsof the film were delivered as satisfyingly.  What a missed opportunity.  Again.
B00009Z576|5.0|This is definitely the best Yes album ever and it was pretty much shunned by most fans, critics and even Yes themselves! Shame. This is better than stuff like Fragile and Close to the Edge regardless if they were ground-breaking or not. This album sees Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson absent and replaced by Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn with the usual Steve, Chris, and Alan. I'm so happy Wakeman isn't on this album! He is what makes most of the older Yes songs not very cool! His constant soloing is so annoying that him leaving is what attracted my attention to this album! And to add to his absence, Geoff Downes, One of my absolute favorite keyboardists (Keyboardist for Asia, the Buggles, and Yes) is his replacement! Geoff knows when it's time to solo and when it's time to be just a keyboardist! And Trevor Horn is a better singer in my honest opinion. He has a strong voice and it's very cool to hear him singing with Howe and Squire's backing vocals. The remaining 3 members, Howe, Squire, and White, give us the best Yes performance in the entire history of the band.  Now for the music:  Drama is a pretty dramatic album...(Pun intended)...because of, well, the way the music sounds!  1. Machine Messiah- HOLY COW!!! This is an extremely good song! They opened this album with perhaps their heaviest song at the time but it also has the best melody and the coolest stuff in it regarding the keys and guitar. I like this a lot. This is a song that makes you really think about why this album was shunned...  2. White Car- This is one of those short songs that we saw on Fragile, but this one keeps my attention. It's great when listening to the whole album, but alone, it's just a nice interlude track.  3. Does it Really Happen?- A catchy, upbeat pop-rock style song with the classic Yes-style vocals. I like the bounciness the bass part creates in this song.  4. Into the Lens- A techno-ish song merged with the rock style of Yes which = A catchy song with amazing music! I like this one alot as well.  5. Run Through the Light- Between Machine Messiah, this one, and Tempus Fugit is a tie for my fave song on the album. This one is a nice mellow song but I love the sparseness of this song because it adds to the beauty of it. Very good song!  6. Tempus Fugit- If you haven't seen the other reviews, then I'll say it; This is the only song that will please fans of the original Yes. This is the closest in style and it's very, very catchy. You will have this one stuck in your head if you take the time to listen!  Bonus Tracks- There's nothing special here...I think that they just take up space on the disc because none of them catch my attention. Fans of this album won't even like the bonus tracks because they are Jon and Rick style stuff but of horrible quality. Like they insult the name of Yes.  Verdict: The only reason I have the bonus tracks is because I wanted the remastered version. If you want the remastered version, then you get 10 bonus tracks that aren't even cool at all. I don't recommend the bonus tracks unless you are a die-hard Yes fan. But the original album, I'd say you can get this as your first Yes album. It's seriously that good. Once you listen to this, the other Yes albums won't seem as cool, trust me. The drama of this is how it's better than the other Yes albums yet shunned by even the band itself! I don't understand...
B004VD3YIM|3.0|I'm a long time user of Live Cams for the iphone.  This app is very comparable, but does have a few bugs.  All the bugs I've found so far are related to functionalities that I didn't have on the iphone (i.e. mostly audio related).  Overall, I'm happy with the app, and the issues are small.  Given that all the problems I'm having are audio related, I probably would not purchase the app unless the audio features are fixed (the free version of this app doesn't have audio and worked just fine for my video needs).  If these problems are fixed, I'll update this review.  Of note, I have a sharx SCNC2607 IR and foscam FI8918W camera running on my local home network.  Of note, I'm an IT consulting engineer with about 6 years of application development experience.
B005MVJM3I|4.0|I wasn't a fan of Machine Head until the Blackening.  I didn't like their sound from previous albums but I thought the Blackening was great.  I had a lot of expectations for this album but was worried due to how much I loved the Blackening.  Machine Head delivered on this one.  They kept this album heavy, fast, and loaded with great solos.    They start off fast with songs like I Am Hell and Locust but the later songs aren't as good IMO.  I especially didn't like Who We Are opening with a children's chorus.    Overall great album that lived up to expectations.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Even when using consumer-grade video cameras, sound makes a big difference in the professionalism of a video. A lavalier is an easy and inexpensive way to mic an individual in a relaxed environment. I actually ordered an [[ASIN:B00006I51V Audio-Technica ATR-35S Lavalier Microphone]] and received an ATR-3350. I paid (literally) a few extra bucks to get a 35S because other reviews seem to favor the 35S over the newer, more \\"cheaply-made\\" 3350. So before returning it, I decided to test it to see if it was worth the trouble. I wound up keeping it.   I'd love to do a side-by-side with the ATR-35S, but I'm not going to attempt to buy one again. I have a feeling that most of what sellers still have listed as 35Ss are really 3350s. But hey, that's just my guess.  The ATR-3350 works fine given these considerations:  - A $20 mic will not sound like a $200 mic. Even if the 35S *is* better, I would be surprised to hear a drastic improvement.  - You have a basic understanding of mic placement. If this is unfamiliar territory, hit up youtube for examples  - Lapel mics are noisy by their very design. They pick up the slightest brush against the mic or the cable, and though it's directional, condensers are very sensitive and will pick up more ambient noise than a directional dynamic mic. So why are they made so sensitive? Because they need to pick up articulated speech 12-18\\" away from the mouth, perpendicular to the direction of vocal projection.  - Expect to do some level of post-processing. Even most of the very best recordings in the world have some level of processing (inline or post). Granted, you want to start with a good take, but effects processors do wonders for recordings that were done in less-than-ideal situations. Again, hit up youtube if you are unfamiliar with sound processing.  I used the 3350 for both indoor and outdoor video interviews, worn anywhere from the very top of the collar to the middle of the chest. The indoor interviews had people talking in the background and the outdoor interviews had wind and cars. I used a [[ASIN:B000VBH2IG Zoom H2 Handy Portable Stereo Recorder]] to record in 16-bit/44.1`kHz WAV and at edit time I used the usual set of effects (gate/EQ/compressor) and it sounds great. The interviewees are clear and the ambient noises are not distracting.  Pros:  - Inexpensive. My philosophy is, at this price, if it lasts a couple years, I'm not heartbroken if I have to replace it.  - Adequate SPL for speech. I wouldn't have someone yell into it, but it handled bursts of laughter without distorting.  - Comes with essential accessories (battery, clip, windscreen, 1/8\\" -> 1/4\\" adapter)  - Long cable  Cons:  - No battery indicator. It's easy to accidentally leave it on and the only way to tell if the battery is dead is to test it.  - Uses expensive button cell batteries. Would I rather have a AAA at the expense of a larger enclosure? Yes. I could at least use rechargables in that case.  Neutral:  - It's mono. This is good if you are using an external recorder and/or you will be editing the audio. Stereo sources are cumbersome to work with when all you really need is a mono track for close-miked speech. If you are plugging the mic into a device that records in stereo (most consumer camcorders do this), you will need an adapter or else the audio will be in the left channel.  Unfortunately, because I've only used this mic for a grand total of about 2 hours:  - I can't speak for the battery life, but it at least seems to NOT drain the battery when switched off (as some electronics seem to do).  - I can't really speak for the durability after such light use.  I'll update my review with any new findings.
B0055S348W|5.0|This application is so much fun!  it was easy to use and worked great within minutes. I am so happy to be able to print pictures off of my phone. I love this app!
B005IF5H2S|5.0|If you enjoy real, heart warming music then buy this album! The lyrics to any Lady A song make you feel and just love music. The music in this album is absolutely beautiful like in \\"Cold as Stone\\". Another one of my favorites is \\"Heart of the World\\" I instantly fell in love with this songs meaning. This album is incredible if you buy you will definitely not be disappointed!
B005OHSNMG|5.0|I really enjoyed this pilot. I hope that this series will unfold into a great 1st season. Zooey is really fun to watch.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Absolutely love this cd.  This band is totally awesome and the songs are all great.  I'd recommend it if you like Breaking Benjamin or if you like hard rock.
B005EHNEDO|5.0|It would have been so easy for Wilco to just fade away. No one would have begrudged them any; Yankee Hotel Foxtrot still engenders enough goodwill in the music community ten years after its release that if Jeff Tweedy decided to spend the rest of his years writing paeans to fatherhood and singing sweet, insubstantial love songs with Feist, everyone would simply nod their heads and go along with it. But what Wilco has always done best is growth, from Being There's epic expansion of classic Americana to the unapologetic power pop of Summerteeth to A Ghost Is Born's startling abrasive rock classicism. Through it all the constant was Tweedy, suffering through a recurring painkiller medication and the woes of growing old, his biting lyricism continually well tempered with fine melodies culled from the best folk tradition, from Cash to Young to Bragg. Yet as a first single, \\"I Might\\" was disturbingly coy; for all the lyrics about parental discord and setting children on fire, it was fairly rote late-period Wilco. That is to say, boring and not particularly memorable. In the context of The Whole Love, however, it's one heck of a red herring. It's the most conventional song on here, an old-fashioned rock `n roll respite cleverly placed after the delightfully unconventional opener \\"Art of Almost.\\" That is the song that sets out the mission statement of The Whole Love - an unassumingly complicated drumbeat propelling a foggy atmosphere of discordant electronics and haunting strings, Tweedy himself practically a ghost in the background, all the elements swirling around each other without falling apart. It's a harkening back to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot territory, at least until Nels Cline rips in with a guitar solo that stretches the song to nearly seven and a half minutes and serves notice that this is not the same Wilco that made that seminal 2001 release. It's the biggest mark Cline has made since joining the band, and the only tragedy is it's taken them three albums to finally realize this incarnation of Wilco's potential.<br /><br />It's hard to pinpoint just what The Whole Love does best. There's hints of Summerteeth-esque pop bliss on crunchy guitar numbers like \\"Dawned On Me,\\" where Tweedy's charmingly imperfect voice gives the chorus all the pizazz it needs. The countrified ballad \\"Open Mind\\" finds Tweedy at his most confessional, the campfire vibe recalling Uncle Tupelo and the lyrics Tweedy's most unashamedly direct. \\"Capitol City\\" is a bit more ill advised, a disposable little vaudeville exercise that sounds like a Beatles outtake circa Sgt. Pepper's, but what still captivates is just how well crafted it is. Mikael Jorgensen's jaunty keyboard, Cline's lilting pedal steel, Glenn Kotche's waste-not/want-not drumming (the man is brilliant in giving even the wispiest rhythm a very real substance and gravity): it's all greater than the sum of its parts. That is perhaps the enduring lesson of The Whole Love; for all of Tweedy's evocative songwriting and pained, autobiographical stories, Wilco is a band, first and foremost. More so than perhaps any other album in Wilco's catalog, The Whole Love succeeds because the band isn't evolving exponentially or diving headfirst into musical waters unknown. For all its weirdness, \\"Art of Almost\\" isn't exactly indicative of what's to come, per se. It's how the band members interact on \\"Art of Almost\\" and \\"Capitol City\\" and the deceptively simple title track that makes The Whole Love such an improvement over lackluster previous outings. There's so much going on here that even the most straightforward of tracks has a subversive flair about them that an initial listen might not catch. The buzz saw lower-end distortion in the otherwise sunny \\"I Might\\" and the understated bass rhythm from \\"Rising Red Lung\\" are just two examples, and the fact that they both involve John Stirratt is no coincidence - he is the unsung hero of The Whole Love. But it's more than any one man's contribution, more than Tweedy's forlorn vocals, more than Cline's elegant guitar licks, more than Kotche's economical drumming. It's Wilco the whole band, a unification of talents so seamless you wonder why every Wilco album doesn't come out so brilliantly (and so effortlessly) put together.<br /><br />Perhaps nothing encapsulates what makes Wilco such a special band at this stage of their career than closer \\"One Sunday Morning (A Song For Jane Smiley's Boyfriend).\\" It's not a song that reinvents the wheel; stylistically it would feel just as home on 1995 debut A.M. as it does here. It picks a destination and it sets out for it, riding the back of an irresistibly simple fingerpicked motif and a syncopated hi-hat. \\"This is how I'll tell it / Oh, but it's long,\\" Tweedy sings, and he isn't kidding; at just a hair over twelve minutes, it's one of the longest in Wilco's catalog. But it never feels that way, despite the song's unerring consistency. Embellished by strings and piano, it stays its course and gradually dissipates over a long outro, but the experience is timeless. For twelve minutes Wilco isn't some institutional rock group, testing the outer boundaries of pop and creating something new and exciting. This is a song in the great American tradition of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, painting a picture of old dust roads and melancholy sunsets, Tweedy bemoaning at the end \\"bless my mind, I miss being told how to love / what I learned without knowing / how much more I owe than I can give.\\" It's a celebration of the art of storytelling, a tradition and a template that Wilco have always been deeply indebted to. That's what The Whole Love is all about, telling a story and sticking to it, crafting a mix of sound and lyrics that best symbolizes the music that beats under American highways and floats around American campfires. Wilco have had their peaks and valleys, but they have never sounded as confident as they do on The Whole Love. For a band with eight studio albums and coming up on eighteen years running, I can't think of anything more impressive.cals, more than Cline's elegant guitar licks, more than Kotche's economical drumming.

B0033I5MQI|2.0|I like this album.  I really do.  I'm listening to it right now.  I bought this album, like, six years ago or something.  I bought it giving this band a second chance because two months before that I'd purchased their album \\"Be\\".  \\"Be\\" is unbelievably stupid.  Even if I really liked \\"Be\\" I would still NEVER play it around a girl because that album = never getting laid.<br /><br />But here is the thing, when I hold this album up to what I consider to be real \\"forward thinking\\" or \\"progressive\\" or \\"intelligent\\" music, it sounds pretty horrendous.  Do you need me to give you examples?  Okay; King Crimson, New Order, Brian Eno, Faith No More.<br /><br />All the praise laid upon Daniel Gildenlow (is that his name? I don't really care if it isn't) needs to be rethought.  He doesn't suck.  But he isn't the awesome figure that 46 people reviewing this album say he is.  His vocals are incredibly forced and melodramatic.  Sometimes the greatest emotions are conveyed by what an artist holds back.  This Swede seems to think all his anger and sorrow and joy have to be on full display at all times.  His semi-raps are stupid (I think he likes Mike Patton alot, but doesn't realize he ain't from Cali); let's face it, the funk is best put on by Americans.  Really he sounds the way somebody sounds when they are making fun of this kind of music.<br /><br />My main problem with Pain of Salvation is that they've got ten thousand ideas and can't seem to properly get them across in a subtle way.  Everything is overdrive with these guys.  Gimme some dynamic.  Even their ballads have to have sixty things going on at once ---<br /><br />---oh, right now the \\"rap\\" on \\"Beyond the Pale\\" is happening, please make it stop---oohh I like this guitar solo, too bad it happened thirty times on this album already---<br /><br />--sorry, I told you I was listening to it right now.<br /><br />I like this jumbled mess of an album because it does sound good, but the closer I pay attention the less I like it.<br /><br />To anybody who wants to really know why this band gets such stellar reviews...it's because their fans are nerds, the type of Amazon reviewers who can't seem to give an album less than four stars because they don't want to feel like they wasted their money and don't want to hold on to an album by a band they really like without convincing themselves that they like it.uch stellar reviews...it's because their fans are nerds, the type of Amazon reviewers who can't seem to give an album less than four stars because they don't want to feel like they wasted their money and don't want to hold on to an album by a band they really like without convincing themselves that they like it.
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was funny, entertaining and heartwarming.....and yet, not sad.  The author represented a unique perspective in his writings.  I think more of us should think about things from our animals' view and maybe life would be just a little bit less stressful for us humans!

0316096199|1.0|I could not finish this book because of the constant references to \\"My attacker was black\\" or \\"The rapist was an African-American man\\".  What difference does his ethnicity make? I found the author to be very racist...
B000JQU4TW|3.0|The book starts out OK, with the known Oscar Wilde wit and his excellent descriptive skills. However, towards the middle of the book, the plots descends into a lengthy tiring description of artifacts (musical instruments, stones and jewelry, portraits and so on) that really break the rhythm of the book. By the time I reached the end, I was quite fed up with this inventory of objects. The book ends with a moral, which I found to be quite void and meaningless, as I did not accept the book's premise - That all sins and corruption will manifest in one's physical image.

B004XNGKBS|5.0|Works great on my HTC Incredible. So much faster than typing on regular notepad with the keyboard. Finally an alternative to the standard notes app! Better grab this free app of the day while you can. Once you try it you'll agree it's well worth the price if you miss today's opportunity to get it for free.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I love the X-men series for quiet a long time, and of course, in my belief, this is the best of them all.  I've seen this one for many times, and watching them over and over again doesn't bored me yet.   Somebody claims that the information, acting, or quotes in this movie are conflicting with the previous. Yes it's truth. After watching this movie, I started to watch the whole series. I started to pick up many things from the previous X-men that conflict with the First Class. Many conflicts were so easy to pick up, from the speeches, appearances, etc.  It's soundtrack is awesome. It's pictures are awesome. I was a bit worry how James McAvoy will draw the images of Professor X when I first know about the movie, but now, he fits perfectly into the character.   My point is: Get this movie, it is the best of the series. The conflicts didn't bother me because I didn't remember them real well before I re-watched the whole series.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|This seems to be the best album from Genesis with Peter Gabriel. The quality of sound is nice. If you like progressive, this CD must be in your collection.

0307454541|1.0|All I have to say is \\"ditto\\" to every other bad review about this book. Worse book ever and I don't understand why it was so popular.
B000002GLV|5.0|I give JBF five stars simply because 10 isn't an option. Acquired my first copy of this in a trade for something in 1973 with 6 or 8 other records. Gave it a listen and moved on, being in my mid teens, I was more in to other styles. Over the next 2 years I listened to this record a dozen or so times until by the time I graduated high school, it was my favorite. My appreciation for this album caused me to deep-dive head first into the blues. Later, as a Deadhead, I learned to appreciate many styles of music, always coming back to JBF as a sort of pallet cleanser, a touchstone. I literally wore out several copies of the record and numerous cassette tapes over the years. I bought every Mayall album I could find, saw him live several times, and was so excited when I found it on CD that I brought it home and listened, with tears running down my cheeks.  But that's not what I'm excited about now. I see several reviews here advising that Mayall's Moving On album is better. I just ordered it and it should arrive in a couple of days. I listened to the 30 second snippets of each tune on the Amazon site and I just didn't hear the comparison, however the line up looks the same and I can't wait to give it a listen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The kindle version is flawless. The story continues and it is great but very dark. Once again the story is very psychological filled with a lot conflicting emotions within the main character. how twisted everything becomes worsens as the book continues and then the action kicks in. Not sure why this a teenage series as it is very dark book. But every worth the read. For the Potter fans this book is like the fifth book in the Potter series.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|This app allows one to scribble notes with the touch of a fingertip. Neat idea in theory, but just not practical. I have excellent, small, feminine handwriting, and even with my fine dexterity, I am barely able to &quot;write&quot; legibly with this app.  And? It's a LOT faster to just use Swype =(  3 stars for creativity.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Why this is a teenage series is beyond me. I started reading the series when i saw the announcement that movie was being made. It is a very interesting postapocalyptic series with a violence and the characters go through a lot of trauma. Very well written, definitely worth the read.
B005NFVZTM|2.0|I guess considering all the crap Hollywood puts out today, this movie is one of the better movies.  A good story and good acting... the movie seems real jumpy going from once scene to the next.  I guess our standards today have been lowered so compared to other movies X-Men First class is average.  I enjoyed it simply because I like the X-men universe... that is all I can say.  I don't think this movie will ever be a \\"classic\\".  Maybe after reading all these great reviews before watching I had high hopes and great expectations.  I felt the original Xmen movies were great and really enjoyed them.  The only part of the movie I really enjoyed was when Charles And Eric try to recruit Wolverine (a cameo by Hugh Jackman) who tells them to get lost.  The best scene in the whole movie!  I look at it this way... I enjoyed the movie... and in this day and age with Hollywood I find it very difficult to enjoy their movies.  People say it is better then the original trilogy.  I don't see that!  People also said Batman Beginnings was better than the original Batman movie with Jack Nicholson.  I still think the original Batman was better.  The only remake I loved was Star Trek...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well so we come to the last book. The resolution Good guys vs Bad Guys. Good guys win? The book takes us through the darkest ride for Katniss and it is very clear that everything is varying color shades of gray, that there is no good vs bad, that anger and rage exists in all of us and that sanity in such a world is a valuable commodity. Furthermore it is clear that in war, people die often for good causes, often sacrificed for \\"higher roads.\\" This is perhaps Katniss biggest challenge yet. I warn everyone this is not a book for the lighthearted, this is a book that delves into the effect war has on people and complexities of human behavior and the effects of trauma. There will be a light at the end of the tunnel but it might not be bright enough for all readers.<br />I thought it was very well written story and the ending was not a fairy tale ending but an appropiate one.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Another HIT for Lady A.  No matter what you a feeling Lady A has a way of adding a tempo and saying what you may not have the words to say.  It isn't too often that the singers of the songs are also the writers of the songs.  You can tell that Lady A puts a lot of effort into there music and it shows hugely by how many albums they sell.  All the tracks are fantastic, but \\"Heart of the World\\" moves me in ways that are indescribably.  There is a reason why Lady A is always my \\"go to\\" CD.  If you feel it, they can relate to it!  Awesome job!!  OWN IT!

0385534639|5.0|Loved this book. Story line and the characters mingle into one great novel. The way the author describes the circus is mystical and enchanting. A well written tale with mystery, creative details, surprises and romance. Author indeed leaves you wanting a second novel to carry the story of some characters further. Highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get lost in a true fantasy.
0385512058|4.0|My impression of this book was that surprisingly few people know that the best way to get on is to help others. In the old vernacular this was known as generating serendipity.<br />If we respond to our networks, they will respond back, often in surprising ways.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Just finished seeing my newly arrived Star Wars saga in Blu Ray. An excellent version of one of the greatest movie series ever done. Are there any change on the saber colors? Are somebody yelling Nooooooo, this or the other way? Is a hand seen or not at any given time of the loooooong story? Maybe, or maybe not. But I love the effects, the sound, the images definition, the struggle between good and evil, the brilliant imagination of the creators who make me dream of galaxy teaming with life..... To miss the story, the monumental saga, for minor, and on my opinion, unimportant details, is just like missing the moon by watching the finger that points at it....
B004LWZW42|4.0|The story is great and more \\"believable\\" and more inspired. Great action scenes, and no Wolverine! (Except that 20 second cameo) However, it wasn't close to the comic, like the other movies. Mystique and Prof. X were never \\"BFF's\\". Mystique was never an X-Man. It doesn't follow the continuity of the other movies, so hopefully this is a reboot because the other movies were awful. Juggernaut a mutant in last stand and not related somehow to Charles? Rogue without flying ability and super strenght? Gambit looking like Willy Wonka in Wolverine? Cyclops and Jean Grey dead? This was a better movie, not 100% faithful to the comic, but it's watchable and enjoyable.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've quit playing a lot of games because they are either too difficult for just killing time, or too easy to keep me challenged.  Quell is just right, and excellent for replaying after mastering all the levels.  I played once to get through all the levels, again to hit the &quot;par&quot; on every game, and now I still play it because its easy to forget the solution to each level.  The price is so low, too ... this game is much better than the expensive Frog one!
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Not a big fan of the costume design for Cap. The helmet looked weird. The action scenes we're real brief like a montage and the whole movie felt like promotional footage for The Avengers. There was not much of an explanation of the cosmic cube and why the Red Skull wanted and how he got all the futuristic weapons. Hayley Atwell looked gorgeous in her retro 40's look. The ending was okay. I'll buy it when the price goes down or get it used.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|It's difficult to believe that over 10 years have passed since Ico was first released, alongside other 2001 classics like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Final Fantasy X.  Unlike those two games, Ico fared poorly in the sales charts, despite its incredible graphics, great story and gameplay.<br />However, this was not the end, as 4 years later, the second game by \\"Team Ico\\", Shadow of the Colossus (SotC), was strongly promoted and achieved much better sales figures.<br />Now, Sony has breathed a second life into these games, thanks to this hi-def PS3 re-release.<br /><br />Both games have been significantly enhanced in this PS3 remastery by Bluepoint Games (who also remastered the God of War Collection and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 2 & 3 games), with the most important changes being:<br />+ 720p or 1080p @ 30fps framerate, with very little slowdown as found in the PS2 version during intense Colossus battles<br />+ Native widescreen support for Ico<br />+ Gameplay is ported from the European version, with the extra puzzle, weapon, and other small changes<br />+ Trophies!  [16 for Ico, 31 for SotC]<br />+ 7.1 surround sound<br />+ Behind the scenes videos + 2 dynamic themes (yours to keep!)<br />+ Reversible cover insert containing original cover art for both games<br />= 3D support (but only at 720p, and framerate reduces down to 15fps during some of the battles in SotC)<br />- Textures appear to be more detailed, but they still look blocky close up, and the polygons look the same<br />- The menu/map in SotC is stretched on a widescreen TV, while the menu for Ico looks sharp and completely redone<br /><br />I have already beaten Ico and the first few battles of SotC on PS2, and am finding this remake just as enjoyable, especially since there is virtually no slowdown even at 1080p.  Do realize that both of these games are relatively short with limited replay value (&lt;5 hours for Ico and &lt;10 hours for SotC, much more if you want all of the trophies).  The high production values of both games is maintained during their short stories, and you will likely spend several hours just looking at the beautiful environments in both games (especially Ico).  The orchestrated music during each battle in SotC is terrific and fitting, as are the ambient sounds throughout both games.  The controls are very simple, but some of the puzzles/colossus battles are incredibly challenging the first time around.<br /><br />An in depth comparison of the various graphical settings can be found at eurogamer.net [...]<br /><br />For the $40 MSRP, you are still getting a good bargain, even if the games have been out for 6-10 years, as the visual experience is so much better on an HDTV (if you don't have an HDTV, get one).<br /><br />Now go out and save a \\"princess\\"!you will likely spend several hours just looking at the beautiful environments in both games (especially Ico).

B0034G4P80|1.0|This was way different from the comic. Thor is not supposed to remember who he is while he's on Earth (Midgard) If I remember correctly, he inhabits the body of some doctor or scientist but in the movie he knows who he is the whole time. This revolves about Norse mythology so I have no idea why they had a black actor and an asian play Nordic gods. Marvel is notorious for changing the races of characters for movies. Nick Fury gets a pass because he's black in the Ultimates, but older readers who haven't read a comic in decades would be annoyed by this. At least DC replaces a character who is white with a totally different character that is black. I know they did this to be politically correct, but could've used the black and asian actors to be Black Panther and Iron Fist, respectively. This movie doesn't beat the Iron Man franchise. If I want to have Avengers on my movie collection in the future, I guess I have no choice but to get this but I'll wait until it's in the dollar bin.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|The story of Bethany Hamilton's rise to the top of the competitive surfing world is a wonderful story in itself, but the story doesn't end there.  This movie depicts her harrowing ordeal of living through a shark attack that claimed her arm and the subsequent challenging experience of living her life and expressing her God-given talents without that arm.  What a wonderful story of courage and strength for those who face handicaps, and what great encouragement to all of us, who face other trials and challenges.  This is a great movie for adults and young people (teenagers) alike!
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I am from Norway. I saw the movie abroad, with English voiceovers. It still made me happy.<br /><br />I am glad to see the fairy tales and stories of my childhood reach an international audience. Trolls are part of the Norwegian landscape and mentality. Who are we to say they don't exist? A landscape as vast and wild as this must have some hidden creatures, something to embody it all.<br /><br />This movie has \\"heart\\". It tickles the imagination by playing with the idea that behind normality monsters lurk, ancient monsters, not from outer space but from the deep of forests and mountains. The mythology is old and better than anything new Hollywood might come up with.<br /><br />Some insider facts from Norway:<br /><br />The landscape you see in the movie is the everyday scenery in the country. The director has not tried to find famous or spectacular spots. This is Norway as we know it.<br /><br />Much of the film is shot on location. The Volda College is real. I was a student there. They do indeed have a media and journalism course. The ferry across the fjord is real too. I have taken it many times. Even the camping ground is real. The Dovre mountain plateau in the final scene is a place I been many times, as a north-south highway run across it.<br /><br />Many of the actors are comedians, including the alpha-male troll hunter. His transformation from a catty chatterbox to a man of few words is remarkable. To Norwegians, that they are comedians add to their mock-serious appeal.<br /><br />Foreigners might misunderstand the bit about trolls going after Christians. This comes from the days when everyone in Norway were Christian by law. Trolls would say \\"I smell Christian man's blood\\", by which they basically meant people. (Trolls are obviously pagan.) A modern troll might have said \\"I smell human blood\\", but the movie sticks to tradition.<br /><br />Will this movie open for a flood of troll movies? There is enough material in the tales. Trolls in this movie don't speak, but in many of the old stories they do.

Te band also wrote \\"Cold As Stone\\" with Hillary Lindsey, who has also had songs performed by many country artists. It has a Titanicish musical ending. \\"Singing Me Home\\" is very Motowny, The harmony sounds great on this one. \\"As You Turn Away\\" is a sad number, \\"Love I've Found In You\\" is totally country! The Ballads \\"Somewhere Love Remains\\" and \\"Heart Of the World\\" end the CD. Charles and Hillary duet on 7 of the songs on the CD, I love it when they do that! You will LOVE this CD!

For all the babies on here complaining about the recent changes or the lack of the original unaltered films, grow up.  They've been changed, it amounts to about 5 seconds of changes and move along.  The amount of love and attention dedicated to this set is astounding, with so many extras it would take you 2 or 3 days to go through it all.

B003H9M1QM|5.0|I've always been attracted to animated films. I'm not entirely sure why, but they've always held a special place in my heart. I'm a massive Looney Tunes fan and tend to love any sort of cartoon that was released in the 40s or 50s. One of the reasons I wanted to explore Dumbo on Blu-ray was because I couldn't even remember the last time I saw it. I want to say it's been at least 17 years. To tell the truth, Dumbo may be even better now as an adult than it was growing up.<br /><br />Our story begins with a traveling circus that is visited by a massive horde of storks. Nearly everybody around Mrs. Jumbo, an elephant, receives a bundle of joy except for her. That is until the following day where she gets her wish and Jumbo Jr becomes a part of her life, but nobody can look past his gigantic ears. The small elephant is mocked, laughed at, and given the nickname Dumbo. Dumbo becomes an outcast who is constantly picked on by everyone around him; human or animal. When his mother tries to stand up for him, she's put in solitary confinement and Dumbo is left to fend for himself. With Timothy Q. Mouse, his only friend, by his side, Dumbo learns that his giant ears are good for something other than being laughed at while taking on the likes of becoming a clown, facing off against pink elephants, and merely surviving the verbal onslaught of a group of smooth talking crows.<br /><br />As a complete side note, I can't help but think the entire stork concept is a lot more believable when nothing in the animated world has anything close to resembling genitalia. For being 70 years old, Dumbo looks really fantastic. Dumbo wastes little time tapping into nostalgia that comes crashing over you as soon as you hear the first few notes of the soundtrack, which is a lot better than I remember it being. Every song is pretty flawless; the obvious favorites being Pink Elephants on Parade and When I See an Elephant Fly. The music seems to capture the essence of the 40s so well, which is probably mostly due to its harmony and barber shop-type sound it has.<br /><br />As I was browsing Netflix to rate Dumbo, I noticed it was filed under \\"Feel-Good,\\" which I found kind of interesting. Dumbo does pretty much the exact opposite of making you feel good nearly its entire 63-minute duration. Dumbo gets separated from his mother, he gets made fun of, he messes up, he gets made fun of again, he gets drunk, he gets made fun of some more.  Even the other clowns make fun of him without even trying to. The scene with his mother rocking him with her trunk makes you want to bawl your eyes out. Dumbo has a happy ending, but you'll probably be a complete mess by the time you get to that point. It's also intriguing that Dumbo is the only male elephant in the picture. I guess having a bunch of male elephants sitting around gossiping and being afraid of mice wouldn't have worked so well. But it also made it that much easier to sympathize with the little guy.<br /><br />Dream sequences are another thing that have always piqued my interest. Bending reality in any way, shape, or form is just a fascinating concept. So the entire pink elephant sequence has only gotten better with age. It walks this fine line of being both goofy and terrifying. Also, does it really matter if the crows are possibly racist or not? They're enjoyable characters that deliver one of the best songs in the film. That's all that matters. I have this thing about admiring cartoon birds and Jim Crow is right up there with Daffy Duck and Donald Duck as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Dumbo is sweet at times, gentle at others, and incredibly depressing in between, which is probably the reason why I like it so much. Its animation is still crisp, colorful, and impressive to this day and its music is spectacular. For being 70 years old, Dumbo has stood the test of time better than anyone could have ever hoped. Despite being the shortest Disney major motion picture, Dumbo is still one of the best.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is loaded with special features. There are three different versions of the film you can watch; there's the original aspect ratio presentation (4:3) that leaves two vertical black lines on each side of your screen if you own a widescreen television, there's Cine-Explore which is the film with running commentary by director Pete Docter, a Disney historian, and an animator, and then there's Disney View that has paintings where the black vertical lines should be during the presentation of the film. I recommend watching the film in Disney View since it's a little less distracting than the vertical black bars and the paintings usually have a theme to go along with whatever scene is currently playing; wood during the Casey Junior scenes, clouds when the stork is searching for Mrs. Jumbo, etc.<br /><br />One deleted scene is featured, but it isn't finished animation. The scene got as far as being sketched out, so you get a lot of still frame shots of the sketches. It's called \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" and has Timothy telling Dumbo a story of how giant mice existed in prehistoric times. Somewhere down the line mice became small and elephants remained big, but they're still afraid of mice to this day because of how things used to be. It's a pretty fantastic sequence and would've been a welcome addition to the film to at least make its duration slightly longer. \\"Are You a Man or a Mouse?\\" is a deleted song. It's difficult to enjoy this since it's performed by a different voice actor and just isn't the same. There's a nearly thirty minute documentary-type feature called Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo that is fairly informative of what things were like behind the scenes. The Magic of Dumbo: A Ride of Passage is just a short feature on the Dumbo ride at Disneyland. Sound Design Excerpt from \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\" is really cool. You get to see how sound effects are made in a cartoon and get to see Casey Junior's first appearance. Celebrating Dumbo is a fifteen minute feature of various individuals (a movie critic, an animator, film historian, etc) explaining why they love the film. Original Walt Disney Introduction is exactly what it sounds like it is while Art Galleries features seven different galleries of art. \\"Elmer Elephant\\" and \\"The Flying Mouse\\" are the two Bonus Shorts included with the film. Two games round out the special features. \\"What Do You See?\\" is a scrambled image game while \\"What Do You Know?\\" is a trivia game. Both are a race against the clock and can be played by one person or the entire family. A DVD version of the film is also included on a separate disc and features some of the bonus materials found on the Blu-ray, but not all of them.<br /><br />Dumbo is rated G and is suitable for all ages. There's an all-new English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, a 2.0 English Restored Feature Audio track, a French and Spanish 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix (DEHT), and the film also has English, French, and Spanish Subtitles available. The box says the film is presented in 1080p High Definition with a 1.33:1 ratio, but I believe it's actually only available in the 4:3 ratio unless Disney View counts. The film is approximately 64 minutes long. The Dumbo Blu-ray/DVD combo set is available in retail stores and most online retailers now.rent versions of the film you can watch; there's the original aspect ratio presentation (4:3) that leaves two vertical black lines on each side of your screen if you own a widescreen television, there's Cine-Explore which is the film with running commentary by director Pete Docter, a Disney historian, and an animator, and then there's Disney View that has paintings where the black vertical lines should be during the presentation of the film.

1856697061|5.0|Loved the book, it really helps us to think outside the box. The illustrations are elucidating and the texts well written. I recommend for everyone who wants to be a professional in this area.
1423124960|1.0|I purchased this book for my 3 year old daughter. It has great stories for bed time that are a great length. The stories are repeats from stories released in single book form. The reason I gave this one star is because the book is falling apart. We have only ready about six stories and the pages are coming out by just touching them. I have used a lot of tape to make it through some nights!  I have wrote to amazon to get a replacement but no response was made, it's been about two weeks.
B0029LHWKO|4.0|This book is an excellent read, and one you will want to finish once you start. It keeps you wondering about just what is really going to happen. It addresses loneliness in a deep and meaningful way. One of the main characters is Mr. Singer. The book keeps you wondering about him, making him to appear to be complicated. However, when the book is finished, we understand that he was not complicated at all, it was just an allusion as to the way people saw him. He was a deaf mute who appeared to be very wise and caring, and he probably was to a degree but not to the point that others regarded him. There were people who would come to his room and pour their hearts out to him. They felt he understood and he was their confidante. It was true that since he didn't speak, there was no fear of him verbally telling anyone their thoughts. However, we learn that he really didn't comprehend what they were saying. He had a way of looking at them along with expressions that made them feel he understood, but he really didn't. At his funeral, many people truly felt  a sense of loss. They really did love him and feel that he was a part of their lives. People who were all alone or who felt all alone were the ones drawn to him. They were lonely people, hurting people. It shows us how much people need people. It also shows that if a lonely person finds just one person who will listen to them and just be there for them, it makes all the difference in the world to that person. Mr. Singer never gave advise or responded except through his presence and kind expressions on his face. He was oblivious to the real problems, but he gave the appearance of hearing and understanding. It is a well-written book, and it is hard to believe that it was written by a 23 year old.
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|Of all the disparate members of the original Genesis 70s lineup, Steve Hackett reigns supreme as the artist and performer who not only pays sincere homage to his past, but challenges his audience to an ever-expanding re-interpretation of his artistry and his music. \\"Live Rails\\", as with all of Hackett's live issues, once again finds the guitar virtuoso at his best. I would highly recommend \\"Live Rails\\" and any of Hackett's earlier live releases to any fan who wants to \\"take a little trip back...\\" or to \\"push beyond the existing stagnant musical forms\\".
B0058VW36U|5.0|Smooth framerate, addictive game mechanics, and not enough time to play.  Great port to android, now I know why every android site was raving over this release.  Evo 4g
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  The live set sounds really sweet, the documentary and concert footage interesting, and the alternate versions and demos along with the other goodies included make me look forward to seeing other Pink Floyd albums get this treatment...
076790592X|5.0|I read this book a while back and keep going to back to read it once a while.  This book is awesome, very touching, very meaningful...
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love the game. I've been playing this now for the past couple months and the only gripe I have is that it's free now. :-) It's very well put together and simple but addictive.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I still can't believe people like Diamond Dean (see his review) are still trying to compare everything Sammy does to Van Halen.  This album rocks.  Chickenfoot has their OWN sound and that is what makes them great.  There is a so much diversity on the album.  No remakes of cover songs from other bands...Something VH was famous for. This is true rock and roll... Not songs like \\"Jump\\" or \\"Dance the night away\\".  Van Halens first album was great.  After that, they sold out, until Sammy got there.  If you want to listen to true rock and roll, this is the album.  Thank you Chickenfoot.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|Pay no attention to the \\"story\\" regarding \\"The Hunter\\". You know the chatter of which I speak. That which would lead you to believe Mastodon has wandered off track and cranked out a non-cohesive, non-thematic, \\"just for fun,\\" record--the implication being that well-executed as it may be, it's a disappointing departure. This advance word of mouth that implies an inherent weakness to a presumed tongue-in-cheek looseness is off-base.  Read the recent Decibel interview with Brann and his band-mates, and you get from the horse's mouth that this is a anti-concept album. That it was composed in a shoot-from-the-hip fashion; a way of blowing off steam by thrilling in being creative without worrying about honoring some larger narrative cohesiveness. Listen to the album, and you will feel that. But wait...  \\"The Hunter\\" is as heavy as any record Mastodon has recorded. \\"The Hunter\\" is as dark and meaningful as Crack the Skye (but it's soul is on the opposite side of the color-wheel). \\"The Hunter\\" is the only possible next step. After the super self-reflection of \\"Crack the Skye\\"--after the last strands of \\"The Last Baron\\"--we're left, as an audience, drifting though space. Mastodon is not going to hold our hand anymore. They're not going to read the runes for us.  No previous Mastodon record was written or recorded as quickly as \\"The Hunter\\". The result is not a half-baked collection of unrelated tunes. The result is a aurally palpable sense of urgency that fits the record's spirit of expression without worry.  \\"The Hunter\\" is not a concept album in the same way that Mastodon's last three to four albums have been. But it is the next chapter in the saga, and there is a story. The Hunter is a more personal record than anything Mastodon have recorded, because steeped in the fantastic as it is, The Hunter is an artistic chronicle executed by men who feel they have neither the time nor the inclination to fuss about obscuring their feelings in a byzantine, self-contained artistic apparatus.  Do you just NEED \\"The Hunter\\" to tie into the thematic cycle? I'll help.  Fire ants march across the flesh of a burning mare to extinguish themselves in the sea. Out of an angry sense of adventure, we follow them into waters haunted by a world-sundering beast that we feel doomed to pursue. Somehow though, we wash ashore on a volcanic beach, and stagger to our feet, only to be chased up the monster-infested slopes of a titanic mountain. We lose many of our party amid myriad horrors. After these trials, trapped in a blinding blizzard, we stagger to the top of the mountain and drift into the ether-filled space between the stars in our grief.  We mourn, hurt, and reflect. Then, with our last shred of self-awareness, we recognize that we have a simple choice that we make now...or not at all. Either we drift forever, and lose ourselves to the scattered stars, or we pull ourselves back together, and find the tug of gravity. We choose action over inaction, and the acceleration of our descent is hallmarked by the frictive-fire that melts our protective golden bubble tighter around our ears as we near impact with the mountain below.  The totemic resemblance of the cover of \\"The Hunter\\" to \\"Blood Mountain\\", is not a coincidence. We are re-grounded in a sense, and while there's a clear continuity of identity, we are not retracing an old path. We have regained the rocky firmament because it is time to reverse the atrophy of our muscles, and stand.  \\"The Hunter\\" is a masterpiece. And it is no less about loss--or fun--than it's canonical forebear. \\"The Hunter\\" is about the crushing burden of loss--and the seriousness of life--juxtaposed with the need to move on. To move. Frantically, reflectively, completely. Full speed ahead.  All hail Mastodon.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's a cute little game that works great on my droid 3  I find myself truly sad when I can't feed the little green guy =)  (course I bought it 2 days ago but well worth the dollar!)
B0058VW36U|5.0|Personally, I don't understand the appeal of those irate avians.  I'd much rather feed the adorable Nomnom, and make her happy!<br /><br />CtR is fun, and just enough of a challenge to keep you playing all the way through, but not so frustrating (at all) that you'll want to throw you phone at a Barista!<br /><br />My only complaint is that I want more, and we don't have that yet.  I am confident that Zeptolab is working on more levels, because there's so much more to do with this theme, and I would totally pay $dollars$ for another installment!<br /><br />Don't deny yourself some of that sweet candy, get CtR today!
B0036T32LQ|4.0|It's pretty much a mind f&*k. Deja vu all over the place...The ending is quite spectacular. It's not about the Bermuda Triangle is that is what is deterring you from watching. It does take place on a cruise ship - mild gore - it has it's creepy moments.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Even if you don't get this for free today, it's an awesome puzzle game, a good mind exercise and mental break from your day.  It's worth more than .99&cent;. And that's cheaper than a pack of Big Red gum.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Seems like a fun game but after playing for 30 sec or so the phone freezes. Need to pull battery.  Samsung Fascinate.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|I was so anxious for their 3rd album to come out and I was on top of Itunes downloading the songs they were releasing and I have to say since I received the album I can not stop listening to it. Every song on the album speaks to me and I can relate. From :Cold As Stone\\" to \\"Friday Night Lady\\" gives us an assortment of melody's and chorus to indulge in. Recently, I have some family problems that have taken a toll on me mentally and emotionally and Own The Night has been my therapy to get by. Lady Antebellum has done it again and every song is incredible and they are UNSTOPPABLE!!!
B004U7MQXS|5.0|wow! What a movie. I was 20 in 61 and remember the excitement the Beattles created; This movie is a good recall of those super times.  Even George's Grandfather was good.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|(Let me start by saying I'd give the SHOW itself a 5/5.. I'd give the boxset/packaging about a 2.5)<br /><br />I grew up watching this show as a kid (which I probably should'nt have!) and always found it hilarious. It revolves around a 'dysfunctional' family and their neighbors.<br />Al, the dad, hates life and works in a womens show store.<br />Peg, the wife, is about as lazy as they get, spending all day on the couch watching Oprah and eating bon-bons.<br />Kelly, the 'hot daughter' is about as ditzy as they come.<br />Bud, the younger brother, is always trying to get with some girl. Any girl.<br />Buck, the talking dog.<br /><br />Then there are the neighbors - Marcy \\"the chicken\\" darcy, who is always trying to fight for some cause (usually against Al), her Husband in the earlier episodes (Steve) or her unemployed boyfriend Jefferson (the later episodes).<br /><br />The show really seemed ahead of itself, and a lot of the content just wouldn't fly on network TV today (lots of \\"Fat lady walked into the shoe store today..\\", \\"NO MAAM organization\\", and other rude jokes that just come off as hilarious! This is also probably a good time to point out that women just hate this show, while most men find it hilarious. This is one to watch without the wife/girlfriend, or you might end up sleeping in the doghouse.<br /><br />Each episode is pretty much stand-alone and can be watched in any order, as it doesn't follow a storyline. There are a few multi-park episodes (vacation episodes), but for the most part you can pop in any disc/episode and just enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br />The discs were previously released as 11 individual sets, then compiled into a boxset: [[ASIN:B00432QAKK Married...with Children: The Complete Series]] - each of these contains the SAME DISCS -- they're just a repackaging (it's also very obvious, as the disc arts show little continuity.. some will say \\"The complete First Season - Disc 1\\", others will say \\"Disc 2\\" (without the season), some will list the episode #s contained on the discs. Overall, this is really only worth noting so that you're aware these discs were NOT remastered at all (they still look/sound good), so if you own the previous releases.. no need to buy this. If you don't own the previous releases, you're not missing anything with this version (some re-issues make changes to the content)<br /><br />Because these are the same discs as before.. that also means an unwelcome change for many: Starting with Season 3 (and through the end) the \\"Love and the marriage\\" theme was changed on the DVD release (likely due to a right issue with the song, and not wanting to pay for it any longer). Many find this change to be unforgivable, but it is only the theme song that's affected -- if you skip it, you don't need to worry about it. Season 1 & 2 have the original theme intact.<br /><br />Each season is spread across 3 discs (with the exception of Season 1, which is 2 discs), bringing a total of 32 discs, 261 episodes, or almost 100 hours of the show!<br /><br />Extras are lacking throughout the set - Season 1 has a neat reunion special (about 45 minutes, from the early 2000's), getting the whole cast back together. Seasons 2/3 have some easter eggs, but there are really no extras (especially from Season 4 on) - it would have been nice to get a commentary on a few episodes at least.<br /><br />Video is presented in its original 1.33:1 (fullscreen) - on an HDTV it will have black bars on the side (or will be stretched) - this is normal. Audio also sounds good, but for a TV show from 1987-1997, you can't expect too much.<br /><br />The big difference in this set, compared to the previous boxset, is how the discs are packaged.<br /><br />The box looks the same, but is shrunken down to only 3 inches wide -- this is done by removing the discs from their original sets and stacking them onto 2 plastic spindles housed inside of a cardboard foldout. The box itself, and even the foldout, look good - the problem is with the storage itself.<br />The cardboard foldout is housed inside of a slipcover - once you pull it out, it folds open (showing pictures of Peg and Al), and each of those folds out again (showing pictures of Kelly and Bud), with a set of discs underneath.<br /><br />This is Sony's new way of packaging these sets (which allows them to keep a lower price). The problem is that the plastic disc holder/spindle has problems: It's a very flimsy plastic material (almost like something you'd expect from a microwavable TV dinner), not even as sturdy as a spindle you'd find with recordable CDs/DVDs).<br /><br />The package has 2 of these spindles - one for Seasons 1-6 and one for Seasons 7-11. The discs are stacked on top of eachother with no protection from eachother. At the top of each spindle is a piece of plain brown cardboard to hold it in place (and keep them from spilling/rattling around in the case). Not only does this look cheap/bad, the discs get scratched very easily -- opening the box (new) for the first time, about 2/3rds of the discs had bad scuff marks on them. Another issue is the quality control - I checked all 32 discs to make sure I received them all, only to find there were 33 discs (2 \\"Season 3 - disc 3s\\") - if you purchase this set, definitely check that you receive all 32 discs (an extra isn't bad, but if you're missing a disc or receive 2 of the incorrect discs, it's a big problem).  Because of this, and how the discs are unprotected/arrive damaged, I think this packaging is a very bad idea.<br />I bought a [[ASIN:B000GX31G6 DVD Repair Machine / Kit]] from Amazon a while ago, so I can repair these if needed, but most will need to replace the set and hope for the best.<br /><br />On the back of the box is a glued on piece of paper -- removing this and flipping it over will give a disc-by-disc episode breakdown of the entire series, letting you know episode titles and locations (Season 2, disc 1 - for example). I wish they would've done this differently, as the paper has to be removed from the back (it's glued on backwards, as the back has the UPC/description). A separate insert or even having it printed inside the case would have been much preferred.<br /><br />In the end, the show is fantastic. The boxset, unfortunately, isnt.. but it comes in at a cheap enough price that it's somewhat forgiveable.<br /><br />If you don't want to chance it, or want to have real cases, check out the boxset linked above. It is about 50% higher in price, but that's only 20 bucks difference, which may be worth it.es of Peg and Al), and each of those folds out again (showing pictures of Kelly and Bud), with a set of discs underneath.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was an amazing book. It was full of action, romance, and thoes times when you feel sad. I think this book was VERY violent at times, but heart warming at others. Suzanne Collins has done it!!! The Hunger Games is a page turner. You HAVE to read it. :D
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I Started Listening To Opeth When I Managed A Small Obscure Music Store and Opeth Have Been A Favorite Of Mine For Quite Some Time Now.  The Album Heritage I Think To Be Totally Honost Ranks As One Of Their Best Or Even Their Best Work To Date.  I Was Completely Taken In By This Recording At First Listen. Opeth Is A Forever Progressing and Evolving Band and Anyone and Everyone Who Gives This Album A Listen Should Definitely Give Opeth's Other Recordings A Listen.  Give Opeth A Chance,..I Have Yet To Hear A Song By Opeth I Did'nt Enjoy.  Great Band,..Great Music!  Two Thumbs Up!
B0058VW36U|5.0|great game. It helps teach problem solving techniques that my daughter just loves to do.  I would say that it would be good for a child at the youngest 4(if they can understand what needs to happen before other chains of events).  My daughter is 7 and can play this game for hours trying to figure out the best way to solve the problem.  great game

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Disclaimer:  I have been a Star Wars fan since I saw STAR WARS in the theater in 1977.  I have not purchased this blu-ray set and I have no intention of doing so.  I have never before written a review/opinion on Amazon.  My review is of the content and concept of how this release is being marketed and presented, so I understand that some will argue that I shouldn't write a review for a product I don't own, and that I shouldn't write an opinion of what I wish this set were.  I also understand that some will accuse me of having too much time on my hands or of living in a basement.  Others may say I'm living in the past.   Whenever I choose to purchase Star Wars again, my intent will be to purchase a High Definition copy of the movies that I saw in 1977, 1980, and 1983 in the best resolution available.  This is no different than being excited about and purchasing Psycho (1960), Casablanca (1942) on blu-ray.  Star Wars (1977), like Psycho, is a classic film.  It has been lauded and appreciated for over 30 years, and it should be preserved and restored and presented in the greatest possible resolution.  Technology and the ability to change and edit existing works after their release may lead to increased interest and even an increase in the fan base, but that doesn't have to be and shouldn't be in place of preserving the original.  When the Special Editions were announced and Star Wars reappeared in theaters, I was very excited, like nearly every other SW fan.  The opportunity to see the films restored, theatrically projected, and augmented with modern special effects was an amazing and unprecedented concept.  And following the release, one could purchase the original versions on VHS or the Special Editions.  The fact that they were called Special Editions indicated that they were a separate creation or interpretation of the originals, but as they were made available on DVD and Blu-ray, they are no longer marketed as Special Editions, of course, and the dates remain 1977, 1980, and 1983 (despite the fact that they contain significant material from as recent as 2011, which should now be their stated release date).  Having the Special Editions available on Blu-ray is fantastic for those who want them, but as far as I'm concerned, the original Star Wars trilogy has not been released on DVD or Blu-ray.  They were relegated to \\"Bonus Feature\\" status, and never presented properly for the format or era in which they were released.  And for all those who say to just stick with the VHS of the originals, would these same apologists say the same if every other classic film were altered, rereleased, and only available in its original for on VHS or a low resolution, outdated DVD release?  There is not rational reason that the original, unaltered STAR WARS trilogy should not be available on Blu-ray at the highest resolution possible, restored to look as pristine as when first released (remembering that film resolution is STILL greater than 1080p video)  This brings me to my one other disappointment with this set.  I have no doubt that this is the best that the films have ever looked in an official release and I'm sure the HD presentation is great to look at.  But it still isn't the best they could look.  Multiple reviews have commented on the master sources of these transfers and the fact that they still don't live up to the best of what Blu-ray could be offering.  I have no speculation as to the motivations of George Lucas, but I will not join those who believe that each of his changes are improvements (many come across as cartoony cgi additions that serve only to distract from the story) or that he has taken the time to make the films look as good as they possibly could.  That would have involved a new 4k or 8k transfer of the negatives (clearly not possible for AOTC or ROTS).  I would have purchased this set in a heartbeat at it's current resolution if the original trilogy had been in included unaltered, but I am still amazed by all those whobelieve that this is the best possible resolution or presentation available.  It clearly isn't.  It's the best so far, but just as Lucas rereleased the DVD version to include the low-res originals I can only hope that something similar (and much more respectful to both the films and the fans) happens with the blu-rays.  Spielberg understands what the fans want, as do Ridley Scott, and even CBS digital, which released Star Trek (the original series) to include both the pristine original versions, and the versions enhanced with cgi.  Until Lucasfilm restores and releases the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, I will not be purchasing any version of SW on Blu-ray.  In the meantime, dedicated fans have labored long and hard, with limited resources and have achieved results that meet or exceed the official release in every respect and I will be enjoying those versions.  Technology has enabled Lucas to ceaselessly and unnecessarily tinker with his property, but is has also allowed the fans of his original vision to preserve what was created more faithfully and more entertainingly than he has.  At last, the circle is now complete.  May the Force be with you
B004XQO90O|3.0|A decent cocktail of \\"Quantum Leap\\", \\"Groundhog Day\\" and \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" which sees Jake Gyllenhaal's s air-force pilot seconded into a covert military operation and forced to relive the final eight minutes of a commuter train bombing - via the expedient of a quantum simulation - in order to try and ascertain the identity of the bomber and avert a further terrorist catastrophe.  It's a decent enough film although not quite the tour-de-force I was hoping for from \\"Moon\\" director Duncan Jones's second feature. Gyllenhaal makes a nicely tweaked lead in the Bruce-Willis-in-12 Monkeys tradition but the rest of the cast - with the exception of Vera Farmiga and a criminally underused Jeffrey Wright - are fairly forgettable.  Definitely a case of \\"Close but no Cigar\\"; unfortunately not quite the classic it could have been with a little more polish.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is better than Angry Birds. It is a lot of fun and and now that it is free today I definitely recommend downloading it.
0439813786|4.0|Far more than just a children's book, \\"The Invention Of Hugo Cabret\\" mixes visual narrative with the novel and is a fabulous rumination on the nature of the creative process and finding one's niche in the world. I was at somewhat of an advantage when I read it, as I was already fairly well-read on the early days of cinema (which is intrinsic to the story).   This is a fantastic phantasmagoria of clockwork automata, intrigue and discovery. I'll be fascinated to see how it transfers to the big-screen. Brian Selznick's pencil-sketches also recall a number of MC Escher's portraits (a resemblance which I'm sure is far from accidental).   Once you're hooked, I suspect you'll burn through the whole thing in about an hour and a half (like I did).
B003UESJ9M|1.0|Slow and boring movie. The acting was bad, the storyline never went anywhere and the woman killed herself in the end. Wasn't exactly an uplifting movie and the ending pretty much did it in. Save yourself the hours of torture and AVOID this movie.
B00406UK7S|4.0|I've no idea why this received such a slating.  Taking as its inspiration a decidedly iffy legend concerning a Roman legion that supposedly disappeared after marching beyond the Rubicon of (the then yet-to-be-built) Hadrian's Wall, Neil Marshall treats us to a fabulous gore-soaked and profanity-laden historical spin on the likes of classic hunter-and-hunted thrillers like \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Southern Comfort\\".   It's violent, bloody, profane, humourous and completely entertaining from start-to-finish and frankly infinitely more enjoyable than most of the bloated, portentous \\"historical epics\\" that come out of Hollywood these days (Ridley Scott, I'm looking at you).   Add a top-notch cast including Dominic West, Michael Fassbender, David Morrissey and Olga Kurylenko and you've got a recipe for a thoroughly enjoyable take-your-brain-out-and-enjoy-it action movie.  Ignore the critics, bores, and pretentious poseurs and enjoy.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|An awesome game, a completely awesome game! I could spend hours firing birds at pigs, and already have. And with no ads, the game gets ten times better. Love it!
B00012QLQ4|2.0|This version has a completely different dialogue. I didn't see a difference in the movie animation itself, however if you're a die-hard fan of the original video release. This is a little off putting, because it's like a thesaurus exploded in the script. It kind of gave me a headache and I had to turn it off.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Great product.  I had to return it however bc the input cables were not compatible with my tv unfortunately.  Worked beautifully on another one however,  Just wasn't the one I wanted!  Make sure you check your connections on your tv before purchasing.

B003R0MF1W|5.0|As with the previous two seasons Patrick Jane (Simon Baker)continues to help CBI (California Bureau of Investigation)as they take on unusual cases too big for local law enforcement. He also gets a little closer to his serial killer nemesis Red John as he discovers that there might be a traitor within CBI informing Red John allowing him to stay one step ahead of Jane and the CBI team (Robin Tunney, the marvelously dry Tim Kang, Owaine Yeoman, and the beautiful Amanda Righetti). The stand-alone episodes allows Jane and the CBI team to tackle a number of fascinating cases that are a puzzle to the local police. During the season Jane and his team come under the scrutiny of J.J. LaRoche (Pruitt Taylor Vince of \\"Identity\\" fame)and must prove their innocence in the murder of a suspect.<br /><br />The show receives a very nice, sharp looking transfer. Colors and skin tones are accurate throughout and although blacks are occasionally crushed and there are some minor compression artifacts on the whole the regular DVD presentation looks particularly fine.<br /><br />The 5.1 audio mix isn't quite as active as some--remember this is a dialogue driven show with moments of action but it is active enough.<br /><br />The special features include a featurette with expert criminologists giving us an \\"offender\\" profile of Red John and suggesting what his motivation and plans are for the outcome of the game Red John plays with Jane throughout the series.<br /><br />\\"Red Moon\\": Directed by Simon Baker\\" gives us a glimpse of the work that went into the production for this episode directed by the series star.<br /><br />We also get \\"Lost Evidence\\" featuring cut scenes.<br /><br />Still missing are any meaningful commentary tracks from the cast and crew (that would be a nice plus for this set) or even a trivia track on the Red John linked episodes providing us with back ground from season to season for each episode. The latter would be nice simply because the key episodes are spread over the three season run (to date)with more coming in season four. For those who have already seen season three it would have been nice for a commentary track on the final episode to discuss the outcome and it's resolution in the first episode of season four.<br /><br />On the whole season three more than stands up to the first two seasons with further character development and a better understanding of Patrick Jane's character (and Lisbon's)which, surprisingly, creates an even large aura of mystery surrounding them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.For those who have already seen season three it would have been nice for a commentary track on the final episode to discuss the outcome and it's resolution in the first episode of season four.

B000R9RGF6|5.0|There isn't one piece of music on this CD that isn't worth listening to time and time again. That is how Ludovico Einaudi plays each piece of music with such intensity, beauty and talent that both my spouse and I never tire of these stunning piano pieces. Listening to them brightens and fills our senses with sounds, which we long to hear again and again. Bravo!
030726999X|5.0|For most of the month I've been engrossed in the lives of Mikael Blomkvist, Lisbeth Salander, Erika Berger and a cast of dozens more.  I will miss them and their fast paced lives.  I, like others, mourn that this will be the end of the series.<br /><br />Reflecting the author's outlook on life, this volume, even more so than the other two, features strong female characters.  In addition to Salander and Berger, there are Annika Giannini, Susanne Linder, Monica Figuerola and Inspector Modig.  Each of the 4 parts is introduced with a note about female warriors in history and literature.<br /><br />There are a host of new characters at the \\"Millennium\\" (2 are murdered), law enforcement, the criminal world and the news media.  There are a lot of cameos, one Kurdo Baski, ([[ASIN:1605981745 Stieg Larsson: Our Days in Stockholm]]), an actual friend of Steig Larrson appears as himself making me wonder how many others are embedded in this series, in the same name same character, as the author knew them.<br /><br />Now that I've been through all three, what stands out is how neatly the plots are woven.  The action of \\"Hornet\\" is fully derived from \\"Tattoo\\" and \\"Fire\\".  The characters stay in character and they are both saintly and flawed, much as the people you meet every day. Like any good mystery, you don't stop to consider its plausibility.<br /><br />While the mysteries are solved, there seeds are there for more volumes. Perhaps Larsson had a plots in the planning stages involving Salander's sister, or something from the Caribbean trip, or maybe a hunt for the Wennerstrom fortune. Sadly, there will be no more from Larsson and it's doubtful that a ghost writer could pick up the threads.  These books digest the author's unique life experience as a police beat reporter and a writer and publisher of a magazine somewhat the size and circulation of the \\"Millennium\\".<br /><br />I highly recommend this series for mystery readers.

B0034G4ORC|2.0|------------------------------------------------  \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\"  (2011)  ------------------------------------------------  This is a very loud movie, with a pretty clumsy script.  Meant to be sort of a sci-fi update of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" with a grunt's-eye view of an alien invasion of Earth, seen from the perspective of a Marine unit sent into the battle zone to save a handful of civilians.  The \\"War Of The Worlds\\" premise is appealing, but the delivery is leaden - the constant screaming and on-screen mayhem is quickly monotonous and numbing, none of it delivered with the directorial grace that would make it worthwhile. Plus the script is corny and riddled with inconsistencies, such as the indestructible aliens getting easier and easier to kill as the movie goes on.  I watched the whole thing because I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff, but I didn't really enjoy it much and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I suspect the title, \\"Battle, colon, Los Angeles\\" was chosen because they thought -- hopefully -- this could be turned into a franchise, with the battles of New York, Paris, being made as sequels. Well, that could be okay f they get more skillful producers and way better scripts.  This one was kind of leaden and uninvolving.  Axton)

B001Q9J4PG|4.0|This is the first Tom Clancy book I've ever read and I was totally blown away. He has a very deft touch when it comes to keeping the intrigue going and the story really kept me guessing as to the 'bad guys' real motivations.
B003UESJHO|4.0|This movie is a very fascinating look at an underdog who makes his way up to the top.  That much is as much a cliche as can be expected.  But the family story here is what really sold this movie to me. Christian Bale as Mickey's brother is fantastic. His portrayal is truly impressive. I didn't realize this movie was made in 2010, I am a little slow in staying up-to-date.  But when I watched it I immediately thought he should win an Oscar for his performance.  And, of course, he did win an Oscar, which just shows how good a job he did.  Mark Wahlberg is good here as Mickey, though he doesn't display the same emotional range as Christian Bale. All in all, the movie is good as a boxing movie and great as a drama with all-around good acting.  I really enjoyed it and hear a sequel is on the way.
0452289963|5.0|Reading these two authors is having a profound positive impact on my life.Tolle provides the context for practical experiences taught by Frank Kinslow. But both are talking about the same. Tolle showed me the causes of my suffering and that I can get rid of it; Kinslow taught me HOW to do it in minutes. But with \\"A New Earth\\", Tolle achieves something almost impossible: reading the book itself is the healing. It is an experience. The reading of \\"A New Earth\\" launches us into the Pure Consciousness. I agree with Oprah: it is one of the best books I have ever read on these subjects.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This season wasn't as good as the others IMHO. It was good, but it wasn't quite as....Dexter..as the previous ones. It was satisfying, but it didn't feel the same. Still good though.

B000003TA4|3.0|To all the one star reviewers:  Let's remember folks who Nirvana and \\"their ilk\\" deposed literally overnight.  Bands like Warrant, Bad English, Lita Ford, Poison, Motley Crue, Skid Row, Def Leppard, Cinderella, Slaughter, Whitesnake,  Twisted Sister, Tesla, and everybody's favorite glam hairband with one hit on MTV: Great White. They all bitched in early 1992 that they couldn't get a gig to get their hair done.  Sure some of these bands have hung around to play the local bar, I heard Motley Crue is playing big concerts again and Def Leppard is selling out state fairs. Wow.  I digress. The point is this:  popular music at that time sucked.  Yes we all know Nirvana isn't god and the album is not something to be worshiped. But it was different.    I bought the remastered edition unlike most of these reviewers. (How does a 10 year old review help if the CD came out yesterday)? Packaging is almost identical as the original.  The waves of color are in slightly different shapes.  Really the only thing is the copyright date and a clear jewel case tray.   The sound is hotter than the original, on average about 4-6db louder. I know this because I measured. The limiting is used extensively.  Not the best remaster I've heard as it gets shrill in the mid range and looses definition all over the place.  The U2 remasters are the best I've heard on CD.) It's a toss up, I'm afraid, the original with it's faults or the remaster with new additional faults. It's not a loudness issue people. It's a clarity issue.  I don't listen to music through 1/16th inch speakers in my living room.  I own a stereo with a volume control on it. I know, it's an amazing feature. So let me turn up the music.
1416585710|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read! It's like the most perfect math equation, this book is magic, a masterpiece truly.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I was very excited to hear about this release. I was concerned, however, that 1080p simply meant the output signal. But this is not the case. The polygons haven't changed, but the textures were redone at a higher resolution. This makes the characters somewhat blocky, but the incredible detail of the texture makes it worth it. The scenery is even more breathtaking than before.  Ico is much more immersive than the ps2 version. Ico is a puzzle built around spacious architecture. At a higher res, the illusion of depth in these spacious buildings is stronger.  Shadow of the Colossus naturally has more polygons, so the added high-definition makes you feel like you are playing a game made for the ps3.  This game collection is a keeper for me.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've been waiting for the full version of this game to come on Amazon.  Never thought it would show up but I'm glad it did.  Now I have something to do to ignore my girlfriend even more.  :D
1451629184|5.0|This was a very detailed, well written book.  It is graphic, but necessary to understand the situation and feelings of this 11-year-old girl.  I am impressed and amazed by Jaycee Dugard.  She is truly an inspiration.
031286504X|5.0|It is no surprise that the novella I Am Legend is quite possibly the best short fiction horror story that has ever been written.  In that regard, it is also not a surprise that such powerhouses as Stephen King have borrowed heavily from Richard Matheson's writing style, his ability to weave a story, the balance of utter horror and snide humor, and to explain or to choose not to explain the horror presented within the pages of their works.  I Am Legend not only presents a story that is invigorating and easy to follow, but Matheson goes several layers deeper into the questioning depths of societal norms, religion, politics, and the human psychosis.<br /><br />We follow a main character by the name of Robert Neville.  The first chapter is in January of 1976 and he lives in California as opposed to the modern movie version where Robert Neville lives in New York City and the time period is set into the near future.  That, in of itself, changes a lot of the story.  Regardless, we follow Robert Neville through his routines of living alone in a waking nightmare.  From the get-go we realize that Neville is alone with his thoughts since he is immune to the bite of the vampire and because of that he makes some startling discoveries.  He begins to try and understand how the vampires that populate the world function and why.  Refusing to believe that it is associated with stigmatized myth, he begins his experimentation in the hopes of saving some form of humanity.  He even dabbles into the option as to whether or not humanity is even worth saving, if perhaps the vampire is nature's response to the way we have treated her.  Nevertheless, he pushes is on to find a logical understanding in an illogical world.<br /><br />He, however, struggles not only with the problem of the vampires but the problems within himself at having lost everyone he knew and having no one to talk to but himself.  During this stage he questions society, religion, politics, everything that once existed in comparison to the vampire--finding little to no differences there.  Like most established order, depending on your view, it can become suffocating.<br /><br />As the vampire consumes his life and gives him the only reason for living Robert Neville also loses himself to an animalistic way of life, losing his ability to communicate and function properly.  When his world gets flipped upside down, he reacts in the only way he knows how.<br /><br />An excellent read and truly a masterpiece in a quick 170 pages.  The rest of the book consists of short stories also written by Matheson which are all very good, unique, entertaining, sometimes funny, and certainly horrifying tales that follow his style where the abnormal infects the normal and has a deep, sub-level understanding that can be analyzed and critiqued openly.ire--finding little to no differences there.

1401223176|5.0|No spoilers here..! Batman: Hush is a must read. Whether you are a new reader to the Batman universe or you are a collector who is looking to expand your collection, Hush offers a lot for you. Jeph Loeb is a master level story teller and each series with his name on it continues to entertain. Jim Lee, well if you are not familiar with Lee then your eyes are missing out. Lee illustrates each page with so much detail you can find yourself staring in amazment instead of reading the dialogue. Now that you know Loeb and Lee, welcome to Batman: Hush. Read any Batman graphic novel/TPB top ten list and you are likely to find Hush on it. Hush offers everything a great Batman comic should have (a great story, the best villains and the worlds best detective work). Batman: Hush introduces you to a new villain named \\"Hush\\", who is using the best of Batman's rogues gallery to help defeat Batman. Several villains make their mark in the Hush story line and several heroes are included as well. Lots of action, lots of mystery, and lots of fun; thats what you will find here. I highly recommend Batman: Hush and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B001GH1ZQE|5.0|I purchased this album after the singers untimely passing. I should have bought it much earlier. This album is great, simply one of the best albums in my collection. Her voice is smokey, jazzy, sensuous and bluesy. I love the arrangements of the songs and the throwback style. She was truly an incredible talent. If you don't have this album, you need to get it; you will not be sorry!
B004X4RU9I|3.0|Just finished watching this movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first part and found it to be pretty great story line and of course sweet kung fu.  I enjoyed this movie as well.  The fight scenes were great but the story line was a little weird to me.  Perhaps, if one knew a little bit of history of the British relations with the Chinese at the times, it may have made more sense or more realistic.  The movie kind of felt like a version of Rocky V where 1) different cultures clash, 2) someone gets killed fighting, and 3) revenge is taken and all is well at the end of the movie.  I give it 3.5 vs 4.5 for the original.

B005D51JQQ|2.0|I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but from my local indie shop in Pittsburgh.  It is quite overpriced for four discs and an interesting, but mundane, book.  More irritating is that disc one is terribly scratched and skips and stutters when played.  One would think that at this price a little quality control is exercised.  Do they have monkeys load these packages? Trying to access the Universal Music website to report the matter...well, the Salemis crashed the White House with more ease of access.  I don't want to return the whole package and trouble my local retailer.  This same thing occurred with the joke that is the Layla/Derek box set (the contents were a mash of torn and shredded memorabilia and glue covered discs).  No small wonder that the music business is in chaos and people download the  hideous sounding ear-plug sonics.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome! works great on the htc sensation. I think its better than angry birds, but almost the same idea. I loved that I got it for free, its hard to find good free games, but I think this game is worth the buy if you weren't able to download it when Amazon offered it at no charge.
0060557818|5.0|Really, really enjoyed this book.  I saw a (BBC?) television mini series based on the book first and enjoyed it enough to want to read the book.  Both are excellent.  My biggest disappontment is that Gaiman never wrote more stories using the world he created in \\"Neverwhere\\".  Fascinating world with wonderful characters.  Would also love to see a well-done series based on \\"Neverwhere\\".
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Regardless of whether you had played ICO or Shadow of the Colossus when they had came out or not, are a game aficionado or a casual player, you owe it to yourself to have these rereleased titles. There are very few people who would claim that these two games are \\"overrated\\", as there is much to appreciate, discover, and enjoy in both.  These are two timeless, beautiful classics made better.  They are very hard to fault.<br /><br />I won't go into any detail on the content of these two games, as they are best left to player discovery for those playing for the first time.  I will say that as adventure games, they fulfill their role and unlike many games these days, does not force unnecessary exposition and plotlines down your throat.  They are very minimalist and like a well told story, leave it up to your imagination to fill in some of the blanks.<br /><br />For the most part, I generally regard older games re-released in HD to be overpriced money grabs by gaming publishers, but every so often, the publishers will do it right.  Shadow of the Colossus, in particular, stands out in that it presents the game in the way it was meant to be played.  The framerates are much smoother than the original PS2 release, and the atmosphere and presence of the Colossi carries much more impact, as the suspension of disbelief is not interrupted by the aliasing (jagged lines) that plagued the originals.

Would also love to see a well-done series based on \\"Stardust\\".  I higly recommend both the book and the movie.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I was not born when this happened being only 20. To be honest, i hadn't even heard of this event. My professor though suggested it as summer viewing before attending his class. I thought it would be a boring documentary. The guy that performed the stunt, also the narrator for much of it really likes himself. He was so thrilled at what he did and it seemed he craved the attention the documentary gave him, he just ate it up. However, this was mostly comical and did not detract from the overall viewing of the movie. I still found it very entertaining and very enjoyable. I really liked it. His passion only made it more fun to watch and follow.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Wow! Star Wars hits Bluray and I'm sure all the geeks are up in arms about the fact that Lucas decided to give us the Special Editions (no doubt so he can sell you the originals yet again, down the line).  Well...  like I said in my last Star Wars review way back when it hit DVD for the first time, you don't have to buy it, no one's holding a gun to your head, right?  With a franchise this big and a dedicated fan base this large, the geeks will never be satisfied.  Oh well...  I'm here to review the movies and the fact theat they look stunning in their Hi-def format.  Episodes I-III have never been my favorites.  I have a allergy for bad acting and Hayden Christiansen is enough to evoke thoughts of suicide,but on Bluray they look absolutely stunning and this actually made me like them just a tiny bit more.  The original three films were all about story and the actors, the latter were all about CGI and... who knows, Jar jar Binks?  Episodes IV-VI are the Special Editions, as I said, but they look better than they have ever looked, and that comes with it's pros and its cons.  The better the picture, the clearer the glitches.  In the opening scene, where the Empire has captured the Rebel Blockade Runner, Darth Vader emerges from the smoke and destruction, and you can see the brushstrokes on his mask.  It looks like it was made by a 10-year-old kid.  Que Serra Serra.  But it still looks amazing and the sound is phenomenal.  Extra features galore!  Deleted scenes from the original movies.  Interviews.  Making Of... documentaries.  Wow!  There is plenty here for the geeks to salivate over and plenty here for the casual fan as well.  Sure they're not the originals.  Sure Greedo shoots first still...  But what are you gonna do?  Buy it or not.  Very simple.  I am a fan. I own these movies on VHS, DVD, and now Bluray.  Gotta have them.  They truly do look fantastic and the 3 bonus discs have a ton of stuff to keep you entertained for over 40 hours and that's insane.  Do not like the sleeves for the discs (scratches???  really?  Does no one think of these things?)but the packaging is compact and well illustrated.<br /><br />Overall, you will have a choice to make, to buy or not to buy, that is the question...  I have been a fan since '77.  I have to own the original three films.  The latter three can burn in hell, but in this is a chance to them all at once (you can buy them individually, if you are insane).  And the price was very reasonable.  So sit around a moan and cry and whine about how unfair George Lucas is, or....  Pop in the Blurays and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Dig it!like the sleeves for the discs (scratches???  really?

B000VNMMPM|5.0|As it has been pointed out other reviews, Jean Luc Besson decided to make its presence in this sympathetic and well-run urban fable of self-redemption, self-knowledge and catharsis  about a citizen who overwhelmed the weight of certain covenants eticamnte questionable decides to end his life, when suddenly, an enigmatic and seductive arises blonde who also decides to jump from the bridge.<br /><br />From there. Besson takes the best of It `sa wonderul life and Wings of desire (even refers explicitly to a section of the soundtrack of the film, Wenders) and through the glorious black and white job telling a story enjoyable, entertaining and deeply thoughtful about of the human condition, its mysteries, social conventions and taboos.<br /><br />Magnificent directorial effort, superb script and wonderful actors direction confers it (with fairness)the film one of the great successes of this talented French director.

1430233834|4.0|I'm attempting to teach myself HTML5, JS, and CSS using this and a few other books.  This one is easily the best suited for my situation thanks primarily to the line-by-line breakdown of the code.  Too many other books include a singular line of code that isn't explained and can sometimes derail my learning curve.  If you are considering teaching yourself HTML5 from scratch, this book is terrific. I recommend reading through each chapter before actually typing out any code.   I gave it 4 stars because I wish there was a bit more content.  By the end of the book, I feel there could have been some advanced techniques introduced.  Overall though, this is a fantastic starter.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Something Borrowed is a fun and entertaining rom-com based on the best-selling novel of the same name. I saw the movie before I read the book. There are some differences with the movie and book which is understandable. Ethan is hardly in the book but he's in most of the movie is one difference. I thought Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson were perfectly cast as Rachel and Darcy. Rachel is a supposed good girl who ends sleeping with her best friend's man. Darcy is a selfish, self-centered party girl who bosses Rachel around. In the book, Rachel and Darcy's friendship is kind of already splintered but in the movie, the two friends are very close which makes Rachel's betrayal even more heartbreaking. I loved this movie and I loved the book, I highly recommend both! Enjoy.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I hate business books. But this one reads like a science fiction novel (a genre that I certainly do not hate) or a rock band biography. If you've seen the \\"Social Network\\" (and hated how it exaggerated everything about development) then you are prepared for the types of discussions and drama contained within - however, imho this would make a much better movie. It's incredible to realize how much Google has accomplished over the past decade. The best parts describe the triumvirate of Page, Brin, and Schmidt - their personalities jump from the pages of \\"In the Plex\\" and I almost feel that I know them personally after reading this book. Their playful creativity - and strategic brilliance - is something all entrepreneurs should aspire to. The biggest take away is the freedom that Schmidt granted the other two - and how at every turn, the Googlers rejected common business practices and tradition to find a new way. From the 20% policy to the culture established early on in Google's history, everything this organization choose to do catapulted them to success. The idea of a corporation as form of artificial intelligence is also fascinating. The history of the development of the \\"google algorithm\\" is also beneficial for those working in search or social networking (I am an engineer working for a non-google search engine). Highly recommended.

B0001907DA|5.0|Seller is awesome.  Product arrived ahead of time.  The series is nostalgic to me in that I grew up with the series.  The series actually inspired me to go into police work.  Each character can be found in real life.  I am a twenty year veteran of law enforcement.  Although some of the series is unrealistic--each of the characters have a life and can be found within your local law enforcement community.  Whether or not if you believe it---there are Tackelberry's, Mahoney's, and Hightowers, serving you on a daily basis.  Police officers are as as genuine as anybody else in the world.  This series casts a comedic life about the work---even as dark as it may be in real life.  Police officers like to have fun as anyone else---don't let the negative influence the positive.  We believe in justice and the sanctity of your lifestyle----whether or not we have fun enforcing the same.  The Police Acedemy series is just a glimpse into the world of law enforcement.  It's really not far from reality.)
B004XNGKBS|2.0|The app works on my EVO 3D.  But I can't easily export the files into more conventional text format in other applications. And typing using a good keyboard such as SwiftKey X is faster.   I can't use it to record drawing unless I want the drawing shrunk onto one line height.   The only candidates for using this program that I see are those who take notes involving equations or other odd characters, and maybe people who are absolutely allergic to using a keyboard.
B0058VW36U|4.0|BRIEF OUTLINE AND GAMEPLAY<br /><br />It's yet another physics-based phone game but quite well implemented for the Android. It runs well on a XOOM and it plays in portrait mode only. Like all Angry Birds-like games, here too you have dozens or hundreds or 'levels', each a progressively harder to solve puzzle and, depending on how well you do - making the lollipop that's hanging on ropes drop into frog's mouth (we all know that frogs are into lollipops) - you earn points and from 1 to 3 stars. Then you move to the next level.<br /><br />It's fun until it gets hard, followed by 'very hard' and then it gets harder than that. There are no 'hints' so you're on your own.<br /><br />Options are sound on/off, music on/off (and the music is awful in its repetitiveness) and the ability to reset the game. If you really want to make friends with the developers you can follow them on Facebook or Twitter.<br /><br />SCORELOOP<br /><br />And it's not just you, your frog and the hanging candy. This game comes with 'ScoreLoop'. Unlike OpenFeint games where participation is usually optional, this game does not have an option to turn off 'Scoreloop' or opt out. Through Scoreloop you can earn an enormous number of achievements based on the numbers or stars coins (points) you earn and the ropes you cut. There are also leaderboards that show you who did well globally, in the past 24 hours and among your ScoreLoop friends if you have any.<br /><br />RATING<br /><br />For a mind-bending challenge, I personally prefer [[ASIN:B005LY4B0A Greedy Spiders]] but Cut The Rope is not a bad game. In fact it's quite good and I can see myself playing it when I had enough Greed Spiders frustration. It's a 4-stars, mainly for not making Scoreloop tie-in optional. I'm not expecting the impossible because most OpenFeint games I know of give you the option of non-participation.

B005OCFHHK|1.0|You can tell from what's available on this boxed set that Warner Bros. was just trying to rush out a boxed set in time for Christmas, but, honestly, this is almost an insult to fans. If all you want are the movies, then here you go. If you want extended versions of the film, new behind the scenes extas, Blu-Ray exclusives, looks like the lazy good-for-nothings at Warner Bros. are going to make you another year.
B0021L9ME6|5.0|Yes this movie has it's campy moments, but if you take it too seriously you probably wont enjoy it.  Halle Berry does a great job of capturing Catwoman, Sexy, Smart, & powerful. She dominates in the 'man's world'.  People are so harsh on this film because it's \\"one of many Catwoman\\" and does not take place in Gotham city,and the character is not Selina Kyle.  Also it has been known people have not liked the villian choice.  But Halle Berry as Catwoman is puRRfect whether people will admit it or not. The movements, the looks, everything she did was actually based off real cat movements.
B005974CDU|2.0|People must not forget that Mike the new drummer had to fill in the blanks on this album, the drumming was already set up by DT members, so we really dont know what Mike would be able to do with the drumming.  Jordan seems to be taking the lead in the songs, which for me, it's horrible. He's proficient, but pretty annoying in the songs. Myung we don't know if he was playing cause you don't listen to him.  Petrucci seemed bored and without inspiration, listen to understand why. Labrie was ok.  As it was said in another review \\"The album is a gray mass containing craploads of forced, uninspired instrumental wankery, multiple showoff passages, incredibly drawn out fragments, boring singing and flat, lifeless choruses.\\"  The 2 stars for: Outcry and Bridges In The Sky (which could´ve been an even better song).  *I really don't know if this has to do with Portnoy's departure, what matters is that the ending result was not good. Disappointing!

B004EPZ016|5.0|I enjoyed this film thouroughly. The performances, especially by Pitt and Hill are perfect and the supporting players all fit in and support the world that has been created (or recreated to an extent as the case may be). The music was perfectly done and the directing felt very real and intimate, the film's execution kind of reminded me of Friday Night Lights (both the film and the first season of the series). It feels like a documentary that goes more in depth and shows personal moments that could not otherwise be obtained. The story is compelling, even moreso in that it is based on the known true story of the Oakland A's, and Pitt's character is likeable but a real person who seems tough enough to have made it as a GM in such a hard hitting business. Watching Pitt as Billy Beane execute player trades is simply pure cinematic entertainment at its best.  I must admit that this film isn't entirely what I expected. The previews had me thinking that the explanation of the statistics would be more fast paced and energetic (though it never drags it does take its time) and that a large portion of the film would be spent with the team and on the field. While we do get glimpses of the team (usually off field) the majority of the movie tells a sports story from a different angle, it was at first off putting as I didn't expect it but then it became compelling and even refreshing.  This film isn't focused on the field, other than when the field plays a part in Beane's story. This isn't a film about the Oakland A's, it is a film about Billy Beane and the experience of a General Manager trying to get by with low funds. So we find many games are seen on television screens or only in short glimpses.   I did miss the usual sports movie theme of following some of the players, the first half of the film set up several key players in more personal scenes but then their stories were never explored in any more depth and they are blended into the team as a whole. The coach, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only character other than Billy who is really given a large personal development. He struggles with what Billy is doing and understandably has a hard time playing along when not only his job but his career could be on the line.  I was also, having not read the book, unaware that Billy Beane was divorced. Obviously this is true to life and so there can't be any arguments about it. It is refreshing in fact to see a different dynamic being played out as we see Beane having shared custody of his daughter. The reason I mention this is because my preconception was that this would be a film about a man and his family, I expected the usual scenes of him being reassured by his wife and kids and so on. We do get that but in a very real and nonromanticized way. Once again, different from the norm but executed so well that it is refreshing.   The entire film has a gritty and real feel to it, while there are some moments where it romanticizes the sport and situation of Beane, the rest feels very honest and to the point. We spend a great amount of time in the film with Beane, this is truly his story, and his life is not shown as picture perfect. These are the struggles we have yet to see in the glory shown here, this is the story of a general manager who is struggling to hit a home run.  This is a great film for anyone, not just baseball fans, it isn't a film about baseball as much as it is a film that explores what goes on behind the scenes and off the field. Let's hope this film will garner a return to sports themed movies, there have been so many comic book movies as of late I for one could use something different.

0060558121|4.0|After a few years in prison, Shadow is released to find that his wife tragically died along with his best friend.  Few remnants of his past life remain and he quickly meets Mr. Wednesday, a mysterious character that requests his services.  Their journey continues across America to meet many of his new boss's unusual colleagues and acquaintances.  Through a series of twists and turns, the novel unfolds into a great tale of intrigue and mystery culminating into a battle between the old and new Gods of this world.  The novel is the winner of both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 2002.  I enjoyed the book, but unfortunately had very high expectations prior to reading that were not entirely met.  Neil Gaiman is a talented writer with a prolific career.  I would recommend the book and look forward to the HBO series adaptation that is planned to come in 2013.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I had actually already downloaded this for free from get jar, but you don't get updates from them so was willing to lose my already  beaten levels to get the Amazon version door free.<br /><br />This is one of  the most fun games. Simple to play, but very cerebral. Unlike Angry Birds where I don't really care hire many stars I get, I just wanna beat the level, on Cut The Rope, you really want to get three stars on every level because getting all the stars is what makes it fun and challenging.

My seven year old is going to love it.  The graphics are pretty and the game play is flawless on my Xoom.  Totally worth the $1.  My only wish is that it had a quit button on the home page, otherwise I would have given it six stars...
B0058VW36U|4.0|just started playing this before bed, bad idea..... looks so adorable and challenging! can't wait to play this game when I have more time.
B00596WEVI|4.0|In the past things were too busy, business too hectic to write reviews, but with today's economy... (shrug)<br /><br />I mention it because several years ago I wanted to review a shockingly good Jean-Claude Van Damme flick. Believe me, it sounded crazy even as I was saying it. But the truth is - given the right vehicle and direction the man *can* act. But again, time passed, and now I'd have to look up the film's title and rewatch it in order to stand by that statement.<br /><br />However, the other night I screened a more recent film project and I have to say: It makes me wonder what his career would look like today, and how we would view him (not as a punchline to many a joke) had he done more work along these lines. This movie is very decent bordering on pretty good. He plays to his strengths, having maintained the prerequisite six-pack body and solid physical presence, but deftly avoids falling back into the old routine of kicking and punching his way thru a script.<br /><br />Not sure if he himself recognized it or he listened to someone he trusts, but the world of martial arts, as in all things, progressed. Those mile-high kicks and incredible flexibility shots have long since fallen out of favor, and quite frankly look ludicrous in today's action films where kinetic energy is mixed with new school ground-n-pound and old school Japanese jiu jitsu.<br /><br />Gone is the complete focus on the martial arts, gone too are his looks. The years have taken their toll and it honestly looks pretty good on him. He finally has the rugged element to match his physical ability, a world weariness similar to the transition Sam Shepard went through. And like the acclaimed writer/actor, gained depth through attrition what they couldn't muster as younger performers. They earned cred by living through hard times. Some in the craft find their \\"voice\\" by going through Life, and if they're very fortunate, it will lead to a second turn on the carousel. If not, oblivion, and hopefully a smooth transition back to being a regular person.<br /><br />In this production Jean-Claude portrays Vincent, a supremely competent mechanic who promptly executes his work, returns home and quietly prepares for his next assignment. That's it. With the exception of a tiny turtle who fears him and a collection of violins, that's the entirety of his existence.<br /><br />And that's about to change.<br /><br />He's offered a new lucrative contract. However, it's one that his business agent points out is extremely dangerous, even for a man with his skills. But the pay is double his normal fee, so there's no hesitation, he agrees to take on the assignment. Kept from him is the reason why this target has been selected for death. He's a criminal overlord who is being used as bait for yet another assassin. Said other contractor has a blood vendetta against the crime boss for beating and gang raping his wife into a permanent vegetative state. So when he learns that the scum that was responsible is to be set free from prison, it draws him out of his seclusion.<br /><br />Vincent doesn't realize that the job is not the real reason he's been hired. His actual purpose: A stalking horse. That doesn't become clear until the two assassins choose the exact same moment to take out the mob boss. Unfortunately, each hitter interferes with the other's kill shot. Realizing what happened, they switch their focus and decide to use their abilities against each other.<br /><br />Their meeting is bone-crushing and lead-laden. Each is a professional and each refuses to give up. Bloodied and sore, they begin to develop respect for the other's ability. Pausing the battle to seek out enlightenment, they do the unexpected and begin to exchange information. It's finally clear that they've both been set-up and perhaps they need to stop trying to kill each other and reassess the situation; figure out who's really pulling the strings and who is the true target.<br /><br />My only complaints were minor. The emotional accoutrements - the turtle and violins - were a bit of a copout, attempting to humanize Vincent's character. On one hand I appreciate that many of these individuals need some other element, some diversion not associated with the job. But on the other hand, I wonder why the need for these oft-used tropes? I often wonder how realistic this aspect is given it's been boilerplate script for hitmen in films for at least the past fifty years. Is it a truth that filmmakers have captured? Or a contrivance that has worked its way into the group consciousness of creators the world over? At least the James Bond villain [[ASIN:B00004RG63 Scaramanga]] (Christopher Lee) did the job to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, ditto the scene-stealing performance by Richard Jenkins in '[[ASIN:0790731959 Absolute Power]]'. Blatant avarice is a truth one can easily accept. Stringed-instruments and offbeat pets, not so much.<br /><br />But those tiny quirks can be forgiven because the movie delivered what it advertised.manize Vincent's character.

It does work very well on tablets, however.<br /><br />It was also disheartening to learn that it sends your private info to a third party with neither your consent or knowledge, and that third party uses the game to track y hour usage  and who knows what else).

B004ZNARH4|5.0|I have read some of the reviews and people seem to be whining. Of course everyone would tweek this one way or another to suit their tastes but this package is awesome. I agree that the swag and trinkets are not important to me but they are still cool...(someone above said they didn't understand the marbles.... a common theme of TDSOTM era Floyd is madness or \\"brain damage\\"... you don't want to lose your marbles do you? LOL).  I see some other reviewers comparing this to career spanning box sets that encompass several albums - remember this is built around a single album. How much more audio/video content do you think there is surrounding this single album? IMO they probably gave us everything worth having so if you are expecting a bigger and better box set for TDSOTM in 10 more years I doubt you will see it. By then most of the group will be pushing daisies and the fans will either be in the same boat or on fixed incomes or deaf.  The audio and visual content in this box is astounding. It will take hours to get through it all. I am not going to go through in detail of everything included because others have already done that. If you love this album like I do and feel it is one of the top 10 albums of all time then pay the money and get your ticket.

B00009W8N2|5.0|This is the one release from Opeth that always seems to grab me and keep me listening.Don't get me wrong,I really like BWP MAYH (my other favorites) but I just seem to appreciate the rawness that is in this one and the guitar sound.What else intrigued me to this opeth release was all the folk influences in some of the songs,but not overbearing and it doesn't go off on a tangent like a lot of prog music that has a bad habit of doing.I never tire from listening to orchid,it is one of my favorite metal \\"albums\\" of all time,there's just something about it that keeps me listening.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game is fun. Five stars. Loads well, runs smoothly. Droid X.   I read people's comments on here, and they discuss 'self discipline' for waiting for it to be free, and others are upset they actually paid for it? It's a buck. It supports the developers who made the game. Chill out.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so much fun. i play it all the time and its very addictive. buy it and support the developer to make expansions!

B000002L99|5.0|After the departure of David Lee Roth many people wondered if Van Halen could recover. After all Dave set the benchmark for showmanship and wiley antics. On The Other Hand, Sammy Hagar was an established, relatively well-known artist with an admirable pedigree, coming from Montrose. Hagar, who is originally from Monterrey California, was, unlike Dave(Bloomington,Indiana), a Cali native. His vocal style was decidedly different and his showmanship could not be more different than Dave. Hagar represented a change to a more mature and sophisticated Van Halen, certainly one that would appeal more broadly to a female audience. The opening chords of Good Enough let everyone know that VH was back with a vengence. The whole album is full of optimism and excitement about a successful future. The album was the first #1 for VH, 1984 was #2 behind the biggest selling album of all-time Micheal Jackson's Thriller(35+ million copies), so this might not be a fair comparison. Why Can't This Be Love, the first single of the album, was a great rock anthem and also a Top Ten Hit. Get Up! made a statement about Van Halen's ability to shred with Hagar, at a time signature of 300+, it surely lived up to the old VH standard. Dreams, which is a superb song, and probably the best song they have ever done in my opinion, is about the importance of never giving up and following your Dreams. Summer Nights, which was originally written with David Lee Roth before he left the band, and if you check the inside booklet of 1984 you will also see that that album was recorded at Eddie's home studio 5150, has one of Edwards BEST solos, with whammy bar antics comparible to Steve Vai and Brad Gillis. Best Of Both Worlds has an AC/DC feel to it, and a bare-bones approach by Edward, who concentrates on chord progression instead of his usual flamboyant style. Love Walks In is a song that holds very emotional meaning for me personally because I always envisioned my \\"first time\\", while listening to the song. The song also has one of Eddie's most emotional and provactive solos. 5150 is Edwards technical masterpiece of the album, it includes almost every guitar technique that Edward pioneered himself, tapping, pinch harmonics, ghost notes, and double stops are all included in this composition. Inside, a piece in the vien of Roth's Happy Trails or Big Bad Bill, is meant to be a slap in the face to their former singer. The production after the loss of Ted Templeman to Roth, was handeled by Mick Jones from Foriegner, Andy Johns, and the band themselves. The album represents a departure from \\"party\\" Van Halen, it started a precendent of 4 Number One Albums for the band.song also has one of Eddie's most emotional and provactive solos. 5150 is Edwards technical masterpiece of the album, it includes almost every guitar technique that Edward pioneered himself, tapping, pinch harmonics, ghost notes, and double stops are all included in this composition.

I am tired of dragging the keyboard around, the mouse you have to hunt and peck to adjust your audio. This thing just sits on your desktop and press once, MUTE, press again, UNMUTE. Gee, that was simple. You rotate clockwise, the volume goes UP! Rotate anticlockwise, the volume goes DOWN!  This thing is programmable, pretty, and PERFECT!
0385344325|5.0|Jack Reacher has an interesting week after falling for a beautiful former marine MP county sheriff in rural Mississippi. There's been a murder in the base town for an obscure Army post and Reacher is sent to investigate, to see if anyone in the Army is involved. The Affair answers the long-wondered question: how did an Army MP major and West Point graduate come to be on the road? Reacher by choice carries nothing with him. But with The Affair readers finally know what is on his mind. The story that gets us there is a good one. Also recommended is [[ASIN:B005DB6NAW Second Son (Kindle Single)]], a prequel to this prequel. Note to Lee Child: it is Kosovar, not Kosovan.
1609611543|1.0|The author has no credentials, no credibility, just a small cult of terriby misinformed followers. Don't be fooled by the high volume screech against wheat and grains. Allegations of \\"secret ingredients in wheat\\" to make you eat more, or comparisons to cigerettes. Seriously?! For over 8000 years wheat has sustained and grown human kind, oh and it tastes good when mixed with a little water and yeast. Every nutritionist and serious medical professional will tell you that bread is the most economical and safe source of essential nutrients. In fact, bread is handed out in natural disasters because it sustains life without food safety issues or requiring refrigeration. And now, suddenly it will kill you. Comical! This book is such a bone headed, misinformed way to just scare people into not eating.<br /><br />As for secret ingredients, humm, apparently the author is ignorant of the food laws that regulate everything that goes into food and on food labels. Unlike some enforcement agencies, the FDA has some serious teeth behind its enforcement. As for frankenwheat, again seriously?! Wheat, due to its ubiquitous presence in the world is treated as sacrosant from any GMO research or development.<br /><br />If you need real, science based information on healthy eating, check out [...] and leave this book and its cult in the compound.

B000E41MS6|2.0|Like many ardent Doctor Who fans, I spent much of the 1990s wondering if the BBC would ever get around to producing new episodes of its signature science fiction program. Well, I should've heeded that old cliche, \\"be careful what you wish for,\\" because the Beeb did start making Doctor Who again and I ended up sorta hating it.    To start, I should try to explain the ... ah ... strange appeal of the classic series. Despite being filmed on the cheap and in a rush, the original Doctor Who generated a lot of witty and engaging episodes, which hold up well for those of us who can tolerate (or even enjoy) camp. To me, the show was always at its best when it was cerebral (e.g., The Aztecs, City of Death, Snakedance) while the \\"action\\" or \\"scary\\" episodes were much overrated by fans (see Earthshock, or almost any of the Troughton Doctor's kiddie-oriented monster episodes).    Alas, this revival series can't really be described as \\"witty\\" or \\"cerebral\\"; indeed, it throws out the intelligence of the old show in favor of gloopy sentimentality and domestic drama of the soap opera variety. (Will Rose and the Doctor kiss? Or will Rose go back to her doofy ex-boyfriend? Oh, the suspense!) Now, I quite like domestic dramas, when they're well done; indeed, my favorite film director is Yasujiro Ozu, who elevated the genre to high art. But watching this season of Doctor Who, with its shrill cardboard characters (I'm thinking of Rose's mother here) and superficial conflicts, is as far from good domestic drama as Earth is from the sun. It doesn't help that every \\"emotional\\" moment is underlined by manipulative music, over-the-top acting, and lots of crying.    On the plus side, this season had an impressive star in Christopher Eccleston, who may be the most accomplished actor to ever play the Doctor. That said, he is not the best Doctor by a long shot, because showrunner Russell T. Davies didn't use him right. Indeed, throughout this season, Eccleston veers from effective to obnoxious.His overall character - an angry man who tortures a helpless Dalek and practically taunts Rose by showing her the destruction of planet Earth - is not really that nice, or that evocative of the more charming gentleman-genius Doctor of the original series. But at times, Eccleston is a good enough actor to vault over the bad writing and make his Doctor memorable.    Like the Doctor himself, the scripts here are uneven. Mark Gatiss writes an excellent episode about Charles Dickens fighting zombies, and Robert Shearman contributes a pretty good script for the Dalek episode (I'm not sure why he wants me to sympathize with the mass-murdering creature, though). Alas, showrunner Davies consistently pens the worst episodes, and uses the series as a showcase for his weird opinions on such irrelevant topics as reality TV and, of all things, weight (one of his villains is depicted as being too thin; another is too fat). Another flaw of Davies' writing is his over-reliance on silly deus ex machina resolutions; the season finale is particularly bad in this regard, as it literally ends with a god emerging from a machine and solving all the Doctor's problems for him!    Finally, the production design is also hit-or-miss. British fans and TV critics tend to describe the new Who as a big-budget spectacular, but to my jaded Yankee eyes, this looks like just another cheesy BBC production. The \\"redesigns\\" of the TARDIS and the Daleks look little better than the originals, the opening credits resemble a screen saver, and the quality of the video footage is poor (the actors' skin tones look orange!) The CGI special effects, meanwhile, improve on the special effects of the original series (anything would) but are still mediocre; I, for one, prefer older Who special effects, which are quite funny when approached with the right attitude. As for the Slitheen, they easily rate among the stupidest-looking Doctor Who monsters in history, and they appear in no less than three episodes of this season. I'll take the Destroyer or the Zygons over them any day...    In short, I was disappointed by this revival of Who, and I'm afraid that the show only got worse with time (with the exception of season four, which managed to produce a few good episodes, like \\"Midnight\\"). As for the DVD package itself - well, these episodes weren't filmed in high definition, so they already look a bit dated and rubbish. And the special features mostly consist of the production team congratulating itself for its own cleverness. I prefer more honest, retrospective features to this kind of self-praising stuff.    Anyway, while this isn't exactly *terrible* science fiction, it is overrated, and I'd give it a miss in favor of (a) modern sci-fi that's better written, or (b) older sci-fi that's funnier and more soulful. Like, erm, Doctor Who...
B004XNGKBS|3.0|This app is ok just ok, even for free. It's a standard not taking app with the ability to write on screen, which is cool, but since my screen is only 4.something inches (samsung epic) i get almost no writing space, so it's petty much useless. That said, it works great, but not any better than any other note taking app, even some of the free ones.
B0057GYOA4|5.0|When I first heard they were remastering Nevermind I was a little concerned. Would it be just a lot of added bass like the greatest hits package? That being said, I just listened to the entire album in it's remastered form and all I could say is wow. This is remastering at it's finest. They didn't add a lot of bass or loudness. Everything just sounds cleaner and more vibrant. Sort of like looking through a window that was just cleaned and you can see really clearly all the detail. Sound is an A+. Second, the package could have been a litte nicer. What I mean by that is they could have included liner notes and more pictures. But, it still is a nice package. Third, the bonus tracks are clutch. They include all the b-sides from the singles from Nevermind. However, they should have included the No Alternative version of Verse Chorus Verse. I'm not big on demos and alternate takes, etc. If In Utero gets this treatment in two years you will get to finally hear the definitive version of MV instead of the demo from the box set. That song is incredible. It's on the All Apologies maxi single from the UK. Extemely difficult to get, but I have my copy. Lastly, this album is ground breaking. I'm tired of certain kids just not appreciating this. You have to understand, this  was 1991 and there wasn't pro tools or any main stream music like this out yet. You actually had to be talented to make music back then. You ever notice how a lot of rock bands sound the same today? There are still great bands out there though. Anyway, stop reading this and go buy the album.

B0054SMIH6|3.0|I wasn't totally disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled either.  I thought this movie was kind of flat.  There were a few bright spots of acting when Matthew McConaughey's character cries over not being able to recognize the innocent from the guilty or when he's figuring out he may have put an innocent man in jail, but other than that his acting was not so great.  The highlights came from (in order) the guy who played the prostitute's \\"john\\" and the rehabbed ex-con who both took the stand in this courtroom/crime drama.  Their performances had me in stitches -- they were really good.  Ryan Phillipe wasn't too bad.  He made a reasonably believable sociopath.  The dialog was pretty thin... not the worst I've seen, but still.  The plot was a bit choppy too... didn't seem to flow right (IMHO) - lol.<br /><br />Very average.  I'm surprised so many gave this movie 4 or 5 stars.  It was really just OK.
B0057MFA42|1.0|I bought the Blu-Ray of NIRVANA Live At The Paramount.    The audio is fantastic, the picture quality is gorgeous, the cinematography looks great.  However, the audio is out of sync with the picture!  I like to watch musicians intently  and it's highly distracting that you HEAR cymbal crashes before Grohl hits them!  You  hear Kurt play high chords then watch his hand slide up the neck a moment later.  Is this issue isolated to the Blu-Ray version?  I can't believe this issue was  not addressed upon issuing this product.  9-29-11:  The comments left on this post look like the Blu Ray version of this disc  does have an audio sync issue to the visuals, particularly in 2.0 stereo.  It's VERY slight, but completely consistent to the entire length of the Blu-ray,   most especially noticeable (and distracting) when you watch Grohl's drumming.  10-01-11:  Returned at Best Buy for full refund, no hassle from customer service.  10-20-11:  Universal did respond to my email a week after the date I returned the disc with some instructions for troubleshooting the issue, heavily suggesting my blu-ray player was not up to date on software patches.  They said they put the disc through rigorous quality control, but in the 3+ years I've had my PS3, I've never had this issue, and you PS3 owners know you can't run the console without always accepting the new updates are they're available.

B00338QENI|4.0|The Immortal Life of Henriette Lacks is a book I don't even think I'd have heard of if not for my friend, and it certainly is not one I would have read. It is fundamentally a - dare I say the word -  science book. It is the story of HeLa cells - where they came from, how they were reproduced and how they were used to create the vaccine that has essentially eradicated polio, among other biomedical advances. But it is also the story of Henrietta Lacks the source of the cells which have now become the immortal HeLa line. Even more so, it is the story of Henrietta's children who lost their mother to an aggressive form of cervical cancer when she was only 31 years old.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henriette Lacks is the biomedical story of cell reproduction and research and the ethical questions that arise. However, if it had been that story alone, I would not considered it defining, and indeed it has become one of those books I will use as a marker for delineating when my views on medical research and ethics became my own and not simply ones that were passed on to me. Many views will forever be referred to as \\"pre-Henrietta Lacks\\" and \\"post-Henrietta Lacks.\\" It has also become the book that has educated me on early cancer treatment, however rudimentary, and how far we have come in the last 60 years. And yet, it is more. It is the story of what happens to children who are left without a mother, children who struggled to understand who their mother was, children who did not know of their mother's contribution until decades later, children who struggled to understand what exactly that contribution was. These events, along with many others, shaped who Henrietta Lacks's children and grandchildren became, and it is their story, as much as Henrietta's.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot's writing style also enhanced a book that was part science and part family chronicle. Her point of view was her own, that of an outsider to the Lacks family, and while objective, it was descriptive when description was required. Although certainly not a piece of local color writing, she did create a sense of people and places.  One of the first lines I highlighted was about her decision to maintain dialect after being told by one of Henrietta's relatives, \\"If you pretty up how people spoke and change the things they said, that's dishonest. It's taking away their lives, their experiences, and their selves.\\" By taking that advice, I whole-heartedly believe while telling a delicate story she preserved her own integrity and that of the Lacks family.<br /><br />This book would appeal not only to those who enjoy reading about medical research and ethics, but also to those who are interested in exploring how these issue affect individual people and their families.n was required.

B0057GYOA4|3.0|Obviously a classic/seminal album of the 90s.  BUT, you really don't need anything other than the one disc version if you are a casual (or possibly even a slightly serious) fan.  I love Nirvana, but found that the second disc really didn't add much to my thinking about this album (and the boombox versions are, um, challenging to listen to).  The remaster sounds good to these ears.  I could be wrong, but maybe they went a little easy on the compression, unlike other albums these days?
0307887960|5.0|I am very impressed with this diet. It is different from other diets in that it enabled me to forget all about my various food addictions (maybe addiction is too strong of a word), such as sugar, fat, carbs, and even ice cream. The website helped me figure out my \\"true weight\\" and gave me a timeline as well. There are 4 phases to the program and the reintegration phase is as long, if not longer than, the initial weight loss/reduction phases. The program includes light exercise (walking), hydration, and protein/veggie foods. The foods are simple, affordable, and easy to find. The recipes and preparation guidelines are very helpful, and after being on this diet for a month now, I'm much less interested in food now and enjoy the outdoors instead (walking at different parks, etc.).
0553212001|4.0|When reviewing a paperback edition of a classic novel like \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", any comments are really about the additional material besides the main literary work itself, as \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" needs no recommendation from me.  The additional material here is the afterword by Jerome Charyn, titled \\"Who is Hyde?\\".  Charyn's tone is rather chatty, but nonetheless he raises interesting issues about hidden subtexts related to Stevenson's own life.  Likewise, he notes that the story repays close reading to details and even single sentences, as clues to unexplained facets of the narrative, such as what Sir Danvers Carew was talking to Hyde about in the street before Hyde attacks Carew, and simultaneously, what the maid saw (the maid being the only female in the novel).  Charyn tries at times almost to titillate readers by raising possible undercurrents of repressed sexuality, or even homosexuality, in the narrative.  Overall, a good edition of this classic story, even if my copy had one typo (\\"Harry Jekyl\\"), and it is best truly to read the Afterword after the novel, and not before.
B005EXA8LY|5.0|If you are a very serious listener for creative, experimental music or just a Steven Wilson fan from his previous solo album called \\"Insurgentes\\" or just a fan of his Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No Man, Bass Communion projects you should hear some song or songs in this album that you will simply love in this album.   Yes, also if you like old King Crimson the song called \\"Raider 2\\" is the most King Crimson sounding piece on this album.   Some of the beautiful songs on this album are \\"Deform To Form A Star\\" it just gives me chills and so does \\"No Part Of Me\\" and \\"Postcard\\" with other beautiful songs called \\"Belle De Jour\\" and \\"Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye\\"   This is simply a artist who is reaching for new musical heights and was able to put together in this beautifully crafted album called \\"Grace For Drowning\\" and I highly recommend buying this Blu-ray like I did which has exceptional 5.1 DTS surround sound and please do not forget to buy the Cd for car or itune use.  This album should get better and better with each listen, so please enjoy this great album and exceptional artist!
0399230033|5.0|I cannot tell you how many times I have bought this book as a gift! ..that's why I'm on this site now!  My granddaughter loved this book from the time she was six months old!  This was in her \\"bedtime routine\\" every night and could not be left out -- before she could walk she would crawl over to her little bookcase and bring this to be \\"read\\" to her before going nigh-night!  She totally wore out the board book to the point where when her little brother came along six years later a new book had to be bought!  He loves it too!!!  The pictures are bright and inviting to a small child.  Discussing the animals, matching the colors (keys to the cages), watching the balloon travel through the book, the \\"trailing\\" mouse with the banana and don't forget each animal's little \\"dolly\\" in their cages!  There are so many aspects to talk about and discover.  ...and lets not forget the giggles when the page comes with just the eyes and the different voice pitches of \\"good-night\\", \\"good-night\\", \\"good-night\\"!  You don't need many words in this book when you get your child to participate, even before they talk much!  A most enjoyable book!
B000FC1AGG|3.0|This is a good fun read with no deep issue going on with the characters. I like her writing, easy to read but not childish and keeps you engaged and funny. I just finished her shopaholic series(book after book) and although I loved the first book, by the 4th book I was done with them and  I couldn't finish it. The characters were all the same and the main character, although you gotta like her, her stupidity sometimes drives me crazy and you can only take too much. I really was impressed with Sophie Kinsella's writing in those series and therefor wanted to try her other books too. I'm somewhat impressed, it reminds me of her other shopaholic books and maybe if i didn't pick this right up after I got tired of that series, I might have liked it more. Although it's a different plot and characters, it just felt so much of the same to me. Please give this one a try, wether you've read her shopaholic books or not, she's worth it.  As to how much I really liked her, I will keep an eye out for more of her books, I just will have to pace myself better and not read them all at the same time.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|\\"....and we can fly from here....with the understanding that we can fly\\".  No kidding, if you can fly then it is understood that you can fly.  These are not the lyrics of seasoned veterans.  Two words describe Fly From Here - repetitive simplicity.  There is no depth of meaning to take emotion skyward like the Yes of days gone by - Anderson's lyrical stylings and Wakeman's (Rick that is) keyboard mastery are blatantly missing.  \\"There are no ground staff in the empty corridors.  Is no one sleeping?  No one awake?\\"  If no one is sleeping and no one is awake then one must conclude that there is no one in the empty corridors.  It is difficult to get past the innane lyrics until the realization hits that Benoit David sings very little on his own without the aid of Squire and others backing up.  It is apparent that this is necessary due to the lack of passion and enthusiasm in David's vocal style.  Then there is the monotony of staccato notes that Trevor Horn brings to the writing and production.  Listen to Fly From Here again and find the song that sounds like:  \\"Man in a White Car\\".  Fly From Here gets two stars only because there is so very little good new music to choose from these days, and this album is just ok.  Karmakanik's \\"In a Perfect World\\" is deserving of four or five stars when compared with Fly From Here.

B0059R5Q08|5.0|Jane Eyre is among my top favorite novels. To catch the yearning gloom in the story on film is a feat. This production does that. Capturing the intensity yet restraint without overacting or over-sentimentalization is a challenge. This film pulls it off. The dialogue transfixes you and the music haunts you.<br /><br />Rochester is how I imagined him and Jane is plainly beautiful. Of course, Judi Dench always belonged in this film as the housekeeper. The landscapes take your breath away at times....you feel as if you are there. If you love historical interiors, you want to freeze scenes and just study the rooms. This is a film worth watching over and over.

B0036S4CTS|3.0|Several of my friends raved about this book, so we decided to select it for a book club reading this month. Of our group of 15, 3 absolutely loved it - and the other 12 of us ranged from bored indifference to active annoyance. I agree with what others have said about the writer's ability to craft wry, funny one-liners, but a one-liner can only take you but so far in a 450 page book where nothing much is happening plot-wise. To say I hated the book is too strong; I was more annoyed that I spent so long plugging through the book (sure that if I stuck with it, something momentous would happen eventually) - only to get to an ending that I found to be a shallow cop-out. If you are going to write a sad ending, at least give the sadness/suffering a purpose. Not like here where once the main event happened (don't want to include spoilers), the book essentially says the character's life/thoughts no longer mattered. Huh?  I also found Dexter to be way to extreme for belief. Somehow Emma waits around almost 40 years for a self-absorbed alcohol/drug addict who shows up to his dying mother's bed high on drugs and takes care of his infant daughter while emptying two bottles of wine? Really? I truly liked Emma's character for her witty, down-to-earth qualities, but the fact that she would wait her entire life for this scumbag to finally notice her took it way too far.  All in all, I'm relieved to be done with the book, glad I borrowed it rather than paying for it, and will probably skip the movie.

1250004349|5.0|This is one of the most depressing books that I have read. Fascinating but depressing. Sarah's Key is well-written. The story moves along smoothly. Tragedy is followed by tragedy followed by the mere hint of a sliver of light on the horizon.
B000J233SK|4.0|This is a very beautiful album with a spiritual feel to it.  Listening takes you on a journey.  If you just sit back and let yourself get lost in the music, you never know where you'll end up in your mind.  This album has Middle Eastern notes to it, and the whole thing is great.
1597801577|5.0|The cover of 'The Windup Girl' has Time Magazine trumpeting Bacigalupi as \\"a worthy successor to William Gibson\\" and while it surprised me to hear Gibson has stopped writing, I'd have to say that Time Magazine is spot on with regards the quality of the plotting, depth of character and pace.  I found this a superb read.<br /><br />(As an aside, I also read it in Dubai, so the unrelenting heat of global warming that saps the soul in this future Bangkok was just outside the door of the hotel, lending a visceral texture to the emotional content.)<br /><br />Bacigalupi has embedded a goodly number of twists and turns into what is a pretty straightforward story arc to keep things interesting without overloading the drama.  And like Gibson - and possibly what Time was referring to - the different background and adaptive technology required to cope post Peak Oil is presented almost subliminally.  Bacigalupi does not labour the point yet still manages to convey the detail and nuance of his megadonts, treadle computers, generippers and even the Thai language itself, along with the character of Bangkok and it's proud but beleagured inhabitants.<br /><br />Also, I was pleased that Bacigalupi is not afraid to kill off a character or two.  No more will be said, lest I spoil the plot, but invincibility takes the tension out of a novel and the balance here is just about right.<br /><br />So, who should give \\"The Windup Girl\\" a try?<br /><br />Probably Gibson fans, though it is not, as Times Magazine went on to say, 'cyberpunk without computers' (and isn't that essentially steampunk anyway?  Lovers of which are also likely to enjoy this, by the way).<br /><br />I think if you like Michael Flynn or L.E. Modesitt, Jr. or Iain M. Banks then you are very likely to enjoy \\"The Windup Girl\\".  That is to say, sci-fi with a strong social and emotional element to it.  If you are keen on more technology driven or military sci-fi you will probably find it heavier going.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, I'd suggest anyone who enjoys sci-fi pick it up and gives \\"The Windup Girl\\" a go because you are likely to be as entranced as I was.es \\"The Windup Girl\\" a go because you are likely to be as entranced as I was.

B000002KLG|5.0|I only have three albums by George Benson, and while I like them all, Give Me The Night is my favorite. The musicianship is on point, but what else can you expect from  the production work of Quincy Jones. My main reason for buying this was the title track, and was surprised to find \\"Love X Love\\" on here as well. The instrumentals are excellent, namely \\"Off Broadway\\". This is just plain good music from back in the day, definitely mellow but also romantic and charming. One of the key contributors to this is songwriter Rod Temperton, who wrote five of the album's ten tracks, one of which was \\"Star of the Story\\", which was first featured on Heatwave's Central Heating album. Not a bad tune on Give Me The Night, and I look forward to listening to more of Benson's library from is 40+ year career.
B0057MFA42|2.0|10/31/91 was such a vital piece of musical expression! The band wrapped up their US nevermind tour with a stunning home-coming set at the paramount theatre. The band is firing on all cylinders, the sound in the venue is great, and the atmosphere/audience is energetic. In addition, the video transfer is breathtaking and the audio mix is solid. Sounds like an A+, right? welp, the audio and video are OUT OF SYNC with one another. The DVD is in sync, but the blu ray is out of sync! completely inexcusable! The blu ray should be re-called/re-released because this is an otherwise stellar product.<br /><br />UPDATE: The above review was for the same product listed on this page (nirvana 10/31/91 blu ray), but the copy I initially purchased was from best buy (this blu ray was a best buy exclusive and was released by B.B. months ago). I returned the blu ray to best buy because it was defective (A/V played out of sync on a litany of different systems...including every blu ray/tv set up inside of the best buy store). Point is, contrary to the garbage stated by the manufacturer about this disc being perfectly fine, ITS NOT. PERIOD. I just received my copy from amazon today (1/12/12). I was hoping that the manufacturers had quietly corrected the glaring audio/video sync issues on the latest batch of blu rays that went out to amazon and other retailers etc. THEY DID NOT. Bottom line: the performance contained within this blu ray is amazing! the audio mix and the video transfer are both fantastic! However, the fact that the audio and video are unacceptably out of sync with one another makes this blu ray unwatchable. Of note: it appears all dvd copies of the show are correctly produced/sync'd and all blu ray copies of the show are defective (out of sync). DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BLU RAY UNTIL THE MANUFACTURERS CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE AND RE-ISSUE THIS RELEASE! amazon should send their copies back to whoever it was that pawned off defective merchendise onto them (UMG? Geffen?). 2 stars forthe amazing musical performance. 0 stars for the defective blu ray and the deceptive lies told by the manufacturer.<br /><br />Quote from UMG/geffen etc:<br />\\"Please note that great care was given to ensure a quality Blu-Ray disc was created. Audio/video synchronization playback issues have not been replicated at the manufacturer or releasing company testing facilities on multiple players.\\"<br /><br />PLEASE!.... then those involved in this process are either remarkably stupid or liars (or both).<br /><br />If you simply must own this show, hold off on the blu-ray and buy the dvd (until the manufacturers correct the blu ray release).

B003G4W49C|5.0|I honestly can't say I am the biggest science fiction fan within the reading world (love it on the screen though).   While \\"Ender's Game\\" is classified as Science Fiction and has been awarded with the famous Sci-Fi medals of honor this isn't just another one of those crazy, strange, weird, Science Fiction books.   \\"Ender's Game\\" takes us into a future where aliens exist and our world has seemingly united to destroy a race (the \\"Buggers\\") that seems hell-bent on destroying us.   The best part about this book? Not just the great action scenes or wonderfully spoken characters, but Orson Scott does something magical. He created a world where children, who are super-geniuses, can make magical feats of terrifying, and brilliant, acts and decisions. He created characters you care about. And most importantly, he created a world which I thought was real. A true mark of a good book.   This book can be read by everyone, but I would recommend they be 12 or older due to the mature content of death, destruction, and the wonderfully poetic psychological nature of what he accomplished in his books: Games can be our reality and humanity is faulted.   In other words, \\"Ender's Game\\" was a great and wonderful read.   I recommend it full-heartily.

B004EPYZZI|1.0|What can I say? Bethany Hamilton is the most inspiring female surfer alive. I deeply, deeply respect her, as a woman and as a fellow surfer. I was really excited to see this film. But this movie is quite possibly the worst movie they could have possibly done. The script makes you cringe every few seconds, it is shallow and boring. The acting is dreadful. I don't know why they chose this young actress Robb, she is dreadful in this role. Flat, and teeny bopper. Amazingly, what could be a really cool flick is full of cliches. But the other actors, except Helen Hunt, of course, are also really really bad. I'm so sad, especially for Bethany, that this film is so incredibly lacking in depth and entertainment, that I have to give it 1 star. I was so bored and disappointed that had to turn it off halfway through it. I finally forced myself to finish watching it. Let me share something with you that will give you an indication of how bad it is. Every time that a mainstream surf movie comes out, the surf industry plans ahead to release a higher number of goods (wetsuits, surfboards, apparel) that are related to the movie, as they expect an increase in sales. Well, O'Neill in Santa Cruz, Rip Curl and Roxy all increased the production of women's related surf goods to coincide with the release of Soul Surfer. Well, turns out this movie is so bad, that the surf industry lost out. And they have an overstock of girl surfing goods. They didn't sell, so now they're cutting women's styles for the next season. Wow, right? It's terrible, actually, that we can't get a GOOD INSPIRING GIRL SURF FILM. The true story is inspiring: you're better off seeing her documentary as well as interviews on You tube. I believe there are now several books out as well. Don't waste your time and money. It's so drab. So sorry Bethany, you rock...

B0058A119G|3.0|I want to start out by saying Barbara Streisand is the greatest singer ever.  I own all her albums (as available) on vinyl, cassette and CD.  But after her less than impressive Village Vanguard album, this M&A Bergman album is dismal but Streisand standards.  Now compared to most singers now a days, this album is a masterpiece but by Streisand standards this is one of her worst albums.  This album had a pedigree that could have made it come close to her Broadway Album.  As I said it has Streisand but it also had the lyrics of Marilyn and Alan Bergman.  The Bergmans are one of the greatest lyricist ever and they have worked with some of the greatest composers on these songs.  One of the things I love most about Streisand is her ability to find the subtext in the song and bring life into ordinary songs.  In the first disc of all new songs, she sings most of them as if they were dirges.  there is no flavor or variety in the performance.  This is what I expect from her but she plays it safe, overly safe.  The second disc is a compilation of her past MAB recordings and shows what she is capable of doing. (Of course one of my favorite songs is not on this Two People which the Bergmans wrote using music from Nuts but I can understand this.)  Most singers aspire to be this good but for Streisand it is a major disappointment.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This movie is beautiful in production values, casting choice, acting skills and respect. The cinematography is stunning. Audrey Hepburn gives a sensitive and gentle performance and is of course breathtakingly beautiful as the conflcted Sister Luke. The supporting cast is just as wonderful. Surprisingly, the Catholic Church is not vilified but treated with respect!  kathy
1419702203|5.0|I have not been able to get through the whole book, but I had to write this up. It is a beautiful book. Dittos to what the other reviewer wrote. Besides the interviews and anecdotes you have gorgeous photos. From the first, a photo of Liverpool during WWII, you'll really be drawn in. The photos are wonderful. The book is larger than I thought it would be. There is a photo of a postcard sent from George to his home, and a letter from John Lennon to George's home as well, written in his early comic style, \\"so to Speke.\\" At the bottom are some of his bizarre drawings of armless people. School pics and early ones at home are ones I've never seen, it is said that these are unpublished items and you can believe it. George was always my fave Beatle and I am so pleased I pre-ordered this book, and I'm not even finished with it! Any Beatles fan, hardcore or casual, will enjoy this. Music fans in general too. This is a book that will go on that one shelf upstairs with other well-done and collectible items.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book is amazing even though a main charter died. it had to happen at some point i mean all the charters die in the end. the book is the best series i ever read and if you think its hard to read or to goary well i am not in high school yet and am extremly young but look forword to seeing great things from this author.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|I don't like movies that have the commentary going at the same time as I find it distracting.  However, as I am a history buff and also consider Abraham Lincoln to be the best president we have had, did find this an interesting take on who was responsible for his assassination.  My opinion is, all the parties who were convicted were guilty and punished.  The cast and director all did well in their bringing this story to the screen.
B00001QEE9|3.0|Well, I love this story, its very classic and I was excited about getting it. The movie arrived fast in great condition, but it seems as if someone took it off of the vhs version and put it on DVD. There were no previews, the picture quality was ok. But since this movie was about $6 to $8 what can I expect. I got what I paid for!
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Excellent album. Easy listening all the way! Next release should be tract 11 - Love I've found in you. I think that Tract 11 is the best song on the album. Terrific blend of fiddle, piano, drums, guitar and super vocals. Video hint....feature the instruments!!!!  Well done!!!!!!
B000YI7MRM|2.0|The episodic, incoherent script patches together highlights from FIVE historical adventure novels spanning a 20-year period of the 17th century. This film takes for granted that we already know something of the era's Spanish political, literary and military history. Even Spaniards found this movie confusing, so what hope do we foreign viewers have?  Mortensen is fine in the title role, though the Argentine Spanish of his youth occasionally creeps through the European accent he learned for the film.   In fact, the whole cast is good, but they're trapped in a hopeless script that leaps over plot points too fast while still somehow remaining plodding and dull. I like the frankness of the battle scenes though: in English-language films, by comparison, war often comes off as a bit too clean and tidy.  The Alatriste novels have a lot to offer, and this probably should have been made as a TV miniseries.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I've been using this app for two days and it is the best weather app I've ever used.  It is great.  I had two questions which I emailed to the developer.  I had answers and appropriate suggestions within hours.  Given the fact that he and I are 8 time zones apart, I thought the quick response was excellent.  This product functions perfectly and has all the information a weather nut like me could possibly ask for.  It is definitely five stars.

I didn't have any lag issues nor did I think other was slow to load. actually I thought it was quite fast.   Garminfone v2.2
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We bought this to fit our Radio Flyer ATW wagon (the one with the wooden sides) and this fits on great!  The velcro is super strong and long enought to fit tight or be a bit more loose (for larger handles, etc).  The elastic cup holders are strong and large enough to hold a Kids Camelbak bottle.  The center compartment is very multi-functional.  Once the compartment is full, it's really difficult to access the zipper pouch.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a portable snack caddy.
0788859544|5.0|The Little Mermaid is my son's favorite stories.  He loves the characters.  Great movie for the whole family  received on time and a great movie to add to one's Disney collection.
B00008NRI8|3.0|these movie is super cute & unique :o) though the conditions my disc came in was not how it was supposed to be.before i ordered it,it said that it was very good but the disc came with minor scratches & i was not so happy with them.i hate it when the seller puts very good, when it really isn't.it was just ok.
B004Z4LVZK|3.0|Thomas wakes up alone in a dark box. He remembers only his name. Suddenly there are faces looking down at him--faces of teenage boys. Thomas has entered a new world and yet it feels eerily familiar. Each month for the last two years one boy has appeared in the box. The boys have formed a civilization of order and law. Their ultimate goal is to solve the maze that surrounds them and free themselves. But things are changing and the boys must work together more quickly now or die.<br /><br />The novel is intriguing, mysterious and a little frightening. It fits nicely into the dystopian category while still being unique and very creative. Since it is written for a young audience, I especially appreciate that it is actually appropriate for a young audience. My ten year old is anxious to read it. I won't have any problem letting him do so.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't enjoy it as much as other dystopian genre series but I do look forward to reading the next book in the series--The Scorch Trials. The third book in the trilogy--The Death Cure will be released in October.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Join the bandwagon. Game is great. just waiting got more levels or a sequel. Thanks for the entertainment. No problems with it.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|I have never taken the time to write a review for an album, but I had to for this one!  I'm not going to break down every song and say what I liked about it.  They are all great if you ask me.  I bought Worship Music the day after it came out and haven't stopped listening to it since.  Any new album usually takes a few listens to get your arms around.  It only took one time through for me to sit back and say, \\"Now that's what Anthrax should sound like!\\"  I honestly haven't found a song that I immediately skip through(which is rare by today's standards).  If you have ever considered yourself a fan of Anthrax don't think too much....just buy it!  I don't know how you could regret your purchase?  Anyone writing a bad review of this release either takes music way too seriously or they prefer Bush over Belladonna.  That is neither here nor there for most of us.  Good music is good music.  The band is tight as always and Joey is back and sounds better than ever!  It took a while, but great work!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This collection is beautifully packaged, and makes a great gift. The movies are classics, with fantastic video quality and sound. It's been great watching these classics over again with the family with surround sound and high definition. I don't understand the nay-sayers here, these movies are really entertaining and fun to watch. I'm very happy that I bought these and I can't wait to watch the next one!
B005HEUF0Y|5.0|Agree this was the best episode of STNG, while not flashy or packed with space battles and fight to the death scenarios, its unique plot and terrific acting by Parick  Stewart makes this episode the one I think about when STNG is the topic. Of course \\"First contact\\" is the #1 STNG movie by a landslide as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|By the end of Chapter one, I was hooked. Couldn't put it down. The main character is well written. You really feel for her. Can't wait to read the other two books.
B0058VA2TU|4.0|Alright, so this is a 4-star review, because, in the context of this band's formidable back catalog, \\"Among The Living,\\" \\"Sound of White Noise,\\" and \\"Persistence of Time\\" are all 5-star albums, and \\"Worship Music\\" isn't quite that...timeless. On its own merits, however, its a freight train, and as good as anything you can find in a system as static as the world of straight-up metal. Which is ironic, given Anthrax is the band so-called purists often blame for rap metal.   Anthrax has always reveled in contradiction, though. While they're only band I know of to ever have had a video banned from MTV not for profanity, violence, or nudity, but rather bleak social consciousness (\\"Who Cares Wins\\"), they are also the only Big 4 band that SMILED, as evidenced by most of the rest of the aptly-titled \\"State of Euphoria.\\" Things turned darker with \\"Persistence,\\" though, and that darkness was cemented with \\"White Noise.\\" The band let Belladonna go between those records, feeling he just didn't have the gravitas to go where they were going musically and lyrically. And at the time, they were right; he was already sounding thin in spots on \\"Persistence.\\"   Hence my apprehension regarding his return to the helm, disappointed as I've been by every John Bush release post-\\"White Noise.\\" Joey's really the surprise here, though, as his voice has acquired a girth and commanding presence it never quite had in the past. It helps that the material is so strong musically, and that he's got Scott Ian's patented bellow backing him up here and there, but yeah, after almost 20 years in the wilderness with a DOA solo career, playing for crowds of 50 in hole-in-the-wall clubs (I know this firsthand; my band shared one of those bills), this is definitely Belladonna's moment. And his awesomely age-thickened voice unequivocally delivers, in the department where Anthrax needed it most: melody. Their last studio album, 2003's \\"We've Come For You All,\\" saw John Bush rendered inexplicably monotone (not counting the even more inexplicable power ballad \\"Safe Home\\"), and that just doesn't cut it with a band like Anthrax; these guys need some melody in the vocal lines to contrast the often 1-or-2 note staccato thrash rhythms making up most of their later music, instrumentally speaking. And Belladonna's melodies on \\"Worship Music\\" are varied, aggressive, and completely effective. Just look at what he does with tunes like \\"I'm Alive\\" and \\"The Constant.\\" This is some Dio-level surfing-the-chug, folks.   As to specific songs, look to \\"Earth On Hell\\" and \\"Fight 'Em Til You Can't\\" for that brutal old-school thrash vibe which can only come from the inimitable combo of Charlie Benante's drumming and Scott Ian's right hand. \\"I'm Alive,\\" \\"In The End,\\" and \\"Judas Priest\\" (no relation) are straight-up epic tracks, something Anthrax isn't really known for but nails to the wall here. Actually, its worth mentioning that there's a surprising amount of borderline power metal throughout the record, especially in the choruses.  For Bush-era fans, I'd point to \\"The Constant\\" (shades of \\"Packaged Rebellion\\" in the descending chorus riff), \\"The Giant,\\" and the album's closer, \\"Revolution Screams.\\" Also, I suppose, \\"Crawl,\\" though that one is the most out-of-place, radio-friendly tune on the record. Its not bad, per se, but this would be an Anthrax album in name only if the whole thing sounded like it. And it really would fit neatly between Disturbed and Audioslave on your local rock station. Lastly, for my money (and I know I'm gonna get flack for this), the weakest track on the record is \\"The Devil You Know.\\" Which is unfortunate, as it was an advance track and as such unfairly colored my expectations for the rest of the record. It just doesn't click for me; its perhaps the only thing on the album that feels too stock and derivative with regard to their classics. Yep, my 2 least favorites here are as such because they either sound too little or too much like Anthrax. I'm just that easy to please.   So. We have Anthrax back among the living, through nothing if not the persistence of time, with a vocalist who has ultimately prevailed as the greater of two evils. No, I'm not deleting that. \\"Worship Music\\" succeeds in the way any album from a decades-old, quasi-comeback band has to: by nodding firmly to its past, acknowledging the present, and setting the stage for future evolution. That, and by writing lines like, \\"We're coming to kick you to sleep!\\" that make me sixteen and p*ssed-off all over again. Welcome back, NOT-men.
B000R4SMCW|2.0|This is a movie that's quickly forgotten. It's uninspiring, cliche' and boring. This movie was one of the most unconvincing films due to the actors and the so-called plot.  In a nutshell, Ryan Gosling plays a hotshot lawyer (wow, that's unique) who is given an attempted murder case where a man Anthony Hopkins (whose character was comical and though he probably wasn't trying to be) has shot his wife in the head. Turns out the wife has been having an affair with the detective on the case and the movie just goes downhill from there.  There were several problems with this film because it was so unbelievable. I love Ryan Gosling and think he's a fantastic actor but he did not fit this role. He was not convincing at all as a lawyer and he seemed uncomfortable within the scenes with Hopkins. It's like he knew he was out of his element because it's like he held back with his acting. I also felt like his acting was a bad impersonation of Matthew McConaughey in a John Grisham film. Why he had a Southern accent and why it was important to the film was beyond me. I also felt like I was watching an A Time to Kill knockoff. It just wasn't working and he seemed like he was more intimidated by Hopkins as an actor than anything else.  Hopkins' talent was completely wasted and I don't know why he was in this film. This was one of the worst acting jobs I have ever seen Hopkins do and I blame it on the bad plot and bad writing. He just didn't have anything decent to work with. He seemed uninspired and like he didn't even care about the scenes half the time. It's like he was just saying the words without any emotion or obligation. Anyone could've played Hopkins' part because for what he did, it did not matter.  David Straitharn must've just needed a job or something because he insulted himself by being in this movie. Anyone could've done what he did and I didn't see any point to his character at all. Rosamund Pike was probably the best actor in the entire movie and they only showed herabout four times. The romance between her and Gosling is what I enjoyed most but it ended up some watered down romance that proved pointless. It's obvious Pike was thrown in mainly for eye candy but she still did a good job with her role. At least her scenes kept me from dozing.  The plot was laughable. I am so tired of movies trying to make a dumb character into a clever killer. I am also tired of movies where clues and answers just fall into the young lawyer's lap when he needs them too. This movie had so many plot holes and made no sense.  Not only did I not buy Gosling as a lawyer but I sure as heck didn't buy him as someone smart enough to figure out Hopkins' plan. On top of that Hopkins' character was dumb as a pinky nail yet managed to keep Gosling running in circles. Please.  This movie was a big pound of nothing. It's a wannabe lawyer film that doesn't live up to any of its predecessors. This is one movie that should be skipped unless you're just a fan of the stars. I've seen Lifetime Movies that are more suspenseful and interesting than this was.  I gave it two stars for Rosamund Pike and for the short-lived romance in the movie. If it hadn't been for those two things I wouldn't have bothered to finish the movie at all. Skip it unless you just wanna see how pitiful it is.

B000BT97AO|5.0|I love this movie.  I watch it over and over again.  :-  I wish there were more creative movies like this available.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a wonderfully done physics puzzle game. The little monster \\"OmNom\\" is cute, the sounds are well done, and it has nice graphics. Perfect for those times you've got a few minutes to kill. It also looks to have a substantial amount of levels to keep you busy. You start with the \\"Cardboard Box\\" levels and go up from there through various other boxes such as \\"Foil Box\\" and \\"Magic Box\\" which I can only assume have different graphics and maybe add a new twist to the gameplay. I would love to get to those levels BUT the one problem I have with the game prevents that: after a random period of time, the game stops responding to touch. No more rope cutting, can't restart, can't press the on-screen menu button. Everything else works fine like the music and OmNom opening his mouth for close-swinging candy, but eventually after hitting the hardware back and menu buttons, the system will tell me \\"Cut The Rope has stopped responding\\" and asks if I would like to wait or force close. If I wait, it doesn't end up responding, so eventually I have to FC it which means back to level 1 next time I start it.  I should mention I am running this on a MyTouch 3G Slide running Android 2.2 (Froyo), and have moved it to the SD card. Whether or not that is affecting this bug remains to be seen, I'll experiment with different variables and see what results I can come up with.   Overall this is a great game, especially to snag while it is Amazon's free app of the day. I subtracted one star for the eventual failure to respond to touch, but that might be a problem with it being on the SD card, or something else specific to my system. If you are even remotely on the fence about this game, I'll tell you right now it is worth it!  ***UPDATE***   There was an update today that put the game from 1.0.0 to 1.1.1 so I downloaded it. The problems I had with the game not responding and not saving progress seem to have been addressed. At first I thought the problems persisted, although the progress saving seemed to be partially fixed as it now asks me if I want to restore progress from a previous version. It still was having the issues with not responding and having to force close. On a long shot, I completely uninstalled and reinstalled, and it asked me to restore progress just the first time it launched, and didn't stop responding. I played through Cardboard Box and part of Fabric Box and it went just fine, it even saved my progress. Everything seems to have been fixed!  Long story short: Cut The Rope 1.1.1 seems to be working great and is an excellent game. If you got it as Amazon's free app of the day, you got a great deal, but even spending 99 cents is a bargain. I've seen worse games sell for way more money. If you are even remotely thinking about getting this game then go ahead and do it, you won't regret it. I've upgraded this to a 5 star app!
B004XNGKBS|5.0|At first I was a bit skeptical of this app because I'm not a fan of writing things directly on my phone screen, and I thought it'd be a nuisance to use, but it's not. I'm glad it was free but it's very nice

0525423273|5.0|Posted at[...]<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins<br />December 2nd 2010 from Dutton<br />5/5 Stars<br /><br />Goodreads Synopsis:<br /><br />Anna is looking forward to her senior year in Atlanta, where she has a great job, a loyal best friend, and a crush on the verge of becoming more. Which is why she is less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris - until she meets Etienne St. Clair: perfect, Parisian (and<br />English and American, which makes for a swoon-worthy accent), and utterly irresistible. The only problem is that he's taken, and Anna might be, too, if anything comes of her almost-relationship back home.<br />As winter melts into spring, will a year of romantic near - misses end with the French kiss Anna - and readers - have long awaited?<br />My Review<br />I finally get why everyone adores this book! Anna and the French kiss is an ah-mazing book! I loved everything about it from the setting to the characters!<br /><br />I have to start with Mr. Etienne St. Clair. I just have to! He's super hot and has soft hair! He's got my begging on my knees for him! Here comes the kind of confusing part. He's an American with an English accent living in Paris. Yeah I said all that! I loved the relationship Anna and St. Clair had. It was so nice and easy (most of the time,kind of).  It was adorable. St. Clair is hard to resist! He was a realistic character with issues and desires.<br /><br />Anna Oliphant is a great character. She does the right things and sometimes the wrong thing (DAVE!). She definitely wasn't perfect.She added a nice humor to the story. I wish she was real so I could be her best friend! I thought it was interesting that her dad was an author and seemingly a bad one whose books still were popular. I liked that her friend ,Matt, from America really gave her a mental slap in the face. I thought that Anna loved old classic movies was very interesting!I loved the way this book focused mainly on Anna's romance with St. Clair but also on her personal journey in Paris.<br /><br />Ms. Stephanie Perkins created a romantic,magical novel!  It was perfectly paced. You'll love it! I promise. If you haven't read this book,you have to now!Ms. Stephanie Perkins created a romantic,magical novel!  It was perfectly paced. You'll love it!

This album shows the maturity of the band and JCF's song writing pinnacle. Unfortunately, selfishnes of other band members who started thinking that they are real musicians and Vnz Kant Dances greed, deprived us more calssic ccr albums. The lyrics of \\"Wish I Could Hideaway\\", tells it all.
0553801473|5.0|I don't understand why so many people are whining about nothing happening in Dance with Dragons.  Obviously, he is bringing all the characters up to the same point in time, so it might seem like he's dragging things out a little. But it's for the sake of the whole story.  And there was plenty of action and surprises and twists and turns.  I \\"read\\" these books from Audible and I listened to the first four all over again before I listend to Dance and I was not disappointed in the least. But George RR Martin better not die before he writes the ending or I am going to kill him!  I went to his website just now and he's got links to what he's reading and what he's watching and where he's appearing.  I want to know what he's writing!  He needs to get busy.  If you're a fan of the series you should like this book just fine.  We're just all in a rush to find out what happens.

B004T1Z9S4|3.0|There is a parameter in filmmaking that is not often talked about: to what degree is the director toying with our emotions through editing and story construction? It happens all the time, of course, but do we really want to be conscious of it? No. A story should draw us in carefully, then spring it's trap when the time is ripe.<br /><br />In Paul Haggis' \\"family thriller\\", The Next Three Days, a remake of a 2008 French film \\"Pour Elle\\", Russell Crowe plays a devoted husband, loving father, and (of all things) a teacher trying to spring his wife, a convicted murderer, from prison. As with so many other action/suspense films, the driving force that sustains one's interest is \\"male goaling\\" -- a man overcoming unbelievable obstacles, and, in this case, totally on his own for most of the struggle.<br /><br />What could be more contradictory? An ethical man, a teacher of children, a loving husband, motivated to a \\"life of crime\\" not for money, but out of love and an overpowering instinct to do what is right. It's certainly a premise with rich possibilities.<br /><br />In the early going, however, I was irritated by some of the film's deficits. In the beginning, there is a shortage of character and location development, followed by a massive continuity jump (with the father and the son), with no explanation. Just going to black and then fading in again on a close up is not a satisfying or credible way to suggest an enormous passage of time, and it is a bit confusing. There was no trial sequence or examination of the evidence as I felt there should have been. The murder in question was not shown in any way, further shrouding the story of \\"Three Days\\" in mystery.<br /><br />I'll grant Mr. Haggis, that trials with prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys and judges and juries eat up a lot of time and a lot of movie budget, but of course he would say \\"that is NOT where this film is going.\\" And he's right. Nevertheless, one still has a nagging feeling that skipping over so much crucial material which could help the audience to understand, deprives the audience of a lot of linear continuity. Films do that all the time, but not so clumsily as in this case.<br /><br />In short, Mr. Haggis style of scriptwriting and/or editing is too manipulative. I felt the same way about Mr. Haggis' 2004 best picture, \\"Crash\\". He is toying with our emotions in ways too obvious, too overt. So I have an argument to make with Mr. Haggis as to why he so selectively chooses to show some sequences and skip over others. This leaves the audience starving for some objectivity -- a difficult thing to quantify, but something you feel in your gut.<br /><br />There is a general shortage of wide open spaces and time pauses to break up the action, too, which might have helped ease us into the story's rhythm.<br /><br />I also think that some details of Three Days -- which, for the sake of not spoiling it for you, I won't go over in detail -- are rather improbable. Other critics have noted this. But life is improbable.<br /><br />Alright, now that I've got that off my chest...if you can be patient enough to get through the first half of \\"Three Days\\", I promise a marvelous payoff in the second half. This is a terrific movie, despite it's editorial manipulativeness. Though I initially had my doubts, in the end this film redeems itself and leaves a powerful impact.<br /><br />What can I say about Russell Crowe? The guy has an intensity, a capacity for bottled-up anger that Brando once had. Elizabeth Banks delivers a very good performance as the wife in prison, and the scenes of imprisonment are poignant and satisfyingly difficult.<br /><br />The Next Three Days -- weak start, very strong finish. Highly recommended for the Crowe crowd. Enjoy it in all it's subjectivity.audience to understand, deprives the audience of a lot of linear continuity.

1582701709|1.0|I'm not God. I just want to make that absolutely clear. I am not God.  GOD is God.  And, assuming we're ALL agreed that the \\"science\\" of the Law of Attraction is clearly pseudoscience, let's start with the hypothesis implied by \\"The Secret\\" that we are each our own God...or is it saying that we are we all the same God? It's not clear. Either way, I don't think I am a God of any variety, so \\"The Secret\\" falls at first base by telling me that I am. I'd rather be a thinking man than a God, if that's alright.  I am not the creator of reality, and I don't want to be. Yes I want autonomy for my decisions, I want freedom and liberty, and I want to achieve my goals...but this does not make me God. God isn't me, or you, or little Bob down the road. God isn't even the universe itself (an alternative/contradictory claim made by \\"The Secret\\"). God isn't mashed potato, custard isn't mustard and black isn't white, all in one big blob of happy-clappy New Age loveliness. Not according to science, anyway. Nobody, neither me nor the contributors to \\"The Secret\\", can just come out and make these kind of big statements without proof and expect everyone to accept it.  Maybe it's just me. Maybe \\"The Secret\\" is true for you and has brought joy into your life. But honestly, do you not find the notion that you are God and the universe is your personal shopping catalogue to be a rather dangerous, hubristic and egotistical (not to mention amoral) way of looking at the world? Personally, if it was me, I'd prefer to believe that God was my creator and I was one of his humble creations, switched-on enough to take control of my own life and follow my dreams, but content enough with my lot not to feel the need to be the centre of the entire universe, pre-Galileo style. Isn't that a far safer, nicer, more forgiving, compassionate, inclusive, positive belief system?  Generally when dealing with pseudoscience, I feel it's best to err on the side of caution and humility, and the biggest problem with \\"The Secret\\" is that it errs on the side of devil-may-care narcissism, solipsism and arrogance. In fact, I'd say the types of \\"positive thinking\\" espoused by \\"The Secret\\" come across on my side of the universe as nasty, negative and unappealing rather than positive and inspiring. I don't think there is anything positive whatsoever about exerting all that mental energy on the conjuring-up of some random cheque in the mail, rather than working hard to make good, honest earnings. I don't see any \\"attraction\\" in shunning people in difficult times so as not to be contaminated with their impure thoughts.  I would go so far as to say that my philosophy of life is almost the polar OPPOSITE to the Law of Attraction. I'm happy to be an Attraction Law-Breaker, yeah, because this particular law isn't just an ass, it's more like a pink unicorn flying merrily over the rainbow! Basically, whatever \\"The Secret\\" says, the exact opposite is usually true. I can't count how many alarm bells ring in my mind when I read its advice to act like I already have money in the bank and its exhortations that I should behave like I'm already rich (ie spend money I haven't got yet). And people wonder how the credit crunch/recession happened? Anyway I'd much rather make my money honestly and rationally, in my own steady way, rather than via any kind of creepy ritual that makes me imagine it materialising in front of my eyes...sorry, not for me. Eurgh! Ditto for the ridiculous advice that I can eat whatever I want without putting on weight, as long as I just think \\"thin thoughts\\". Way to go, Rhonda.  The scary part is, these pieces of appallingly unsafe advice, clearly written on the back of a fag packet on the way to the publisher's office, are not only lauded as scientific facts, but also feted by the True Believers as \\"ancient wisdom\\" secretly kept from the public in an almighty conspiracy! Stone the crows. And better yet, in true cult fashion, anyone who dares question the credentials of this ancient wisdom is banished to the Cornfield (I can't be the only one to notice the similarity between \\"The Secret\\" and the awesome Twilight Zone episode \\"It's A Good Life\\", in which people who don't think good thoughts are simply wished away to meet their grisly fate....chilling anti-cult stuff, especially when watched back-to-back with \\"The Secret\\").  You don't have to go far to find mottos and proverbs that contradict \\"The Secret\\", if it hasn't already contradicted itself, that is. \\"Pride comes before a fall\\", \\"Don't count your chickens before they hatch\\", \\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\\", \\"Be careful what you wish for\\", \\"All that glitters is not gold\\", \\"Beware the wolf in sheep's clothing\\", \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\\" etc etc ... Maybe Rhonda Byrne had a copy of Aesop's Fables to hand, and for a laugh she thought she'd create a book contravening as many of Aesop's timeless, commonsense folk wisdoms as she could!  Artistically and aesthetically, notwithstanding its content, \\"The Secret\\" seems to me very poor, very brash and unsophisticated in its use of distractingly overblown NLP techniques and the ultra-cheesy contributions of its oleaginous \\"metaphysicists\\". The transparency of the gibberish is such that the whole book resembles a mediocre children's entertainer struggling to fend off the insults of the brighter kids: \\"hey Mr Magician, I can see you're hiding the rabbit up your sleeve!\\". If only they'd kept their ideas artistic, metaphorical and allegorical, like Aesop did, without such outrageous factual claims, then at least the \\"this isn't science\\" brigade wouldn't be in a position to criticise. A fictional character who believed in the Law of Attraction would make for an interesting novel - and the quality of writing would determine its plausability. It might even inspire people! I for one was moved much more by the ideas explored in the fictional \\"The Celestine Prophesy\\".  Golden Rules of Writing #101: don't claim to be something you're not - in this case, a bunch of unproven hypotheses masquerading as scientifically-proven facts - because you will lose integrity and credibility and turn off many of the audience who will start actively looking for proof or disproof of your claims. And that's not because we're negative people who \\"just don't get it\\", it's simply because PROOF is what turns something into science! No proof = no science. Science adores proof, it thrives on it, it begs for its theories to be proven or disproven so that new, better theories can take us closer to the truth if need be. It never stands still. Even Einstein's theories are coming under renewed examination now. Real science thrives on the forensic examination and testing of its claims. \\"The Secret\\", as a supposedly factual collection of statements rather than a piece of honest fiction, seems to ignore the requirement for proof of its veracity. Anyway, looking for proof and picking holes in false statements is fun. It's one of the most positive, life-affirming things I can think of, especially when you work out for yourself something that is proveably, demonstrably true. Anyone reading who is looking for uplift and a positive mental attitude: I suggest you get into critical thinking and troubleshooting your problems by logically dissecting things that don't immediately make sense...it's great, much better than \\"The Secret\\"!  Still, if we insist on getting our positive thinking from divisive, passive-aggressive, non-debatable, unproveable pseudoscience, we might as well stick with good ol' Scientology. At least LRH had a warped sense of humour and a highly original hypothesis (more important to the history of mankind than the wheel, it says here). Plus the modern-day Scientology movement does at least try and be entertaining in its approach - Squirrel Busters Productions, anyone?! It's rubbish, but entertaining rubbish.  A little humour and lightness of touch would work wonders for \\"The Secret\\" - it wouldn't make itany more scientifically valid but at least it would bump up its entertainment value! And it's the misleading approach to science that more than anything else gets me wondering if the contributors are either genuinely ignorant of the conventions of science, or else wilfully distorting their unproven beliefs as statements of fact (lying, for want of a better word).   Either way, because of this simple, schoolboy error in mislabelling their ideas as science, they have lost my trust in delivering the admittedly good parts of \\"The Secret\\" (there are a few, but they're all things you either knew already such as \\"good feelings make you feel good\\", or that have been regurgitated from far superior original sources, such as some of the goal-visualising exercises). That said, even if they came out and admitted \\"The Secret\\" isn't science but it's still a good spiritual idea to believe that God, the physical universe and ourselves are all as one... well I would just ask people to consider with an open mind the alternative hypothesis (obviously not a fact) that God rather than us is the creator of all, and it's God who ultimately decides what is positive and negative rather than us in our Icarean folly. You can still think good thoughts, you can still make goals and visualise the life you want...but the difference is you ultimately believe \\"the secret\\" lies with God rather than with yourself.  Me? I'll stick with the Bible...though even that I'll take with a heavy dose of critical thinking.  So Rhonda, please...stop calling me God, alright?

B004XNGKBS|1.0|Wow. This app is absolutely terrible. I don't see how anyone could ever stand using this for more than drawing pictures that even a preschooler could put to shame. The idea for something like this for a phone is a bad idea in the first place, because it just won't work, as demonstrated by Handrite.
B005PUF0O6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this light hearted grisly murder investigation.  There were lots of twists and romantic banter.  I'm glad the new Richard Castle Comic was featured as I recently bought that too from Amazon.  I enjoyed the costumes.  The new chief is rather funny.  I like her better than the old chief.  This 2nd episode of Season 4 was better than the 1st episode.

B0058VW36U|4.0|Be warned if you already have the (free) GetJar version: Your app won't just \\"unlock\\" and become ad free... instead you'll end up with two versions of Cut the Rope on your phone. Angry Birds updated alright for me (from Market to Amazon version) so I was hopeful this one would as well, but no dice so far.  Still nice to have the purchase for the future, but still.  Other that that, the game is obviously wonderful and addicting. Didn't have any problems opening/running it on my EVO 4g, just a little disappointed my progress wasn't there waiting for me.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|The idea behind this app is interesting. Trying it on my Samsung Mesmerize (SGS) felt like the screen was a little too small for writing. As the page gets full, you kind of start thinking you are running out of drawing space, even though you can write across the whole screen. It felt more like a novelty app on the SGS.<br /><br />On my Viewsonic gTablet, it was much easier to use. Having the larger screen space made writing via finger easier to do. I could also read what was written much easier as well. The only drawback was having to wait for the words to be added to the page, which slowed the writing process down for me.<br /><br />So, the app does what it is supposed to. Will I use it every day? Probably not. It's nice to be able to write without a keyboard, but typing is much faster for me.

0142418471|5.0|This book is simply wonderful.  The characters have depth and are so real.  The dialogue is fantastic (as is the inner monologue).  Basically the writing is just superb, both authors did a great job of portraying the two Will Graysons and their friends.  Oh and the musical bits...hilarious!  Gotta love Tiny Cooper - he is such a fun character.    While I am no longer a teen, I can easily relate to these characters.  Perhaps because music snobbery was just as integral to my High School experience (or at least to my circle of friends).  Just kidding!  No, what makes the story and characters so relatable is the honesty of emotions and the slowly unfolding self-realization that occurs in the novel.  Anyways, I highly recommend this book to all readers (younger readers FYI - there's quite a bit of swearing).  It will make you laugh, leave you a little misty-eyed and very, very satisfied.  Now I need to go check out these authors' other books ASAP!
0316098329|1.0|I bought the audio version.  I \\"listened\\" to the first few chapters on my ipod.  Did not read the story as most did.  Let me tell you, I have three kids and they absolutely did not use a speaking syntax remotely like this at or around age 5.  Another review likened Jack's speaking style to nails on a chalkboard and I would have to agree -- the audio version was particularly grating to listen to.  My opinion is that this is what an adult (who probably does not have children judging by the prose) THINKS a five-year-old would say.  Ugh.  After listening to a painful, but mercifully, few chapters, I advanced throughout the book hearing the first few words of every chapter to see if someone else ever spoke, but no, no one else speaking.  That was enough for me.  No listening to Room.  Perhaps it reads a little easier.  Audio version definitely not recommended.
034552554X|5.0|This easily makes my list of top books in 2011!  It is gorgeously written and filled with realistic and memorable characters.  I fell in love immediately with Victoria - her misunderstanding of human nature and her communication difficulties are oddly endearing.  I was rooting for her throughout all of her struggles to understand the world around her and find her place in it.  I read the second half of this book on the plane and couldn't prevent my eyes welling up with tears despite trying desperately not to look a fool in front of the other passengers and flight attendants.  While sniffling was inevitable, at least I managed not to let a sob escape (not an easy feat)!<br /><br />The inclusion of the Victorian language of flowers as a means of communication was another aspect that I really enjoyed - and my ARC included Victoria's dictionary of flower meanings which I just loved perusing.  The way in which Victoria's flowers impacted people almost reminded me of a floral version of Chocolat.  I heartily recommend The Language of Flowers to ALL readers - I can't believe this is Diffenbaugh's only fictional endeavor to date!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|There is no way to accurately describe Al Bundy. Al Bundy is everyman and that is something that the writers and producers made come through during the run of this all time classic. To capture all of the episodes in one place is a gift for the fans to say the least. Can anyone not smile the minute Al walks on screen?   Married...With Children will forever be an iconic piece of American television. I don't know that anything that came after it measures up to all that is incorporated within this one show. It is what life is all about.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger games had me from the first word. I spent the first 150 pages or so feeling incredibly anxious for the main character. I felt as if I were scheduled to be executed an hour after I woke up the next day. The sheer dreadfullness of Katniss's situation just seems to bleed out of the book. I could hardly sleep after reading.  And so the premise of the book is its real winning card. It's just such an awful thing to imagine that you're completely entranced by it. The actual execution of the story is top notch as well. The plot drags you on with such urgency. The characters are most certainly likeable, real, and relatable, particularly the main character. As a young adult book, the language is fairly simple, but definitely nowhere near embarassingly so. I really would love to see a more adult version of this, though.  There are some aspects of the premise that don't quite add up. But I refuse to deduct a star for them, because the story couldn't be as great as it is if the author tried to \\"fix\\" them. Ignore these chips in the paint and you will thoroughly enjoy this book. Probably in one night. Two tops.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's almost 3:00am and they made this great game Free App of the Day?!?    Man,  I'm gonna be tired...   This is a great game whether it's free or 99 cents.  I was actually going to buy this game the day before it was Free App of the Day, but some reviewers said a recent (Toy Box) update had wiped out all of their game info so I decided to wait. I jumped on it as FAotD and noticed there was an update available almost right away, but I decided to wait until I had finished the game before updating.  Fortunately, I guess the developer fixed the update problems, because it loaded fine and my previous game progress stayed as it was.  Fun, fun, fun.  Get it.

0307277887|1.0|The concept of the books is really interesting.  I was so sure I would like it, that I bought 3 books in the series before I ever read the first one.  I found the first one a huge disappointment.  Great Idea, but poorly thought out and executed.  Very little original imagination.  Just dumb. I would say this is one of the worst books I have ever suffered through and definately will not waste the time on the other two I have, unfortunately, already bought.
B004LROMSO|5.0|This series based on the legend of Camelot is very well-done: beautiful production, authentic costumes, great acting and interesting plot. All the men playing the knights are excellent in their roles, all testesterone and manly in their portrayals. Philip Winchester particularly stands out as Leonites with high morals and a true faith and sense of honor. Clive Standon Gawain is all macho knighthood and Peter Mooney as King Arthur's brother gives the show a sense of family. Joseph Fiennes is brilliant as Merlin and gives his character a sense of magic and mystery. The women of Camelot are all beautiful and perfectly cast in their respective roles. Some reviews on here critisized Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur, but I think he was right for the role. He is supposed to be a boy-man plucked from obscurity and placed on the throne. He should look a little out of sorts and uncomfortable at first and should appear too young for the part, but as time goes on he rises to the occasion and finds his position with more confidence. I think if the show was allowed to continue, we would have seen him grow more \\"kingly\\" as he grew into more of a mature man. It's a real shame that the show was cancelled and we will not be able to see how the story continues - Is Morgan pregnant by King Arthur? How will Gwen and Arthur's relationship develop? When and how will Lancelot enter the story? Where did Merlin go and why did he leave? This show should have been given more of a chance to develop and continue; I would have really liked to see how it all turned out in this gorgeous production.
B00026WU7I|5.0|One of bob dylans greatest albums.From \\"Tangled up in blue\\" to\\"Buckets of rain\\".It shows him at his most open and vulnerable.One of the best albums to listen to after a break-up.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I really didnt think it would be possible to top their last album \\"Need You Now\\" but they have done it! \\"Own The Night\\" is every bit as good as previous albums, and dare I say BETTER. Aside from the current singles on the radio \\"Own the Night\\" and \\"Just a Kiss\\" there is a plethora of amazing tunes on this album. One of my new favorites is the track \\"Cold as Stone\\". It gets you right in the heart, and there is a little Easter egg at the end of the song. It's beautiful.   The harmonizing on this album has stepped it up a little, and its an all around GREAT gift that Lady A has blessed us with once again :) Love it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|First off, I just finished watching all six movies as of today. They all look amazing in HD. Especially Revenge of The Sith, I thought that one looked the best (probably because it's the newest.) I can understand why fans are mad with Darth Vader saying  \\"NOOOO!!!!\\" but it's really not as bad as I thought it would be. It does seem rather pointless to add that to it, but whatever. All the other changes are so minor you most likely wouldn't notice unless someone told you about them. Aside from maybe Obi Wan's odd call/scream to scare off the Sand People. I found that one kinda hilarious.  But you get over these things when you're watching it anyways, it's still Star Wars, and it's never looked this amazing before. If you could stand the 2004 DVD changes of the original trilogy, you won't have a problem with these. All the extra's are really cool too. I would like to note that it DOESN'T include deleted scenes that were on the original prequel DVD's. These are all for the most part unfinished scenes.   I enjoyed this set a lot. I really forgot how much I enjoyed these movies until I watched it on Blu Ray again (it's been a few years since I last watched them.) I grew up watching the original trilogy on VHS until they looked like crap. I still got them somewhere.
B004132HZS|3.0|This is not a Sherlock Holmes video. It is an example of trying to sell a modern PI sh0w on the basis of the name attached. The good films and TV productions using the name, now-I assume-in public domain, all recognize that the atmosphere, the scenic design, with its period flavor, and characterizations  rooted in the Victorian era, are the essence of the continued entertainment value of Conan Doyle's original. As I watched, it took no more than a few minutes to shed all anticipatory responses associated with the magic names: Holmes and Watson.  What was left, with the thinnest of veneers stripped away, is a modest PI show, with contemporary scenes and casting which seeks to attract the teen-age and younger adult audiences. I was not much impressed but, then, this may be because of the generations that separate me from teen-age and younger adult outlooks.   It may be that the substantial majority of reviewers accurately reflect the response you, the potential viewer, will have to the show. For those steeped in the original text and film/tv attempts which captured the flavor of the original, as did the Jeremy Brett performances, I should thnsk it best to approach this as one would, the series some years back, of Young Indiana Jones.
B003YUQ9L2|1.0|I had one pair of Crocs before I purchased this one. That one was in Men's size 10, so I bought this one in the same size. Unfortunately, the shoes arrives larger than I expect. So I decide to change it into a smaller size. I contacted the company, they want me to pay for the shipping back to them, and purchase a new pair at the same time.  Then they will only refund me for the price of the shoes, not including the shipping fee, and they are not clear with the time for refund.   I didn't know their exchange policy is so much different from Amazon's exchange policy. I felt unfair and unsecured of their customer service.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|After 371 reviews, I'm not sure what I can add.  All I know is that my 8 kids put this in over and over even though the oldest one is 17.  And I am a forever fan of a movie that can 'entertain' me as an adult while the kids are thoroughly happy.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I just wanted to add a five star review to help throw off the affects of these one star reviews by people not having even bought the product.  It's a great, compact set and if you are a fan you'd be doing yourself a great favor by getting it!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Toy Story is one of those series of movies that does an amazing job of making each one as good as the last.  I love the adult humor and the children's story.  It makes it enjoyable for me to watch with my kids over and over (cause that's what kids do!  I probably can't add to the 378 other reveiws, but I did want to be sure and show my support for the Toy Story movies.  I love them.  I truely believe that you will too.

B005D51JQQ|5.0|Finally Sting gets the complete boxed set treatment, and it's a stunning one at that.  As an avid collector of The Police and Sting, I'm so excited to have this in my collection.  I'll probably leave the book out on my coffee table, it's gorgeous and something that deserves to be seen.  And of course it's exciting to have all that music in one place.  It's worth every penny.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|I have always loved these 2 actors!  This is \\"the\\" perfect movie for the both of them to star in.  Having seen many of their movies on TCM over the years, I became big  fans of theirs.  This movie has it all- love, comedy, drama.  Also admire Jimmy Stewart's acting in this movie. He was perfect for his role!  Make  sure not to miss this one-especially if you are a fan of old movies.  This one can't be beat.
B0034G4OZE|3.0|There are plenty of movies, if not books set in Mental Wards or Institutions: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Slaughterhouse Five, Catch-22 and many others you can probably think of. It is a little tired and tiring to set a movie in such a place now, but \\"It's Kind of a Funny Story\\" manages to  use this setting to consider the awkward boy learns valuable lessons about life and self from quirky eccentric figures who may or may not have a mental illness genre. It is though not especially interested in exploring the mentally ill or mental institutions, so don't expect this movie to shed any new light on the subject.

B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of The Moon was released originally in March of 1973.<br />The album was the band's first number one album here in the United States of America and has stayed on the charts for nearly an accumulated 1,300 plus weeks (741 weeks from 1973-88 and many more now from 1991 - today where it still remains). Plus, The Dark Side of the Moon is the third largest selling album worldwide with some 40 million copies sold (including 15 million here in the US but should be updated for recertification now).<br />There is a good reason why this album has held up for the last nearly 40 years and it's because the songs deal with problems that one goes through in life and the production was many years ahead of its time. This was the first album that ever touched me in the heart, I used to go to sleep listening to Dark Side when I was a baby because lullabies wouldn't work half the time so when all else failed, my mother would put Dark Side on the turntable and it did the trick. Consequently, I became a die-hard Floyd fanatic, which I still am today.<br />The Dark Side of the Moon started out life as a piece called Eclipse and eventually became Dark Side of the Moon. Guitarist/singer David Gilmour's vocals and guitar solos dominate throughout the album as does keyboard player Rick Wright's keyboard work and harmony vocals.<br />This album has survived the test of time like no other album ever made before or since.<br />As everyone knows, the album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London between June of 1972 and January of 1973 with the band producing and Alan Parsons (whom would go on to be a succesful producer in his own right) engineering the album with Chris Thomas (whom had worked with The Beatles and became a producer in his own right working with Pete Townshend, Roxy Music and The Pretenders among others) handling the mixing.<br />All of the songs dealt with different topics that one experiences in life like \\"Time\\" (with clock noises and about racing against or managing time) and \\"Us and Them\\" (a song about the perils of war and is still relevant today). Note: the music of Us and Them was originally intended for the 1970 film Zabriske Point during the riot scenes and was called The Violent Sequence but director Antonioni rejected it in favor of another Careful With That Axe Eugene entitled Come In Number 51 but was luckily resurrected for the album's best track.<br />Instrumentals like \\"Speak to Me\\" (featuring voices that are dominant throughout the album and with a heartbeat that was done on drummer Nick Mason's bass drum which opens and closes the disc) and \\"On the Run\\" which was originally a guitar jam entitled The Travel Sequence changed into this eight note Synthi-A VCS3 synthesizer pattern complete with tape effects and guitar noises. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" was originally called The Religious Sequence/Mortality Sequence before it changed into this instrumental about death and dying and featured the excellent vocal phrasings of Clare Torry. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" (which was originally called Scat during the preliminary stages of the album) is excellent as well.<br />The other tracks are classics. Aside the aforementioned Us and Them and Time, you get classics like \\"Breathe\\" (which was originally written during the recording of bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters' first solo project The Body with different lyrics and music save the Breathe in the Air refrain), \\"Money\\" (which eventually became Pink Floyd's first American Top 20 hit and one of the few singles released with a 7/4 time signature and was about the pleasures and negatives that money brought) and the closing one-two punch of \\"Brain Damage\\" (a song referencing to original Floyd leader Syd Barrett and absent friends) and \\"Eclipse\\" (which sums up the album) wrap up this classic of an album.<br />This album is a must in anyone's record collection and the remastering on first disc of this Experience Edition was done by James Guthrie and Joel Plante and is excellent (I don't know if this or the Hybrid SACD are best CD issues (I thought the Mobile Fidelity version was flat) but the original 1970s vinyl is hard to top)!<br />Now as part of Pink Floyd's Why Pink Floyd? reissue campaign, this classic is reissued and remastered in three different configurations. This Experience Edition contains a live recording of the band performing this album at Wembley Arena (then known as Empire Pool) in November of 1974 which was originally recorded by the BBC. Turns out, the band also had a mobile truck on hand as well to record the whole show of 16 November 1974. I had the ROIO of Dark Side at Wembley 1974 for years but what Andy Jackson, David Gilmour and Damon Iddins did with this was superb. Many of the tracks are extended (On the Run (an altered sequence compared to the album), Great Gig (featuring Carlena Williams and Venetta Fields doing Clare Torry's performance as a duel (I think this version trumps the studio version)), Money and Any Colour You Like (which is five minutes longer than the album version and compare this to PULSE and it has just a four man Floyd playing with a fire and passion. I know some are griping and complaining that the \\"Echoes\\" encore is missing but I believe a live version will be on a Experience Version of Meddle in the form of its 1971 performance for the BBC. The booklet is excellent and the packaging is somewhat original to the record. Kudos to PINK FLOYD (IMMERSION REVIEW LATER)!<br />RECOMMENDED!<br />Highly recommended!ante and is excellent (I don't know if this or the Hybrid SACD are best CD issues (I thought the Mobile Fidelity version was flat) but the original 1970s vinyl is hard to top)!<br />Now as part of Pink Floyd's Why Pink Floyd? reissue campaign, this classic is reissued and remastered in three different configurations.

B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Pink Floyd's eleventh studio album The Wall was released in December of 1979 and is a classic and regarded as the band's most ambitious masterwork.<br />This double album ranks up there with other noted classic rock double studio albums like The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Tommy, Exile on Main Street, Quadrophenia, Blonde on Blonde, London Calling, The White Album, Physical Graffiti, Electric Ladyland and many others.<br />The concept for The Wall still holds up over 30 years after its initial release.<br />The idea came to bass player/singer Roger Waters whom was upset with himself after spitting on a fan on the last gig of the Animals tour at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.<br />In 1978, Roger was writing and recording demos that would become The Wall (many to appear on the Immersion Version in 2012). Meanwhile, drummer Nick Mason was off producing other acts (ranging from punk rockers The Damned to prog rocker Steve Hillage) whilst the other two principle Pink Floyd songwriters whom were guitarist/singer David Gilmour and keyboard player Rick Wright were recording their first solo albums in France which both came out in 1978.<br />In late 1978 the band, along with KISS/Alice Cooper/Peter Gabriel/Lou Reed producer Bob Ezrin, began demoing the songs for The Wall at Britannia Row Studios in London (these too are to appear on the Immersion Version in 2012).<br />The band properly began recording The Wall in April of 1979 in two studios in France (and later at studios in Los Angeles and New York) with Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and engineer James Guthrie producing to avoid the crazy English tax laws as the band was almost bankrupt due to their agents stealing the money in a way that they still owed the British tax companies taxes.<br />All of the songs, save four, were written by Roger. The album's three best tracks \\"Young Lust\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" were co-written by Gilmour. Then, \\"The Trial\\" was co-written by Ezrin.<br />The Wall was a concept album which told the story of a character named Pink (a composite of Roger Waters and Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett).<br />After we begin with the bombast rock of \\"In the Flesh?\\", The Wall story begins when Pink goes through a traumatic childhood of losing his father in war (\\"The Thin Ice\\" and \\"Another Brick in the Wall (pt.1)\\"), cruel sarcastic teachers (\\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\", the chart-topping single \\"Another Brick in the Wall (pt.2)\\"), an overbearing mother (\\"Mother\\"), problems with adolescence (\\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\") problems with success (\\"Empty Spaces\\"), relationship troubles (\\"Young Lust\\" (wife leaves him), \\"One of My Turns\\" (snapping when the groupie comes in room and many other problems (like the wife beating in \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\") one goes through before walling himself off from the rest of the world (\\"Another Brick in the Wall (pt. 3)\\" and \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\").<br />The second disc starts with Pink walled off from society (starting with the classic \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\") then ponders his life in a hotel room (\\"Nobody Home\\") and thinks back to his father's death (\\"Vera\\" and \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\"). The highlight of the album is \\"Comfortably Numb\\" which tells the tale of Pink being confronted by a doctor to take something before he could go on with the show. The song was first intended for David Gilmour's 1978 solo debut but was thankfully left off and saved for The Wall. The track is a classic and is always in the Top 10 greatest rock song/guitar solo polls! The track \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is Pink being led to the show and then as a fascist dictator Pink is performing like a madman as depicted in \\"In the Flesh\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Waiting For the Worms\\" before having his own trial (\\"Stop\\" and \\"The Trial\\") and is ordered to knock down his wall to start life fresh (\\"Outside the Wall\\").<br />Band turmoil during 1979 reached an all-time high and Roger eventually kicked Rick Wright out of the band citing Rick wasn't doing squat whenin fact Roger was setting Rick up to fail from the word go. Rick was let go but stayed to finish the album and did The Wall shows in 1980/81 as a paid musician (the other three members lost money from staging the shows). Rick played on most of the album (even co-producer James Guthrie stated Rick played on more of The Wall than given credit) as does Nick whom is not on drums for half the record (Jeff Porcaro played drums on Mother, Jeff's father Joe played snare drum on Bring the Boys Back Home and there's no drums on some of the tracks).<br />Despite the band turmoil, The Wall became Pink Floyd's third US chart-topping album (stayed at #1 for 15 weeks), sold over 25 million in the US alone (second highest selling album of original material of all time here in the US and best selling double album ever though some configurations were on one cassette and one heavily edited 8-track cartridge), spawned the greatest rock concerts ever produced (documented on Is There Anybody Out There and many boots available) and a classic film.<br />As part of the 2011 Why Pink Floyd? campaign, the band re-release this masterwork with a remastered CD painstakingly done by James Guthrie (one of the original co-producers of the album and the engineer of the album) and Joel Plante. Out of the CD issues I have owned of this album, this is probably my favorite version (sure beats the lifeless EMI Europe remasters from 1994) apart from the original vinyl record. Also the booklet is excellent and does a great job replicating the original vinyl LP art apart from the change in color text of front cover writing.<br />The Wall is still a classic today and is highly recommended!to fail from the word go.

B004ZN9UZO|5.0|Pink Floyd's Animals album was released in February of 1977 here in the US and the previous month in Europe (as they were on EMI Europe and Columbia/CBS for the rest of the world).<br />I first got this album on cassette in February of 1985 (when I was 9 and had Pigs (Three Different Ones) cut in half but on CD the track is uncut) and I have had the remastered CDs, LP and cassette and 8-track.<br />The Animals album was coming hot off of the heels of two chart-topping studio classics, 1973's Dark Side of the Moon and 1975's Wish You Were Here.<br />The sessions for Animals took place between April and December of 1976 at the band's own studio Britannia Row Studios in London and like the last few albums was produced by the band members themselves.<br />If tensions were bad during Wish You Were Here, they got worse during Animals.<br />This was the first album where bass player/singer Roger Waters wrote practically every tune on the album and vetoed anything keyboard player Rick Wright came up with and restricted guitarist/singer/songwriter David Gilmour's contributions to one track, the classic \\"Dogs\\".<br />The album kicks off with \\"Pigs on the Wing (pt. 1)\\" which was a love song to Roger's then-wife Carolyne. Part two of Pigs on the Wing ends the album. Next, was the aforementioned 17 minute epic \\"Dogs\\". This song was originally called \\"You Gotta Be Crazy\\" but the lyrics were changed to tell the tale of the Donald Trump tycoon types whom are power-hungry people whom kick, bite and claw their way to the top and then eventually grow old and die of cancer caused by the weight of their self-importance.<br />The album's second half kicks off with the 11 and a half minute epic \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" which talks about bigoted political leaders. The last verse, \\"hey you Whitehouse\\" was misconstrued as an attack on President Ford but is about the late moral majority leader Mary Whitehouse. That track had great guitar work from David (whose guitar dominates throughout the album as a contrast to synthesizers, saxophones and choral sounding backing vocals that dominated DSotM and WYWH). The track \\"Sheep\\", originally called \\"Raving and Drooling\\", is the final epic on the album and is about the weak-minded people who follow what the dogs and pigs say before finally rebelling at song's end parodying one of the psalms in the bible. We end with \\"Pigs On the Wing (pt. 2)\\" which is a reprise of part 1 with different lyrics.<br />When Animals was initially released, the album was seen as a critical and commercial disappointment compared to its two predecessors due to the three awkwardly long songs on this album. Animals quickly went Platinum (eventually 4 million in US sales) and shot to #3 but quickly fell from view because the songs were too long, big deal!<br />With this new 2011 remaster that Capitol has released painstakingly done by James Guthrie and Joel Plante (it rivals the 1992 mastering that Doug Sax did for the Shine On box set), Animals today sounds fresh and competent unlike most albums that came out in 1977. The booklet in this Discovery issue is amazing with lyrics, photos and credits.<br />The tour to support this album was not a memorable tour for the band. Whilst the rest of the band got used to larger crowds and stadiums, Waters' persona changed from a happy person into a mean, embittered sourpuss (which he is slowly dwindling away from today). On the final night of the Animals tour, Waters admitted to spitting on a fan which would give birth to The Wall (review soon).<br />Animals is highly recommended!st to synthesizers, saxophones and choral sounding backing vocals that dominated DSotM and WYWH).

034552554X|5.0|When I was approached by Random House to read this book, I was fascinated by the premise of the book.  I was also interested because it was the author's first novel.  I just wish I hadn't let it fall down in my pile of books to read.  Once I started this book, I struggled with the fact that I couldn't put it down, yet I didn't want the story to end.<br /><br />The character of Victoria took me back to my early social work days of working with juveniles in alternative high schools and group homes.  It reminded me of some of the kids who left an impression on me and made me wonder....where are they now?  All would be adults by now.  How are they doing?  Was there someone there to help them transition into the adult world?<br /><br />I liked how the author flipped back and forth from Victoria's childhood in foster care to her current life as an adult.  It made the story move faster and gave you the history you needed at the time you needed it.  I can't say I had a favorite character, because I loved each of the them in their own special way, but Elizabeth and Renata were amazingly strong, patient and caring women that I would love to know.  I also loved that a certain person in the novel was named Hazel Jones.  My grandmother was Hazel Jones, and she also was a flower lover and passed that on to my mom and to me even though I never met her.<br /><br />I loved the history and language of the flowers. It was fascinating and made me look at flowers in a whole new light.  I have a new flower garden that we will be planning for next spring and I am thinking differently about the types of flowers I want to plant in there.<br /><br />This novel touched on many different topics that would encourage lots of discussion including forgiveness, love, heartbreak, despair, hope, and second chances.  We all make mistakes, so shouldn't we all deserve second, or maybe even third, fourth and fifth chances?  This novel makes you believe second chances must be given and received.<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS is powerful, engaging, enchanting, thought provoking, and beautiful.

1400063515|3.0|This came highly recommended by one of my previous manager. He was in fact so impressed that he did a book review session on conference across that firm's various locations. The interesting part is that in a few months, it was the same company (Satyam) whose Chairman resigned after publicly announcing his involvement in a massive accounting fraud - indeed something like a black swan. Post this I was too busy finding my next job, this was still on my watch list but then when I read this self statement from Nicholas Taleb - I couldn't avoid picking this up: \\"My major hobby is teasing people who take themselves & the quality of their knowledge too seriously & those who don't have the courage to sometimes say: I don't know....\\". As of the book, it lived to the expectation and Taleb is as entertaining as the above statement dictates. However, I had also picked this book with the belief that the current economic crisis is also a black swan - which was not as it doesn't satisfy the three criteria's essential for that to be classified as a black swan event. So it was a bit of a personal disappointment but enough to get me hooked to Taleb and follow his other works.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|I am the list maker queen and wasn't in love with the notes app that came with my Samsung Infuse. With all the positive reviews for this app, I was surprised that I hated it. My biggest complaint is that it wasn't intuitive. On my way to try something else!
0743298039|5.0|Margaret Lea loves books.  Old books.  Books whose authors have been dead for many years.  A one-time amateur biographer, she says, \\"I like to disinter lives that have been buried in unopened diaries on archive shelves for a hundred years or more.  Rekindling breath from memoirs that have been out of print for decades pleases me more than almost anything else.\\"  Almost anything, that is, until she receives a letter (\\"A letter.  For me.  That was something of an event.\\") from the eminent and elderly novelist Vida Winter that bids her to her home and her life story, something that has never been offered up truthfully to any biographer, professional or otherwise.  Confused as to why Winter would seemingly choose her at random to pen a tale long sought and never obtained, Margaret ends up learning a great deal about the fine line between truth and fiction, the endurance of blood lines, the enigmatic and somewhat supernatural bonds between sisters, and the mystery behind a collection of unfinished stories that has perpetually baffled Winter's adoring public.<br /><br />\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a bit slow to start, but don't let that deter you.  After a deliberate and slightly torturous first 40 pages, the chapter entitled \\"Meeting Miss Winter\\" is the dram of water to a reader's mad thirst for a story and characters that ensnare.  The encounter that follows between storyteller and biographer is even more spellbinding, Winter every bit the three words the author uses to impress upon the reader the intensity of her voice alone (imperious, declamatory, magisterial).  The larger-than-life raconteur's simple moniker is rich with symbolism; the extremes of life and death that construct her nom de plume serve as a constant theme of the book.  All of Setterfield's characters have experienced the pain of loss: one is a conjoined twin whose sister died following their separation shortly after their birth; one witnesses death many times throughout her life, suffering a spiritual death herself at one point and being reborn in a way she didn't anticipate; the whole of the Angelfield family often meets untimely and tragic ends.  Setterfield even concludes her novel with two deaths.<br /><br />The book's form is advantageous and keeps the narrative at a moderate and steady flow; its division into four parts sets the reader up for a strict chronology of the tale, the author avoiding a betrayal against her character's resolute desire to tell the story in proper order and entirety (\\"...All stories have beginnings, middles and endings; it is having them in the right order that matters.\\").  Past and present consistently commingle and Setterfield's transitions from now to then and back are smooth and systematic.  The book could be considered lengthy at 406 pages but this is hardly noticeable once one gets sucked into the narrative and allows themselves to be consumed by its grand albeit slightly ostentatious method of storytelling, the methodical disclosure of long-buried and dexterously layered secrets, and characters that bear a silent mutual grief, one that inexplicably and irrevocably connects them.<br /><br />And yes, the characters.  Setterfield's cast is plentiful: Margaret Lea, her protagonist; Vida Winter, a woman who bore neither wealth nor name and gave herself both; the Angelfield family, with its suicidal patriarch, mentally disturbed siblings Isabelle and Charlie, Isabelle's polarized twins Emmeline and Adeline; John-the-dig, the slightly crotchety groundskeeper who only feels warmth toward the Missus, Angelfield's long-suffering housekeeper; Hester Barrow, the meticulous and diligent governess who whips Angelfield and its inhabitants into shape only to mysteriously pack and up leave one day after seeing something she cannot explain; Aurelius Love, a delightful baker and caterer who befriends and warms the remote Margaret.  There are also minor characters that slip in and out of the story and though the introductions are many, Setterfieldkeeps it organized and detailed to avoid confusion.<br /><br />Margaret provides the book's first-person narration but Vida Winter is the more multidimensional of the two female leads, her steely front gradually giving way to the frightened and fragile woman underneath who evaded questions on her personal history in order to protect herself and those she loved.  Margaret is a bit cold and distant herself, her interests in the antiquarian intense (perhaps boring to some) and a convenient distraction to her strained relationship with her mother, something which is as much a conundrum to her as it is to the reader.  In Vida she initially finds the same frustrating inability to communicate or connect, the emotional distance all too familiar.  In her attempts to breach the stronghold of Winter's mind, Margaret's own private fortress comes tumbling down and she finds herself opening up first to a perfect stranger (who later becomes a person of significance) and then to Winter, their newfound bond the catalyst to other momentous connections.<br /><br />Though Setterfield manages to tie up most loose ends, there are a few questions left unanswered.  At one point in the story, a character is found clawing at the ground, digging for something...or someone.  The reader is left to assume who or what is being searched for - the author sows the seed of inference and never out-and-out confirms.  What's also left up for grabs is who the spirit is that supposedly haunts the Angelfield house, and whether it is just a shadow, a trick of the light through the fog, a figment of Margaret's imagination.  But I think it rather keen that there aren't answers to these questions - what would be the fun in knowing everything?  The greater delight was being fooled by both the author and her character; I was never able to guess the truth about Winter, and when I thought back to the clues I had been given, I couldn't help but admire the degree of subtlety with which they'd been placed in the story.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's difficult for me to be objective when critiquing \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" - there is so much about it that I like that I hardly see any reasons not to like it (there are echoes of \\"The Distant Hours\\" by Kate Morton, another book I really enjoyed and highly recommend).  When you read so many books, it's easy to get caught up in technical detail, but I chose to let the story take me away, and take me it did, providing a wonderful escape into a world where I sat down with a famed author and had the privilege of being privy to her dark and tragic family history.  Setterfield has made quite an impression on me with this first novel.  I hope she can exceed expectations with the next, because I'm really looking forward to it.d to avoid confusion.

B000F8O35U|5.0|Hey I love the little mermaid and now I have it on dvd! I watched it as soon as I got it and its awesome!! Thanks for everything!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is so much fun and addicting!  Got it for a FAOTD,  but definitely worth it to purchase.  Thanks developers for making such a great game!
B0058VW36U|1.0|Looks fun. Hangs on loading on a stock Captivate running 2.2  Got it during free day, so I'm not out any $$$ so I'm not really complaining.  Glad I didn't purchase it and need to get a refund.  I'd be willing to apply any updates to see if it fixes this device, as others have complained with Galaxy S phones.
B0058VW36U|5.0|One if the best games I've seen for Android.  Visually appealing and addictive game play. Well worth the asking price.
0345350499|5.0|I read this book for the first time almost 20 years ago and I wasnt able to put it down then and I cant put it down now. I am happy that there are now two other books after this to read.
B005EHNEDO|5.0|Dear Music Appreciator,<br /><br />Knowing that more than enough will be written about this new Wilco album by more than enough reviewers both on this website and on countless others, I humbly offer (to those who are truly shopping and are truly reading reviews for the purpose of deciding whether this product is worth paying for) the following three reasons to buy this album.<br /><br />Buy this new album by Wilco if...<br /><br />1. ...you are already a fan - whether a casual or a dedicated fan you will find in THE WHOLE LOVE some of the fine qualities from each of the previous Wilco records carefully crafted around new and creative ideas.  If you really are a fan you should probably at least get the Deluxe CD edition for the bonus disc and 52 page booklet with the groovy artwork all housed together in a firm carboard slipcase that will look good lined up with all your other special edition CDs on your CD shelf.<br /><br />2. ...you are a patient and intelligent music fan who doesn't mind spinning an album again and again and again before truly deciding how you really feel about it.  Some of these songs are instantly accesible and some are growers, but Wilco as a band has always been like great literature for me in that I have to study them out a bit and actually spend some quality time really listening before I truly begin to appreciate what I'm hearing.<br /><br />If you are relatively new to Wilco and if you haven't seen it yet, I recommend that you watch the movie I AM TRYING TO BREAK YOUR HEART: A FILM ABOUT WILCO.  This movie was a turning point for me in my appreciation and understanding of the band - probably safe to say that if you really enjoy the movie you will enjoy this new Wilco album (and every Wilco album?).<br /><br />3.  ...you think of yourself as a person who appreciates and supports artists who continually explore the limits of their creative abilities in new and interesting ways without much apparent regard for commercial success.  Wilco is a band that does this.  Wilco is a band that is consistently thoughtful, creative, and fun - a band that accomplishes the neat trick of being the same but different rather than just being the same or just being different.  Wilco is a band that knows itself and that knowledge gives them a confidence that continues to power their flight over consistently creative musical terrain.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listenerthoughtful, creative, and fun - a band that accomplishes the neat trick of being the same but different rather than just being the same or just being different.  Wilco is a band that knows itself and that knowledge gives them a confidence that continues to power their flight over consistently creative musical terrain.  Sincerely,  Constant Listener
B004XNGKBS|3.0|This looks like it would be a really cool app but it didn't work on my Samsung kick, I've  been looking for something liked this but it keepted F/C on me for that reason I gave it a 3 because I like the concept.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|The app works fine with no crashes... But even with cursive the writing is indistinguishable from real writing... Would not recommend
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Excellent app!  works better than PDF Scanner.  and its free.  very easy to use, well thought out.  2 thumbs up
B000BYRD6Y|5.0|It works very good the sound is very good on it it is at a very good price buy it now at a good price.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The is a great game and extremely polished. It runs blazingly fast on my HTC Desire (1Ghz Snapdragon) and I have no idea why so many people are complaining about load-times and crashing. Less than 5 seconds from clicking the shortcut to playing the game and I've never seen it hiccup once in game.  It's the #1 paid game on the Android Market at the moment (and for good reason) so getting it here as the free app of the day is outstanding!
B0058VW36U|1.0|Om the most updated version of Droid it will not go past tge start screen.  Continues to loop back to the starting screen.  Uninstalled and reinstalled already without luck.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I just got around to testing the new Soundfly in my 2006 Hyundai Sonata. I was a bit skeptical about any of the FM adapters after reading many poor to bad reviews. The Soundfly seemed to stand out. One concern is the placement of the car antenna on the back window. I plugged the Soundfly into my lighter socket that I usually use for GPS power. Initially, I thought the device was defective because it did not power on. I had to push the connector very hard to make contact. Once it powered on I hit MENU and set the Soundfly for 88.1 Mhz. I dialed up 88.1 on my FM receiver and got a very clear signal with plenty of volume. I live in a highly saturated RF environment with powerful FM transmitter towers within sight. I navigated to a few folders on my music loaded SD card and sound quality is pretty good. We are off on a road trip tomorrow so I will give it a workout and report back later. One negative is the LCD display. It is poorly backlit and the lower sections are hard to read. Overall, I am very happy with the Soundfly.
B0058VW36U|5.0|worried bout permission use lbe privacy guard... Now how do you beat level 22 (cardboard)? .... got everything else beat. its a good game all in all
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I knew Laurie had some talent for the blues from watching the British comedy series Jeeves and Wooster set in early 1930's Britain. Rich twit Bertie Wooster was always in trouble with his overbearing female relatives but saved by his genius gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves. Once in a while he would get a chance to sing and play the piano on some then current popular music. What sold me was his incredible version of Nagasaki, \\"where the women chew tobaccy and the men are wacky - wacky - woo\\". This set of recordings shows that he has the chops to ride with some fast company as side men. Not bad for for an \\"amateur\\". Once again, as with the Rolling Stones, the British bring our own music back to us.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I personally recommend these movies to everyone, especially this one! Out of the three movies of the Twilight Saga, Eclipse is by far my favorite. I found the movie to spike all of the emotions inside myself. Portions made me sad, like during the fight. It also provided many happy moments, especially every ones favorite at the end ;). Jealousy and anger are also throughout the entire thing.  You get jealous of the characters but also jealous for them. A person becomes angry at them, or with them, while feeling pity at the same time. These emotions really make the movie exciting and relatable even with extensive amount of fictional themes that occur throughout the movie. Another positive about this movie is the fact that it really went along with the story line of the book.  Although no movie can include everything that happens in the book, I feel that the writers did a very good job at including the important aspects of the book in the movie. From the words that are in the book, to the emotions that you feel during reading parts of the book, the movie really connected the two so well. All in all I think that everyone should watch this movie. Even if you haven't seen the first two this one really is absolutely captivating and deserves more stars than I can give.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Finally! Cut the rope is here for free! Great game hard to put down, have fun with it while it's free!
B001UV4XI8|2.0|WB has decided to only honor the Digital Copy for 6 months. If you zoom in on the back of the Blu-Ray you will see an expiration of the middle of September. I am a fan of this movie in the Harry Potter series, but please save your money and buy the single disk addition and don't give WB any additional revenue as they have decided to screw the purchaser by no longer honoring the Digital Copy because it was \\"a limited time only,\\" but their are still happy to sell it to you the purchaser!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|This season certainly does not disappoint. Filled the twists and turns we have come to expect over the years, some tear-jerking moments, and the yell at your TV out of frustration moments. Don't miss out on the conclusion of one of my favorite series ever!!
0307887898|5.0|I went to the Eric Ries Lean Startup event in Chicago and read this book immediately after. It was a really good read. It encompasses lots of different things that just make sense or that I have heard/thought about in varied experiences. This book does a wonderful job of articulating it all into a cohesive framework that has been proven to work as illustrated by the myriad of examples and case studies given in the book. I am an aspiring entrepreneur and I plan to use this book as a framework to guide my decision-making process going forward. This book has provided much needed clarity and a roadmap for a seemingly counter-intuitive process that just makes sense. Thanks Eric!
B0055SWM08|5.0|My first thought was that this worked just like the icy patches in Pokemon. I've been addicted since level one. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I ordered these last week to upgrade from my current X11 model. This headset is well worth the money in my opinion. The sound quality is impressive. The surround sound is a little misleading because the xbox is only capable of 5.1 but it still is incredible. I play MW2 a lot and i can tell you explosions are a lot deeper highs are more crisp and i hear things i could never hear with the X11. So far i have no complaints about this product. This is the best price anywhere, retails for 160 at places like gamestop and bestbuy. I know some people complain of cracking and noise drop out with the headset since it runs on the 2.4 GHZ frequency but i haven't had that problem even with my D-link dir655 extreme n router. I guess it only matters if you have tons of items running at that frequency. So overall i would give this set a 5/5 no complaints works well for me, cant speak for everyone else but it worked perfectly out of the box setup was easy and its all clear. Would Highly recommend if your serious about your gaming and want to upgrade.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very relaxing &amp; soothing. The puzzles are a nice challenge. I find it calms me during my physical therapy appointments quite effectively.
B005974C94|2.0|So i bought this just on seeing Clapton, Marsalis and Jazz/Blues. I should have looked further or listened to the samples. Suggest this is for people who enjoy New Orleans style Dixie. Not for me!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Bought this on the Android Market months ago, and it's a steal at .99! If you pass this up while it's free, you're crazy! The graphics are great, it's a clean &amp; adorable game visually. The game concept is simple, yet amazingly &amp; progressively more challenging. Very addictive!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I have only been playing this app for about five minutes and wow I gatta say that its pretty addicting lol highly recommend it :) works prefect on HTC Sensation
B004ZNACA6|4.0|I'll break the review down into two sections, the music and the box itself.<br /><br />The music-<br />It is incredible.  I have owned every Pink Floyd album in various incarnation from UK pressings, to US dollar bin vinyl, and dubbed cassettes to various CD masters.  I am rather estranged from most of my vinyl and mostly had MP3 and FLAC versions of recent reissues.  Since I had a lot of ad hoc versions downloaded from various sources I was pretty psyched to get the whole collection in one nice newly remastered box. And sonically they are incredible.  People are looking for a revelation in sound in the other reviews and you won't necessarily find it here.  This is not the first time Pink Floyd's catalog has been well mastered.  But it is extraordinary.  It is neither over-compressed nor \\"brick-walled,\\" the dynamics are super clear and this reminds me very much of my old vinyl.  Especially albums like Wish You Were Here and Animals, which have always had a tremendous amount of depth and clarity.  There is a bit of sonic unity through the masters which is also welcome.  You can have a cut from the Division Bell follow in your changer after something from Obscured By Clouds without sounding overly jarring.  But that is meant as a compliment to the excellent mastering work which just lets the original tapes shine.<br /><br />The packaging-<br />This is where I'm less psyched, and why I am not giving this five stars.  The albums are all housed in digi-packs which doesn't bother me as much as other reviewers.  However the lack of art does bother me. This is PINK FREAKING FLOYD!  The visual element has always been very important.  The new booklets are all 8-12 pages long but are mostly lyrics.  In some cases, notably Wish You Were Here and the Wall there is actually LESS art than in previous editions.  If this is a last push at giving people a gorgeous physical product they definitely fell way short of the mark.  And the 60 page book is not very interesting or cool.  There are a few outtakes that look a lot like the original covers.  Snore.<br /><br />So in summary- from a sonic perspective this is probably the best these albums are ever going to sound on a 16 bit compact disc, and the consistency running through the discs is stellar.  However the love put into the sound does not carry over into the bland box which does not do the visual style of Pink Floyd justice.ok a lot like the original covers.  Snore.    So in summary- from a sonic perspective this is probably the best these albums are ever going to sound on a 16 bit compact disc, and the consistency running through the discs is stellar.  However the love put into the sound does not carry over into the bland box which does not do the visual style of Pink Floyd justice.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game competes with Angry Birds as the reason to get a smartphone or tablet.  Very fun and addictive with a lot of very challenging levels and surprises!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this way before it was the faod after seeing it on my friend's ipad.  In fact, this is the only app I've ever paid for!  Absolutely worth it.  It keeps me, my husband and all of our friends' kids entertained every time!  100% worth it, whether it's free our 99&cent;.
1446301583|4.0|Love this book. Tilda is a real creative Crafter. I have many of her books.  I was waiting for this one for a long time as I pre-ordered it earlier. I am just a \\"little\\" bit frustrated as the content starts to look a lot like her other wonderful books.  But still it gives you a lot of ideas to come up with. Her love for coordinate colors and patterns is always a delight and very helpful for your future creations.  If you don't Know Tilda, I would definitely recommend it. If like me you already have almost all her books, may be only add this one if you are a collector  ;-)
0307887960|4.0|IT IS A VERY DETAILED BUT BUT STOPPED USING THE DIET SO IT NOW JUST SITS ON MY SHELF TO COLLECT DUST....
B003L77GRO|5.0|Can't wait for Season Six - CSI Miami meets Serial Killer is how I describe to newbies. GF is now an addict.
B003HZW26U|5.0|This is a great story about a dog and his owner, it made me cry really, really hard but it was so very good
B0058VW36U|5.0|This was my first paid game purchased. Fun levels, and just waiting for the update, Toy Box. Enjoy the freebie!
B001M4YZ90|5.0|Met my expectations. It arrived promptly and in great condition. There's not much more I can ask for, and so I have nothing else to add.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love the new look of the recent updates. I love the blue background and the ability to change the color. I don't even use my alarm clock anymore I just use my phone alarm clock and never have to worry about over sleeping when the power goes out anymore. Absolutely the best alarm clock on the market! The only suggestion I have is to add a date to alarms so you can add an alarm for a future date, like a calender reminder but my calender reminders only put a notification icon up there and I never see them. If I was able to add an alarm for a certain date and it popped up over my lock screen like my alarm does then I wouldn't miss appt's. That would be great.
B005D51JQQ|2.0|What is the deal here ? Old, albeit great, material re-mixed and repackaged for $27.50 a disc ???? Pure greed.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|It was for my son, and believe me, that he loves it.<br /><br />I could play with it too, and I have fun too.
630463949X|5.0|I have ordered quite a few concert videos lately, and this is my favorite, and one of the few that I rewatch regularly.  Good tunes, great artists and the group really seems to enjoy playing (the McVies were very subdued, but good too.  They just seem like they prefer to be in the background).  Definitely worth the money.
B0058WFO06|5.0|I was a little underwhelmed with the recent Blackfield release, so I came to this new solo work with my expectations somewhat dampened.  Happily, this album is a masterpiece, a veritable smorgasbord of rich musical ideas, dazzling musicianship and wonderful sound engineering.  This is truly music as art in a world where the majority of music has become cheap filler (quite literally unfortunately, gotta have something to fill up those gaping empty gigabytes on your brand new iPod, right?).  My one small quibble with the existing reviews on this site is that the track Raider II needs time to sit and mature before you pass judgement on it, I too was a little overwhelmed by it initially, but having returned to it many times, it's now a standout track that takes my breath away.  Mr. Wilson, with this work you have joined a very exclusive club of artistic genii, and I applaud you for your staunch determination in sticking with a high quality approach to everything you do.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Works great on my droid x, it loads very fast and does not lag at all, plus the game is really fun
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Not a big Nicolas Cage fan, but I absolutely loved drive angry.  Very fast paced with enough action for any adrenaline junkie.
0843178167|3.0|I bought two of these books as return gifts for my son's b'day party. It's good, but you can actually find similar books (not exactly this one but sesame street/ sponge bob etc) at party city at $1 only. I dint know that before I bought these books. I think these are little over-priced, but again it's your preference what kind of books you want for gift purpose.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I paid for this app 2 days ago, now its free! But you know what? I am not disappointed at all. It was definitely worth the 99 cents I paid for it. I have had no problems with it at all. Runs perfectly, looks amazing, and gameplay is top notch. Highly recommend getting this as a free app!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Extremely polished, elegantly simple and easy to learn, perfectly executed. I really can't recommend this game enough, for kids and adults!
0811875040|2.0|I looked forward to this book as I have loved the bakery and its products, but as with so many recipe books of well known bakeries much is left out inviting failure. As with this book insiders have said critical points were left out. I found that some critical techniques were left out such as using a torch to help release the double chocolate cake from the pan. I will try this cake again...the first try was not pretty.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Lots of static right out of the box when connecting this to my new MacBook Pro 15 inch.  Within two weeks, it started flickering and now barely works.  Anyone know of a better product?
B0058VW36U|5.0|The first time I heard the little alien open its mouth and go \\"OM NOm\\" or whatever, I was like..wow..that's cool. Dumb reason to like a game probably, but it was my first reaction.  Honestly, I've seen this game in the market for a while and wanted to buy it, but could not convince myself to spend the $.  I was hoping it would show up as the App of the day.  And here it is!  Runs stellar on my Asus Transformer (DUH, everything does) and my Samsung Vibrant.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|Having to wait 24 hours for hints is a pain. What is the point of that? If you are stuck on all  3 of the available puzzles, you can't go forward until you can get a hint the next day to clear at least one puzzle out. Really frustrating.
B004HZ76FQ|1.0|For one, it says you can only install the app on one device. That means someone with a phone and a tablet or ebook reader is violating the &quot;agreement&quot; you see only after buying (sorry, &quot;licensing&quot;) the app.  Then later, it also demands the right to spy on you and track you online.  Absolutely unacceptable.
B0000013GT|5.0|Thank you for the great cd, it came very quickly and was well worth the small amount of money. I look forward to doing business in the future.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I have both of Lady Antebellum's previous Cd's and let me tell you they are just awesome!! I still to this day can't get enough of them! Everytime I hear them sing it fills my heart with love and joy! I have been listening to their latest release and all their hard work and endless commitment to their work,family and fans all over proves that it comes from their soul deep down! You can not only hear,but feel all the passion and love that goes into each song they write with the greatest of details. Keep up the great work! I will forever be a fan!!
0316098329|1.0|This book was very hard to read as it was written from a 5 year old perspective.  Although at times it was a page-turner, ultimately it fell flat for me.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Though I loved this book, I do think it's the weakest in the trilogy. It is very different than the other two. Even then, I give it 5 stars. I would put it down to go to sleep at night only to pick it up again 5 minutes later.  Once you finish this book, just plan on not sleeping at all until you finish the other two.
B0058VW36U|5.0|But was really hoping for the toy box update. Read in a few places that android was supposed to get it a couple days ago. So where is it???
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|As always, her books never disappoint.  I don't think I've read one yet that I didn't like.  I always love her main characters.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love it!  Engaging, challenging, great graphics.  I feel an addiction coming on!  You must try this especially if you enjoy Angry Birds but are ready for something new.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|The RHPS 35th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition is actually a loving gift to us, Rocky Horror fans. I really love the video transfer, but the DTS HD-Master 7.1 audio blows my mind. Another detail really nice to be mentioned is the fact that this Blu-ray, one of those all-in-one BD-books with photos and a lot of extras, has also Portuguese subtitles I usually don't see when I import something to my country - Brazil. And have you ever noticed how haired is Rocky's chest and body? I haven't until this accurately and highly contrasted edition. We are now honored to finally be able to see both UK and US versions. There's only one thing that makes me sad while I play this BD edition and it's the unhappy situation of my not being part of any cast, or shadow cast, for that matter. As Sal Piro welcomes you in a little inviting card, that comes separately in the first pages of the book, if you haven't seen theater exhibition - with shadow cast, screen talkers and flying food - you're still a virgin. So, I'm still virgin, but one who is constantly introducing the Rocky Horror spirit into other's life. However, let me say I'm still working on a theater RHPS project... And someday it might even come true. Enjoy you BD-book edition; it's not only excellent Mick Rocker photos and high definition video material, but eye-rolling, body-exploring, weirdly dressing and dancing sing-a-long fun... In Abundance!

Have to keep putting them back in! Good God! Excellent Work! Excellent talent at expressing the female form in all it's best!
B004XNGKBS|3.0|Does what it advertises, but I type much faster than trying to scribble using this app. It takes way too much time scribbling a sentence, which would be faster on swipe or SwiftKey. If you have a tablet and are used to writing with your finger, then this might be useful, but it's still personal preference. You can make equations and drawings faster, but it's not that easy either as the screen moves on/tabs to the next column/space so it's difficult editing the drawing, or adding on to the equation.<br />Android 2.3 galaxy s
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Built in Android alarm stopped making sound on my Droid X, so I started using this. Not only does it work every time (good thing for an alarm), but it let's me set how many times I may snooze before I'm forced to solve a math problems. This morning I was so groggy, I tried to snooze a 3rd time, but couldn't, and was too groggy to solve the problem, so had to run into the other room with the phone to avoid waking my wife until my brain kicked in! :) Great app!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Excellent special effects, story and plot. re-enhanced and as always classic Disney's touch of what leaves you to feel a classic to own and re-share with family, friends and your children for those young parents to share with their children :P

B0058A119G|5.0|WOW!!  AMAZING!!  How is it that we don't know these people's names after they wrote so many wonderful songs?  Brilliant!!  Highly recommend.
B001JFZ118|5.0|well paced action, interesting concept.  the story is quite unusual which makes it all the better.  perfect choice of actors.
B005D51JQQ|5.0|Those complaining about the price, get over it.  Have you heard of inflation? Well, this collection is like having a piece of history in your possession for years to come. It is remastered and remixed.  Yes, it can be expensive. But, you are paying for a brand name called STING (like buying an expensive car, luxury car). Yes, in a perfect world, this collection should have been around $50-$75.00, with some additional B-sides or unreleased material.  But, as we all know, everything around us cost more money these days.  There is 3 simple scenarios: you buy the CD without making too much fuzz about the price. The second scenario being that you don't buy it, and you wait till it goes down in price, or buy a used one.  The last one is that you don't buy this collection, and wait for a new STING release.  This is a free market.  You don't bitch when you buy an expensive car or luxury item because it comes with the territory.  Sting has joined the music loyalty, and he deserves it.  It is a matter of perception and value. The Record label knows how much they can extract for a collection like this. The good thing is that when you buy it at Amazon, you don't pay taxes, and it is still the cheapest i found.  So, stop complaining, and enjoy this collection of art and music. This is a piece of history you buying.  It is priceless, and i don't care about the price at this time.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Best fighting movie ever, period. Ip Man completely kick @ss, hands down. If you have a chance, check up Ip Man 2 as well. Awesome kungfu movie.
0553801473|2.0|Neil Gaiman, responding to readers complaining about the Martin situation back in 2009, stated that Martin \\"is not working\\" for his readers. Let the little people keep buying and suffer in silence.<br /><br />Gaiman is an idiot.<br /><br />I am lucky in that I started reading the series just eight weeks ago, which is how long it took me to finish book five. If I had started reading back in 1996, and had to wait the seven years between the superb book 3 and the lackluster books 4-5, I would be livid beyond words. No spoilers here, only the sad fact that, as too many have noted, Martin takes 2000 pages to get little done. Yes, the competent prose is still there, but prose was never Martin's strong point. His strong point was character, plot, drive. There is some minor development in books 4 and 5, but that's about it. To take seven years and 2000 pages to accomplish just that is unforgivable for an author. Forget the readers; the characters deserve better. The series deserves better.<br /><br />Even a mildly competent editor could have pared these two books down to a single volume. Doing so could have saved the series. Sadly, this did not happen. If it did not happen for books 4 and 5, it probably will not happen for books 6 and 7. That means we are looking at a wrecked series. I don't know if Martin is capable of bringing what is now a mess back on track; I'll wait to hear some reader responses before buying the next book.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|has fade in feature, which was the main thing I was looking for in an alarm, great interface. I definitely recommend this.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I have only just listed my book on here and my first customer is a good friend of mine, who found out about my book through Facebook, went to my website, read the first chapter and bought it. So all the things John talks about in the book are working for me already. My book has only been listed for 4 days!  I have set up a Twitter account and am learning how to use it. I have also created an account on Wordpress and I've started writing a blog to start me off. I'm headed for the Top 100 list. I'll see you at the top, John!!!  My book is called Tamisan. Check it out.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I love android in no small part because this is such a great calendar app. I run this on an HTC Droid Incredible with no issues at all.  I have Calengoo installed as well and prefer this calendar because it's easier to change views, the weekly view is simpler to navigate (I use the bars view) and most importantly you can choose which calendars to display. For example, I list two of my own calendars as well as my fiancee's calendar, and I can toggle her calendar when I need to coordinate with her. this has made my life much much easier!
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This works really well on a tablet.  I installed it on my Galaxy 10.1 and it works great since the tablet's screen is so large.  I haven't tried it on my phone, but I think the small screen would be a little too cramp to fully use this app. Great for taking notes in class if you have a tablet.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|If you don't like it at first, let it linger.  This album really grows on you with its great melodies and absolute bone crushing heaviness.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've been waiting for SO LONG for this game to be the free app of the day. I love it!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have read many, many books over the years, and I can honestly say that this is one of the most-enchanting I have ever encountered. I remember when I was younger and my imagination was strong (and my mind less-jaded)... when books came alive, and magic was real. This novel brought that feeling back to me. Anything I write cannot do this book justice-- please just take the time to read the sample and judge for yourself.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played.  It is challenging enough to test you but not so challenging to turn you off.  It operates very smoothly on my Xoom Tablet and it has a great appearance.  A TOP NOTCH GAME!  Thanks to Amazon and the Developer for this FAVORITE APP.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I don't know if it is innovative, but I can say it is the first time I have seen an application that records a character or sequence of characters and lets you replace or redo later. Works surprisingly well with fat fingers.
B005869U6G|5.0|One of my favorite things about Incubus is that they are always willing and capable to record an album that goes in a new direction. It's one of the things that makes Incubus who they are. Their newest release doesn't disappoint in this aspect. It doesn't surprise me that a lot of people are giving this album less than stellar reviews. This album is definitely not a repeat of any of the previous Incubus releases. It's different than the rest but still fantastic by any measure.  Minimalist & melodious is my best description of \\"If Not Now, When?\\".   Many of the tracks have a Pink Floyd or Bjork atmospheric simplicity to them. Likewise, there are still several heavier rock songs to round things out.     5 stars in my book. If you like Bjork and more than two of Incubus' previous albums, this one is a guarantee. Regardless, do yourself a favor and give it a few listens before making a judgment. What makes this a good album are its subtleties.
B005OTYSW8|5.0|This episode changes everything between Alena and Damon. There is also a very impressive twist with Claus.  The only draw back is that it is hard to change to a new episode. I give this five stars.
B005NA3B8U|1.0|i loved the arcade game and would love to play this but it does not install on the dell streak 7 you dont even get a error just a failed to install
1400052181|5.0|Excelnte libro muy conmovedor la historia te mantiene enganchado,Skloot ha hecho un gran trabajo y ha sido un &eacute;xito, espero que sea reeditado varias veces  m&aacute;s.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Excellent game. Definitely worth the price. Clever level designs and great, smooth graphics and physics. Will definitely buy for my second device.
B000HKWCOA|5.0|I watched TNG, DS9, and VOY when they were on television but I never watch Enterprise. Once I saw Star Trek was added to Prime I decided to try it out so I could see the shows again. I just finished watching the entire series of Enterprise. I really enjoyed watching it, it brought back memories of the other ST series. I thought this series was a little different than the rest though. This series seems to have more suspense in the episodes and less of the Federation ideals-- since this supposedly takes place before the Federation is formed and before the other series then it portrays it well. The last season of the series I thought was lacking and didn't end how I would've hoped but I still thought it was worth watching and overall liked it. I just wish it wasn't cut short and there had been more seasons!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not the kind of book I normally read, but my daughter INSISTED it was a must read.  I'm so glad she pushed me to read it.  It's nothing short of brilliant, everything an author aspires to and everything a reader looks for.  Innovative, unusual, unexpected twists.  Even if it doesn't look like \\"your cup of tea\\" read it anyway.  You'll be glad you did.
B004V98UKS|2.0|This game is really bad, the controls are bad, it lags, dumb graphics and nothing to do really...a better game for the same price is Quell.
B0033B5XCS|4.0|The cover was cool, the movies were brilliant, the only thing was that I got 2 copies of Freddy vs. Jason & Wes Craven`s a new nightmare, and Nightmare On Elm Street 1 was absent. No disaster since I already had Nightmare On Elm Sreet. So I just put one of the Freedy vs. Jason & Wes Craven`s new nightmare discs up for sale. The films are fantastic so if you like Freddy..Buy it!
1419702203|5.0|Drawing on George Harrison's personal archive of photographs, letters, diaries, and memorabilia, Olivia Harrison reveals the story of his life, from his guitar-obsessed boyhood in Liverpool, to the astonishment of the Beatles years, to his days as an independent musician and bohemian squire. Here too is the record of Harrison's lifelong commitment to Indian music, and his adventures as a movie producer, Traveling Wilbury, and Formula One racing fan. The book is filled with stories and reminiscences from Harrison's friends, including Eric Clapton, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and many, many others. Among its previously unpublished riches are photographs taken by Harrison himself beginning in the mid-1960s. It is a rich tribute to a man who died far too young, but who touched the lives of millions.
0385344325|5.0|I too read this in one sitting, just too good to put down.  It was good to look into Reacher's past.    Have I missed something along the way.  His brother is mentioned in this book.  Is he mentioned in other books also?    I always enjoy the author's intricate descriptions of a simple task or job.  I feel the tension building throughout the description and yet you never quite know if  Reacher will break someone neck, shoot them outright, or just walk away.  Spend sometime with this one!

B004UID2LC|1.0|So far, all I can get this to do is search. When I try to download anything it does a search then goes to a normal screen. No download.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great time waster, well worth the money if you miss this free application of the day.  I would have paid for it if I missed it.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|The added Vader \\"Noooo\\" at the end of Jedi was just horrible.  But then there are many things about the last third of Jedi that bother me.  I bought this edition for the deleted scenes and documentaries, but honestly the scenes are on youtube and the fan documentaries Star Wars Begins, Building Empire, and Returning to Jedi, all available for free are the best docs I've seen on the movies.   The new movies have some parts I like- all the Obi bits are good in my opinion, but I found myself fast forwarding through the \\"Annie\\" and Padme parts because I still find them horrible.    It may be my imgaination, but certain background elements in the old trilogy seem enhanced or added to.  Things have more color, or style, or come fancy holo terminal will be there when there wasn't one before, etc.  I would have been happy just getting the original trilogy on blu-ray.  The extras aren't worth it in my opinion.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is it, one of the last remaining games I wanted ported from ios. on a 7 inch screen this thing is better than it can ever be on an iphone. the loading scren hangs up at launch though. Also, opening any level after first opened will hang.<br /><br />All you have to do for now is hold tthe google search button for voice control , as soon as it pops up cancel it and then repeat. It just takes 2 to 3 to start ithe game and 1 or 2 times to start a new level, after that it is smooth as silk.
B005C5A66G|3.0|I've been listening to Machine Head since Burn My Eyes came out back in '94. They certainly aren't the same band they used to be. While they have gotten back to being really heavy, it kinda feels like they're just being heavy for the sake of being heavy and not really putting a whole lot of thought into it. I didn't care for The Blackening, and this album sounds like a follow up to it. They've moved on to a style that just doesn't appeal to me, although I'm sure some of that has to do with my tastes changing as the years to by too.<br /><br />Through the Ashes of Empires was my favorite album by these guys and they just haven't been able to impress me as much as they did with that one (or any of the earlier ones). I listened to this album once, and I probably won't listen to it again for a year or two until I forget that I didn't like it. If you're an old school MH fan, this most likely isn't going to be album of the year in your book either.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the ONLY app I have actually paid for, because it's that good, that polished, I never expected it ever to be released as a FREE AotD. It's that good I don't even regret paying the 99&cent;!   Some may berate the slow load times, but it's not that slow on my G2x.   There are many levels to keep you occupied and still more to come. The levels start off easy so you can get used to the play, and if you mess up it's quick and easy to restart that screen.   I can't say much more except that most people think Om-Nom (the creature you adopt) is cute. He is. The developers did an EXCELLENT job with this game.   Download it now. You won't regret it!
B000SJJCX4|4.0|Its pretty delayed, and doesn't display the notes for very long, but I play in drop G, and it gets the job done. The construction isn't something I wanna step on, but in a bag its better than paying $100
B00005UEAR|4.0|this is an album that I always wanted to get, but held off due to the price of $24 + for many years.  I had previously only heard the songs from Six Degrees on the Dream Theater Score DVD with a full orchestra backing up the band.  It is very interesting now to have the original CD and listen to the songs in their original form.  It is easy to see why the songs lent themselves well to being played by an orchestra.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a fan of music.  I like all kinds of music.<br /><br />My first thought upon listening to this album is that these guys really know what they want out of their sound nowadays and they did exactly what they wanted.  There are tons of great riffs, lots of melody, different vocal styles, different tempos, and an album that is fairly easy to listen to.  I don't necessarily mean that in a good way.  It's definitely a more mainstream sounding album in my opinion.  It's not boring mainstream, but you could mistake some parts for bands that get radio play.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about this album is that it has a lot of draw from different genres.  I hear hardcore, punk, thrash, heavy metal, mainstream metal, groove metal, etc...<br /><br />One thing for sure, it has a lot of diversity.  Since this is just my opinion, let me say that The Blackening is by far my favorite MH album.  To me, it just blew me away on the first listen from start to finish.  Wolves was probably the only song I didn't really like that much.  This album falls short of The Blackening IMHO.  It's still good though and if you are a fan of music, you will enjoy this.  If you don't like your albums to slow down a little, you probably won't like this one.  If you are stuck on, \\"Burn My Eyes was the best album ever when I was 17, MH died in 1978\\" then you probably won't like this album.<br /><br />And the last thing I'll say is that too much metal these days forgets to have a soul.  It's just pure anger channeled into hatred.  They forget that melody can make metal sound awesome!  This album has melody and groove!  Oh!  and the two bonus tracks are done well.<br /><br />Update - 8/30/2012:  On the way to work this morning, I realized that this has pretty much been my go to album for a long time.  It has gotten better with time and it really is a masterpiece of an album.  I thought, I need to update my Amazon review, so here I am.  Anyway, if you are into metal and you don't just sit on the extremes, then you probably already have this in your collection.  Changed to 5 stars.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Definitely worth 99 cents for all the great gameplay you get. It looks great on my Samsung Epic also. Now that we have toybox on Android, it's an even better value.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I've watched this movie probably half dozen times and each time I am just as engulfed and entertained as the first time.  The story line, characters, design and all the components that make this movies were completed to perfection.  I very rarely give 5 stars to a movie because my bar is so high but this one definitely deserves it without hesitation.  I hope others get the same enjoyment from Kung Fu Hustle as I.<br /><br />A note about the blue ray version - I noticed about 15 mins of extra scenes that I didn't expect which was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Enjoy
B0058WFO06|5.0|But I loved it from start to finish. It's definitely not Porcupine Tree, but any follower of Mr. Wilson would not expect that. The atmosphere is dark throughout, and at times downright creepy, but also sublimely beautiful. I hear hints of his Bass Communion sound, and there is also a heavy jazz influence throughout, which I love.  I am not a musician, so I can't break down bit by bit what is so awesome about this record. If that makes my review unhelpful, so be it. I just know with one listen, I was mesmerized by this music. I am not a \\"fangirl\\". I don't think that every piece of music Steven Wilson writes is brilliant or genius, but this album is, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.
1439175640|5.0|YUM YUM Had to have this book after a visit to the Bakery in New York in June, 2011 so I could try to make the cup cakes myself.  Book has all the cup cake recipes and the butter creams as well.  I bought the rough cut book and received it fast and in very good order.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Works great for the EVO! great translation and great app...it makes it even better being able to get it for free!

B004NSVE4Q|5.0|Having worked in the ED for many years, I finally read this book, and was comforted that someone was actually brave enough to put into print the things most of us only think.  It was such an inspiration to me, that I wrote my own book about emergency medicine, Haiku STAT!  I'm not nearly the great story teller like Samuel Shem, so I went with the collection of Haiku, but I tried to make them as dark, painful, and true, as the rules in the House of God.    House of God is a MUST read for anyone with experience in the medical field, and for those that have no medical experience, it is still worth the read, and believe me, it is more true than fiction.[[ASIN:1463650426 Haiku STAT!: A Poetic Look at the Harsh Realities of Emergency Medicine.]]
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Love this set.  I'm sort of a new PF fan and only owned 6 of the 14 albums on cd.  So for me, this was well worth the money and very excited to get the fancy packaging and book.  The cds are all paper cases with booklets, I prefer jewel cases but no big deal with the nice storage box.  The music itself, we all know that already, it's awesome and all must owns, well except maybe UmmaGumma which is a challange for me.  Overall, very pleased this with set and the Division Bell rules!
B005CM9DX6|3.0|I was looking forward to something different from Opeth. I don't always love the growling vocals, so I thought for sure I would love Heritage. Unfortunately, although it is a new direction, not everything works on this record.  Even though the growling vocals are absent here, you can still tell it is Opeth. I also love and appreciate the homage done to 70s progressive rock. There are definitely great moments on this record.  The problem is the songs themselves are bland. There is absolutely no spice to them. It's difficult to decipher one tune from another. The musicianship itself is perfect, but a soul has flaws. This album lacks soul. And that is a major failing for me. Someone else may be able to appreciate and love this, but there is too much missing in my opinion.  I hope their next effort will impress. Whether they go back to death metal, or continue in this direction, I will be interested.
B005BZQS1E|3.0|Like a train wreck, which I have only seen on the news, it is hard to not watch once you notice it.  Having paid to see it, we had to stick it out. It has some good laughs, but if I had known more about it I would not have bothered.   I can't say I didn't like it... much. It's just that there were a bunch of moments where I was contemplating turning it off, but felt compelled to see what was coming next.  So, three stars because I stayed with it to the end.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Homg, the little frog/monster is so cute. I love this game! How could *anyone* give it 1-star. Thanks for putting this up for free for us Amazon!
B004XNGKBS|2.0|Ap does not accurately copy my handwriting. some words look like lines. why do I have to write so many dang words to give this my review?
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this awhile ago, and have had a lot of fun with it.  there needs to be more levels, though.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I missed it the first time. One of my faves. Love it so much, just pick up and play, no compromise. Loads fast, unlike other reviewers have said. But I have a sgs2, what doesn't load fast in this beast?
B004UID2LC|1.0|great program but latest version broke video playback &amp; download. hoping dev fixes it quickly. been using this program for over a year now...
B0051MKNV8|5.0|A very well done film.  I really enjoyed the twists and the acting.  Intelligent premise and the actors did a great job making the viewers believe the story line.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was amazing... It really looks like a book and doesn't look to bad to display... The movies are great and I love all the extra content it has in the bonus disks.
B0058VW36U|5.0|great time killer, buy it u won't regret it! its a puzzle app but its not to challenging. although some levels are tricky. the great thing about this app is you can skip levels if your stuck and can't get all three stars.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Free today, but worth a dollar any day. Nice polished graphics, sound, smooth game play. This is a little bit challenging at times, not frustrating though. Fun for all ages. If you enjoy games like Angry Birds or Stupid Zombies, this is a great addition to your phone or tablet. EVO 3D user.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is the only app I've ever paid for. the physics are great. omnom is too cute. great challenge for the mind while still fun and addicting. should be 10 stars! &lt;3
0634022296|5.0|Excellent resource for any gigging professional musician. I found it hard to find songbooks of the beatles works, and this book has been a great find. Thanks!
B0057MFA42|5.0|It's been a long wait, but this show is finally available in it's entirety! I've seen clips of it throughout the years, but wow, here it is. Where has it been all these years? Awesome show!  I never had a chance to see Nirvana live, but this is the next best thing, especially if you have a decent home theater setup. I'm not going to break it down, I mean, it's Blu-Ray and the source material has been kept in great shape over the past 20 years, so it looks and sounds amazing; toss out those bootlegs... If you're a Nirvana fan, definitely pick it up, you won't regret it.   Also, I haven't noticed the sync issues that others have reported... have you checked the A/V sync on your receiver/BRD player? Perhaps the timing isn't set properly?
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I heard about this movie before buying it. I bought before seeing it. I am a straight married woman. But I love gay man. They are great friends and I don't see anything wrong with who they want to spend their life with. Because I feel so strong about gay man I knew I would like this movie before seeing it. I wasn't wrong, this is a great love story. Yes I said Love Story. It doesn't have to be about a man and a woman to make it a love story. This movie is about two man who worked together on Brokeback Mountain alone one year. One night they had sex together. One feels like he did wrong and the other is in love. After their job was done at Brokeback Mountain they both went on with their life. Getting married and having children. They both found each other again and every so months they got together to show their love for each other. I don't believe there was any more sex scenes but you can see how much they care for each other. SO NO THIS MOVIE IS NOT A GAY PORN MOVIE. Like someone wrote on here. This is a must see or have movie.
B005NA3B8U|4.0|I have a Motorola Droid 2, and I would love it if this port (and any other titles DotEmu has planned for Android) would have better support for physical input. Simply put, I'm not a fan of shoe-horning touch controls onto games that were meant to be played with buttons.  I have an accessory for my phone called the Game Gripper which overlays a &quot;game controller&quot; on top of my phone's keyboard. However, for this to work, the game would need to support custom remapping of controls, due to what keys the Game Gripper presses.  Additionally, I also have a Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet, which has a full-sized USB port, allowing it to host a USB game controller. If I could work with that, that would be great, too.  Being able to use physical buttons is one of the several reasons I went with Android instead of iOS, and it's a real shame how most developers/publishers ignore us. Even the small-time developers of emulators and such support custom controls!  Aside from that, it's a grat port of a great game.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|It looked like a neat app to try out, but it force closed the first 2 times I tried to start a new (first) note. very dissapointing. :/  Sidekick 4g
B004T6IBNY|1.0|Doesn't work on HTC Thunderbolt. I've tried to re-install several times. Absolutely WILL NOT work. I keep getting error codes.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|The version on Amazon has NOT been updated to fix the issues found that helped this app work with most phones. The current version in the Android Market is 1.2.2. Amazon needs to receive the updated version ASAP!
B005EHNEDO|5.0|It's amazing how effortless it all sounds.  That was my first thought upon hearing the latest addition to Wilco's already lengthy discography.  From a digitized, jagged opener that reminds me of Mwandishi-era Herbie Hancock to the elegant, pastoral closer, this album moves through its sonic peaks and valleys with the natural gracefulness and ease of a band that has really settled into itself.  This is diverse music that takes its time and reveals itself over countless listens, ebbing and flowing through more conventional rock (\\"Standing O,\\" \\"I Might\\"), gentle and thoughtful acoustic-based numbers (\\"Open Mind,\\" \\"Rising Red Lung\\"), and swirling, Beatles-esque pop (\\"Sunloathe,\\" \\"The Whole Love\\"). I recall an interview with Jeff Tweedy after the last Wilco release in which he pointed out that the transitions between the sonic textures were one of his favorite things about the recording as a whole. Those are handled expertly again here, with louder giving way to tranquil in a way that makes both stand out in sharp relief.  Overall this band has gelled as a unit and knows how to incorporate many different influences in a way that sounds wholly unique and of a piece.<br /><br />It's easy to hyperbolize about Wilco both because so many people are doing it and because Wilco has meant so much to me for so long now that the release of each new album has become an event for me. Their albums seem to come along right when I need them to, dropping into my life and helping me put things into perspective.  Nonetheless I will get a bit gushy for a second and say that the first song from Wilco (The Album) really seems to ring true: Wilco loves us, the fans, and that the band respects us enough to give us recordings like this should be all the proof we need. It's senseless to compare this to past triumphs because those are snapshots of where a particular group of Tweedy-led musicians was at in whatever year those albums were released, and don't really say anything about what the band is doing or thinking or feeling in the present moment. Similarly, future albums may or may not build upon The Whole Love's template. The great thing about Wilco is that they love to shift their sound around and provide us with something new and different each time out of the gate.  It's what keeps them interesting and fresh.<br /><br />This album is just a delight to hear, and keeps me eager for whatever is next around the bend from these guys.or thinking or feeling in the present moment.

B004SEUIW4|2.0|First copy ordered did not play on our BlueRay.  Sent it back and received a second copy.  Same results.  Will not play on our Blue Ray.  Also, the jacket does not appear to be an original picture.  Cannot tell if this is just a copied version or original.
0345495004|5.0|This was a most enjoyable novel.  It kept me with it until the end.  The book was not in great shape when received...looked like it had  been used.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|\\"Video game\\" is a medium cursed by its own name. In the first 40 years, what critical achievements have gathered in its top 100 list? Blockbuster action titles (Half-Life), puzzles (Portal), toys (Mario) and tournaments (StarCraft). I love good entertainment. Good entertainment is precious. But in its first 40 years, the world of cinema had already produced Nosferatu, Metropolis, and Grand Illusion. Notice a peculiar trend: they all focus on the human condition.  Imagine, for a moment, if 99.99% of all movies and books focused on entertainment alone. Imagine if the likes of \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" were never filmed and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" never written because the public thought they \\"weren't fun.\\" What a travesty that would've been. Yet this is precisely where the gaming medium has been for the past four decades and God forbid if a game should be anything other than a toy.     Now look at Ico. Like Shadow of the Colossus, it has plenty of engaging gameplay, fantastic scenery, and a haunting atmosphere, although unlike \\"Shadow,\\" it places focus on the human condition. This is a taboo in games because gameplay must always come first -- a juvenile concept preached by those that see the word \\"game\\" in \\"gameplay\\" and think that the two share the same meaning. Ico takes this idea and proceeds to screw it sideways.  Here is a story about adults that want to sacrifice children to save themselves and about children who are willing to sacrifice themselves to save each other. Shadow of the Colossus is also about sacrifice, but it fails where Ico shines when it overlooks a crucial step. It neglects to establish a thriving connection between you and the one you are trying to save. When you labor to exterminate sixteen magnificent giants, your mind will be on how entertaining it is. Yes, \\"Shadow of the Colossus\\" is moving to be sure, but with Ico included in this HD Remastered package, it is as if somebody bundled your favorite Disney film with \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\"  Before I go on: No, I do not think that Ico is \\"the Art of Gaming.\\" Gears of War is art; so is Madden NFL 2004. \\"Art of Gaming\\" is a pompous term which is a synonym for the word \\"pretentious,\\" and Ico is anything but. Rather, Ico is humble. It is shy. Like its two protagonists, it does not want to be noticed. Its vast absence of dialogue in the presence of what is otherwise detailed narrative reminds me why silent films carried so much power, now long forgotten.     Dialogue gives us the illusion that people are communicating. This is a big farce. The truth is of course that a thousand meaningful conversations mean nothing and may not draw two people even an inch closer. Ico slyly asks us, \\"What about holding hands?\\"  The answer is \\"no,\\" of course, but Ico provides a glimpse of what the right answer might be. When Fumito Ueda-san started work in 1998, he had one simple concept: a boy taking a girl hand in hand through a castle. This in itself is a gameplay gimmick until you fill your protagonists with life and then drain life out of everything around them. Now all they have is each other and you believe it.  Another thing you believe in is the world itself. Today, many games try to convince you of this by bombarding the environment with vast detail and purpose, forgetting completely that purpose undermines detail. Ico does something bizarre. It believes that the world it takes place in actually exists. It doesn't need to convince anybody because it already convinced itself. This is best exemplified by the iconic pond under the Windmill, which contains no gameplay purpose and appears only once. Why is it there? Well, to begin with, sometimes water collects in large holes in which you can swim.  On the surface, Ico is a game no different from the rest. You run, you fight, you solve problems. Like all games, it's more akin to sport than art. But when shadow wraiths leap out of the ground, gameplay will be the last thing on your mind. You will not care about \\"sweet moves\\" or other trivial feats that games are so eager to idolize. Your mind will be largely on the companion nearby. This is all the doing of Team Ico's animators and AI designers, who accomplished nothing short of magic when they created Yorda and abandoned motion capture. She pulses with life and if you've studied traditional animation, you will know why.  I should mention at this point that I heard all about this girl well before I played Ico. Popularity always drains away mysteries and their magic and like everyone, I have an adverse reaction to hype. When the game started, I embraced it with snide cynicism. I'd like to say that I maintained it pretty well, too, until Yorda helped me solve a puzzle without speaking, pointing, or motioning. That shut me up.  I first encountered Ico four years ago and did not like it. When the credits rolled, I wanted to throw the controller across the room. I have matured since then. For starters, I understand that Ico is closer to a vivid dream than a story. A story tends to imply that it has another story preceding it and continues with yet another after it is over. In Ico, you experience a brief, otherworldly journey which has no real past and no actual future. And you meet unforgettable characters, but as with all dreams, once you wake up - they will be gone.  ==============================================  If you're disappointed that I didn't review the gameplay then it's only because I can't compete with YouTube videos, which will give you a better idea about gameplay mechanics than all Amazon reviews combined. As for this \\"HD\\" release, what's there to say? You know all of the included changes from reading the marketing specs. You know that \\"Shadow of the Colossus\\" runs at a much better frame rate. If you still can't decide, my recommendation is to rent the collection. Although I have a feeling that if you appreciate thought provoking literature and film, your local neighborhood Game Rental store will never see it again. A pity for them.  In2001, Charles Herold wrote in New York Times that \\"Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments.\\" I recommend you read his analysis of the game, although not before you play it. It is far better to experience magic than to read about it. In the end, I do believe that Ico \\"redefines the boundaries of gaming as we know them.\\" But as Herold said, it is by no means perfect. It is, however, the first step. Let's hope there will be others.
B000RGSOR8|5.0|Absolutely remarkable. I'm glad I had my baseball mit on because I had to catch my brain after she blew it out of my head with her amazing album. Can't wait to see her in October!!!!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Season 3 as well as both previous seasons are amazing. And season 4 is even better than any other season.  This show continues to wow me. I NEVER react out loud while watching tv or movies, but it seems common for me while watching this. I am so grateful that I discovered this show but at the same time it makes me sad because I know it will be a long time before I see anything as good. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this, however you will probably end up buying season 4 as well because you'll be hooked if you aren't already.
0783229526|5.0|Good DVD. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas isnt a movie for everyone. Its a very crazy movie about what happens when people decide to do a lot of drugs for many days
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought the PX21 headset mostly because of its compability with PC, XBOX, and PS3. I actually dont use the headset with anything else than my computer, but its good to know that if i buy a PS3 oneday, ill have a headset thats compadible with that too.  Technically the headset is very good. The soudnt quality is great, the souond correction (chat boost) and volume dials for both game and chat separately work great. Bass boost isnt midblowing, it is very suttle. The expander gives a more realistic feeling to the sound of an FPS game, i dont think its very useful when playing RTS and Roleplayes though.  The only faults i can find are, the quiet but a bit annoying hissing sound the headset makes, even when volume is down to 0. Also, when turning the volume down somehow it stops at somepoint giving you high sounds at all, and boosts bass. May be only my product that has this problem, but it doesnt really matter, because it happens at a volume no-one would really try and listen to anything to.  Id give the PX21's a 8/10. Good quality, nice to wear, at least if you have small ears, but has some technical problems that could deserve a look into at Turtle Beach.
0060557818|2.0|This book was a waste of time. It is the only Gaiman book I've read, but it doesn't belong anywhere near the best fantasy writing available today (like Rothfuss and Martin). The \\"world\\" isn't that great, and Gaiman leaves waaaaay too much unexplained. It also lacks any discernable theme. It kinda reads like a book that was written in one sitting and then never edited.   Gaiman has a decent knack for dialogue, but he woefully lacks the talent to create a story with depth and breadth.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|These are a total waste of money. My first pair I had broke off at the ear because of cheap flimsy design. The plastic is weak and not made to be used by anyone who actually plays games. So I sent them in and after about 3 weeks of emails back and forth I was able to send them in at my expense. At a  cost of 14$ shipping was not cheap, but I wanted my headset back and working and figured it would be okay afterwards. No, I was wrong. I received my seemingly new set from TB and after about a week of use the wire that connects to the headset just fell out of the earpiece. No sound at all. Needless to say I will not be purchasing another set of TB any time soon and would advise against it. the shotty quality is evident once you put them on and you might be better served to spend the extra cheese on some nice ones instead of wasting time and money on these POS. I say this only because I have been through the ringer once before as I had a pair of X1's die on me and they wouldn't fix them. So all that being said, BEWARE OF THESE HEADSETS>
B0058VW36U|5.0|SO EXCITED THIS GAME BECAME FREE APP OF TH E DAY!<br /><br />Owned it previously on iOS, is one of my favorite games!
B0059IVV9M|5.0|Love this! Great music and great songs again. Zach Condon is back with his new CD and it's amazing! Thank you.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|I had tried to connect an Optoma PK-102 pocket projector to my iPad and iPhone using the VGA dongle for the ios devices. The PK-102 did not work with that connection. On a forum somewhere I discovered that this composite cable is what is needed to make that work. And it does. Both the iPad and the iPhone work well when connected via this cable to the Pico projector.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Cool app that works as advertised, but as a couple of other commenters I have bad handwriting which is made worse trying to write with a finger on my phone screen.  Once it shrinks most of my words are illegible... not sure a bigger screen would make much difference for me :O  I'll hang on to it, perhaps I'll find a use for it, even if it's just to impress a friend sitting on the fence about getting a smartphone.  HTC Desire
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This movie has it all  1. Action  2. Drama  3. Romance  Its great for   1. Comic Fans  2. Women  3. Men  4. Children 10 and over
B002I0J5FG|5.0|THe graphical overhaul is amazing. These two games are classics and genuine pieces of art in the gaming genre. I'd highly reccomend this to anyone who played hem before and definatly would for anyone who never played them before.
0385344325|5.0|A dedicated Lee Child fan, I was as eager as everyone else to read Reacher's newest adventure. There was no disappointment for me on any count. Plot, character, and suspense were the usual high caliber. What intrigued me with this book, however, was the fact that I repeatedly noticed that Child's writing is getting better and better. I rarely see this from a serial writer; in fact, the opposite is usually true. His descriptions were more detailed and exciting. He stepped \\"up\\" with some vocabulary choices, and he created depth in some scenes (like the sex scenes) that he usually glosses over. Keep it up, Lee!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I don't play many games on my phone and avoid those with too many controls.  This game uses 1 finger and is super simple to learn, although it quickly gets challenging.  Gameplay reminds me a bit of tic tac toe where you have to think a step ahead to avoid the spider trapping you where he has 2 moves where he can end the round.  My non-gaming friend was able to jump right in this and had a blast :)
0393317552|5.0|I had to read this book for a class back in college, and it was the first time I actually enjoyed such a requirement. Each chapter is extremely interesting in it's own way, I ended up reading the whole thing ahead of time instead of waiting for the weekly chapter assignments. Even for casual reading outside of a classroom, this book is amazing and I'll be reading it again.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I hate doing reviews on movies, only because it's such a personal thing; either people like or hate any particular movie. No room for realistic opinion, on the whole; one may often get a reaction based on cultural belief systems, rather than a simple movie entertainment factor. People will disagree to agree, but it's still a personal thing. Some people simply go Ape and any review gets a real shattering...... So, be it.  This movie was hot on my list after the Stars 1st day release on Netflix. When Amazon had a preorder I can bet I was one of the very first to preorder; because I hit the check availability every day until it showed up!  This was not a disappointment, both series was a wee a bit mixed up, having released the aftermath before the beginning, kinda bent the whole show. :) However, having both Blu Ray disks, sitting down to an action packed adventure was worth it! This is how I imagined the era, so for that it worked very well for me; perhaps not for others.Tops my list for favorites!~ Don't like it, too bad!  Excellent achievement in concept, design and execution...  Cheers
B004ZNARH4|5.0|There is no other word to describe it. This is what happened when I played the blu ray version.  I listen to a little of the stereo mix first and decided ok... let's listen to the quad mix.  And I was charmed. I really was. It reminded me of long ago when I got caught up in the audiophile lifestyle by listening to a friend's sound setup and his copy of the quad version of dsotm. I listen to the whole album.  Then I decided to listen to the 5.1 surround version. Never mind this is the same mix that was on the sacd that I had heard many times before.  I was stunned. I had never heard the album sound so full of life. It literally wrap itself around me sonically and would not release me. I had to sit still until the album played completely thru again. I am sure I would have transcended if the subwoofer had been working.  Now on to the complaint... The second disc was loose in my box and had some light scuffs on it. I would be on the phone complaining to Amazon if had been any of the other discs. This is NO way to pack something I am shelling out big bucks for... If I was not so blown away by the blu ray tracks I would have to take a star away.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|I really hate hip-hop music but was so bored I turned on ABC Family and watched this movie. There is somewhat of a plot and the acting isn't bad.  Briana Evigan (Baby Bear since she is the Daughter of the star of the old TV Show BJ and The Bear) is beautiful and can really dance. The main reason I love this movie is the dance sequences are amazing especially the one on the train and the final part of the movie.  The biggest plus is the actors actually do their dancing and not some dance doubles.
1557427283|5.0|We ordered this book for my sons high school AP English class.  It arrived in perfect condition and very fast ship!
B003PIUC02|5.0|An enjoyable series, another yet to come.  A very good concept, with flawless design and execution. The \\"'Fall of Rome' might well be appreciated in the current climate. :)  Cheers
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've downloaded and played dozens and dozens of Android games. Cut The Rope is probably THE BEST game of the whole lot of 'em. Fun. Unique. Challenging. And a bit humorous with the little critter. This game has almost FIVE stars, and there's good reason for that - it deserves it.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Works well when you feel like drawing your notes. Of course you would only get this app if that is your intention. Anyone who doesn't realize that typing is quicker should reevaluate what they were looking for in a notes app. Needless to say it does drawing notes decently well but the user experience could be more polished. It's great for today's price.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this game months ago and thoroughly enjoy it. It's definitely worth a buck. You can't go wrong if you snag it for free today... just don't let your kid accidentally reset the progress (especially 3 levels away from finishing it with 3 stars on every level!!) or you'll be starting from scratch!
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This is one of the best desktop monitor mounts. I have 3 of them and they all work wonderfully. Very sturdy and all joints can be tightened with an Allen wrench to make them rigid. The only downfall of this device is that it doesnt add much height adjustability. You can raise and lower the monitor but say you want to raise one monitor above another then this is not the device. The LX version of this is different and possibly better but this model here is probably your best deal for the price.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Do not download this game for free today and buy it tomorrow to support the developers of this awesome game. it's worth a dollar and so much more.
B0040JHLBS|5.0|This is the fourth pair of Brooks running Adrenaline running shoes I have purchased over the past few years.  I have considered, and even purchased, other brands over that time, but none of them have come close to being as good as the Brooks.  The Brooks provide better support and comfort while holding their integrity under heavy use longer.
0451228375|2.0|I am 20% through this 1000 page, eagerly anticipated book and am getting bored. I LOVE historical fiction, but there are two big problems with this book. First, it is so much like Pillars of the Earth (fabulous movie) that it's hard not to compare the two. This one doesn't compare favorably because it's largely the same people and the same stories. Second, you can't help but be disappointed when such a great writer fails to do his homework about basic elements of life. Did he ask any female what it was like to lose her virginity? Apparently not because none of these maids gave a second thought about it and just whooped it up like pros. Not many virgins in any time period have first time experiences like those described in this book. I think sex in an area where Follett really failed in his research. Hellfire, brimstone, social pressure, and extreme punishments were powerful deterrents to copulating before marriage, outside of marriage, and with any old body. That's definitely not reflected here. Since relationships are a big part of the forward momentum of the book, it makes it hard for the rest of the stories to stand firmly.<br /><br />Update: Now I am a little more than halfway through the book and I'm done. When the nuns started trekking cross country in search of the Bishop IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE GROUND, I gave up. Really? (sigh) It's very soap opera-ish and not very plausible. If it were a fantasy or romance, it would be forgivable, but that is not what I was expecting or wanting. The characters were also so one dimensional. They never changed, evolved, grew or had any complexity to them. Very boring.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I had it on the iPod and I'm excited to have this game on my Android phone. And for free!!! Can't beat it.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|With much anticipation for a new album from the amazing and talented Lady Antebellum, was well worth the wait. This album is amazing, one you can relate to and lose yourself with. When you hear the words, they are at such a passionate level, you feel yourself imaging the song, or what they felt when writing it, or maybe that they are even talking about something you have felt in that same way, then you add the talent of music behind it and it will heighten your senses and emotions to a whole new level, where you find yourself replaying one song over and over again and it never gets old, or you will hear new parts of the music that you didn't hear the last time you played it. I feel like I can close my eyes, and visually see what your verbally saying, as though I have been picked up and placed in your the songs atmosphere.  This is a CD you can listen to all day every day, wake up singing it and look forward to hearing it again.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|You will enjoy this dvd set as much as the original airing on TV. I have watched it several times. You have to if you enjoy the chemistry between Bones and Booth
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a story! I listened to the Audible version with Jaycee's voice while reading the Kindle edition.<br /><br />I don't want to go into her story but I will say that I admire her courage and strength to get through the past and learn to live in the present. May her future be forever bright, along with her family and friends.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Always see this as a best seller on the android market. Glad I can pick it up for free today. My load times are fine on My Touch 4G with Virtuous Unity.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Most Awesome Box Set..... They added so much stuff that was never heard or seen before...... Well worth the $120 cant wait for the next realease dates...... You will not be disappointed............
B002JIOOB2|5.0|Don't sterotype anyone that buys this set. It is excellent and no one should be ashamed to watch any of the dvds. I watched the show on prime time and enjoyed the weekly suspense so I bought the set. Now others have asked to borrow the dvds and they are on loan. Yes  females, amles and couples have borrowed this dvd set
B004LROMSO|3.0|When I first heard of this my initial thought was that it was from Starz, the same network doing the Spartacus series, so I had very high hopes.  See, for the past three years I've been watching the BBC show, \\"Merlin\\", which is a fine little show about the Arthurian legend (although they've totally buggered the original story into something very different than any telling of it I've ever heard).  But that show is obviously FOR KIDS.  And \\"Merlin\\" is a nice show, FOR KIDS.  I had hoped the one on Starz would be a more realistic, true to the time version.  Sure, there are things I like better about Camelot.  \\"Merlin\\" completely left out Sir Kay, Arthur's brother.  Camelot doesn't make that mistake - and that character is one of the ones you really end up liking.  I have to agree with some of the other reviews here that the show simply didn't go to where it could have.  It doesn't have the gritty realism I was hoping for.  It does, however, have some interesting characters - Merlin, Morgan, Kay, Gawaine and others.  Unfortunately, Arthur is not one of them.  I think the guy they cast for that part was chosen for something he had to do with \\"Twilight\\"????  Sorry, but I never watched any of the Twilight movies, so I'm not sure what he did in them.  Anyway, a show like this really has a problem when it mis-casts its leading man - and they did that.  It's too bad they can't go back a re-do that casting decision before season two starts.  However, because of the good characters they do have, the show still has potential to be something better in the next season.  I hope they get their act together and achieve the potential that's there.  I gave the first season three stars because the first season of a lot of shows is kind of rocky.  Look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Who would have known how great that would become just after watching the first season?  I hope Camelot can similarly grow into its own skin.
B003AXAS60|4.0|I have a toddler who has had Safari the Giraffe for a long time and was given Cookie the dog as a gift because she liked Safari so much, Safari holds up great, but Cookie not so much...I had to throw it away, I wish I had bought a different toy as a replacement but I purchased another Cookie.  The problem is that I had a baby that became a toddler who is still teething.  The nose is a hard piece so just be aware if you are buying this for a child that chews on things that the nose and the fabric around the nose and stuffing is likely to get torn up and become a hazard for your child.  They make plenty of the Boos with soft noses like the Giraffe so there are plenty of cute options out there.  Which you are supposed to watch out for stuff that has hard noses and eyes that can come out with kids anyway, but it was a gift like I said, and she really loved the cute little dog, which is why I replaced it with a new one.

B003O85W3A|5.0|I'm not sure what it is about this album I can't shake. I became a big Arcade Fire fan with Neon Bible and bought Funeral after they started playing \\"wake up\\" for the movie Where the Wild Things Are. As much as I love wake up, the rest of the album just blurred into one forgettable song after another. When Suburbs came out I was luke warm and as much as I loved Neon Bible I was worried Suburbs would be a disappointment like Funeral. After the first listen I decided it was just another OK album from Arcade fire. And then I listened to it again on a long commute between states to a new job in New Hampshire and was struck by how sad the last song was leading back into the first track \\"The Suburbs\\".  Several long commutes later, the Suburbs has become one of my favorite albums. There is just something sad and beautiful about every track on this album that after so many times listening it has become my favorite of Arcade Fire's albums. How often do you reach the end of listening to a full album and the CD player wraps around to the first track and you actually smile when you hear the first track start again?  Favorite tracks: The Suburbs, Ready to Start, Half Light (both), Month of May, Sprawl (mountains beyond mountains)

B005DZMODI|4.0|I guess some people think the blues started with Robert Johnson. Or that \\"the blues\\" is what came out of Chess Records in the 1950s. Or \\"the blues\\" is what Cream recorded. To call this just \\"Dixieland Jazz\\" somewhat misses the mark. As Marsalis explains in the liner notes, Clapton is a walking blues encyclopedia and well versed in the entire history of the blues going back to WC Handy and including all genres and styles. What the two have done here is put together a combo that can play all styles, including Handy style blues (they cover two of his songs), jug band blues, Delta blues, gospel and Chicago blues. The arrangements range to full Dixieland treatment to a mixture of blues stylings. The group covers Layla, and for those who think the unplugged version was blasphemous, you will think this version is an abomination. But I like it and think it's wonderful to listen to a great musician re-imagine one of his signature songs. Taj Mahal joins on two songs, and some reviewers don't get it. Taj is also a blues historian who has not only incorporated Dixieland into his music, but has taken the blues all the way back to Mali and recorded with African musicians. He fits very well here.<br /><br />The performance is presented just as it sounded to the audience. No over-mixing, overdubs or auto-tuning as you typically find in other \\"live\\" recordings. You actually get a sense of the room, something sorely lacking from other \\"live\\" recordings. It takes some getting used to only because you're not used to hearing a live performance recorded in this way. There are some trade-offs, naturally. Clapton's lead vocals on Joe Turner's Blues are nearly inaudible due to the backing vocals. And yes, there's a few bum notes here and there. But life and music can be messy, and that's the beauty of it. It's an old school approach to live recording and fits the genre of the music.<br /><br />I don't listen to Marsalis or Dixieland so I can't comment on the relative merit of those performances. But I can say that Clapton's solos (although few) are among the most inventive I've heard from him in some time. Vocally, he sometimes slips into a growl to lend some misguided authenticity to the song. In one instance he slides between smooth and gruff several times in the same verse! I did not find that appealing and I wish he would have been more selective in how he sang the songs.<br /><br />I like this, but I can't say that I love it. It's interesting and I'm sure I will listen to it occasionally when I want something new yet familiar. Marsalis and Clapton take us through the blues history book in a very entertaining fashion.that Clapton's solos (although few) are among the most inventive I've heard from him in some time.

B0051GY0LS|1.0|I have always admired John Grisham and truly enjoyed all of his books.  I have a hard time believing that he actually wrote himself \\" the abduction\\".  The plot is lame, no suspense whatsoever and uninteresting.  It felt more like reading a young kid's adventure book.    For the first time, I am sorry I bought a book from Grisham.  I hope he writes another one soon to compensate...
0307592839|5.0|Nothing is more familiar to us than the passing of time--and yet who can comprehend it? We're simultaneously aware and unaware of its constant pressure pushing us down a linear passage, and we're often shocked by both its speed and its painful slowness. We can remember our younger years, but also realize time has changed us into altogether different people.<br /><br />Who would dare to write about such a complex issue? Jennifer Egan, in her book A Visit from the Goon Squad, masterfully takes on this task through interwoven stories (ironically told out of chronological order) of various characters who are all affected by time's merciless power. Time, according to Egan, is a goon, and it visits each of us.<br /><br />I can only wish I didn't understand what she's talking about.<br /><br />Egan's use of linking stories is a brilliant means by which to explore the concept of time.* We see characters at different stages and ages, from various perspectives, and we can't miss how time has affected them. For some, time has given healing and hope; for others, apathy; for others, deterioration and death.<br /><br />Interestingly, time--not the goon in the book, but in real life--plays a role even in how we read this book. Five or fifteen years from now when I read it again (which I will certainly do, and probably sooner--as this is now my new favorite novel), my response will be different because, alas, I'll be that much more familiar with the goon and his work in my life.<br /><br />If you have ever looked in the back seat of your minivan and wondered how those children got there, if you've ever wondered how you arrived from point A to point B, if you've ever looked in the mirror and not recognized the person looking back at you--this is a book you will not want to miss. You will be enthralled by the writing, blown away by the point of view shifts that happen as seamlessly as time itself, captivated by the stories, and humbled by a keen new awareness of your old friend Time.<br /><br />*Linking stories is one term used to describe a composite novel, or a collection of short stories that have a collective arc. I happen to be studying linking stories in my graduate studies.a composite novel, or a collection of short stories that have a collective arc.

B001R4MEYS|5.0|Crack the Skye is hands down one of my favorite rock albums.  What I mean by that is it's a CD that I could listen to from beginning to end all day long, and I've had it for over nine months and I still feel that way.  To be honest, I only got on board recently, as I'm not into screaming lyrics all the time.  This album is mostly harmony and metal, traits I love about Alice in Chains and the borderline grunge bands of that era.  I love how all of the members of Mastodon contribute to the vocals in Crack the Skye, and how tight their instrumentals are.  The DVD is surprisingly long and goes into great depth, and it's well worth the extra dollars, but the CD itself, while it's great, is very, very short in duration.  The short duration is a little disappointing after the first listen through, but it's quality over quantity, and sort of refreshing since most \\"albums\\" today are just trying to sell singles.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Give me the original films on Blu-ray. I don't want this at all, but I'd buy the originals in a heartbeat.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|If you go by Amazon's average score alone, you'd think this Blu-ray set caused cancer or something. But that's what happens when you allow angry fans to write uninformed reviews months before the product is actually released. Mind you, there are plenty of sensible, valid complaints to be had about this set. Only one of the six films (Episode III), looks truly amazing. The original films suffer because they're derived from the 2K laserdisc transfers and not the 4K master files. And there are the unnecessary additions to the old films, most notably the terrible Vader \\"dialogue\\" added to the climax of Episode VI.<br /><br />That's just what you have to put up with in this set. If you don't like it, don't buy it. As relatively lackluster as the video quality may be in some cases, it's still certainly superior to past formats. And luckily, all six movies sound amazing. They'll really put your home theater to the test. The bonus features are also robust, featuring a healthy mix of commentaries, retrospectives, and deleted scenes. The latter material alone should more than justify the upgrade for many fans.<br /><br />Yes, Lucasfilm could have done more as far as offering a complete set of bonus features or providing the best possible video transfers for the original trilogy. With the 3D theatrical re-releases coming, it's a safe bet we'll see new Blu-ray editions in the coming years. Hopefully those sets will address the omissions here, and maybe finally deliver HD versions of the classic trilogy in its unaltered state.

A note to the producers.... extra content is lame, you would make a better effort, this movie deserves it

030788743X|5.0|This book might be the best book you read all year, possibly the best book you read all decade.  It's just your typical cyberpunk coming of age love story mystery adventure about online gaming.  The plot is tightly constructed and the story makes you laugh, cry and cheer.  However, the best part of the book is how it weaves and integrates Generation X geek culture throughout the story.  There were major references to my favorite games, video games, anime, books and movies throughout the book.  Seriously, this book was written for uber-nerds like me and it was almost like I had written the words myself.

B0000C4LXG|4.0|This mini-album is way more intimidating than many black/death metal bands today. Maybe because the band members were genuine lunatics.<br /><br />The lyrics are insanely graphic not gonna go into detail but entire songs are devoted to detailed descriptions of necrophilia and dismemberment, maniac sounds like a damn maniac. I don't care how bad he got later on, he was much better than dead or atilla on this particular album as far as sounding scary goes. He doesn't sound like a demon, or count dracula, but he sounds like real human bloodthirsty lunatic that escaped from the psycho ward and got his hands on some recording equipment.<br /><br />And Euronymous....the best thing about his guitar playing isn't actually how skilled he was at actually playing, but how macabre he sounds doing it. He was a master in tinkering with his equipment to find heavy sounding guitar tones. I wish I knew the exact settings he used to get the tone he got in this album. You could play the spongebob theme with the guitar tone used here and it would sound evil due to how weirdly creepy the guitar sounds.<br /><br />And surprisingly, the bass can be heard here. And it also sounds incredibly heavy.<br /><br />And the drumming can be good at times aswell, The album starts off with a nifty drum solo.<br /><br />Some of the standout tracks on this are Necrolust, and Chainsaw Guts****.

It's nice to hear an album  with guest artists that haven't been homogenized by  T-Bone Burnett ! Thank God he's nowhere to be found !! What you get is a  a fun, soulful production by Paul Nelson, one of Johnny's longtime  cohorts in the Blues . He brings out the best in everyone !!! Buy this cd, you'll be tapping your feet, and singing in no time .

It's a bit dated (1970s) so some of the chapters discuss how to memorize long telephone numbers (now with their new area codes!), so those parts are arbitrary. Otherwise the book is timeless and does exactly what the cover states.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|this is a great product. It did what it said it would. great use of GPS. outstanding product. worth 3 dollars.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I give this album a reluctant 3 stars.  If it were a 1-10 scale it's probably get a 6, which would balance out to 3, but other albums I've given 3 I like much better, not all but several.  5 is really not enough for an accurate rating, but it's what I have to work with.  Dream Theater has been one of my favorite bands for a long time, and the band that introduced me to progressive music, then or Rush, which I liked first.  Either way, one of the first progressive rock/metal bands I've ever heard, first metal.  Their 90's stuff along with Six Degrees were all classics, but things started to shift after that.  This is the second in a long string of ok to bad albums by the band.  Now granted I've given passing grades to all of them, but still.  I've had issues with all of them.  Mostly this one it's the tone of the album.  It's a lot mellower, which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, but on here it doesn't really work.  There are only 3 rockers on here.  There are a few songs that are just plain boring.  We get 2 bad songs, which if they were removed I'd like the album much better.  Root Of All Evil 6/10 starts off quiet before becoming a rocker.  Kind of an upper mid tempo song.  The main riff is pretty good.  The problem is this song has no staying power.  I tend to forget it except for the intro, once it's done.  There's just no hook, nothing to keep me coming back.  James sounds good on here.  The song slows a bit after the first chorus.  Also we get parts of the previous songs from Portny's 12 step program in here.  I already know Glass Prison and Dying Soul thank you.  I really don't need to hear parts of them in another song.  I can listen to those songs just as easily.  This song after the first chorus kind of drifts into some sort of bridge that really doesn't go anywhere.  It's not terrible, but it leading to a reprise of the chorus from Dying Soul is too much for me.  If I could edit that out and still have the song sound good I'd do it.  The solo'sdecent  The Answer Lies Within 1/10 talk about a snooze fest.  This is a predominantly piano driven song with if memory serves me some horn playing where the guitar solo should be.  I don't remember if there is any guitaring in this song.  Now I know this song isn't my cup of tea, but did it have to be so boring?  Dream Theater alone has had some good to exceptional piano driven songs, Another Day, Disappear, Through Her Eyes, Space Di Vest one of my all time favorite songs actually, but come on..  They could have done better.  Honestly it's been years since i've heard this song, haven't listened to it since the album came out.  I gave it some time, but it never grew on me.  These Walls 9/10 kind of sounds a bit old school to me.  It's one of those soft verse, heavier chorus.  Love the melody in the chorus.  This is definitely a highlight for me.  There's a nice build up to the chorus too.  I Walk Beside You 2/10 cool intro riff, but that's about all the positive I can say about it.  Really I have no idea why I hate this song so much.  Sure it's cheesy and poppy.  Maybe that's it, but there are plenty of cheesy poppy songs I like.  It kind of has a U2 sound to it.  Mostly it's the chorus that bugs me.  Plus this is like the third ballad in a row, and only 1 was any good.  Fortunately that 1 is awesome, but still.  That doesn't help the fact this song kinda sucks.  On my computer/ipod I inserted Raise The Knife in this song's place, wish they'd just put that song on here instead.  Panic Attack 9/10 is the heaviest song on the album, and one of my favorites, not just because it's heavy, but because it's a good song.  The drums are almost frantic sounding.  There's a nice riff throughout the song.  James's vocals are awesome.  I like the melody during the chorus.  Jordan's playing actually compliments the song, which is the closest thing you'll get to me complimenting him, untill I get to Six Degrees or Scenes...  They definitely named the song perfectly to fit the music.  Actually this is probably one of their heaviest songs overall, thinking about it.  Never Enough 9/10 is another rocker.  This one the guitars are more subdued, muted notes, and we hear piano prevalent throughout the song.  It actually works ok on here.  Love the vocals again.  I know a lot of fans don't care for James's voice, but I think he does a good job.  Nice fast paced drumming.  I wish they'd separated this song from the previous one though, as the rest of the album, Root of all evil excluded are pretty much ballads.    Sacrificed Songs 7/10 uh another political song.  Well..  That was the trend at the time.  the piano part at the beginning was fairly boring.  There was just no emotion to it, and I didn't need the long drawn out news clipping vocal tracks to start the song.  They could have just gone straight into the song.  The song gets more interesting once everything else, guitars, drums etc, kick in, but still.  There's a lack of emotion to this song, that works against it, especially given what they're singing about.  Octavarium 5/10 is the epic of the album.  Honestly this is another I haven't heard in years.  Where I have trouble remembering Root of all evil, at least that song isn't this long, long enough, but still.  I just don't remember this song, so hence the middle of the road rating.  I figure I shouldn't give it a failing grade, because it's really not a terrible song.  I just never found it to be a song I wanted to hear either.  But, most fans seem to like this one above the others on here.  Overall if you're a Dream theater fan, you'll probably like this one.  Most people seem to.  Personally the style and production just made this one of the least enjoyable albums of their career.  Still there are gems to be had on here, so at least listen to it, and decide for yourself.  It's really not a bad album, just the slower parts, most anyways, come off a little emotionless.
B0058VW36U|5.0|cut the rope!!! FINALLY! call me cheap, but I've been waiting for this game to be the faotd for months!! Thank you Amazon!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|So after readings tons and tons of pre reviews ripping apart this release. I have to say after receiving the product I am overly impressed. It's too bad all the fan boys have rated this down just because some minor things have not been fixed. Oh well.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|loved it.  somewhat challenging, but lots of fun.  initial screen and movie were tiny on my xoom, but the game itself filled up the screen.  some background problems, but nothing that affects enjoyment of the game.  first game of this type that I've seen.  loved it.
B004WR125O|3.0|Well it does what it is supposed to do.  However, I've seen the Onkyo nr-809 only get between 37% to 67% connectivity to my router that in the next room.  And that's with the door open.  When I actually get everything installed, I was hoping to have the router a bit further than that. But it's not looking promising.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game runs very well on my Droid X, unrooted of course. There is some delay loading the game, but it is loading a good amount of resources.  There are seven worlds and twenty five levels per world. Each world has a unique feel to it and special features, like magic hats tht make the candy go in one hat and out another, or spiders that try to eat the candy.  Even at 99&cent;, the game was well worth the price I paid. Today it's free, so definitely get it.

B005DR64OQ|4.0|There's something oddly quaint about watching a movie like Trespass in this day and age. The thriller, starring Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, is a perfectly self aware piece of entertainment with no greater ambition in mind than to just give the people a good old fashioned white knuckler, and to hell with all that CGI, shaky cam nonsense. It's about time. Trespass truly is the perfect sorbet for those wishing to cleanse the enamel-stripping, syrupy sweetness of summer from their palate. While still a Hollywood genre picture top to bottom, Trespass feels so far removed from the past season's onslaught of absurd bombast (which I'm not ashamed to say was pretty awesome) that it feels as refreshing as a crisp autumn breeze.   The story opens with Kyle, a spitfire diamond broker played by Cage in what may be his most convincing everyman role to date, returning to his opulent gated home with an attaché case ironed to his wrist. Apparently this is all routine for Kyle who, after casually greeting his lovely wife (Kidman) and dodging an argument with his precocious teenage daughter, Avery (Miss Liana Liberato, one to watch), deposits the case safely into his office's fittingly high-end wall safe after uncuffing himself. The household is quiet and mostly empty. The wife feels her dwindling beauty goes unnoticed by her ever-busy husband, the daughter feels trapped within her own house and just wants to party it up with older boys. So, aside from the affluence, we have ourselves a pretty average family dynamic rife with tensions both unspoken and exhaustively discussed (by the daughter).   Director Joel Schumacher frames these early scenes with an almost Spartan efficiency, drawing attention to little things that  the audience just knows will soon become key pieces in a chaotic game. Schumacher knows what the people show up for, and he wastes not a moment in setting up Kyle's home as a ground zero waiting to happen. And soon enough, some questionably uniformed police officers arrive at the front door and... insist on coming inside.   Without giving too much away, Kyle's safe becomes the trespassers' center of attention and what ensues is a battle of wills and wits, with Cage supplying the will and Kidman the wit. The antagonists of the film become surprisingly layered in their characterization, though sometimes succumbing to clumsy archetypes, they provide the story with an invaluable dose of unpredictability as their hazy motivations and plans are slowly unraveled. The film never gives away too much to soon, always keeping a card or two under the table, and allowing the audience to pile on questions as to how it's all going to play out. The movie is not above telling the audience outright lies, but the ploy works for the most part, saving one last \\"ahah!\\" moment for the end.   The trespassers and their victims are all played expertly, with no glaring weak links in the cast. Kidman's role is on the thin side, but she keeps a level head amidst the chaos and convinces in her \\"mama bear\\" moments. Cage's character is saddled with some strange motivations, but he delivers on portraying a man who acts far more in control than he actually is. He also gets a fine monologue, punctuated by fits of stressed snorting.   The surprise standout of the cast is Cam Gigandet, one whom I'd previously written off as a wooden pretty boy. He convinces as a deeply conflicted thief, torn between allegiances as events teeter out of control. The entire motley crew of thieves is well cast, and though their lack of professionalism as criminals is at first off-putting, as the situation escalates their in fighting and instability only adds to the tension so expertly arranged by Mr. Schumacher.  The camera work is solid across the board, making even Kyle's massive estate feel stiflingly claustrophobic. When things (inevitably) escalate to violence in the climax, it is all shot carefully and with urgency, never devolving into a chaotic mess. Set design also deservesspecial recognition, as the house looks both realistic and ravishing, even as it disintegrates around the cast.  Though it bears all the markings, Trespass does not feel like a modern Hollywood film, perhaps because the director is still caught in his own 90's style filmmaking  sensibilities. Regardless, the film is refreshing not because of innovation, but because it is a throwback to a time not so long ago when the script and the actors were the most important elements in crafting a good crowd pleaser. This is the right kind of movie at just the right time; sandwiched comfortably between the arduous spectacle of summer and the equally arduous pretension of award season. While at the end of the day, Trespass is no more than a good flick, sometimes though, that's more than enough.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|First off let me say - #imabzzagent and receive Samples and coupons and hopefully Jono will send me a copy of these to check out! However I have not received anything for this review I'm just an avid fan of the saga! Now- I can't wait to get a copy of this I have watched episodes I.V., V., V.I., hundreds of times since I was a youngling, and the newest films just as many times since their release! Recently I used the force to convince my own padawans to sit still for hours upon hours an watch all six movies that's not easy to do with twin 4 yr olds believe me! Oh and they are girls!! And now they have no interest in their cartoons anymore, star wars are the go to movies! And I think these will be a perfect addition because my one year old will be next in line and the discs I have will be burnt up by then! I have to add that my girls have decided they want to be  Queen Amadala, and Princess Lea for halloween, so I'm thinking my one year old son will make a great yoda!!!
0345529057|5.0|like a title says, for 20$ you'll get four awesome books and enjoy for next few months...i have read just first two books, but i no doubt that all of them are great. already thinking of purchasing the fifth book :)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|first off let me say this was a great past six days on dialysis. I enjoyed following the whole story to the end  I see nothing wrong with either the movie or the packaging (the disks are made stonger then most people would belieave)<br /><br />yeah, there were a couple added scenes and there was a change made to the ending of return of the jedi, but i think it is all BETTER then the original.<br /><br />grow up, children. it's a movie that i grew up on and change is for the better. seeeesh
0446547603|5.0|Interested in reading a love story with some action? Well, Nicholas Sparks has surely done it again! Nicholas Sparks has a multitude of love stories which contain a great amount of action, but none of them can equal how great Safe Haven turned out to be.   In Safe Haven, a young woman named Katie finally sums up the courage to leave her abusive, alcoholic husband to try and make a better life for herself, in which she can find true happiness, but alone. Unfortunately, her husband Kevin is a cop gone rogue, who makes it quite difficult to escape, but nonetheless she succeeds.  Although she wanted to start a new life alone, she comes across a man named Alex and his two wonderful kids, whom appreciate her in every single way. Throughout time, she begins settling down and accepting that she is not meant to be alone, while her husband continuously keeps searching for her, becoming more desperate and dangerous because of the lack of evidence of her whereabouts.   Safe Haven keeps readers wanting more the deeper they delve in. It keeps readers on edge and it is completely unpredictable. Although Nicholas Sparks is known for his sappy love stories that seem unrealistic, Safe Haven is definitely realistic. This novel will definitely touch a multitude of hearts in many ways, just like it touched mine.   I do not regret spending a penny on this book, and if I had the sufficient time to read this novel multiple times, I certainly would and I would not get bored. I am usually one of those who enjoy taking small little peaks to see how books end, but I strongly recommend for those who are like me to refrain from doing this. The ending is, without a doubt, worth the wait!
B0057FWSQ2|5.0|This CD is awesome!  Patti at her finest....  Especially LOVE her version of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit!\\"  Highly recommended!!!  Buy it today!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a great lil time waster.  Well worth a dollar and unbelievably is free for today only.  Wow.  Thanks to the devs for bringing this game to android phones.
B0057O6IDW|4.0|Not all of Fulci's films are amazing....in fact some of them are stinkers.  However, this film stands out as one of the genre's best.  I HIGHLY recommend also checking out Zombie (a.k.a. Zombi 2), The Beyond or City of the Living Dead.  These are all classics that stand alongside horror's finest.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I am really pleased with my Plantronics Voyager Pro series Bluetooth headset. Normally I just keep my headset in a shirt pocket. But this device is larger than most of my other Bluetooth headsets and, frankly, I just want to make it last - and, considering the low price, this is a \\"why not?\\" kind of buying decision.<br /><br /> It is a very nice little case. The quality of the material is higher than I would have expected. I can't tell if it is leather or something that came out of a test tube. It feels good and that's the important thing. The sewn seams are nicely done. The interior is some kind of soft fabric-like material.<br /><br /> The case is formed to hold the Plantronics snugly. The design of the front allows you to get the headset in and out quickly with a minimum of hassle. The flap secures with a magnetic closure which offers a reasonable degree of security against accidental opening. Personally, I would have preferred a solid snap or Velcro, but the magnetic closure will do the job.<br /><br /> There's a belt clip on the back. It's a spring clip and will fit a 1-1/2\\" belt, but I think with any degree of moving around, walking, sitting down, getting up and the like, it could work itself off the belt. I would definitely have preferred a more robust snap or Velcro closure here, even if it made the case more expensive.<br /><br /> Overall, particularly at this price point, this is a nice little case for protecting your Plantronics Voyager series headset. Pretty good design and excellent construction.<br /><br />Jerry
B000WMEAKC|4.0|Ryan Tedder didn't completely grab my attention back in 2007. I mean I loved \\"Apologize\\" cause it sounded nothing like anything on the radio at the time but \\"Stop & Stare's\\" chorus threw me off and I heard it so much that I didn't care to know them up close as a band. But this man is smart. He seems like he's watched all of the hitmakers from the past couple of years, learned what they knew and took it up a notch with his band, OneRepublic for this able record entitled [[ASIN:B000WMEAKC Dreaming Out Loud]]. The track \\"All We Are\\" has a Coldplay-like chorus with identical-sounding guitar work that will prove just that.<br /><br />The music on the record is mostly rock-based with bright, poppy hooks and shining details into Tedder's life at a point before he broke good into the industry. Most of the songs shine like a lighter in the night with tons of sparkling piano pieces and guitar-wrapped goodness, but my favorite tracks are the highlight \\"Someone To Save You\\", the heartbreakingly beautiful \\"Won't Stop\\" on which Ryan's falsetto sounds identical to Justin Timberlake's, \\"Prodigal\\" and the piano-led \\"Goodbye, Apathy\\".<br /><br />You'd be doing yourself a favor if you got this album if you haven't already but if not then download these few tracks.<br /><br />4.2 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Won't Stop\\"<br />\\"Someone To Save You\\"<br />\\"Prodigal\\" &<br />\\"Goodbye, Apathy\\"<br /><br />HONORABLE MENTION:<br />\\"Apologize\\" (without Timbo)
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the most addicting game I have ever played.  I bought it on android market a while ago and I still consistently play it.  It is a must have game on any android device!
0307595579|5.0|This is by far one of the best series I have ever read to date. It has a mix of everything in these books. From mystery, to sex, crime, murder, escapes, and government conspiracies. Read the books and don't just watch the movies, since they leave out many scenes that I felt were important to the plot.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|There is nothing wrong with this version of the film.  The second disc is unnecessary unless you are a real SciFi fan and need more fix.  The quality of the sound and picture is clear and excellent.  A one disc version would probably be adequate for most.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|i loved this product in my ipod touch 4g and in my nokia e71, it was perfect, even though it starts to wet REALLY dirty and kind of yellow/brown with not more than a month old, once i got my iphone 4 that same day i order my invisible shield for it, when i finally get it (i'm not in the states) i applied it to my phone and give some hours for it to stick well, the only used it for texting and didnt touch it much, for a couple of weeks it go ok it looked right and love it as in my other devices, the about in week 3 i take it out of my pocket and it was almost entirely peel of my device!!! i didnt believe it, put it on again and as soon as i get home take out the liquid it came for for clean it and apply it again, the same process and almost everything ok, no more than a week later the same but this time with both sides!!!! didnt believe it, contact zagg customer service and told them about the issue and that it also happened to the one i bought with mine for a friend (white iphone 4) and that it was dirty to and make my friend iphone look brown, told me that have to register product, ok, also asked about it falling of b/s also read that many people have the same issue, asked if it was because of the chmical the glass have for not scratching and said that it was it, and have to let the shield dry for more than 48 hours!!!! let get serious we all work, study or use it the whole day, no one s going to let it dry for that long...
B0058VW36U|4.0|This app needs to come with a 12 step program. Simple but totally addictive and easy to play. It fits the screen nicely Nd doesn't beat you up with cuteness although there is some present.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game is fun and just challenging enough to keep it interesting, but not so hard as to be aggravating. I am SO happy to see it as the FAOTD!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Received product within the time stated at time of purchase.  DVD arrived in new condition, with no defects.  I am always satisfied with products bought through Amazon.com and their sellers.
B005NA3B8U|4.0|This game takes me back to the day when I was a kid feeding the arcade version of this with quarters. This port over to the Android is very good. The game was hard on the arcade version and is the same for the Android.  Steering the ship is alot faster than the real game because you use your finger on the screen where on the arcade you actually had a joy stick and the movement speed was predefined on the arcade. I have an Asus Transformer tablet and found the best way to play this game is to have the tablet flat or slightly inclined on a table and than to play since all the controls are on screen - as oppose to holding the tablet in my hands and than trying to control the ship from the on screen controls.  Over all a good game and well worth the .99 cents for the game!
B00006LFGD|5.0|I have some of these duets on her older vinyl albums but not all of them, it's nice to have them all on one CD.  The only one that's not so great is the one with Don Johnson, his voice is pretty thin.  If I were to buy all the CD's of the vinyl albums I have I'd have to sell my house.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My favorite game on Android! Now, only wish I hadn't already paid for it. One of the best FAOTD I've seen Amazon offer.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I have been hearing what some have been saying about the new Opeth, and it really makes me laugh. Opeth is always moving in a different directions, and with this record they have bravely done so by somewhat abandoning their 'metal' sound.. whatever that means. Just listen to this record, give it time to resonate with you. From my ears,  this the most inventive record the band has released since Blackwater Park- and I am stunned/amused that so many poser metal kids are instantly bashing it for lacking screaming vocals and being so proggy. I mean, if you don't like it, you don't like it.. but give it a chance. Do you really want Opeth to put out another typical Opethy record.. where is the fun in the that? This record will definitely be looked back on positively, since the band refused to stay inside the box where they were hailed as kings.. and put out a kick-ass record. This is why Opeth is so loved.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is super fun, and challenging, in which allows for hours of fun and frustration! Nonetheless, fun, fun, fun and more fun!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|My initial thoughts when hearing about this album was: I know Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa both has a great big set of b@lls and a lot of talent - but to handle 10 classics like these, really is a big mouthful. Not only are the originals all killer, but some of the songs have also been covered by many greats before them. So would these two artists really be able to add anything new? The answer is a loud and clear \\"YES!\\". Even a song like Etta James' \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" which I've heard many others do before sounds unique here. Joe's guitar-playing is out of this world and Beth Hart ... oh my God ... Beth Hart proves herself to be the best singer of our generation - hell - most generations. This is a must have for anyone who likes rock, blues, soul ... actually: Anyone who likes music.
B005EHNMWM|5.0|So.. I personally felt that Wilco's last effort 'Wilco, The Album', was a step backwards for them. With this record, I feel they have taken two steps forward. This is on par with Summerteeth and Yankee, really great songwriting!
B004XNGKBS|4.0|I like the export and share feature. it'll even send to facebook. I do find the swype keyboard way faster for note taking but this its neat and fun to use.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|For a Bronte purist this adaptation will not make them happy (see the 1 star reviews for proof).  I am not so much of a purist that I could not enjoy this movie.  Of all the adaptations I've seen, this is by far the best, including the most recent release in 2011.  This one beat that by miles.  As one reviewer said, some of the dialogue was changed, big deal.  The story line and the thoughts and feelings it evokes from the book, is here in this movie.  And I take exception to one (1 star) reviewer who said that if we like this movie then obviously we don't know the book, or have respect for Ms. Bronte.  That's quite presumptuous.  I loved the book, I love all Ms. Bronte's work and have a great respect for her.  But I'm not so tight-laced and pompous that I could not allow myself to sit back and enjoy this wonderful movie.  To those who've read the book but have not yet seen this movie.  Please don't be put off by the reviewers who trashed it and allow them to decide if you will like it or not. Watch it and decide for yourself.  This is a wonderful movie, well acted, and well put together.  Extreamly close to the book itself (with a few exceptions).  I wish I could give it 20 stars.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The gameplay is simple to pick up, the graphics are cute, and it is so satisfying to feed the little green guy.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Oh boy, I coundn't wait any longer for this to come out! It finally showed up at my door yesterday afternoon, and I settled in,headphones at the ready,and dove in. And, the verdict is..... one of the most impressive reissues I've ever had the pleasure of owning. The 2011 remaster is very good-very clear,and not compressed to death, as some remasters have been done. The live disc is also very good-I love the audience reaction as the sound collage of 'Speak To Me' spins around Wembley Pool. (Too bad this isn't in 5.1). The main reason for buying this, for me,was the original 4.0 quad mix. Oh my goodness,did they do a great job on that!!!! Hearing that took me back to high school,when a buddy of mine had the quad 8-track,and we played that to death!    All of the additional material on here is very cool-I particularly enjoyed the concert films(my fave is the first On The Run from the British '74 tour),and putting the original '73 mix on the Blu-Ray is a welcome addition. I haven't got to the unreleased CD (#6) yet-from what I've read so far,it sounds a treat!   A note on the packaging-when I opened the box up,at the bottom of it, 2 of the 4 discs were loose,as some have posted here. I think I got lucky,though,as those discs have very light scratches on them,and they all played fine. I took 2 double thin jewel cases I had left and put the discs in them.Glad the Blu-Ray and #6 have their own sleeves.    Anyway, this package is very comprehensive,very entertaining, and very much worth the price! Can't wait for 'Wish You Were Here'!
B005C5A6C0|5.0|On early listens seems like the best machine head album since burn my eyes. Follows on from the blackening and definitely has a similiar sound, but overall sounds more like what drew me to machine head in the first place.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Bought it months ago but it was worth it. Be sure to grab it if you haven't already. Its fun and well made.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|I saw this in the theater with high expectations and hated it. However once I got over the disappointment, I was able to recall portions that were funny. This eventually trickled down to the must see this scene again and I purchased it. Accept it for what it is and have fun.
B002ZBT84G|2.0|I never knew Gil as a spoken word artist, I knew him as a soul singer. Songs like the revolution will not be televised wqas the closest I'd heard but even that has a nice funky rythm and flute in the back.  There is no music here. There is no singing. There's deep bass, gong hits... bunch of crap if you ask me. The words are pretty poetic... but really nothing groundbreaking for me.   Severely disappointed. Get the band out, perk up, and sing.  It's a shame Gil's life has spiraled so far down...I feel like people are rating this album highly out of pity almost.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I have been a fan of Lady A since I heard Love Doesn't Live here, partially because Hillary Scott looked cute in the video and she has gotten hotter.  Their sound is absolutely amazing.  Each album they seem to get better and with each album there is at least one song that I relate to.  For lady antebellum, lookin' for a good time, need you now perfect day, Own the Night, Own the Night.  What I liked about this song is the experimentation of instruments by dave heywood, and his strumming of the mandolin adds to the song, but also the blending of vocals by charles and hillary are awesome.  Then there is Friday which harkens back to lookin' for a good time, and it was great to hear songs written by rose falcon.  With music like this I will continue to be a fan.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Surprisingly good keyboard with a keymap that is good for working with terminal. Much nicer to use on smaller screen phones than smartkeyboard and I like it when it can predict artist names when I search in mog or move music.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|I am a huge Michael Connelly fan - esp. Haller stories - but this movie, despite the great cast just didn't carry the story.  McConaughey is not the right guy for Mickey.  Close but does not do the book any favors.  If you haven't read the books, go ahead, it'll be fine.  If you have, oof.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Extremely useful utility.  Very straight forward and easy to use.  I have found it perfect for transferring over roms and pictures and music without needing a usb cable.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is an inspiring and wonderful movie. I recommend it to all families. It is the story of courage and over-coming hardships through the strength of the Lord.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My kids and I really like playing this game though they find this game easier to play than I do. Highly recommended.
B001IF252C|1.0|I realize that in the fine print Apple probably says that this device is only meant to work with THEIR monitors, but it's just astounding to me that they would do this. I have a Dell 30\\" monitor that i love (matte screem yay!) and with this adapter I have to unplug it and plug it back in several times a day. On top of that, it seemed to get worse with the new Air i bought (thunderbolt). sigh. ill just shut up and take it from Apple again.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|It should be noted that with Amazon's \\"other viewers frequently bought\\" segment that along with \\"The Tree of Life\\" \\"Horrible Bosses\\" and \\"Transformers\\" was also purchased. It says a lot about who would want this film in their collection. Many of the reviews here are as puffed up as the film. And while it is a wonder to behold, you can throw just about any idea at it and it'll stick. The finale of the film reveals how lost the director is with the material. He wanders around as aimlessly as all those people on the beach (and for much too long).
B001MCXLW4|5.0|I don't know if I can begin to express just how good this 1965 album is. It is surely my favorite blues-rock album. There's a great mix of music too : raukous driving numbers and down-tempo blues as well. It is truly a shame this band didn't stay together longer but thankfully they left us this masterpiece.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|Whether or not you are a risk taker or afraid of heights, you've got to see Man on Wire. It is a documentary about fearless Pilippe Petit, the famous French tightrope walker who pulled of a stunt walk from the top of the World Trade Center in 1974. With the help of his brilliant, loyal friends and a great deal of time planning out the physics and logistics, he achieved fame and now fortune.<br /><br />The story is magically told by each of the real life characters who played a role in the actual WTC stunt. Some 35 years after the event, they are still emotional when they talked about how they pulled it off. My family really enjoyed this, and so will you.
B0058S0OMS|2.0|If Universal would of got their act together and removed the specks and dust pops then this picture would of been great! This is nothing more then laziness on their part. I will say that this is still worth getting for the 'Terror in the Aisles' documentary never before released on dvd. It's pretty sad that the Halloween 2 dvd never had these dust scratches but the blu ray does! How is blu ray suppose to stay on top with all the mediocre releases they have put out. If I just bought blu ray and saw this picture next to the blu ray of Christmas Vacation I would of said I was ripped off to no end! Both these pictures are examples of releases to worth buying as picture quality especially in High Def! Disappointing Universal... without Terror in the Aisles I would want my money back!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Jim Carrey stars as Scrooge and also plays the roles of the spirits - past, present and future.  Rather than his usual, silly style of acting, and what I refer to as \\"overacting,\\" he does a serious, Oscar-worthy job here. The film was created using stop-motion animation, similar to \\"The Polar Express.\\"  It is like combining reality with fantasy resulting in mesmerizing characters. It must have taken a really long time to make this movie. I cannot even imagine what that process is like!<br /><br />What I love about this version of A Christmas Carol is that it is quite true to Charles Dickens' original story.  Carrey portrays the misery and unparalleled nastiness of Ebeneezer Scrooge perfectly. That combined with the magic of 3D makes for a most extraordinary movie-going experience. For a Miami girl like me, it was a true pleasure being snowed upon! This animation makes you feel as if you are Scrooge himself, flying with the ghosts, running from fear and being overcome with regret. There are many creepy scenes, and for that reason I say this movie may be too scary for very young children.<br /><br />The only thing I was not crazy about was a scene where Scrooge is frantically running through the streets, being chased by a dark carriage. The story line here seems to go on and on, and just when you feel relieved that it is over, the creepy carriage reappears a few more times. It did not make a lot of sense to me.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I asked myself, \\"What is it about these classic, overly familiar stories that keep us coming back for more?\\" I think the answer is that we love what we know, yet we want to experience familiarity in original ways. Does that make any sense to you? The fact that Scrooge, a totally unlikeable, unfeeling human can face his own cruelty, be filled with regret and then change, gives us all hope for ourselves and others.<br /><br />What if you came face-to face with the spirits of your past, present and future? What would you see? What would you want to change?
0896898288|5.0|well this book was a gift so i felt like i had to try and i am glad i did i dont have a computer so<br />dont laugh but i put a piece of paper on my computer screen and copy the templates cut them out and re copy them on oak<br />tag i had so much fun making this quilt keeping all my friends up dated on how many where are done<br />i finished it today it took about 4 months time wise .i will be looking at other Laurie aaron hird books<br />i wish i could add a picture to this i am so proud of my self so thanks Laurie and Joan my friend who got me the book<br />i can understand why people had a problem with one template on each page the cost was to much for me and staples wouldnt<br />print it out any way so i did it my way.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I don't usually read other reviews of books and movies before I write one myself. But I was so impressed with Despicable Me, I had to read what others had to say about it. The thing about reviews, in my opinion, is that reviewers often over analyze movies. What is the point of dissecting an animated movie made for kids? It's okay to say that you just really liked a movie because it made you feel good.<br /><br />I read that the movie copies other movies, has stereotyped characters and does too much to try to make you love it. As for me, I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT. I don't care what the producers borrowed from other movies, if in fact they did. And I am so glad they did too much to try to make me like it. Simply put, this movie is adorable. I smiled a lot, giggled and was charmed out of my seat.<br /><br />The action-packed story is about a funny-looking, Russian-accented villain named Gru (Steve Carell), who tries to outdo another villain, named Vector (Jason Segel). Gru has flashbacks about his disapproving mother (Julie Andrews) while he plot to steal the moon. The story involves 3 cuter-than-cute little girls and a whole bunch of tiny pill-capsule-looking creatures, who work for Gru in his basement laboratory. The characters in the movie are all either odd looking or darling cute. If you are sensitive to overweight people, you may be slightly offended by some of the obese characters, many of whom are mean. But you'll have to admit they are mesmerizing to watch - especially villain loan shark Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett) with his triangular-shaped head and mushy, southern-belle-talking Miss Hattie (Christen Wiig) from the adoption agency.<br /><br />The youngest of the three girls in the movie, Agnes (Elsie Fisher), is so charming, she will melt your heart. Her voice and facial expressions are darling. And the little creatures who work for Gru generate a whole lot of laughter from the audience.<br /><br />In the theater, when the movie was over, everyone in the audience clapped and cheered. One boy got up and danced through the credits. That's how I know it was a great movie. And unless you have no heart or are one of those over-analyzing critics, you too will cheer when you see delightful, Despicable Me.d danced through the credits. That's how I know it was a great movie. And unless you have no heart or are one of those over-analyzing critics, you too will cheer when you see delightful, Despicable Me.
