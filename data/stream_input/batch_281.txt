B00005JL78|2.0|I read the back cover of this DVD in the video store, saw the comparison the critics made to \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and instantly wanted to rent it... It's no \\"Raiders,\\" let me be the first to say it...<br />The first complaint I have is the visual quality of the DVD. Was it me, or was the movie filmed with a blue filter over the camera lens? Also, at times it seems like the editors of the film forgot to reset the contrast on brighter scenes. At times, the sun shines out everything on the screen (what's funny is that the oval-shaped digital lens flares are caustically visible - probably cgi lens flares at that!), and some dark scenes are too dark to view. Very strange. There's also a general lack of color in most scenes (mostly just blue); I'm still trying to figure out if this is an artistic approach to sci-fi films which depict the future, or if it is just poor cameras/film/cgi.<br />My next complaint is the rating. This film evokes VERY strong images and emotions, probably too many for a PG-13 rating. I was very disappointed this film isn't rated \\"R\\" (I wouldn't have rented it if that were the case, I have a child at home). It definitely pushes the envelope (even at the very beginning of the film, images of graphic adultery and brutal murder are introduced), so if you're queesy or have children at home, take my advice and just see something softer or nothing at all.<br />My next complaint is about some of the problems in the story. A) Why don't the pre-cogs see Burgess' murder of the federal agent sent to watch over precrime? B) If Anderton was disavowed, why do his old eyeballs still open doors and allow him and his wife entrance to the \\"temple\\" and the prison holding areas? C) If Agatha and the twins' precognitive powers are symbiotic, why can Agatha still \\"see\\" the future when she is removed from the \\"temple\\" (where the twins remained) while she's with Anderton? D) Why were the police officers tardy when Anderton \\"killed\\" the individual set up to look likehis son's abductor?<br />All in all, you may want to think twice about this film. I'm very disappointed.
B000001FI7|5.0|Portisheads' debut CD, Dummy, is a classic. Filled with heart-wrentching grooves and beats - this CD is one of my most played CD's that I have. Beth Gibbons' voice is just so soothing yet invigorating, it's amazing how she can pull these songs off. My personal favorites off the CD are Only You and Glory Box. This CD is a mandatory for any trip hop fans. It never goes old.
0743201140|2.0|this is a fine book for those who've never done a self analysis course or personality test.  unfortunately, that's all this really is and the multiple references to sales and the word &quot;empathy&quot; make it clear that the authors were lazy in their providing the depth that this topic deserves.  &quot;now, break the rules&quot; was infinitely better than this half written effort to make more money.
B000003TSP|5.0|Portisheads' self titled 2nd disc (shouldn't it be the other way around?) is fantastic. The first single &quot;Cowboys&quot; is something very different than what you would expect, it's one of my favorites. The way the guitars overload the track with strange sensations is a wonderful turn around from the relaxation period in Portishead's career. This CD is something you can really get excited about. One of the CD's masterpieces is &quot;Roads.&quot; Now this song always gets to me, it makes me cry everytime. You have to hear this track, its so impactful, one can only imagine where Beth gets these lyrics... Download or buy it, As long as you hear it - its all good. My other favorites off the CD are Western Eyes and All Mine.
B00004T0P1|5.0|This is a Disney score!! It beats the Disney scores of the past hands down and takes on a life of its own. James Newton Howard adds to the beautiful scenery of the animated film and the relationships between the dinosaurs. The main theme is a marvelous orchestral and choral masterpiece that will remain a classic for years and years to come. &quot;The Egg Travels&quot; starts the soundtrack with the majestic main theme that really does leave you breathless, with a full orchestra and an African choir. Howard uses vocalist Lebo M and a wide selection of percussion instruments to accompany the scenes of the African plains. Solid action music in &quot;The End of Our Island&quot;, &quot;The Carnotaur Attack&quot;, and &quot;Kron &amp; Aladar Fight&quot; contain outstanding percussion and brass exclamations that really explode. &quot;Raptors/Stand Together&quot; contains a joyous brass motif toward the end of the track and &quot;Aladar and Neera&quot; contains a delightful romantic theme. &quot;Epilogue&quot; lays out the main theme one last time with a powerful and joyous reprise. I think James Newton Howard should continue scoring Disney movies because he has a real talent for it. Just listen to this and try to tell me otherwise.
0425107469|5.0|I very much enjoyed Watchers.  I couldn't put this book down! I fell in love with Einstein, the dog with human intelligence.  He is what we all wish to see in our pets.  The characters worked well together,and the anticipation/chase for The Outsider was thrilling.  The only thing I would change about this book is that I don't think Vince gets what he deserves the way I think he should get it.  His character was so arrogant that I think his out was too easy. Overall, I highly recommend this if you like to be absorbed in your books.
B00005JKNC|3.0|A surprisingly good performance from Jim Carrey, a heart-warming story from Michael Sloane, and some beautiful direction from Frank Darabont are undermined here by fatally languorous pacing.  Just as in \\"The Green Mile\\", Darabont gives us way too much time to think about what might happen, and given it's such an old-fashioned story you can easily work it out.  Of course, movies aren't always about twists and surprises, but when you find yourself predicting it shot for shot and anticipating dialogue line for line by the end of the first half hour, there's something seriously amiss.  It isn't helped by Mark Isham's insistently saccharine score washing over every scene, relentlessly reminding you that every second moment is meant to be \\"achingly emotional.\\"  It's almost as if they don't trust the actors or the script.  Ironically, the musical safety net just forces us out: we're never allowed to fall into the story, to forget for a moment that it's a movie we're watching and feel things out for ourselves.  Quite simply, it never gets real.  The result is film which feels artificial, an academically interesting, intertextual, introspective Capra homage at best.  And as much as we love Capra, there's a reason they stopped making films like his: cinema has moved on.  It doesn't mean audiences are any more or less sophisticated these days.  It just means they have been taught to have different expectations.  And while filmmakers shouldn't pander to those, they ignore them at their peril.  It's a shame this film isn't better, because there's a really good story here - an important story about patriotism, freedom, American democracy, and the kind of state-sanctioned lunacy inflicted in their name.  But as presented, \\"The Majestic\\" makes them seem like antiquated heirlooms of a fondly remembered age - notions we can take out, dust off, briefly smile at, then just as quickly forget.
B00006LLNU|5.0|It's not exactly an easy task to describe Icelandic band Sigur Ros' latest record. For one, it doesn't have a title, other than \\"( ).\\" \\"( )\\" also has no linear notes whatsoever, giving us no song names, or any references to the musicians, engineers and psychiatrists who appear on it. What's more, the lyrics, which are written half in English and half in Icelandic, are sung mostly in an echo-drenched falsetto that makes Jeremy Enigk sound like Paul McCartney. <br />Then again, no one ever understood Michael Stipe or Kurt Cobain. And the Beatles did the same sort of disappearing act on the White Album. And while we're at it, Bjork's from Iceland as well. And every review of this band ever written will mention that. <br />What's left is an odd and uniquely distinct experience of a record. Imagine the condensed images of a Stanley Kubrick film put to music that's mostly whispered and played at half-speed. Picture My Bloody Valentine or Sonic Youth daydreaming away on thousands of crates of cough syrup. <br />Pianos give way to walls of guitars, strings, and drums that occasionally lift the pulse above a trickle. Occasionally. But Sigur Ros don't work in speed or pop hooks. They work in pure aural texture. They move sideways, and they swell, not into catchy choruses, but into orchestral static and ghostly buzzing. This isn't a record for fans of mainstream pop music. In fact, it may not be a record for listening to at all, but rather it's something to play during science fiction movie credits, or in the background of an opium den.<br />Oddly enough, this isn't exactly a bad thing. Sigur Ros may just be the first band in a long time to sound so different, so confounding, and so beautiful.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Enough has been written about this album to fill a Proust novel. Sure the record was finished a year before it was released. Sure the same label ended up paying for it twice (after being dropped by a major and then picked up by a subsidiary of the major). Sure critics have been wetting themselves since leaks and live sets started showcasing songs nearly two years ago now. Bottom line is, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a great record. It chirps and buzzes like Radiohead and the Flaming Lips. It rollicks like the Replacements used to and the Strokes do now. It's as heart-felt as a Neal Young album, as universal as Sonic Youth at their broadest strokes, as expansive as the late Beatles, and yet as simple and tender as early Joni Mitchell. And it does it all at once.<br />The first track, \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" picks up where \\"She's a Jar\\" left off, wistfully abusing a pop melody. The latter's line, \\"you know she begs me not to hit her\\" completes a wash of romanticized images the same way the I Am Trying does before ending on an endless negative mantra worthy of a Nirvana song. Great simple pop songs like \\"Kamera,\\" \\"War on War\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" are gracefully interspersed with sparse compositions like \\"Radio Cure,\\" where singer Tweedy croons, \\"there is something wrong with me,\\" as if he were terminally pensive. Two songs later he tries to cheer up Christ, singing, \\"Jesus don't cry, you can rely on me honey.\\" And the timely (although written long before 9/11) \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" goes somewhere in between, stating simply, \\"I want a good life, with a nose for things / a fresh wind and bright sky to endure my suffering.\\" <br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is probably as close to a Paxil-loving Pet Sounds as we'll ever see. It's something to aspire to, and something to celebrate amidst all the tattered pop clichés. It's a hype worth the wear, a box of tunes worth the listen, an independent triumph, and a achievement that proves American ingenuity goes on despiteall the warnings of life during wartime.
B00006LLJ4|4.0|In the future Earth has found a new way to deal with murder.  Three super-humans (genetically enginered(known as Precogs)) make telling the future a reality.  By identifying murders before they occur, criminals can be arrested and victims remain safe and alive.  This movie really does give you a scary image of the future.  Could you imagine waking up in the morning drinking a cup of coffee and all of a sudden the police break through your door.  You have never broken the law but in five hours you will commit murder and there is no questions about whether or not you would have done it.  The only complaint I did have with this movie was all the twists and turns with the plot at the end.  The movie almost teased you into thinking you knew what was going on then it threw you off.  Some people may like this, but the movie does it a lot, it only frustrates me.  All in all a great movie.  I am starting to love Spielberg's work, let's hope he keeps it up.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Branded as the second coming of Echo and the Bunnymen, this New York foursome create stirring soundscapes drenched in reverb and a raw energy long missed in the dry ironic world of indie rock. <br />Listen to the desperation in Paul Banks' voice on the relentless \\"Obstacle 1\\" or the gorgeous, hovering \\"NYC.\\" Not only are they not afraid to emote, but, despite comparisons to New York brethren The Strokes, Interpol are a polar opposite of the garage rock revolution. Instead of straight, Stones style rockers, Banks and company produce effects-laced exercises in rhythmic uncertainty. Songs start slow, swell, retract, explode, and dissipate as if they were living organisms rather than just mere rock and roll songs. <br />\\"Hands Away\\" is a perfect example. The song begins on a whisper, before building on a trance-ready kick drum and wash of guitar and keyboards worthy of Sigur Ros. Then just when you think the band might erupt, they quietly and gracefully fade away.<br />Delicate, tense, unpredictable, and utterly captivating, Interpol are no mere 80's retread. Instead, think of them as proof that the future can indeed improve on the past. Think of them as proof that music can still move forward.
0151008116|3.0|Read this over the holidays and it makes for a nice, easy read that flows well though simple yet sophisticated passages.  It's a nice bit of storytelling and the author does a good job reinforcing the overall theme through the use of smaller episodes in the novel.  The book loses a few stars for a ending that doesn't have as much impact as it could and also for what I see as pandering to an audience by handing them the theme at the conclusion.  I have a little bit of distain for authors/directors/artists who feel their audience is too ignorant to make the connections on their own without having it explicitly spelled out for them.  However, is still an interesting read that I can see picking up again.<br />**** Small Spoiler ****<BR>Would like to comment on the story A vs. story B theme that was present in one of the past reviews....<br />The novel presents 2 versions of what may or may not have happened; version A and version B.  It makes no difference whether you believe in version A or B of the story (as the narrator states, they have the same result) just whether or not you believe in the story itself.  Those who choose A over B (or vice versa) and call others idiots and judge their character for not doing the same are the same priests and holy men arguing over who is right and who is wrong in the beach scene in the novel.  <BR>There is so much in common, why argue the details?<BR>Just my take...
B00005JL1C|5.0|This is one of the best of the teen movies of the 80's, right up there with The Last American Virgin, which is long overdue for the DVD treatment, or at least a re-release on VHS, because its impossible to find and if you do, be prepared to shell out the big bucks, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and Say Anything, which was probably the very last great teen movie made of the 80's. All of these movies are realistic and not sappy and corny and typical. However, my problem with this movie is this. Are we really supposed to believe that Eric Stoltz is this \\"dog\\" that's totally undatable and a freak? Come on. I know if he would have went to my high school, I can't even begin to count all the girls would have drooled over him. He's excellent in the role, but just kind of hard to believe lookswise. Other than that, a great movie. And like someone else said, I'm kind of disapointed by the lack of extras on the DVD but I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it if you're a diehard fan of this movie.

0871137380|5.0|The previous reviews have covered why the book is so great, so I will point out a few weaknesses.<br />First, the author (Mark Bowden) did a good job in his interviews with the porticipants (on both sides), but explicitly admitted that he knows nothing about combat tactics. This weakness was made very clear in his writing. He describes what happended extremely well, but there is no critique of decisions made, no analysis of actions taken or not taken. (There are a few critiques from a few participants, but these are not explored at all.)<br />His only commentary was in his epilogue, where he blindly \\"sides\\" with the commanding general. For example, Bowden criticizes a former Ranger who lost a son in the battle, stating that American armor (Bradley's) would have arrived too late to save the soldier. But the author totally ignores the option that such vehicles could have gone in with the Humvee's and large trucks during the initial part of the raid.<br />Second, the author mentions the many weapons used, but the average reader probably does NOT know what the acronyms means.<BR>Some might know that an RPG is a \\"rocket-propelled grenade\\", but a glossary of the firearms with their acronyms would have been very useful. If a reader does not know what an M-60, M-14, 9mmm Beretta, AK-47, etc. are, then that reader is out of luck.<br />I consider Hal Moore's book, \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\" (with Joe Galloway) a slightly better description of what combat is really like to the soldier actually in combat, but Bowden is technically a much better writer than Moore or Galloway.<br />All in all, this is a MUST book to read.

B00006LLNU|5.0|Having listened to this album countless times now, both awake and asleep, I have come to the conclusion that it simply cannot be compared to its predecessor, Agaetis Byrjun.  The songs on this album take a less orchestrated, more minimalistic approach, using less of the traditional string section for backup.  If you have never listened to this band before, be forewarned that they do not resemble anything even close to conventional music.  The songs often go on for upwards of 13 minutes, with a not-so-cut-and-dry song structure.  The songs reach from somewhere deep to present a sound that is beautifully textured and ethereal.  The first half is like listening to a sunrise, while the second half is like being trapped in an ice storm with no electricity.  The relatively simple instrumentation of 4 band members creates a sound that is irresistable and makes its listener happy to be alive.  Sure, critics complain about the supposed \\"pretentiousness\\" of the band, but I don't consider it pretense at all.  OK, so they left the CD booklet blank, left the album without a title, assigned no song titles, and sang in jibberish instead of Icelandic.  So what?  They are trying to convey the point that the music is all that really matters, and they encourage listeners to pick up a pen and fill in the blank pages with their interpretations of the lyrics.  It's entirely listener-involved.  Iceland has no problem understanding this; why do we?  If you haven't listened to this fantastic band yet, and are looking for music that will truly live up to the word \\"music\\", I urge you to pick this or \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" up.  Sure, bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor and Silver Mount Zion have made ethereal, atmospheric music before Sigur Ros came around, but who cares?  No one pulls it off quite like Sigur Ros, and no one will ever hear of those other bands anyway.  Oh, and just for reference, Sigur Ros is pronounced \\"seer rose.\\"
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore's composition of the Two Towers is purely genius. Howard's ability to capture the beauty and power of Middle-earth is breath-taking. The sensibility of the score is enhanced by the arrangment of the music. The music itself tells the story. The way Howard interlaces the diverse themes is phenominal. Shore's music highly compliments the film and adds depth to the intricate story. The fiddle of Rohan, the gloom of Gollum, and the various themes mixed in the battle of helms deep are some of my favorite moments which can be heard along with themes from the last movie. In conclusion, I highly recommend this work of art to anyone who enjoys quality music.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I have not been a comic book fan since I was a kid. I did like this film though. I like action thrillers, and this was a sci-fi film, but the action was decent. It was better then I thought it would be. If you like action films, pick up the widescreen edition of Spider-Man.
0066214122|3.0|I finished reading Michael Chrichton's Prey, on and off within a week. Prey was less enjoyable than most of his earlier works, namely Raising Sun, Disclosure, Jurassic Park.<br />The topic is fasinating. Nano-technology with agent-based genetic algorithm programmed in them to evolve, and what happens when things go wrong. How Scientist uses their knowledge to help them survive the monster that in part their creation. This theme has been used in Jurassic Park and other popular tales of MC and never really fails. The problem in prey is not the technical aspect of the story, but one with delivery of the plot. <br />The book started off very slowly, introducing main character Jack and developing his relationship with his wife and family for more than a third of the book. Character development wasn't great but you can see MC is trying to put more depth into these people. The slow peace have me put the book down and do other more interesting things at times.<br />Through the middle of the book, the story begin to pick up speed and the story becomes pretty intense. You start to see the good old MC writing with the familiar use of suspense. However, all through the later part of the book, climax after climax, the whole thing felt like a movie script more than anything. (In fact, the feature film rights was already sold to 20th Century Fox before the book was published for near 5 million dollars). The movie-formula was unbelievably obvious, so much so that you can almost see him giving instructions to special effects crew and camera men. It's always been his style of writing to be very movie-like, but somehow it felt like the style has been over-used.<br />The book is a fast page-turner towards the end, but one that would leave readers unsatisfied. I'd still recommend getting this book, but wait for the paperback. :)

B000002OOY|5.0|If we were still flying under the &quot;Union Jack&quot;, John Williams would certainly be knighted by now. Contemporaries Elmer Bernstein and Jerry Goldsmith only rival his contribution to motion pictures.<br /><br />But, that withstanding, his score for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; remains one of the maestro's most dynamic, poetic, and challenging accomplishments. The &quot;Theme from Jurassic Park&quot;, while slightly pompous, still projects the massive scope of the scientific and entertainment complexity of the story line. Interspersed throughout the score, the familiar melody adds equal parts of drama and pathos.<br />One of the best cuts is the excitingly menacing &quot;Dennis Steals the Embryo&quot;, heard as the treacherous park employee absconds with his booty and meets his end. &quot;Eye to Eye&quot; and &quot;T-Rex Rescue and Finale&quot; are also thrilling pieces that musically capture the onscreen tension and danger.<br />Williams has never put to paper more awesome &quot;little black dots&quot;.
0783225733|2.0|First of all, this movie is of course awesome.  One of my all-time favorites.  The Extras on this DVD are great too.  The documentary is about 60 minutes long and very entertaining and interesting.<br />Now the disaapointments:<BR>In the details for the DVD it says there is footage from Bill Paxton's 'home movies' shot during astronaut training.  I can't find them on the disc at all.<br />The biggest disappointment is the way this movie was converted to WIDE SCREEN format.  Wide Screen format, when viewed on a standard TV is supposed to give you more to see, but of course a smaller picture due to the black strips at the top and bottom.<br />With most wide screen formats (like Castaway for instance) I lose about 25% of the screen to the black bars - no big deal, you see more of the original movie.<br />But, with Apollo 13 the wide screen black bars take up literally 50% of my screen.  And, to top that off you are NOT actually getting more in the picture.  I compared my old Full Screen VHS version side-by-side to the Wide Screen DVD version, and I literally lost half of the view.  There was very little gained on the outer edges.  Very poor - it looks like they actually took the Full Screen version and covered it up with black bars.<br />Looking back, I still think I would buy this because of the documentary film.... but beware of how much you lose with the Wide Screen format.  If I want to watch the movie, I actually use my VHS tape instead of the DVD.<br />5 STARS for the movie itself, and the Extras - but because of the lost images in wide screen format, i give it 2 stars in the end.<br />Anyone else notice this big in the wide screen format?  Is is because this is an older film?
B00006JJ1O|4.0|One thing's for sure about certain teen-pop--it's the musical equivalent of eating a whole carton of coffee-flavoured Haagen Daz. Guilty pleasure, definitely, and I notice that the younger the artists, the guiltier the pleasure. Examples include Sweet Sensation back in the late 1980's and more recently, Play.<br />Then there's t.A.T.u., the Russian duo Julia Volkova and Lena Katina whose single, \\"All The Things She Said\\" (no, not the Simple Minds song) is a sweet piece of techno-pop. The title is sung in one-two double quick time, accompanied by a mixture of heavy guitars and synthesizers. They're simply the best thing to come out of Russia since Catherine the Great, Mikhail Gorbachev, and all those figure skaters. Call them a cross between Shampoo, M2M, Ace of Base, and Xymox.<br />Another cute pop teen-duo like M2M, except their music is more on the techno side, they are Russian, and like the White Stripes, helped promote themselves with a salacious rumour. The rumour is that they are lesbians, thanks or no thanks to a video for a song \\"I've Lost My Mind\\" which is the song \\"Ya Shola S Uma\\" The video involved the two making out in the rain.<br />\\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" begins with a shrill voice belting out the title lyrics with hard-driving industrial synthesizers reminding me of Depeche Mode or Xymox. The lighter moments and the softer voice reminds me of M2M.<br />Like \\"All The Things She Said,\\" the title lyrics of \\"Show Me Love\\" are sung in rapid-fire succession with the guitar/synth backing. A starkly haunting piano, laughing girls in the background, and an M2M-ish vocal highlight the wistful \\"30 Minutes\\", another one of this album's great moments.<br />That is followed by their cover of the Smith's classic \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" It's not half-bad, actually, with some grinding rock guitar enhancing the original. However, nothing beats Morrissey's vocal talents.<br />\\"Clowns (Can You See Me Now)\\" belongs to the Xymox/Depeche Mode/New Order side of the spectrum, with its racing strings-like synthesizer and vocals. \\"Malchick Gay\\" with its rhythm guitar backing, is another quick-paced number and some lyrics gives a hint to the lesbian rumour. The title lyrics are sung in rapid-fire, then jumping up an octave, and then another.<br />\\"Stars\\" has an outer-space otherworldly feeling, kind of like Dido's \\"Here With Me\\" or something from Sarah Brightman's Dive. There are some distorted Russian lyrics rapped inbetween the soft voices. Lyrics here too suggest Julia and Lena's rumoured relationship: \\"Are we in love? Do we deserve/to beat the shame of this whole world?/And like the night we camouflage/Denial\\" Well, it could be something heterosexual as well, but anyway...<br />There are two Russian-language songs. \\"Ya Shola S Uma\\" is \\"All The Things She Said\\" while \\"Nas Ne Dagoniat\\" is \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\". I like the Russian version of \\"All The Things She Said\\" even though I don't understand the lyrics. It's phonetically superior than the English version.<br />So are they cute? As buttons! Julia, I think, looks a bit like Rachel Leigh Cook; Lena, resembles a teenaged Geri Halliwell. Are they lesbians? If they are, so what? And does this album go 200 km/h in the wrong lane? Well, not that much, but it's still worthwhile. Rapid-fire delivery of vocals (think Billy Joel's \\"We Didn't Start The Fire\\"), industrial synthesizers, techno, vocals that alter between sweet and soft to loud and shrill, that's \\"t.A.T.u. you.\\"racing strings-like synthesizer and vocals. \\"Malchick Gay\\" with its rhythm guitar backing, is another quick-paced number and some lyrics gives a hint to the lesbian rumour.

B00001U0E1|5.0|What is the creative force that enables anyone to write, compose, paint, dance, etc.?  It must draw from life experience and the screenwriters for &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot; have more than ably acclomplished their goal.  The plot within the plot here is Shakespeare's play, &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; perhaps the best play written on the subject of Romantic love.  Around this &quot;inner plot&quot; the authors have created an imaginitive arena for the artist's imagination.  The film must be seen more than once in order to truly appreciate its value.  When I first rented it, I was disappointed.  On second viewing, without having to concern myself with plot, I was able to see the screenwriters' craftmanship.  From pen to screen they were able to invent a love story that mirrors &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot;  including a realistic ending, though without the bloodshed.  Love does not conquer all in this life and the film painfully makes us aware of it.  It is not a comedy -- it has its funny moments, but the essence of the story is dramatic.  The performances are good -- some more outstanding than others -- but the plotting is what is most important.  The screenwriters deservedly won oscars for their work.  Understandably, there are some who will miss the point of the film because they do not know the Shakespeare play well.  I am glad the producers were able to finance the film.  It is a wow!
B00006LLNU|5.0|() has exceeded the wonder that was Agaetis Byrjun.  The songs are still melancholy, reflective, and sung in that occasional falsetto.  Some of the songs are lengthy epics that stretch to 12 minutes and have those emotionally rising orgasmic Bolero-like crescendos.  Yes, the songs are untitled, but I found the following song titles for this album from some site so here they are:<br />Vaka<br />Fyrsta<br />Samskeyti<br />Njosnavelin<br />Alafoss<br />E-Bow<br />Death Song<br />Pop Song<br />As if they needed titles.  They're more mood-eliciting tunes that scarcely require any identification.<br />\\"Vaka\\" begins with a slow reflective piano, viola-like strings, ringing organ-like sounds, and haunting falsettos.  Despite the Hopelandic, the hybrid English/Icelandic language developed by Sigur Ros, there's one lyric that I picked up:  \\"You sat alone on the fire.\\"<br />\\"Fyrsta\\" begins with distorted sounds like crunchy static before going into melancholy guitars, whimpering sounds, and some lyrics in a lower but lovely register.  \\"You sat along,... fire\\" and \\"you ran along\\" are what I picked up.  A wall of strings surround the lyrics near the end of the song.  It blends into the next song, \\"Samskeyti\\"<br />The mellow piano melody in \\"Samskeyti\\" reminds me of looking at snow falling from one's window or alone on a plain.  It makes one either wistful, pleasantly melancholy, or maybe the urge to end it all.  Probably my favourite tune here.  But what about now, while I sit here listening to this?  It makes me realize how empty and alone I feel sometimes.  The sound, the shrill bagpipe-like synthesizers and the octaves of the piano, rises slowly in intensity before calming down, exceeding \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\" in emotion and intensity.<br />\\"Njosnavelin\\" begins with soaring guitar-like sounds before breaking into something that Coldplay could've done more smoothly in \\"Yellow\\".  The lyric here sound like \\"You sigh alone by the fire, alone\\".  Or is it \\"Desire alone by the fire\\"?  I see an image this time:  the orange daybreak sun reflecting off a glass windows of skyscrapers while one is standing atop a tall building.  Kind of like a familiar Tom Cruise movie from last year, I know.<br />There's a thirty-five second pause inbetween that song and the first of the long epics.  \\"Alafoss\\" stretched out clarinet-like sound with a slowed down drum tempo.  Falsetto Hopelandic lyrics: \\"Don't you\\" and \\"you're so wrong.\\"  The whole song is like a slow burn, coming to a crescendo, with the clarinet taking on the sound of an organ well into the eighth minute of this 9:54 epic.<br />The 8:48 \\"E-Bow\\" features that falsetto Hopelandic vocal, which by now I can't pick out anything coherent (which is fine) and the blaring majestic crescendo of a sound that characterized \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\" and the previous \\"Alafoss.\\"  It cuts off suddenly.<br />Synth-organ flavours the 12:59 \\"Death Song,\\" which features the Hopelandic \\"Don't fare\\", \\"Don't you love\\", \\"You sire follow\\".  This is like a tidal wave; it briefly blares early on, in the fourth minute of the song, quieting down, before blaring back at roughly 6:40, and slowly trailing down for another four minutes, going back up at 10:40, quieting down for the remainder.<br />The 11:45 \\"Pop Song\\" has the familiar Hopelandic lyrics, both falsetto and lower register.  It has \\"Alafoss\\"'s slow burn, intensified by the pronounced rat-tat-tat-tum of drums, kind of like Fleetwood Mac's \\"The Chain.\\"  If \\"Alafoss\\" and \\"Death Song\\" had a child, this would be it.<br />As for the title of my review, well, words cannot describe it, just like the title of this album.  This is something special and otherworldy.this time:  the orange daybreak sun reflecting off a glass windows of skyscrapers while one is standing atop a tall building.

6304712499|5.0|I know that I am one of the few that actually like this film, but I find it to be very good.  The acting is alright, and there is enough action to satisfy even die hard action people like me.  There are more extras in this DVD than most and is well enough.  I feel that the movie doesn't really seem like it has much to do with the actual \\"Spawn\\" character, it deals more with his personal life \\"Al Simmons\\".  There are good special effects and is worth the viewing.  The only downside is that this \\"Director's Cut\\" is the only version for this film out on DVD and it actually gets cut.  The actual film is 96 minutes and is rated PG-13, while the director's cut is 94 minutes and is rated R.  Some of the scenes may have been changed, but I don't think they were, back when I saw this film for the first time.  Just give this film a chance.  You may be one of the few that likes it like me! :-D
B00005JKZT|5.0|Whether anyone liked it or not...If your a fan it will always be five stars.  I have read all the books and i can say, the movie did an extraordinary job at trying to capture the book. there are things that are missing in the movie...who-cares.  The movie could have been three hours longer..if you asks me...Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew should be commended on this great epic.  I have the collectors box and the theatrical release and it is never enough.. I have only seen 2 movies in 2 year and they are the fellowship & the Two towers...everything else has been garbage or at least unforfilling (trailerwize)and too short. i really don't think anyone understands the magnitude of this epic.  Thanks Mr. Jackson,the trilogy is more than a just a treasure..  worth every penny!!
B000000OQF|5.0|From the opening riffs of \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", to the explosive \\"Rocket Queen\\", this album is amazing.  This album is a must-have for any guitarist (or any hard-rocker for that matter.)  \\"Paradise City\\" could be a 20 minute song and it wouldn't be boring.  Listen carefully to the guitars on \\"Rocket Queen\\", man those guys are good.  This is one of those albums that changed music (like Led Zeppelin IV) that everybody should have.  The first heavy metal CD, and still the best.  Rythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin is actually the head songwriter despite what you may think.  I recommend his solo albums in addition to this CD. <br />***guaranteed ear-ringing***
B000068TSI|5.0|As a former soldier, i can relate to the experiences of the men in this film.  And i have seen almost every war movie ever made here in america, and i can tell you no film more closely describes the bond between soldiers than this.  It was emotional for me, i can only imagine what veterans of that battle may feel after seeing it.  I feel this movie finally brings to light the courage and determination of our armed forces, and the brave men and women who are willing to give their lives for their country, and each other.  Anyway, back to the movie itself.  Incredible.  Acting, special effects, accuracy, it has it all.  Buy this one, you wont regret it.<BR>Never forget the alamo, but also never forget the men of the 7th Cavalry, Air mobile division.
B000066NW0|5.0|Honestly, I *tried* to hate this CD. But I've listened to it numerous times, and it's damn good.  I don't even like most \\"pop\\" music, but most of these songs are good, well-written, great hooks, musical.  Avril has a phenominal voice for her age - her vocal phrasing and musicality is sublime - her voice is expressive, strong, and refreshingly non-sexualized and non-pretentious. Somewhere underneath the annoying \\"image\\" and marketing, there's an extremely talented singer/songwriter in there.<br />To you reviewers who complain about her teenage-ish lyrics - for god's sake, she *is* a teenager! What did you expect?  But her sense of phrasing is beyond her years. Her passion for singing really comes through.<br />I love this CD. (Don't tell my friends.)
B00005JLRR|5.0|... The movie I thought was very good. Action seens were a lot better. It would be nice to see a good enhanced DVD since they did horrible at the box office.
B000060P79|5.0|Wow... Okay, I have to admit that I had never heard of these guys before. I got an FYE gift certificate for X-Mas, and was determined to buy something I'd never listened to. Well, walking through the store, I found that I had a lot to choose from (some of them I hadn't listened to for good reason...). I must've sample about twenty CD's, none of them really catching my fancy. Then I picked up this CD, and tried it. Wow... I instantly bought it, and the only time it leaves my CD player is when I'm transporting it to another room I'm in, just so I can listen to it. <BR>My favorite tracks definately would have to be: God Must Hate Me, I Won't Be There, One Day, Perfect, and Grow Up. Why they put the good ones at the END of the CD, I have no idea... <BR>Anyway, this so was not a waste of money.
0316666343|5.0|Quite possibly the best novel I've read in the past 5 years. I couldn't put it down and finished in two days. Rarely does a book come along that binds the reader so tightly to such a sympathetic narrator. Beautifully written, masterfully plotted.
078401213X|3.0|this movie is an insult to anyone that completed 8th grade math. I would not recommend it to a casual viewer. However, if you are sincerely interested in Darren Aronofsky, meaningless math-babble, or just think that seeing people play Go in a movie makes it totally cool and intellectual, then by all means, you best gobble this one up. <br />Visually it is stunning, and the handheld work and other characteristics are very good and even somewhat original. Much of the visual styling was repeated (and augmented) in the much superior Requiem for a Dream, a movie that was thankfully not penned by Aronofsky. Pi might have been saved from a quagmire of innumeracy if a mathemetics consultant of ANY caliber was employed in the writing of the script. Instead we get the most insulting pseudo-intellectual script (that has ever been taughted as high art) in recent memory. I haven't had the opportunity to consult any professional mathematicians on this account, but the writing (or in this case, the scribbling in crayon) is on the wall.<br />Darren Aronofsky is clearly talented as a director. Requiem should be remembered and Pi forgotten. Hopefully his great visual style will progress and mature in future work. It would be unfortunate if he turns himself into a cliche rather than a director.
B000002JPA|5.0|This album truly reflected the talent of this great band. Unlike the metalica loving freak up there i can apreciate good music such as this wonderful album. The perfect and very solid drum work by Mike Portnoy just topped of this sperfect album. Everybody in this band are extremely talented. The bassisst John myoung is very well placed and fits into this band nicely. The combination of \\"80's\\" singing and heavey grooves in this album are amazing and they are also combined with some insane time signatures. I definetley recommend this album to anybody that can oppreciate good music.
0393320928|5.0|If you've read Surely You Must Be Joking, Mr. Feynman and found it enjoyable, I'd recommend picking up What do YOU care what other people think? If you haven't read SYMBJ, I would recommend reading it first.<br /><br />This book has an easy flow and is made enjoyable by an approachable protagonist whose science mind and everyday eagerness is rewarding and inspiring.
6302453356|2.0|This movie could have been great but it is far from it.<BR>It is probably one of the worst movies Robin Williams<BR>and Dustin Hoffman ever made.  It is slow moving and<BR>about an hour too long.  Most of the scenes with the Lost<BR>Boys could have been eliminated.

0679805273|5.0|\\"Santa\\" brought this book for my 4 year old this year and it was an instant favorite!! He already know that \\"with a head full of brains and shoes full of feet\\" he's much to smart to go down any not-so-good street. Great story that instills confidence and direction for kids of all ages.
0553573403|5.0|I am a sci-fi and fantasy novel skeptic. Books of castles and dragons or spaceships and aliens usually don't entertain me (with their weak plots and single dimensional characters). So it is a rare treat indeed to find myself unable to put down a book filled with knights, castles and, yes, a few dragons. \\"Game of Thrones\\" is simply excellent reading. The first book in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, this novel is much more than just another fantasy book. The plot is beautifully complex and developed to an amazing degree leaving the reader constantly hooked. The characters are multidimensional and leap to life off the page. But, be warned, this is no children's fairytale. If you like all things to end well, then this book will leave you frustrated. \\"Thrones\\" is fantasy story based on a medieval realism with the heroes and villains not always what they seem. I can not wait to move on to this novel's sequel. It is truly that good.

B00005JL2O|3.0|As a longtime fan of Mike Myers, this third installment of Austin Powers was mostly one big disappointment (too bad he never got to realize a feature-length film featuring Dieter from Sprockets). Surprisingly short on laughs (except perhaps in Myers' own head), GOLDMEMBER rehashes too many elements from THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, but this time the carryover jokes have been completely drained of life, much of the dialog seems like it was ad libbed -- and poorly at that. For example, Myers has a tendency to linger on Dr. Evil's babbling and facial expressions, most of which is unfunny if not downright awkward this time around. Most punchlines and sight gags fall dismally flat where they could have succeeded had they been delivered with a little more flair (e.g., I could see the Mr. Roboto punchline coming early on, but when it did, it was like a mere footnote). The trip back to the 70's -- so heavily hyped in the previews -- is all-too-brief and the star-studded opening sequence makes this dud seem far larger than life than it actually is. And did anyone notice how inconsequential Austin Powers, as a character, becomes in each successive movie? Still, its worth viewing for a few, gutbusting moments where Myers does in fact deliver.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I play this CD a lot, and find myself singing these songs to myself.  The beauty of Celine's voice and her musicianship really come across. I'm in awe of her performance of some of these songs and think this disk contains some of her best singing ever.<br />Celine is better in French.  If you can deal with not understanding the words, you'll love this disk.
6300216039|5.0|My high school English teacher showed this movie to us in class when we were listening to the play on record.  The class howled excitedly as they saw the graphic parts of the movie.  However, the movie interested students into understanding Shakespearean literature and that time period.  I find Shakespeare boring because I don't understand the English and it really doesn't do anything for me.  When it is on screen, that's really where it will get the viewer intersted.  <BR>Zeferelli did a great job directing this movie for audiences who don't read this kind of literature.
0783117388|5.0|I have not met straight man yet that has enjoyed this show! Its pretty much a &quot;girl thing&quot;.  I love the way they categorize men, I have met a few of them! Working with men on a daily basis I sure appreciate the humor they imply on the show it keeps me snickering at the men I encounter!  I love this show! BRAVO!!
006441034X|5.0|The first book I bought by Diana Wynne Jones was the first volume of  The Chronicles of Chrestomanci.  I was looking for a book for my granddaughter.  Before giving it to her, however, I decided I should read it to make sure it was something she would like.   I have now read six books by Mrs. Jones and have three more waiting their turn.  I have given copies to my sister (age 60), and, yes, my granddaughter, age 13.<br />These books transport the reader to magical worlds, filled with fascinating characters and page-turning plots.  <br />Do yourself a favor, buy one of her books (I haven't found a one that I would not recommend!) - then settle back and enjoy!
B00006RJHG|5.0|This is the Critical Mass Collector's Edition of Black Christmas, released December 03, 2002.  It's an update to their previous release, the 25th Anniversary Edition, and is available only in Canada.  It is a dramatic improvement over that edition, featuring a brand new 1.66:1 widescreen transfer (though not anamorphic, alas), and a plethora of new extras including a 36 minute documentary, 2 audio commentaries, the complete script (!), poster galleries, still galleries, reversible cover art, TV spots, radio spots, interviews with principal cast members (including John Saxon) theatrical trailers, and alternate title sequences.<br /><br />This is the version to get.  Ignore all others and order this.
2070360024|5.0|First of all,can I tell you this is my all-time favourite novel.  Camus died ten years before I was born but reads a hundred years more modern than many writers I've read who were born decades later. <BR>The Mersault of this novel is not the ponderous but very clever eejit of the earlier version, A Happy Death. Mersault this time is a clipped, direct, yin-yang mofo who knows the difference between what sucks and what rocks, until of course that fateful hot-knife escapade on the beachIf you want to read this in French, do so even if you think your comprehension level is less than expert. It's poetry. It will get you.
B000065V9N|5.0|This is wonderful album, with several songs alone that deserve five stars (&quot;Don't Give Up&quot;, featuring the inimitable Kate Bush; &quot;Red Rain&quot;; and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; come immediately to mind). <br /><BR>This is my favourite PG record, and it is beautifully remastered here: the songs sound more lively, denser, and cleaner, though not dramatically so.  Wonderful stuff.  I am not a fan of the limited edition digipack packaging, however:  there is too much chance of scuffing, tearing, or otherwise defacing the album.  However, that shouldn't prevent one from buying the disc, which is a timeless listen.
B000063S6Z|5.0|This album of Moby's is the best and I'm a fat dirtbag named John Strickland.  I Listen to the album 24 - 7!  It's great, you should buy it!!!  I think that eminem and Moby should collaborate in the remix of \\"We are Stars!\\"  The album is awesome. It has collaborations with Blink 182, Missy Elliott, Notorious BIG, and 2Pac Shakur.  The hidden track at the end of the album is a phone convo with Moby and his old prison buddies (hahahaha).  It's pretty funny.  The best song is track 5.  It features Macy Gray and P. Diddy.  \\"I am Moby, my mom wanted me to be Toby, what a phony...\\"  Thats one of it's good lyrics.  BUY THIS CD!!!

B0000508U6|3.0|My friend recommended this CD to me so, I got it.  There are some good things about it and some bad things.  The good things, though, slightly outweigh the bad.  There were a couple of the songs that I could barely sit through, they were annoying.  BUT, don't get me wrong, it isn't a total waste of time and money.  <BR>     The singer of the group has a wonderful voice, except when he is trying to hit the high notes.  High notest aren't one of the strong points.  If you can deal with that, I would say, you will most likely enjoy the cd.  <BR>     Key tracks are \\"shiver,\\" \\"yellow,\\" and \\"trouble.\\"  I personally liked \\"shiver\\" because it is a very sweet song.  Also, because the lyrics say that he will do anything for the girl, even change everything about himself.  \\"Yellow\\" was also a very sweet song.  (In that particular song he did better on the higher notes.)  In \\"trouble,\\" the music is very beautiful.  At the beggining the music sets a very sweet and loving tone.  It is very beautiful music.<BR>      Discounting the few points that I didn't like, this is a pretty good CD.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The music in this album is gorgeous... at times haunting, moving, and intensely powerful, Howard Shore brilliantly captures the essence of Tolkien's Middle Earth in an album that is intoxicatingly good. The balance between the winds, strings and vocalists is excellent. Unlike many movie soundtracks, The Fellowship of the Ring does not require the movie itself to entertain. I kept this CD in my car for a month, never listened to anything else, and never got bored. All I can say was that the Academy made a wise decision when they selected this as the Best Soundtrack of 2001. My only complaint is that the soundtrack doesn't last as long as the movie!
B00001NFCY|1.0|this has got to be the most insipid, boring, uninspired, and trite music i have ever had the misfortune to endure. creed does acclomplish what they sought out to do...make money off of mediocre ballad music which infiltrates the top of the charts like a malignant tumor. i see no distinction between this and countless other manufactured grunge bands riding the hype kurt cobain generated, and the rest of the year 2000's pack of drivel ( nickelback, saliva, default, seether, etc...). not to sound pretentious, but you'de be better off buying a brick and smashing it against your head, because sooner or later, you'll want to.
B000005JA8|1.0|It ain't a mystery, baby, not to me.  It takes a fair while to unravel the puzzle behind this recording.  You work for a long time trying to understand it, or appreciate it, or at least accept it...  and then one day you realize that you've been hustled - tricked as it were.  How in the world did you buy this recording when there are so many truly great albums in the world?  I don't know, but I'll be sure not to make that mistake twice...
B00005JLEU|5.0|This film will spirit you away into another world for two hours.  It is a gem.  The animation is breathtaking, not with splashy razzle dazzle, but with the simple depiction of gentle ocean waves, or the way things look when submerged under shallow water while one moves over them, or the way a human face reacts and registers emotions.  Miyazaki's love for his craft shines through bright and  clear in this film.  Anyon, of any age, can enjoy this film.
0385505833|4.0|'Skipping Christmas' provides the experience of reading a very good novel without actually knowing it.  Its length and ease make it the book I turned to for quite some time when I had nothing to read or wanted some inspiration, in 2002, and as a result I read it numerous times in the first half of last year.  Although different from the typical Grisham, I believe his mark is stamped all over it, and it has confirmed that it is the author who I appreciate, and not just the genre, to a greater extent than 'A Painted House'.  This christmas tale is written with great perspicacity, and although it largely focuses on the negatives of christmas, is heart-warming nonetheless.<br />Luther is not scrooge, in my opinion, but the book does highlight how christmas loses its appeal when the youngest grow up, but paradoxically how this appeal is able to prevail despite this.<br />Very addictive and enjoyable, and I might just go and read it now...

B0000640SA|5.0|Far too many times have I heard people praising the pretentious, high-budget films of 2001. The problem with this is that many of these individuals don't really know what to look for in a good film, and only say that movies deserve Oscars because others told them so. Think about it...if The Lord of the Rings or A Beautiful Mind for that matter, flopped at the box office, would it be as highly recognized? The problem is, the Academy is just like these people, and refuse to use their brains or form their own opinions about movies. Which is why Memento, and many other movies of its kind are far too often over-looked by the dull, uneducated masses.<BR>   Yes, when you watch Memento you do have to *gasp* think! Oh, what a concept! If you are one of the few individuals who enjoys a film that challenges them, and makes them question their own opinions about themselves and the world around them, you will fall in love with this film. <BR>   The movie opens with Leanord Shelby (Guy Pearce) killing the man who raped and murdered his wife. Or at least, the man who he thinks raped and murdered his wife. The conflict throughout the film is Leanord's inability to make new memories. Everything, as Leanord so aptly describes it, fades. The film's first scene is the last scene in chronological sequence and the film is stacked so that from there it plays out backwards so that the audience can properly identify with Leanord's illness. Leanord is desperately trying to find his wife's killer, and along the way meets some new friends (Teddy: Joe Pantoliano and Natalie:  Carrie-Ann Moss). Or are they enemies? We are never quite sure until the very end, and along the way, we are desperately trying to piece together Leanord's life, as is he. Leanord is obsessed with finding the man who destroyed his life, and it is something that he can never forget, for it is the very last thing he can remember. One of the saddest and most powerful points in the film comes when Natalie asks Leanord what thelast thing he can  remember is. He replies, \\"My wife...\\" Natalie comments on how sweet that is until Leanord cuts her off with, \\"...dying.\\" It is moments like these that make Memento one of the most brilliant films ever created, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a challenging and incredibly involving film experience. <BR>   The Limited Edition 2-disc DVD is well worth it, also, as it is loaded with extras and contains a thought-provoking and extremely creative menu format.

0783230710|4.0|This movie is very well done, with solid performances by a really excellent cast. No disrespect to the astronauts, but I found the performances by the ground crews and flight control a lot more interesting.<br />Gather the family. It's that kind of movie
B00005JKZT|5.0|I've seen this film twice so far and every time I come out of the theater I say \\"Wow\\". This movie was excellent! I don't see how anyone could say \\"Lord of the Rings ....!\\" for it is just an excellent book and movie! I can't decide whether I like the first or second better for they are both wonderful. They way they made all the characters (especially Gollum) I thought was perfect. They are just so realistic and are just like I pictured them in the books. Plus there was a little bit of humor in the second one and there wasn't much in the first. The only minor problem with this one is that some things were cut a little short and there was no Shelob. I mean you'll see Shelob in the third movie, but since the battle of Helm's Deep was so amazing and long they had to cut short the movie. And push it back into the third. The only problem is that I am going to be disappointed in the third knowing that Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring. I thought Helm's Deep was really awesome, it's the greatest battle I've ever seen in a movie before. I can't wait to buy The Two Towers on DVD when it comes out and then go see the final movie.<br />Overall Rating: 9.7/10<br />I underated this slightly because it wasn't exactly like the book since the battle of Helm's Deep and the fight with the Wargs were long. I thought is was cool how they made the Ents look though. They were pretty much like how I saw them in the book.<BR>I know people at school that say Harry Pothead and the Chamber of Secrets is better than Lord of the Rings. Harry Pothead is nowhere near a good as Lord of the Rings.<br />A Great Triumphant Picture!!!

0679735909|5.0|Beautiful prose, compelling plot, fine characters and an example of gorgeous imagination.  Byatt is a jewel.  Interesting, the one &amp; two star reviews, however.  Perhaps someone stocked this book with mass market &quot;Romance&quot; novels instead of the literature section.  I cannot otherwise understand how anyone could refer to this as tedious.  Read the whole thing.  It's a treat.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I will say this at first:  I am biased.  Megadeth are one of my favourite bands, and always have been.  This, in my opinion, comes in at Number 3 of their albums so far.  It is a GREAT album, and, although it has a few weak points, the pros definitly out-weigh the cons, as far as I'm concerned.  The rhythm guitar parts, as usual, are amazing.  Dave Mustaine comes out with some of the best riffs I have ever heard.  The leads are good, but nothing amazingly spectacular.  The bass parts are humble, but always fit (I'd rather a simple bass part that fits the song perfectly, than the most finger-frighteningly fast and complex bass solo that just doesn't sound right at all), and the drumming is great.  The vocals are very much debatable.  Dave Mustaine has a voice that you either loathe completely, or actually like.  I, personally, like it.  I do not care for Dave's lyrics.  However, some of the lyrics are quite good.  Following is not my opinions on all the songs (because I would be taking up a lot of Amazon.com's storage space if I did so), but instead, my thoughts on what I find are the high points of the album<br />Skin of my Teeth is a fast, rocking song with a great riff.  The lyrics are about failed suicide attempts.  Aside from the morbid subject, that Dave seems to actually take a comical slant to, it's a great song.<br />Symphony of Destruction is another very good song.  Slow, dark and heavy.  The lyrics are quite good, even though that kind of thing has been done to death.<br />Sweating Bullets is a great song.  It's also the first Megadeth song I'd ever heard.  It begins with a slow, melodic riff, and has a very catchy verse and chorus.  The song is about multiple personality disorder (not to be confused with schizophrenia), and has more amusing lyrics.<br />Countdown to Extinction is a fantastic song.  It's not amazingly heavy, but its melodic chorus and progressive song structure is fantastic.<br />Ashes in your Mouth, as far as I'm concerned, is one of Megadeth's finest moments.  This song is damned near flawless.  Probably the band's most progressive song ever, this song is brutally heavy, melodic and is very angry sounding.  As far as I'm concerned, this song is a must for anyone who likes metal at all.
0446608955|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I would give it the HIGHEST rating on any scale. If you have seen the movie you have to read the book. I will admit the first chapter is little boring but after that you will be so intrigued by the book you won't be able to put it down. ***The most unique thing about this book is that it is a clean romance novel.*** (It is very hard to find those any more.) I can guarentee that if you like romance novels you will absolutly FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK. HAPPY READING!!!
0385503954|5.0|I'm not sure, being an Enduring Love fan myself, but this was hands down the best new book I read in 2002.  McEwan's writing is beautiful, soulful, passionate.  Even though it's an easy read, make yourself slow down to truly appreciate the ambiance and subtleties of McEwan's prose.  <br />The ending. . . I still think about it, it stays in the back of your head.  For those who didn't like the ending. . . perhaps this book was too sophisticated for you!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Johnny Cash's voice is fading but its emotive power is intact.  I disagree with a previous review in that I think Cash is very aware that a song like &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; can very easily push the needle into the red on the schlock meter.  However, Cash's honest reading (one imagines he has June Carter in mind) works because he knows how to work the material--he's an incredible interpreter and he takes a potentially cloyingly sentimental track and makes it sound like a good man's honest pledge to his wife.  Plus, how can you go wrong with a guy who on the very same CD manages to take Trent Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot; (which in Reznor's hands is silly teeny-bopper Goth) and makes it feel like the profound confession of a condemned man?  And, as much as I love Hank Williams, &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; is, like &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, very open to incompetent sentimental readings, but not in Cash's hands.  Moreover, who else could duet with Nick Cave and Don Henley on the same record and not seem at all out of place on either track?  If you want to hear a great record by a &quot;roots&quot; oriented entertainer, you can't go wrong with this disc.  Or the other three in the series.  They're beautiful, man.
0316666343|5.0|I was a little skeptic at first when I came upon this book. Mainly because I was afraid it would not keep my attention, that perhaps it was more of a teenage girl book.  I was wrong! It starts out with a rush and keeps going.  The author hooks you from the beginning with the first chapter.  Susie is 14, she is raped, murdered and in heaven then begins the story! (Whew)<br />You relate to everyone in the book from the mother to the young boy who had a crush on Susie to even dwell into the psyche of the murderer himself.  I was slightly disappointed in the end with the Susie, Ruth and Ray thing coming together.  I felt like I slipped into a bad teen romance book.  But what happens in the end with the killer is worth the read.
B000002L5I|5.0|I danced for 4 hours the first time I played this album...over and over again.  This kid is the most incredible thing to hapen to Texas Blues in the last 15 years.  Not even the remaining Vaughns can hold a candle to this kid.  He is it...<br />Where is this 3rd album????
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was a little weary of this because the last album wasn't that great. None of the songs except for Reflection were really inspiring. However this album is awesome and goes into a new adult territory.<br />Stripped 1- Good Intro. Numerous News Clippings with a short and effective message. Not a song but still like it.<br />Can't Hold Us Down- Major Female Power Song. Okay, I am a guy and liked this. It is up front and while it is sad to admit the message is VERY true. Made me laugh with the \\"You must talk so big to make up for smaller things\\" comment. =)<br />Walk Away- An Okay Song. I put this near the end of my program but I STILL put it on.<br />Fighter- My Favorite song on the album. It is awesome.<br />Beautiful- Nice Message. Very Inspirational.<br />Dirty- Great Dance Song.<br />Stripped 2- Like the first.<br />The Voice Within- Excellent song.<br />Im OK- It is a decent song. Not my favorite though.  <br />Keep on Singing My Song- I love this song except for the fact that it is way too long.<br />Overall an Excellent album. Go Buy it. Even if you didn't like the first.
B000003TB6|5.0|Before straying from their own roots, this legendary crew of talented musicians was producing funky, feel-good music that would make Trent Lott boogie down and bust a backspin. Coupled with original, head-nodding beats, Black Thought's legato flow will infiltrate your senses and incite a steering-wheel-dashboard-stickshift-console pounding [session]. I don't care what you have to do to get a copy of this album-- it's essential.
B000066NW0|4.0|Must admit that this music is a bit for the under 25 crowd but for that crowd and for the young at heart, this is definitely catchy music. Unlike most CD's every song is digestable. Me and my 7 yr old daughter have a good time driving to school listening to it. I would highly recommend this CD.<br />near 40  :-)
0881032646|3.0|I Alex Stemm enjoyed reading this book Childhood's end. i liked the ending i wasnt really a big surprise but it was interesting. There was no main charactor but i liked that it kept things fresh. This whole book was about change things were constantly changeing. its also about power though the book there is aways a higher power and a highest power. over all this was a good book and i suggest anyone the age 12-99 to read it right now and you will have good luck.
0553106635|2.0|Well, I have to say, that George R.R. Martin is one the best fantasy writers around.  <br />His latest book is full of magic, intrigue and twist and turns that just make this book go forward.  <br />I dare anyone to say that they can see where this series is heading.  Because a particularly interesting plotline that seemed to be developing was absolutely destroyed in the last half of the book.  <br />I have never seen this many well loved, and truly hated characters come to a gruesome, and painful end in my life.  <br />If you have grown attached and like ANY characters that were introduced in the first two books forget them!  They are dead meat. <br />That readers would hail this book as refreshing, and groundbreaking is a shock to me.  To me this guy is just plain morbid.  <br />Personally I could not finish the story, after one character got killed, I decided to rush ahead and read the last 4 chapters of the book.  I was thunderstruck and disgusted by what I read.  Great characters butchered like animals, wonderful subplots destroyed for the sake or realism.  The only saving grace is that my favorite character was spared.<br />But for me this is it.  The last book, I can't read what comes next.  <br />IN all fairness it should tell you something that I may give it 2 stars, but my feelings are so strong is because the writing is so good.  <br />The series is just not moving in the direction I would like it to.
B000003Z12|5.0|Schon is one of the best guitarists in the world, regardless of genre.  His playing is in full force on this album.  While he has the talent to go off whenever he wants, one of the most impressive features of &quot;Beyond the Thunder&quot; is his subtlety and melody.  It's hard to pick a favorite track.  Each one conveys a different mood.  Jonathan Cain's keyboard work is solid and Neal definitely benefits from his songwriting input.  A must-have for Schon/Journey fans.
B000062YB1|5.0|One thing about Slayer that I really love is that over the years these guys have not softened one bit. They have never sold out like some other bands. They do what they want to do and wear what they want to wear. In Seasons of the Abyss they really cut loose. If you like some really heavy thrashing metal where the singer does not sound like the \\"Devil\\" puking then check this one out. Tom Araya has one powerful voice! This CD is full of aggression just what I need to get myself going on a lazy day.
1565847032|5.0|What an enlighting book! This book has totally changed my views of the world, really. It was my first encounter with Chomsky's works and views, and this book really delivered. I must recommend this book to any one new or already aware of activism and Chomsky. It has more than 300 pages worth of additionnal info and material complementing and supporting Chomsky's words to firmly ensure that they are not simply words out of a lunatic... Having a scientific formation I must say that this book and its footnotes were visibly made with a rigourous attention keen to scientific research. The editors and Noam Chomsky deserve all my gratitude for all the work that went into this book, but most of all, for their courage in encovering the real truth behind Power and in helping a new generation be aware of the roots of the injustices in our world and continue to struggle for a better one. As Chomsky said more or less, \\"honest History should be taught in high school/college/university\\", and for me it started with this book.
B000001C6M|5.0|Show No Mery was the very first release that Slayer put out. When I first heard them in 1993 or 1994 they became my favorite band and they still are to this day. Show No Mercy sounds much diffrent from their other releases. Show No Mercy is a rocking album. Its fast, heavy and loud. This is one of thier very satanic albums. I love the cover to this one, dont you?

B0000024K1|5.0|This album literally changed the face of hip-hop music and led the charge through the golden age of rap (1986-1995). Chuck's Sinister lyrics combined with Flav's hilarious ad-libs and the ingenious production from the Bomb Squad enabled It Takes a Nation of Millions to shift an upward rapid change in hip-hop in terms of inspiring more artists to approach mcing with more cultural awareness and political consciousness. The Bomb Squad inspired a wide range of producers in hip hop and should be noted as the predecessors to producers like Dr. Dre (post Chronic) and RZA of Wu-Tang, along with others. Due to their usage of the whiny high pitch trumpet and sax samples. This album also was the first to use entire Heavy Metal guitar chords instead of one riff of a guitar sound, like on early RUN DMC, Beastie Boys, and LL Cool J albums. This album also introduced hip hop to interludes. Interludes were unheard of before this album. This album not only shifted hip hop's direction, but it also shifted a way of thinking for America. And you can't knock Flav he was hip hop's first and greatest hype man. Chuck D is in my opinion in hip hop's top 10 category. I don't even know why I'm writing this, just go buy the album if you don't have it in your collection. If you don't have it, your cheating yourself. plain & simple. Not only is this the greatest hip hop album of all time but it's hip hop's most important album of all time. I wish somebody would step to the plate today and deliver something of this magnitude.

B00004TDRD|5.0|\\"Jaws\\" is a classic masterpiece about an ominous great white shark that attacks unsuspecting beach-goers at Amity Island. Chief Brody thinks it is wrong to keep the beach open while a shark is in the vecinity, but the mayor doesn't want to shut the beach down. Brody embarks on a journey with an experienced seaman and a shark expert to destroy the evil shark once and for all. This film is filled with suspense, action, and horror. Of course, it itsn't the scariest movie, since special effects are far superior nowadays, but it is still quite horrific hearing the terrified scream of the first victim in the dark, eerie night, or seeing the shark swimming towards Brody, ready for his next meal. The real nail-biter of the story is the suspenseful and haunting score. Spielberg is a marvelous director! I definately recommend this film for horror and suspense fans. The special features on the DVD are excellent too. I enjoy seeing the theatrical trailer and the making of \\"Jaws\\".
B00000I3JM|5.0|This album is lush in it's minimalism, sweeping emotions of pensive reflections and surreal moodiness. Paul Bucannan's voice is earnest, sincere and convincing. Songs like &quot;Automobile Noise&quot;<br />&quot;Heatwave&quot; and &quot;Easter Parade&quot; give you the feeling that Bucannans' detailed observations about his feelings and surroundings could almost take you to the places that he's been.
B00005JLS0|4.0|You will love this. What else can you say about the wonderful Hugh Grant, and the amazing Sandra Bullock?<br />The story is about an affluent New Yorker (Grant), who depends so much on an employee (Bullock), who does not want to work for him.<br />The plot is not all that great, however the acting helps push the forward. And this flick goes at an amazing speed!<br />I won't say this film is wonderful and all, but trust me, I will recommend it.
0691023565|4.0|How does a teacher go about teaching? It is a hard trick. Written and published in the `40s, and then again subsequently Polya's \\"How to Solve It\\" is an attempt to describe the general paths to the student's Eureka! moments. As such it is also of interest to those who go about the task of discovery, and you must constantly rethink their strategies, in the face of a stubborn unknown.<br />Polya's consideration of the Various Approaches to problem solving hangs on several key structural bands that take the forms of a teacher's questions: Do you know any related problem? Do you know an analogous problem? [Parallelograms are considered.] Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Can you use it? Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?<br />These ring true to this recently mustered parental pedantic.<br />Polya's actual treatise is just 30 pages; the associated `dictionary' definitions section is quite extended, actually, making up some 200 pages. He describes going back to first principles in problem solving. January 1, 2003 is a day perhaps to remember such back tracking is sometimes in order.
B00006J9OT|4.0|Mostly reworked material from Diana's other popular releases, this may not be the most essential purchase for listeners who have the earlier albums.  She's joined here by one of the most well-oiled rhythm sections in the business, the Hamilton-Clayton association going back to their time together with Monty Alexander in the mid-70's. In fact, Diana's piano playing takes on some of the fire and humor of Monty--especially in the opening tune, where she quotes Monk in the left hand, followed by an allusion to Duke (\\"Rockin' in Rhythm\\") in the right.  And on \\"Deed I Do\\" she begins to stretch out, generating a bit of heat and excitement before yielding to guitarist Wilson.  Otherwise, the intros, hooks, and tags are replicas of her studio sessions--which is probably exactly as her considerable fan base would want it.<br />Diana is doing more than any other artist at present to make a larger public aware of the treasures of the so-called \\"American Songbook.\\" Not to announce the names of the songwriters (Arlen, Porter, Gershwin) may not be copyright infringement, but it is certainly a missed opportunity to introduce listeners to the indigenous, inimitable tradition of American popular song and its major composers.  On the other hand, after Old Blue pounded into our consciousness the real meaning of obsession in his definitive recording of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" Diana may have good reason not to remind us of the song's origins.

0609610570|4.0|Reading \\"Execution\\" and pondering its theses is a lot like listening to your mother telling you to eat your broccoli: There are other things you'd rather have, but in your heart you know it's the right thing. Much of \\"Execution\\" is plain old common sense; to move a business forward, everyone from the CEO downward needs to work to make things happen. <br />A refreshing departure from the fuzzy style of most leadership books, \\"Execution\\" is invaluable for up-and-coming business leaders of all stripes, though its focus is primarily senior management in very large organizations. Some readers will find that Bossidy and Charan spend a lot of time re-stating the obvious. For every \\"ah-ha!\\" moment this book presents, there are at least two \\"well, duh!\\" moments. But in light of many of the problems facing businesses today, the obvious bears repeating.<br />Others will find that \\"Execution\\" barely scratces the surface of a highly complex series of topics, and will want a greater diversity of business cases. Much time is spent fawning over Jack Welch at the expense of other, equally deserving business leaders. To that end, a sequel or a companion workbook would be helpful. But for getting managers thinking about their jobs in a new and beneficial light, \\"Execution\\" accomplishies its goal admirably. Much like broccoli!

8408038818|5.0|Almost without promotion, this book has become one of the best sellers of the Spanish market in 2002. The reason behind it is its elegant and sensitive mixture of  ingredients. Critics have compared the author, Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, with Eduardo Mendoza and Arturo P&eacute;rez Reverte, and indeed do we have a literary mystery, not unlike the kind P&eacute;rez Reverte used to excel at, and we have the early XXth century Barcelona as a background (and a very gothic Barcelona, at that), but in all fairness the references trascend those mentioned. This is the story of youngster Daniel Sempere, entrusted with the care of a unique book (&quot;The wind's shadow&quot;, exactly like the title of this novel). His research for information on the book's author will reveal as far more dangerous than he anticipated, and will teach him a thing or two about love and courage. This book has a magical quality to it, both in the collection of well rounded but altogether odd characters it portrays, in its description of the dark years after the civil war as in the strange tingling it leaves in your heart after reading it. A winner.

This movie is a very scary thriller .  <br />This movie is about a shark that is attacking and killing people near the shore of a beach, and so the only way to stop the attacks is to close down the beach.  The mayor doesn't like this idea though because a big town holiday was coming and everyone usually swims on this holiday.  So he hirers three people to get the shark in time for the holiday.  What they think is going to be an easy capture, they are wrong and they are in for the thrill of their lives<br />So if you like thrillers, shark movies, and great classics, check out JAWS you'll never want to go in the watter again.
B00004YC2F|5.0|Volodos can only be described as a true wonder.  After seeing him perform at Emory University I believed that his recordings of Rachmaninoff would hit the music world like a bombshell; I was wrong.  He has scarcely gotten as much attention as Kissen, who has only a fraction of Volodos's talent.  This recording far surpasses Argerich's performance and comes very close to Horowitz's legendary recordings.  He has perhaps the finest maturity and poise of any living pianist today and could easily take the throne as the greatest living pianist.  This Rachmaninoff recording has so much depth that it gives the expert listener a new perspective on the true emotion of the piece.  The cadenza in the first movement is a fair match for Horowitz and light years away in emotional content.  Horowitz believed the alternate version to be too bombastic and climatic, so he played the sherzo-like version instead.  But Volodos gives this powerful cadenza a fresh new meaning that is dark, thunderous, and rich in the true integrity of the piece.  The other pieces featured on this album are incredible.  Hopefully Volodos will make more Liszt and Rachmaninoff recordings, for these seem to be his greatest realm of pianistic domination.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Besides Space Jam is eight years younger than Roger Rabbit, and this movie (Space Jam) has CGI effects (this movie is from the Digital era), it lacks a lot of things:<br />1.- Roger Rabbit was one of the last jobs done by Mel \\"1000 voices\\" Blanc.<BR>2.- Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Droopy Dog, Betty Boop (and a loong etcetera) don't appear in Space Jam, meanwhile Bugs Bunny did appear in Roger Rabbit.<br />This movie is one of my long favorities, when it was released in DVD, i don't think twice and i buy it ..., but i noticed that this DVD have nothing of extras or foreign language support (but the movie itself worth the money that i expended); fortunatelly and finally Touchstone/Disney will release a special edition of this DVD, with all the things that the fans expected from a movie like this (and foreign language support, at least with Spanish audio track, something very important to me)...<br />I can't wait to buy this precious DVD! (did i say that i have to sell my old DVD for less than 1/5 of the original cost?)
0393312836|5.0|This book is one of those books that once read can be read over and over again.  This story of what is good and bad, right and wrong, innocent and evil shows the world through the eyes of Alex, a teenager in a futuristic world.  This book raises ideas that many have never thought of or questioned.  Burgess's use of inventive words conveys his meaning even clearer and in a way that will have you accidently using them in eveyday language.  This book is real horrorshow as Alex would put it.
B00006RAKP|1.0|I found this cd set to be somewhat lacking in quality. The recordings have obviously not been remastered since they were originally produced for LP's, and the resultant product on these cds is scratchy and limp at best - incomprehendable at worst. What makes it all the more glaring is that as the cd tracks are arranged in chronological order, the quality of the recordings gradually gets better. But, if you play track 20 followed by track 5, the gap in quality is reprehensible. Very poorly executed.
0613035976|5.0|This book brought back all of the joy of reading a good fantasy novel.  The heroine of the book, Sabriel, is a  strong character that gives this book a good base.  Magic and mystery abound along with a love plot that is subtle enought that it does not cover up the strong fantasy roots.  This book was truly enjoyable and should be read by all fantasy lovers.
B00005YXZH|3.0|it has one f the best covers and great photography in the cd panflet. that is y i boght it, the music is like country and love songs and that stuff, im not into it that much but i still listen to it... its pretty good buy.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ohhh my this cd is just amazing. You really hear her heart and with her strong voise it really goes out and relates to teens and great to just sit to and listen to im 15 &amp; I think its the best cd i have she changed on her style and her music but her music is certanly the best. Great voise great music great person just an all around great cd.
0385503954|5.0|Book critics have proclaimed \\"Atonement\\" as Ian McEwan's best novel to date. They may be right. In my humble opinion, it should have beaten Peter Carey's more showy \\"True Story of the Kelly Gang\\" for the 2001 Booker Prize. \\"Atonement\\" is about how a young girl innocently ruins the lives of two people she cares about and spends the rest of her adult life atoning for her crime. Did aspiring playwright Briony let her fertile imagination run wild after witnessing scenes she barely understood ? Did she jump tragically to the wrong conclusion or was there something subterranean at work that we or even she didn't realise at the time ? <br />The novel breaks neatly into three parts. The first and arguably finest part is so expertly constructed it knocks practically everything else that follows - barring the epilogue - into the shade. In typical McEwan fashion, we are spared long intros common to writers who indulge in elaborate scene setting. We cut straight to that fateful summer in 1934. The action begins after the extended family has assembled in the Tallis' home and at once there is a brooding tension that perfectly anticipates the tragedy that follows. Here, McEwan shows his mastery of suspense by going over the same happenings through different eyes. <br />The middle section deals with the aftermath of the crime. The torrid war scenes poignantly heightens the bitterness experienced by Cecilia and Robbie of their broken lives. This section also provides a natural bridge to the final part where we see the adult Briony working tirelessly as a nurse in a hospital attending to the sick and wounded. Will the physical punishment she puts herself through atone for her crime ? How does she seek forgiveness from the aggrieved when the past cannot be rewritten and when she was only doing what she thought was right ? As usual, McEwan has left his best shot for the last. The ace secretly tucked up his sleeve is revealed in the concluding chapter when the 77-year old Briony makes peace with herself and those she has hurt by using that same imagination she was blessed (or cursed) with. What an ingenius resolution....but then again, it's only McEwan spinning his magic.<br />Ian McEwan is unquestionably the pre-eminent contemporary novelist of our time. He gets better and better with each effort and with \\"Atonement\\" he may have reached his peak. A literary masterpiece. I have every incentive to mine his entire back catalogue for the enjoyment it will provide.
B00006X06U|2.0|An outstanding selection of songs performed with none of the zest and vigor you might expect.  Some of the performances are quite good, but there is a prevailing flatness to the recording as a whole.  This is made worse by having two discs to get through rather than one.  This is mostly pop music, and like even the best pop music, it sounds silly when orchestrated.
0385508417|5.0|First of all let me tell you how I read this book, it was december 29 and I went shopping with my wife, I saw a book store and bought this book, I started reading at 10 o'clock and finished that night, even if I don't celebrate X'mas I like very much this book, because when you do something every year you just can't skip it one year just because.<br />The book is very easy to read and it has a great message of friendship at the end, is a very nice story.
B00005JL9B|3.0|One of the most disturbing films I've seen in a while.  It is quite entertaining, but lacks plausibility, which is the only real caveat I have about this film.  First, the premise itself is surreal, but I guess that was the point, so that's not really a negative.  What really bothered me was the extended 5-minute death scenes and how it took 100 bullets from an automatic machine gun to kill one person from 10 feet away (aka the Rambo effect).  3 out of 5 stars for content.
B000055Y0X|3.0|This movie is a classic and one of Kubrick's finest, but I was surprised at how many pops and scratches were on the disc. I'm assuming that the DVD was made from the best print obtainable, which makes me think that the master print is damaged or not available. The quality varies from scene to scene, but generally looks like a print that has a lot of miles on it. I hope that the studio goes to the trouble of restoring this film someday soon.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Me, being a huge Beyonce fan, I defintely enjoyed this one. It is full of humor and funnier than Carmen, her first movie. Mike Meyers also did a fantastic job on all the characters he represented. I suggest this movie to anyone who likes to laugh!
0897500482|5.0|The book covers everything JKD related. The physical and the mental aspects are covered. Buy this book first, the only downside are some hard to understand drawings, but if you look at them for a bit they make sense.
B000002N2P|5.0|I find this Green Day cd to be one of their best.  Green Day is my favorite band and I would have to say this is a big step away from Dookie but its a step in a good direction.  This cd seems a little more hard on the guitar but it works.  Billie's lyrics are as always great and about boredom, and the usual Green Day topics, but there are some new ideas mixed in.  Some of the best tracks on this cd are \\"Walking Contradiction\\" and \\"Brain Stew/Jaded\\".  There are many other great tracks and this one is definatly worth picking up.
0679731725|5.0|Many years ago I was fond of Wodehouse's books. That very way of telling a story, dipping out a huge sequence of details with the ability of maintaining the reader's interest, marked a very characteristic style. The same style I am encountering in this Ishiguro's tale. I found very surprising how a Japanese author can acquire (absorb I think a more suitable word) the most British style, turning it into a so personal thread, in which a trip of few days becomes the occasion to flash back a whole life, spent in a screened service as a butler in a high gentry house, in which the protagonist has been having some opportunities to find himself \\"close to the hub of the wheel\\", receiving slight echoes of the main current events of the outer world: debates about Versailles Treaty, appeasement, the rise of German Nazi Party, anti-Semitism, the war. All that softened by the professional burden of the butler, by the local quarrels and arguments. So two main threads are followed by the protagonist, creating two competing tensions: the former backwards, i.e. a more and more precise depicting of lord Darlington, up to his final involvement with the Nazis, the latter the approaching to Miss Kenton's living place, along which the author, in a slightly deceiving way, builds what seem to be a desire of regain lost time. Both threads are left unresolved: you do not come to a complete knowledge of what happened to lord Darlington, and Mr. Stevens, the protagonist, finds Ms. Kenton married and waiting for the birth of a grandson. Such a literary joke is proper to the great ability of the writer, and makes a book a masterpiece not only in fiction, but also in the more subtle art of language use.
0783225733|5.0|This movie is a little longer, but the time flies. If you liked both &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;The Abyss&quot;, you will probably like this movie. Enough character building to make it interesting, but the beat-the-clock action is what is gripping. The performances are excellent and realistic (being a &quot;geek&quot; that has worked with this type equipment and scenarios). Suitable for all audiences, it is a pleasure to view.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I knew right from the first episode that this was a collection I needed to own.  The story is complete and detailed, leaving no stone unturned.  The various episodes interspersed with actual recollections from survivors really brought the whole experience to life.  The care with which this mini-series was filmed is unbelievable.  It is something everyone should see to gain a true understanding of just what previous generations went through for our continued freedom.  Incredible and chilling at the same time.  Watch it, Love it, Buy it!!
6305176299|5.0|Just saw it again last night for probably the tenth time. It is non-stop action. Sometimes when I would look at my collection of DVDs for a movie to watch that night, I would think so-so about this movie -- until I started watching it again. It is no wonder that one of the top movie reviewers said that this may be the best action movie ever. It keeps you on your toes and doesn't have to resort to a sex or foul language to keep you glued to the screen. This was the kickoff for Sandra Bullock and she does very well. Keeanu Reeves is in one of his better performances. All-around good stuff.
6304383827|2.0|It had potential but unfortunately i did not get around to seeing it all because i was so bored by it after only 30 min that i actually turned it off... The plot is cute and ive heard the book it was based on was pretty good but all i can say is that this video definetley was NOT.
0385335989|5.0|I am starting to get a little sad at the prospect of soon finishing these books!  What will I do with my life?  I do know that I will really miss these characters.<BR>I agree with many of the previous reviewers about Brianna (even 30 years ago girls were being 'sent off' to have illegitimate babies)--I can't imagine what reactions would have been 200 years ago. Wouldn't Jocasta have kept her hidden?  And why didn't she tell people that she was 'handfasted' when her pregnancy was discovered?  It's also ironic that Claire is always saying that Brianna is stubborn just like Jamie. Claire is pretty stubborn herself!  I did enjoy Roger and Brianna's story though.<BR>I disagree with previous reviewers about DRUMS OF AUTUMN needing a villain.  Bonnet is extremely dastardly, isn't he?  Frankly I'm glad Black Jack is gone!<BR>I loved this novel as much as the first three.  The writing is exceptionally beautiful and as we have grown accustomed, the plot is compelling.  As usual, something is happening on every page and I enjoyed the fact that Jamie and Claire have settled down (sort of!).   The last few pages of this 'bonnie tale' are so poignant and touching that I was moved to many tears!<BR>I have learned so much about Scottish and Colonial history; this is a historical novel with large doses of romance, adventure, and fantasy to boot.  And best of all is the love story of Jamie and Claire:  &quot;Your face is my heart, Sassenach,&quot; he said softly, &quot;and love of you is my soul.&quot;  Or, &quot;And when my body shall cease, my soul will still be yours Claire--I swear by my hope of heaven, I will not be parted from you.&quot;  And, &quot;You are my courage, as I am your conscience,&quot; he whispered.  &quot;You are my heart--and I your compassion.  We are neither of us whole, alone.  Do ye not know that, Sassenach?&quot;<BR>I recommend these books to anyone who loves to read; they will touch your heart as they have mine!
0380789019|5.0|I'll try not to gush. I can babble on and on forever on how wonderfully AWESOME Neil Gaiman is, but I'll just let you read this book.<br />The plot, in a nutshell: Richard, a Londoner, is going out to eat with his high maintenence fiancee, Jessica, when he sees a wounded young girl on the sidewalk. Feeling pity, he skips dinner and takes her home. When he awakes, he is faced with strange predicaments involving hired assasins, a charismatic con man, angels, and, most importantly, an alternate world in the London underground. The adventure that follows is one of fantasy and beauty.<br />I loved this book. I never wanted it to end. For those of you who are Douglas Adams readers, Richard is a character who is actually quite comparable to that of Arthur Dent. As for the hired asassins, they bear more than just a little resemblance to the New Firm in Terry Pratchett's &quot;The Truth&quot;. Door-the wounded girl-, the Marquis De Carabas (the con), and Islington (the angel) are so richly characterized that they are simply their own characters. The whole story is absolutely rife with imagination. You are drawn into the story so that you care very much about the characters, almost as if you were in the story yourself. When the characters are scared, you are scared. When they are happy, you are happy. When there was a shock, I gasped audibly. The only flaw in Gaiman's amazing story, is that the book itself is so wonderful that you are unsatisfied once you've finished it. To sum my review up: READ THIS BOOK! It is wonderful, and is really an experience unto itself.
B00004T0US|1.0|Although this is a great way to get two albums in one CD, the song LET ME BE THERE is not included on this CD. LET ME BE THERE is on the original Moody Blue album and should have been included to make the combined album complete.
B00006V9A0|1.0|What a Major dissapointment...they cleaned up allt he tracks..they don't have that gritty, dirty basement sound that made Nirvana and Grunge... they might have as well read did Kurts voice so you could understand every word coming out of his mouth. This album sound slike a POP album not Nirvana. Be better off buying all their albums...you get a ton of better songs that weren't even on this album.
0440237688|5.0|The giver was probally the best book. It is about a young boy named Jonas who is going to be the reciever. Jonas's world is plain. There is no color, differences, and you are assigned a job when you are 12. There is no birthdays or holidays. Their only holiday is when the anouncer says it is an uninspected holiday. It means that you do not have to go to school, work, or no traning hours. When Jonas goes to the Annex room everyday he gets memorys from long ago. You should read this book! I do not want to tell you any more!!
B000005JA8|1.0|It's great, if you like that sort of thing, which I don't.
0790736233|5.0|This movie has a lot to offer. Besides the fact that the special effects are great and the acting is great, the story is entertaining and realistic (okay, to a degree). The science world is exposed as to how it really is -- more driven by money, politics and ego than most care to admit. It also shows that although science can do wonders, it is not the answer to everything (by the way, my background is in the hard sciences). Before you know it, you may be wondering about Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and really appreciating what it says.
0451207521|4.0|Follett is no wordsmith, but he is a talented storyteller. The major characters show modest character development, but the reader can empathize with them quite easily. If you liked \\"Eye of the Needle\\" this is definitely worth the read. The book is suspenseful in the same fashion, but the key difference: instead of the good guy chasing the bad guy to prevent a horrible incident, it's the bad guy chasing the good guy. The book is a breeze to read and was very enjoyable. If you are not familiar w/ Follett, he writes in the fashion of Grisham and Crichton - an action screenplay loosely disguised as a novel. As for the \\"sex\\" in the book, it did not disrupt the plot, and was not out of the ordinary for this type of \\"bestseller.\\" The Modigliani Scandal, by Follett, was more graphic, and that book was written over 15 years ago.
B0000640SB|5.0|This movie has it all, well, except romance. A little suspense, action, drama, western and a lot of comedy. There are many memorable scenes and ones that will make you watch the movie several times. The editing and sound are top-notch. The acting is very well done. The special effects are superb and some of the best that I have seen so far. This should be in your list of top 20 must-see films.
B00000I3JO|5.0|I got this ON TAPE in 1990 and am so glad I found it on CD. &quot;Each time I fall for you, it hurts me a little bit more... than I want it to.&quot;
0800127803|5.0|This is a nail-biter of a movie. There are many points that keep you on the edge of your sear, er, cliff. The cinematography is excellent and so is the acting. Although the setting is snow-covered mountains, it is viewable any time of the year (watching during a snow storm is especially gripping). This is better than many of the summer block-buster movies we have seen in the past ten years, so give it a try.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|If you want to have a scary time night, this is the film. The story of Jeepers Creepers is really original and you will never guess the end. The special effects are well done and all the time something scary happen. The sounds of the film are really scary. It good also because it dont have sex scenes, so everyone can watch it.
B000069AUI|5.0|Simply put, \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" wouldn't be nearly as great an album were it not for two things, 1) 'The Scientist' and 2) the last minute and a half of 'Amsterdam'.  Without the glow and ethereal resonance of those songs, this would be just another highly-accomplished Brit-pop exercise in post-Verve symphonics.  And that's not to say it would be bad - not by a long shot - just not as great.  However, with the inclusion of those two potent jump-starts, Coldplay sends the album straight to the sky and you're left feeling your God-forsaken heart whistle.
B000069AT7|4.0|The first time i saw this movie was with my grandfather and not too long after that he passed away, this movie reminds me of him.  Sure, i didn't like the fact that Steven changed the guns to walkie talkies (yeah, the government with weapons! not in america), but i enjoyed the soundtrack, book and other stuff that came with this set.  Still, ET for me is memories and candy.
0783246641|5.0|This may be THE American satirical work of the nineties, and has a special resonance following the ENRON and WORLDCOM sagas that ended that weird decade.  We do need to keep reminding ourselves that a film is a film not another version of a book.  More than anything, Ms Mary Harron must be given full credit for the work whilst acknowledging her source material.  She needs to be spoken of in the same way as Julie Taymor whose brilliant work on Titus Andronicus should bear comparison. But in terms of satire, which I believe is at the heart of the greatest comedy, only Mr Todd Solondz perhaps is a worthy contender.  I found the set pieces in AMERICAN PSYCHO superb, the acting pitch perfect, and the mis en scene a model of its kind.  As there is over 300 reviews preceding this, I keep my comments brief -I only hope that Ms Harron has the opportunity to direct much more.
B0000027RL|5.0|Who came first - Pearl Jam or Creed? Eddie Vedder was a superstar in rock when Scott Stapp still was in highschool. Scott rips off Eddie. Period. Learn you history before you attack Pearl Jam. Ten came out in 1991! Years before Creed got together. Pearl Jam allowed Creed to be famous!<br />This was just a comment, not a review of any kind. <br />peace
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I can't. There is no way for me to really express just how amazing, how thought-provoking and compulsively WATCHABLE this movie is.  I've watched it three times, and know I will watch it again at least three more times.  The story is incredible, and the concepts which are fully fleshed-out (but still left for the viewer to discover) are fascinating.<br />Having been a film fanatic for the past 25 years (since I was 8), and being a HUGE fan of offbeat cinema, I expected to be let-down by this movie.  <BR>Quite the opposite. <BR>It's one of those films where, once you've seen it, you begin planning when you can watch it again, and whom you can drag-along for the ride.<br />The genius of this film is that all of the elements are IN the picture, but it's up to the audience to piece it together, and once they DO it still leaves lots of room for alternate theories.  It's the kind of film that raises as many questions as it answers, and NOT in a frustrating way. The film can be re-watched many times and it's not like the previous veiwings will ruin the effect; rather, they enhance it. Knowing what follows makes the film all the deeper, the messages all the more relevant, and the different trains-of-thought about &quot;what it all means&quot; all the more captivating.<br />I can't recommend this film enough.  The only movie of late that knocked me off my feet this way was MULHOLLAND DRIVE.<br />BTW, the DVD is great. The image is a bit soft (source materials?), but the audio (5.1) is AMAZING, and the bonus features are plentiful (the deleted scenes are over 1/2 an hour long, and they're NOT just throwaways).<br />Very, very recommended.
0385486804|5.0|After reading this book for a class assignment, i can say it has changed my life. I relate to Christopher McCandless in so many ways. This book is very well written and tells his story to the best of it's ability. We don't know Cristopher's reasoning behind what he did, but it wouldn't be the great story it is if we knew all the details.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie was awesome, to say the least.<BR>Director Peter Jackson took Tolkiens already exciting story and made it into the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was exciting and intriguing, leaving me counting the days till The Return of The King comes out. <BR>Several people I saw the movie with complained that the details were confusing, but it's actually alot simpler than it seems. Good vs. Evil is the basic rule. Others complained about details left out from the book, and other details that were added. It seemed to me that the director did the best he could to stay with the book in the 3 hours he was given (you could take a week for each movie) and the few things he changed only made the plot more understandable. <BR>I can't think of anything to complain about, besides afew moments of talking trees (which I found kinda boring) and a cheesy love story. Overall the movie was great, and I would see it for the special effects alone. I recomend it to anyone.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Every person with a tv and video player should see this.  It is simply the best movie ever made (it's not a mini-series!  Nothing &quot;mini&quot; about it!)and I don't even really get into war/history stuff.  The cinematography, the acting, the plots of each episode, and what I see as very realistic illustration of battle and war, is just second to none. One of the more birlliant, yet subtle aproaches to the writing was how each episode comes from a different angle of the Company.  It focuses on different elements that come into play throughout life as a soldier.  Very crafty, but not overdone.  Sometimes simplicity shines brighter than complexity. No one can do this movie justice by describing it, it is just so well done I don't know what else to say.  Thanks to everyone involved in this.  What a treasure.
B000000WGL|4.0|Talk Is Cheap is an excellent example of how great a solo album can be,and it is by far the best of Keith Richards solo efforts.He rewards us with a nice blend of musical styles and creativity,the finest performers and the best recording and production expertise avaliable.The sound is clean and well balanced.This album really opened my eyes as to how good a guitar player Keith is. His playing is superb! He even demonstrates his vocal ability.Which can be weak at times.But there is so much going on within the music that you can hardly notice it. Even though every song on this album is a winner,there are still some unique favorites; Such as, Big Enough-which gives us a Funk Reggae groove,slap funk style bass,cool back up vocals and some nice alto sax. Make No Mistake-a nice balad with female vocalist Sarah Dash sharing the vocal duties along with an inspiring horn arrangement by the Memphis Horns. Struggle-a fast paced rocker that includes Great Bass and drums! For you drummers,check out drummer Steve Jordans catchy drum fills!! You Dont Move Me- another solid rocker,with solid back beat drumming and a variety of guitars.{Keith is also a wonderful acoustic player}. Next is a song called How I Wish- a stones type of rock n roller with a catchy lead vocal line,great rhythym guitar and a touch of boogie woogie piano.Last but not least is Locked Away- a beautiful melodic slow ballad that flows nicely in a dreamy kind of way.It also features acoustic guitar,smooth keyboards,violin and some accordion mixed in as well. Final thoughts; I wish Keith Richards would continue his solo efforts or at the very least collaborate with other artist of his caliber.He could have a real future in doing so. This is a good one!! BUY IT!!

6305971293|1.0|But no where near are bad as Halloween: Resurrection. I'll say that much for it.<br /><br />Never before have a seen a film that has been RUINED so much by the AWFUL teenagers (?) on display. They have nothing to do with the plot and contribute zero to the film. All they do is run around throwing up appalling dialogue, most of which is shockingly bad ADR ('nothing is all I get from you Michael'-check it out). For example there is a massive scene in a barn, which has nothing to do with anything, and is really only there to pad the film. These characters ruin the entire movie and I was very disappointed. Are we really supposed to side with them, perhaps fear for them when they are in trouble? I was relieved when they started getting knocked off.<br /><br />The scenes with Michael Myers (now played by Don Shanks instead of George P. Wilbur), Doctor Loomis and Jamie are the only reason I didn't eject this film. They are the saving grace of this movie. But, unfortunately, all the grace in the Universe cannot make us forgive this film for having such pointless and meaningless characters who turn it from almost a sub-par `psychological horror' to a `sub-standard cliche'. It's a shame.<br /><br />Halloween 4,5 and 6 started an ongoing plotline that was ignored in the abysmal Halloween H20 and Resurrection and it was also cut to shreds in the severely edited and re-arranged Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. The fact that 4,5 and 6 could have been very good makes this film worthy of attention. The fact that 4,5 and 6 (are bad) is the fault of the creators. Tho I do appreciate the work that Anchor Bay has put into restoring the movie.<br /><br />The re-mastered Dolby 5.1 soundtrack has been created using the original Ultra Stereo tracks and sounds rather forceful and loud considering the basic production values. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture (Carpenter and CO. made them in 2.35:1 Panavision which is how Moustapha Akkad should have continued it from parts 4-6) is good looking and although the movie (is bad) it's presentation is more than acceptable. I also love the Limited Edition tins Anchor Bay puts them in. Some of you may hate them but I think they are rather neat. My copy is number 0843/15000. The extras consist of a thick booklet containing many production stills, a documentary in which the cast seem to be surprised at asked questions about such a forgotten film and a replica of the theatrical poster. Forget the advertised 'deleted scene' it's shot on a camcorder and is not explained.s bad) it's presentation is more than acceptable. I also love the Limited Edition tins Anchor Bay puts them in.

B000002UKS|5.0|I actually happen to like this album better than Foo Fighter's self titled debut album. While the first one was excellent, this one has just so many good songs on it and none of them get old (not even the overplayed &quot;My Hero&quot; gets old).  I could listen to this CD over and over again and find myself listening to it over and over again the next day. Its that good. The highlight tracks are &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;Hey, Johnny Park!&quot;, &quot;My Poor Brain&quot;, &quot;Up In Arms&quot;, &quot;My Hero&quot;, &quot;See You&quot;, and &quot;Everlong&quot;.  This is one of my all time favorite CD's next to 311's &quot;Music&quot; and The Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;.  A great CD that never gets old.  Check it out for yourself.
B000077VOY|5.0|Clarification:  After reviewing the set and then receiving the set...I Must applaud A&amp;E for the brilliant 20 minute BEHIND-THE-SCENES special on the 5th disc!  Finally...the puppeteers get to talk about their work and you actually get to see inside the puppet's heads!  Also on DISC 5, they did include the lost footage from the 40th Episode!  BRAVO!
B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning, although very different from Green Day's recent hard punk albums, introduces the strong harmonics of the many different instruments that the boys can play. The lyrics are outstanding, and the songs introduce the new different side of Green Day. The singles, Waiting, Minority and Macy's Day Parade are great and the album is an overall success for Green Day.
0375414053|5.0|What a funny book; I loved it! What makes this book so funny is that even Kate does not take herself seriously; read her emails if you have any doubt. This book is not a treastise or a how-to book. It's fiction; particularly well-written, very funny FICTION, and I wish all the reviewers would treat it as such.<BR> <BR>Most women will never make as much money as Kate does. It doesn't matter. We still have to lie about staying home with sick kids, we still think we're dressed appropriately until we look down and see baby spit-up or the agent provacatuer bra, we still have to compete with the Muffia. (And now that I'm at home full time, I STILL can't keep up with the Muffia.)<br />We can all laugh and cry and be proud and even disappointed about where those damn suffragettes in Emily's \\"Mary Poppins\\" movie have gotten us to. This book is a wonderfully funny look at the state of women today. We can all see ourselves in Kate Reddy, but none of us ARE Kate Reddy (thank God!).

B0000683DH|2.0|I was delighted when I received the director's edition, but utterly dismayed when the second straight copy I received was defective.<BR>The movie DVD skipped 10 minutes and the extras DVD would not play at all. This was returned and Amazon quickly (kudos to Amazon) sent a replacement. Unfortunately, this defective in exactly the same way. The problem is not with my DVD player since I've had no similar problems with other DVDs and these problems were in exactly the same place.<BR>Someday I hope to receive this director's edition again so I can write a real review of the DVD edition of what is one of the best Star Trek movies.<BR>P.S. I regard Nemesis, the new one, as one of the worst.

B0000683DH|2.0|I was very disappointed in this because of technical problems.<BR>&quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; is one of the best Star Trek movies. However, the first copy I received of the director's edition and the replacement were defective in the same ways. The movie skipped forward 10 minutes and the bonus features DVD would not play.<BR>These problems were identical on both copies, pointing to a manufacturing problem since I have not experienced this problem on other DVDs I own. <BR>Someday, I'll try to order it again and then maybe I can see and review all of the extras I had hoped to see.
B00006RCNW|5.0|'The Shield' is by far the most violent, most graphic and most interestingly layered cop show on television, period. On basic cable, 'Shield' gets away with more of what 'NYPD Blue' wishes it could do, mainly ripping the censor's bellies right open and pouring salt in the wounds. That said, beneath the refreshingly un-Politically Correct premise of the show, the characters are all unique, with distinct motivations and flaws. You love and hate all the main characters at the same time, and it's great. And each episode is as fresh and intense as the last. It simply NEVER slows down. It's an adult show with adult themes, for adults to enjoy and absorb. Keep your kids away and have a fun ride!
B000002UTI|5.0|This album is the perfect epidemy of anything a person could ever ask for in a CD. Anything you could possibly want is on this album. Easy listening music, insightful lyrics, decent Voorman guitar, the works! It's all here! Flawless album.
0142002038|4.0|If you have seen the movies, you will find many interesting differences in the books upon which they are based.  James Bond is much more vulnerable and not nearly as sinister as Sean Connery portrayed him.  Honey Rider is a much more complex character.  Her beauty is flawed by a broken nose caused when she was raped.  The movie softens this in a way that takes away from understanding her character.  Dr. No is much more menacing.  This book is not great literature but it is a worthwhile diversion.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|I got this cd from my uncle for christmas.  This was a couple days after joe's unfortunate death.  I think the clash had a lot of potential and are a influence on any rock group.  \\"London calling\\", \\" Lost in the supermarket\\" and \\" Clampdown\\" and great classical punk songs that will never fade through out the years.  The clash aren't as exciting as the sex pistols or misfits but they right classical punk rock.  Just plug this LP in your stereo and relax to the creativeness of the Clash
B00000JLWW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The special effects are excellent and you almost feel like you're right on the ship itself! The love story added in was pretty good, but that's not the reason I liked the movie so much. I am just obsessed with the Titanic! This movie tells the story of not only the two young lovers but also of the ship and what really happened. The 5 Stars that I gave were for the movie, but I have to say that the DVD itself was really really bad! There were no special features except for a theatrical trailer for this movie. They should have made this a 2 DVD set with behind the scenes footage, the specials run on various television channels and a walk through of the Titanic tour with all of the props and stuff. I saw that in Great America and thought it was very cool. Why didn't they do a mini tour of it and show it in the DVD? Besides those complaints about the DVD, the movie is awesome and a 5 Star flick. I watched it again this morning for a total of 4 times, 2 in the theater, 1 on the VHS edition, and 1 on the DVD edition. This is pretty much the VHS edition but with a trailer and only 1 disk. Buy it! It's a great movie (if not a good DVD.) Enjoy!
B000002LND|5.0|Almost all of her hits from 1983 until 1990. You can still hear them on the radio today.<BR>Holiday: I don't know why but I don't like this song. I am sick of all those Madonna-coverxs out there but you should check out Captain Jack'S version of this song. The singer has a nice voice.<BR>Lucky star: Typical 80'S-Popsong. Sweet<BR>Borderline: Like &quot;Lucky star&quot; but it'S more a dance-song.<BR>Like a vigin: I love this song. One of ther best.<BR>Material girl: That'S where she got her nickname from. There'S no better song to describe the early Madonna.<BR>Crazy for you: HEr first ballad. Something like that can only be sung by Madonna.<BR>Live to tell: Pretty ballad. Madonna can sing something like that without making vocalgymnastics (does that word exist?)<BR>Papa don't preach: None of my favourites but well written lyrics about teenage pregnancy.<BR>Open your heart: Another great dancesong.<BR>Lsa isla bonita: One of her big radiohits. is this Latinsong.<BR>I think the album version is better than the remixversion here. This is maybe her best song ever (along with &quot;Ray of light&quot;).<BR>Express yourself: Again the remixversion. Great for daning.<BR>Cherish: A sweet, sappy lovesong.<BR>Vogue: I had to get used to this discosong. Now it'S great.<BR>Justify my love: with this new song she takes a look into the future. It sounds like something from her Erotica-album only better.<BR>Rescue me: This sounds like a mix of the last two songs.<BR>Overall a great compilation but why are there edits of the first songs. and not the fullversions?
B00006SFLV|5.0|My (19 yr. old) neice told us (my 50ish childless wife and I) this was one of her favorite series and we thought why not put ourselves in her shoes for a few hours?  Boy was I surprised by just how good, and profound, this series was.  The writers/actors masterfully dealt with many of the classic issues our society confronts daily: vanity, love, betrayal, lust, disappointment, alienation, desertion, career burnout, mother/daughter relationships, etc.  And ultimately I think that is what did the series in; it was just a few years ahead of its time in its portrayal of these issues in a mainstream venue (i.e., network TV).  But there are gems here; I laughed out loud on many occasions (the \\"Pimple\\" episode is a classic) and nearly cried on several occasions as well (the episode where Ricky is beaten by his \\"uncle\\" and left homeless but is taken in for a short time by Angela's family and ultimately by one of his also gay teachers - now is that taking a risk for a series in 1994 or what?).  Another possible first is the fact that in the first (and unfortunately only) season, they have Halloween, Christmas and New Year's episdodes.  My only regret is that they cancelled the series after only one year - although my neice contents herself with the thought that, \\"But just think, it was so good it could only go downhill from that first season\\".
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love her voice and her style. After hearing DON'T KNOW WHY on the radio, I was convinced this would be a new addition to my collection.  After hearing the CD in its entirety Norah Jones, became one of my new favorites.  COLD COLD HEART and THE NEARNESS OF YOU are my favorites in addition to the popular DON'T KNOW WHY.  <br />This is a definite must have for the old time fans of Nina Simon, Gloria Lynn, and Billie Holiday.  She makes every song a poetic melody with profound lyrics and her searing voice.  She gives her own style to the older songs and a triumphant entrance with her new songs.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Granted, DVD's seem to be devoting more on the &quot;extras&quot; than the movie itself...<BR>  But there are features on this DVD that I will never use or want to use. The movie itself isnt that bad. Possibly a four star type movie, but the Infinifilm bit? Whats that all about?<BR>  Basically this review isnt going to give any information as far as buying. If you like Austin Powers, then get the movie. The deleted scenes are great and some of the features are pretty cool (theatrical trailers, music videos, etc). <BR>  I wanna know why movie studios dont put movies out with deleted scenes and give the option to watch the movie with the scenes in them?
B000002NG7|2.0|Some of which include &quot;Stripsearch,&quot; &quot;She Loves Me Not,&quot; &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; and &quot;Helpless,&quot; but the overall album feels very lackluster and cold. Whatever spark FNM had before this had died off almost completely by the time they made this, and much of it feels forced, painfully at times.  <br />This is interesting when you consider that many of the songs could in some way be about the band coming to grips with the fact that their beautiful collaboration was ending, but not very enjoyable to listen to on the whole. (Also, I seem to be in the minority here among FNM fans, but I preffered Trey Spruance's virtuosic yet classy and restrained guitar to that of Jim Martin or their third guitarist.)<br />Anyway, not bad or awful by any means, but the only time I've heard Patton sound like his heart just wasn't in the material he was singing, which is a shame indeed. He (and the rest of the band) called it quits at just the right time, for just the right reasons.
B00006IUL7|5.0|A couple of Hollywood legends are in top form and a newcomer director proves his first mind-bender wasn't a fluke.  This movie revolves around Will Dormer (Al Pacino at his dreary best) who has come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a rather brutal murder.  A girl was beaten senseless but than the killer carefully cleaned up the corpse to hide his deed.  But just as Will is on to him, he accidently (or was it an accident) shoots his partner while chasing the killer in the fog.  Then, the killer and Will begin a game of wits, a taunt cat and mouse game that pits each others souls, and lives, on the line.  Will past comes into play, and the killers real intentions.<br />The film is made ever the more suspenseful by the razor sharp directing of Christopher Nolan, the mind behind last years \\"Memento.\\"  He gives the film a sense of wild motion, to simulate the emotions and the slowly slipping mind of Dormer, who cannot get an ounce of sleep becasue of the 24 hour sunlight of Alaskas summer.  He also gets the best out of his actors, who all are in their best mode for movie making.  We don't only know the characters from the expertly written script, but also from the actors expressions, gestures and vocal inflections.  In other words, you don't need the well-written script to get the characters emotions and personality.<br />Al Pacino is the best part of this movie.  His perfect portrayal of the conflicted Dormer goes down as one of the best performances he has turned in.  Though he will proably be forgotten, he should at least be considered by the Academy for his work in this film.  ot to mention director Christopher Nolan and the sinister Robin Williams, who  turns in a truly creepy performance in his role as a small town writer.
B0000640VO|5.0|...to like this movie, but I was very pleasantly provoked by this feel-good movie.  I might have created an unwarrented idea that this would be a &quot;chick flick&quot; in my head.<br />As a 19-year-old male, I am skeptical of any movie that would be put in the romance category.  This is not a romance in my book.  If it is, I chose not to appreaciate it for the romantic characteristics but the intelligent subplots.  I am glad to say that I found myself laughing out loud during moments of the movie.  A task which is usually only drawn by slapstick comedy and lude jokes.

0930289455|2.0|Alan Moore is probably the best comic book writer of all time. But while he puts real work into his major projects, sometimes he just throws things out there for a paycheck. This book falls into the latter category. Unlike Frank Miller, who both studied and redefined Batman and the Joker, Moore clearly didn't do his homework here. Both of them are completely out of character with the rest of the series. Perhaps the worst part of the writing is the portrayal of the Joker's \\"insanity.\\" Sure, he explains how he went insane. But his explanation is perfectly sane. In fact, everything the Joker does in this book is either sane or simply random (and the random acts are carried out just for the sake of doing something randomly: the Joker is trying to prove his insanity). Save your money and get Dark Knight Returns or Batman: Year One instead.
0786222328|5.0|This is the second time I read this book.  The small print is now uncomfortable for me so I purchased a hardcover, large print edition for myself for Christmas.  Great idea!<br />Not only was the magic of the children's story still there for me to enjoy but now the true wonder of the spiritual touched my heart.  Was it the large print or was it that I am now 60 years old and 'see' things differently?  Who knows, who cares - what difference does it make.  I was blessed to feel like reading this story once again and did so.  You can be sure I will read it again.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers is the second part of Peter Jackson's trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's epic fantasy masterpiece, the Lord of the Rings.<br />The Fellowship of the Ring has just been broken and our heroes are now all heading in different directions, all following their own paths. Merry and Pippin have just been captured by a horde of Saruman's foul Huruk-Haï who, following the sorcerer's orders, are taking them to his tower of Isengard, and Aragorn the Heir of Gondor, Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf are running to their rescue across the plains of Rohan, land of the Rohirim horsemasters. Taking the advantage of a clash between the orcs and a band of Rohirim, the hobbits manage to escape into Fangorn, the old forest, home of the legendary Ents. There they'll meet an old acquaintance.<br />Meanwhile Frodo, the Ring-bearer, and his friend Sam are on their way to Mordor. It won't be long until they become lost, nor before they realize they're not alone. Gollum, the filthy creature who once possessed the One Ring, has been following them all along. They capture him, but soon Frodon takes pity and decides to release him in exchange for Gollum's word that he'll guide them to Mordor.<br />Once again, Peter Jackson managed to bring to screen the enchanting spirit of JJR Tolkien's complex novels. I personally liked Gollum's character a lot, as well as admired the creature's beautiful computer graphics animation. And the Battle of Helm's Deep, the terrible final conflagration between Th&eacute;oden's people and Saruman's army of ten thousand orcs, is just as formidable. I'll have to read these books again!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This movie has so many outstanding character portrayals.  When you are finished watching you almost want to start it over again from the beginning.  That's how powerful this movie can be.  The soundtrack is also a must own for any lover of classic rock.
B00000JHAU|4.0|5.4 million people, more if you count Sean Connery, ( I don't, but that's a whole nuther story, mate ) and look what they've done to music.  I'm not talking about the bagpipe thing, though &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; on pipes is pretty scary the first time, isn't it?<BR>I'm talking about Cocteau Twins, The Beta Band, Jesus and Mary Chain, Del Amitri, and Belle and Sebastian.  It's a heavy burden to be a sublimely clever soft rock band in the 20th Century.  No flippin' market for it, for starters, but worse, you have to write songs.  None of this three chord business, with crashing drums and tons of feedback.  No.  And then there are the rhymes.  I'm thinking of 'Fox in the Snow'.  If you're looking for songs that have those nice moon/June rhymes, you're plumb out of luck.  All you've got here is a fresh melody, an ironic storyline, some fine guitar picking, rich string backing, and a vocal that lets you understand all the words. Rather than go thru all the songs -- you can do that yourselves -- I'll point out that there are no bad apples here.  Just peaches, the kind you like, Brad and Daphne, if those are your names.<BR>Belle and Sebastian has carved out a very small niche, but they know what they are doing better than any other band I can think of, and they are undetered from pursuing their ideal of artistic integrity. I give this release 4.5 stars.
B000002KBH|1.0|This is an incredibly mediocre album.  It's one-dimensional, Jerry has a weak voice, and it's all together one of the most overrated bands in America.  Just because they went more commercial and have more merchandise than any other band, that doesnt make then the best.  A true rock 'n' roll fan would recommend ANY album by &quot;The Band&quot; as opposed to this... I suggest &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; or &quot;The Best of the Band&quot;
B000002BYA|5.0|Simply magic, you get the feeling you are in the concert!!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I read the book \\"Band of Brothers\\" written by Stephen Ambrose, concurrently with watching the dvd series,(which I rented one disc at a time). As soon as I am finished with this review, I am ordering the set. This is definitely a keeper! I enjoyed this mini-series more than any other, possibly more than \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". The series follows the book better than any two hour movie could possibly hope to, and the book was excellent. The attention to detail is oustanding. The actors are mostly unknowns,(with the exception of David Schwimmer, (Ross from \\"Friends\\"),who does a great job as the infamous hardass Capt. Sobel of the Toccoa boot camp days), and they perform admirably. If you are at all interested in WWII, YOU MUST SEE THIS.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Okay, for all five-star reviewers out there, imagine what you would give this album if it weren't Chris and Rage.  Uh huh, thought so.<br />Names can only carry an album so far.  Eventually you should have the MUSIC to back it up.  Cochise gets you up and running, but they're stuck in third gear the rest of the way!  Am I the only one who wishes that this album rocked more like the \\"Louder Than Love\\" days of old?<br />There's nothing memorable here.  Still, it's better than most of the stuff out nowadays  (Avril Lavigne anyone?).  Maybe they'll wake up on the next album.
B00005JJX8|4.0|After reading some of the customer reviews here on Amazon.com, I almost didn't purchase this DVD.  \\"To Catch A Thief\\" is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies of all time (yes, I know it's not \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Rear Window\\" or \\"North By Northwest\\" -- but \\"To Catch A Thief\\" wasn't supposed to be serious, it was simply Hitch & some friends having fun!), and I already owned the video.  So when I read that the DVD was little improved from the admittedly poor video, I opted not to buy it.  Then my video went south, and I was forced to a DVD purchase.<br />Imagine my happy surprise when the colors leaped off the screen at me, when the crispness of the pictures knocked my socks off!!  Wow!!  Whoever wrote that this DVD is \\"washed out\\" probably needs a new TV.  Granted, I'd love to see this movie digitally remastered -- and soon!! -- but until that happens this DVD is a far better version of this movie than any I've ever seen.  I am unfortunately too young to have seen the original in the theatres, but I'd have to guess that this DVD comes pretty close.  I'm frankly thrilled with it!!<br />Cary Grant is wonderful, Grace Kelly is divine, the supporting cast (especially John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis) get their chops in, and a good time is had by one and all.  And even beyond the stunning visuals, the scintillating dialogue and clever wordplay are easily worth the price of the movie!  Don't look for Hitch's usual suspense or intrigue here; there's relatively little of those to be had.  Rather, think of \\"To Catch A Thief\\" more as a very stylish romantic comedy, filmed in the inimitable Hitchcock fashion.<br />My vote is four stars -- a very worthy effort, and a happy new purchase, but still a movie that could stand a serious remastering!!  If that ever happens, I'll buy that DVD, too!!  (That's a hint.)
B000066AXC|3.0|I thought highly of this movie until I actually watched it. This film is not entirely bad but it's not entirely good either.<BR>While watching it, I spent a good amount of time waiting for something to happen. It was a bit dull and drawn out most of the time. the dialogue was also equally dull and predictable. As for directing, Ron Howard hasn't done anything that impressive. <BR><BR>I understand that the directors of In the Bedroom and Fellowship the Ring were also nominated in the best director category. Both deserved the award more than Howard. <BR>Especialy when you consider the fact that what Peter Jackson did (and is still doing with) Lord of The Rings was revolutionary. Fellowship of the Rings is a masterpiece that will go down in history. A Beautiful Mind, a piece of sentimental, hollywood nonsense, certainly will not. After that helicopter shot of Nash riding his bicycle in the mathematical infinity symbol with what was supposed to be inspiring music playing in the background, I had to resist the temptation of pushing the stop/eject button on my VCR. <BR>The message was indeed inspiring. Jenifer's performance was excellent. But that's about it. In fact, if you wan't so see Jenifer at her best, go rent Requiem for a Dream.
B00000K31Q|4.0|I originally thought it would be another lame, teen comedy with a thin plot but I was quite impressed with the humor and lovable characters found in this movie.  Newcomers Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger add a sparkle to the mix.  If you need a good laugh or something to watch with a date, this is the movie!
0064409422|4.0|The first and one of the best of the Narnian Chronicles.   One of the strengths of the series is the creation of children who are human and fallible yet also noble as the \\"Seven Friends of Narnia.\\"  And the narrator of the audiobook, Michael York, couldn't be better. Even though he might be a bit corny, I like it; it's appropriate for children's stories. I like the way he says, \\"One should never lock oneself in a wardrobe.\\"
B00003CWL6|3.0|Grant it that this has been an original portrayel of modern day life and is deserving of some recognition, however I don't believe this is an award winning film.  I do agree that the character development and depth of each character was interesting.  Also, I was disappointed that the &quot;Awards Edition&quot; really didn't include any worthy bonus features.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|t.A.T.u. will certainly give the part of the music industry concerned with teen-pop divas quite a shock.<br />This duo, composed of Russian teens Lena Katina and Julia Volkova, are a product of music-video mastermind and executive producer Ivan Shapovalov.  The good thing about this is that Shapovalov is much smarter than the pop-music marketing geniuses who signed Britney a few years ago.  Ms. Spears may sell a sexy image, just as t.A.T.u. do, but Lena and Julia have two things that make all the difference:  vibrant electronic music and a habit of acting like a lesbian couple.<br />t.A.T.u. masterfully pull off their wonderfully cheeky, sassy image without being downright skanky (à la Christina's \\"Dirrty\\" video).  Their songs seem less like the afterthoughts of a greed-driven record company than those of America's clichéd pop princesses.  The lead single, \\"All the Things She Said,\\" puts the Russian-language single from the million-plus selling '200 Po Vstrechnoy' into English with striking results.  It tells a story of two girls in love, wanting to flee from the disapproval they face from their families, backed by soaring synthesizers, sturdy beats, and a subtle-yet-immovable bass line (produced by Frankie Goes to Hollywood producer Trevor Horn).  Lena and Julia's voices don't hurt, either.  These girls are truly talented singers (also unlike some of America's favorite female pop vocalists).<br />On '200 km/h in theWrong Lane,' several of t.A.T.u.'s Russian tracks are re-imagined in English (as \\"All the Things She Said\\" was), mainly staying true to their original musical arrangements.  A welcome change, though, is found in \\"Malchik Gay,\\" which incorporates acoustic guitar for a more stripped-down approach.  A submerged-sounding Russian chorus is left intact in one part, as are Russian rap sections in \\"Stars\\" (\\"Zachem Ya\\" in Russian).  These pieces leave some of the original feeling and intensity in the songs that can't be translated out:  the (misspelled) all-Russian tracks \\"Ya Shosla S Uma\\" (\\"All the Things She Said\\") and \\"Nas Ne Dagoniat\\" (\\"Not Gonna Get Us\\") provide excellent examples.<br />'200 km/h' has a good deal of diversity from song to song.  \\"30 Minutes\\" is possibly the album's most beautiful song.  It opens with a whispered plea for forgiveness.  Then an icy piano line moves steadily along as a clock ticks and Lena and Julia laugh hauntingly in the distance.  The chorus is unhurried, fluidly sung, and backed by chilling pizzicato strings, creating the album's most quiet yet most lush moment.  In contrast, \\"Not Gonna Get Us,\\" the album's opener, is full of beats, with an almost urgent, empowering chorus sung as airplanes fly overhead:  \\"Nothing can stop this, not now I love you/They're not gonna get us.\\"  t.A.T.u. also cover the Smiths' \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" exercising the outer limits of their ranges.  \\"Show Me Love\\" and \\"Clowns (Can You See Me Now?)\\" are well-balanced, wonderfully sung songs that demonstrate the producers' sensible use of electronic and industrial noise with strings and piano, in addition to Lena and Julia's voices.  This sound is unique.  This sound is t.A.T.u. and their songs of love.
0743216385|5.0|I served at Ft. Campbell back in 1989 for only 6 months before my service was over. I got my air assualt badge while there, but I never really had time to research the history of my departing station. 13 years later I have become so proud that I too have a screaming eagle on my btu's. The soldiers of Easy Company had a hell of job to do, and did that job well. This book gives you the feeling you are there with the troops. The circumstances these troopers where put in is well described in this book , and leaves you with the understanding of who our heros really are! I couldn't put it down.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|As an owner of many concert DVD's, the sound on this is amazing.  Metallica sonically shine on this DVD.  It will knock your socks off with or w/o a Home Theater System.  Metallica play with emotion and they are captured beautifully with inventive camera angles that seem to coincide with the music especially during the opening of One.  The making-of documentary is a treat for fans as it shows the band at their most honest.  I'm sure Metallica's other DVD's showcase that aspect better but I thought it was interesting.  Everyone has something to say on track selection here, so I will add my two cents as well.  Devil's Dance, Fuel, Memory Remains all sound good with the symphony but aren't very good songs, especially with the early catalog of Metallica's music.  Songs like Fade to Black, Unforgiven, Sanitarium, could have been incredible additions and could have made this concert something special.  Fuel is too fast for the symphony and just sounds odd.  The 2 new songs are OK but nothing groundbreaking.  However, the 2 tracks that make this DVD worth owning are Master of Puppets and One.  These are incredible songs on their own but coupled with a good symphonic arrangement and perfect sound and a gutsy vocal performance, these songs flat out pound your audio system and are visually impressive.  Enter Sandman is another concert staple and sounds great as well with the addition of the symphony, however, the guitars are a bit muted.  An honarble mention is the hyper-fast Battery.  A long favorite of mine from the PUPPETS album, it quite possibly sounds better here, than it does on the remastered album.  Metallica play with guts here and in my opinion, sound incredible with the symphony in most cases.  All in all, worth owning to wow your friends if you have a nice sound system and if you are a fan.  My only gripe aside from track selection, is the somewhat muddy production and the average picture quality.  The Eagles DVD has a much clearer picture.  Highly recommended and worn your neighbors because it will shake your room.
0393317552|4.0|As the saying goes, when you have a hammer, everything looks like nails.  I found Diamond's basic hypothesis that the march to civilization is accelerated (if not determined) by availability of useful, domesticable plants and animals and a geography suited for the transmission of the plants and animals (and later ideas) over a large distance very compelling.<br />The two places he fails in what would otherwise be one of the best books I've read is he seems to be working toward a personal agenda, and he applies his theories to inappropriate situations.  His personal agenda is not hidden, with his discussion of New Guinea's tribesmen fairly glowing.  I guess it's better to have it out in the open than hidden, but it makes the work seem like a justification for his preconceptions rather than an unbiased research into the broad strokes of history.  <br />His very compelling basic point is that when numerous small groups (tribes, etc) compete, the rate of adoption, modification, and usage of available resources will be fairly constant across any group of people.  The rate is only modified by the quality of those resources and the number of people with access to them, because if one society fails to use its resources at the best rate of human invention, a competing society will force the adoption either through competition or conquest.  <br />The problem is, and he acknowledges it in one sentence and ignores it in another, is that when societies (especially dictatorial ones) no longer feel competitive pressure, they can behave in largely unpredictable ways governed only by happenstance and psychology.  He tries to explain the failures of the Aztecs and (especially) the Incas to use the wheel by describing them as \\"Island Cultures\\" since they did not have competing societies nearby.  He later uses the same argument about China. <br />The problem is that there is a range between small tribes and enormous islands where his theory only partially applies, and where much of written history has occurred.  His arguments to explain why Europe was not one big island (meaning politically unified) were not very compelling, but given the fact that Europe wasn't unified his theory does explain why the West outpaced China in the past 600 years.  His troubling assertion that the fertile crescent couldn't compete with Europe in modern times merely due to resource depletion (since it had been civilized for so long) was only in passing and lacked much backing in statistics or research.<br />Unlike some other reviewers, I don't feel he was too hard on the West's modern conquest of the native peoples of the Pacific, the Americas, and Africa.  He points out that disease made the lands empty, and that much of the pushing out of the natives was inadvertent due to the actions of people behaving just as our prehistoric ancestors did (and every other continent's ancestors did) for thousands of years.  And when he chooses the words \\"exterminated\\" (in modern colonization) over \\"displaced\\" (in prehistoric colonization) he does it because he has the historical facts to back him up in one case, and only conjecture in the other, and he acknowledges the difference at least a few times.<br />I definitely recommend this book if you are unfamiliar with the geographical element of the prehistoric move to civilization.  Just keep in mind this is a theory that by nature no longer applies, and stopped applying somewhere between 100-600 years ago as modern communication destroyed geographic separation.
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden is not a underrated band but they have several albums that are, sadly. Somewhere In Time is one of those said albums. I think a lot of people were turned off by the use of synthesizers and the very epic feel of all the songs but they can stop whining and just continue to miss of the all time great albums that this has become. As the title and cover art would suggest, the album has a very futuristic feel and it has a very spacey feel. Sadly, Maiden has forgotten about these songs live wise but that's what albums are for :) This is your classic maiden that you will find on Powerslave or Piece Of Mind and contains the same scorching riffs but everything has a slicked up futurisitc feel to it. I can't explain it well, you'll just have to listen to it. <br />Several songs on here are the best that Maiden have written and those are: Alexander The Great, Sea oF Madness, and The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner. The latter is one of my favorite all time songs. <br />In short, Iron Maiden is a band full of awesome albums for you to listen to and enjoy but I highly, highly, suggest this one. <br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005KFUM|5.0|This has to be the greatist album ever made! It is simply superb. I'm not a geat fan of the slower songs such as citizen erased but they are still good to listen to. If you can try and get the cd with 2 extra tracks:dead star+can't take my eyes off of you. If you fell in the mood for a bit of air guitar megolamania is excelent. If you just want to chill in your front room or bedroom then play it from the start. If you havent got any muse albums get this first then showbiz as this is a little better. Virgin megastores have it for 4.99 so go and get it!
0375414053|4.0|I thought Pearson's book was right on the money.  This is a must read for any busy mother trying to juggle both working outside the home and motherhood.  Kate Reddy expresses many of the feelings about working, husbands, and motherhood that many of us may have felt from time to time.  Kate Reddy could be my British twin!
B00006AG5N|3.0|How come &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot; is not here but &quot;Burning Love&quot; is,despite the fact that it never got to no 1 in either England or America? And that hokey remix of A little less conversation doesn't help,but overall,not bad.
B00006RU5B|1.0|i love chris cornell, never dug rage against the machine. this has chris cornell screaming 'i did it for the money/much needed exposure' written all over it. tom morello proves once and for all that his guitar playing never developed past most 12 year olds and has managed to rewrite the same 3 and 4 note riffs yet again. i wonder how many times at rehearsal does someone say,'wait, have we written this already?'<br />even the songs obviously written by cornell(the ones with actual chords)kind [are not that good] suck.these songs sound like stuff my friends and i wouldve come up with when we were 14-15 and then trashed because they were ... the most diverse thing morello does here is play the exact same riffs detuned so that its the same thing, but a different key. tool is doing this too, come on guys listen to something new and get some inspiration going. even rabid fans wont fall for the same deal time and time again. or maybe they will. if you like chris cornell/soundgarden avoid this like the plague.
B00002Z88D|5.0|It was really hard to make this album for the metalliboyz and it was clear that it was going to like you or disappoint you with no mid point in the opinions of fans. But they made two awesome concerts in San Franciso with an almost perfect setlist.<BR>The hightlights are: Ktulu, Puppets, Fuel, Bleeding Me, NEM, Bellz, Outlaw, One and Battery.<BR>But of course, the best of the cds are No Leaf Clover and - Human, song that might have said what it was going to be the direction of an album in 2001(but Jason changed that for good or bad, we'll see in June). The orchestra plays in a very efficient way that makes you think that they (with Metallica)were playing for many years.Jaymz sings with such power and melody, Lars is very inspired and Kirk &amp; Jason just play with all their talents. Metallica has still future in the music, people. This is a must-have for any Metallica fan. One advice, try to go to a Metallica concert in the future. I never had the chance and I sure I will go to see them because they worth to be seen and be heard. Play it loud!
B000002JAX|5.0|I heard a single from this CD on NPR in December, 2002.  I got the chills and immediately bought the CD.  Simply incredible.  Saw her play that same weekend at a small club (50-75 people) in Arlington, Virginia.  Tremendous show especially her Vie en Rose.<br />During the show and banter, she mentioned a new album due out next year.  Her accompanying guitar player corrected her and said next month.
6305127638|5.0|I'm not a huge Star Trek fan.  I've seen a few of the shows.  I watched this movie just recently and loved it.  The story was fantastic.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is an awesome DvD that is packed with extra features including the making of &quot;the matrix&quot; and others. The main movie is great too with extra scenes deleted from tv, and enhanced picture. Obviously, we all know the story of the matirx, a man realizes that his world is a computer simulation, and a man named morpoheus is set to free him from the &quot;program&quot;, because he believes he is the one who can put an end to it. This movie is awesome, and i can't wait until the sequal comes out this summer.
B00005MK6Y|5.0|This SACD is multichannel so the music has been remixed.  And the remix is simply amazing.  The drums sound as if your in the room with them.  The guitars are so present that you'd swear that Jeff was in the room with you. Even modern recordings rarely ever sound this good on my home system. As for the material this is Jeff Beck at this best.  Of course it didn't hurt to have George Martin handling the production.
B00002E23E|5.0|I absolutly love Led Zeppelin's music. Every single member of the band is extremely talented, and they bring it all together to make a sound that to describe as extroadinary would be an understatement. Its almost depressing that I was born in this time period, and I don't have the chance of seeing them all together in concert. But then i found this DVD. and even though i can't see them live, this DVD is the closest I can get, and i love it. The only thing I don't like about it is when they show these totally weird fantasy shots of the band members, and i mean its cool and how that they have these like dreams and all, but I wish there was more footage of them playing. But honestly, that is the only thing that i don't like about this DVD. If you are a zeppelin fan, and love their music, this DVD is a must-have!...
B00000ILBK|3.0|When I watched ST:Insurrection,it starts well and has wonderful outdoor set design.So how come it ends up being a little boring?<BR>Well firstly because Rick Berman made the huge mistake of not using ILM for the effects and the result is very disappointing special effects. The new company that Rick Berman replaced ILM with was inexperienced at compositing the space special effects and they just don't look right.The final shot of a plastic looking Enterprise zooming off is the worst movie effect for the ship ever.It looks fake,as does some of the other special effects. The second big mistake is that,just like in STTMP and ST5,the characters are not in control but instead are either running away or being captured. Even the Enterprise is running away,and in a very disappointing battle their solution is to collect explosive gas while under fire and release it hoping that the enemy might shoot at it and blow up... What fans really wanted was an in-control Riker to outwit the enemy and fire the photons,taking chunks out of the enemy...<BR>The film plods along because of this and becomes a little flat. But on the positive side,it was nice to see the Data character used correctly and the other support characters do get some good lines. The outdoor scenes are the biggest in Trek history and the mountains and lake are spectacular.The film does have a warm hearted theme and is a good family movie. But what a pity that Ric Berman didn't use ILM as they made a huge difference to the previous two STTNG films.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is by far the best CD I own.  Most live CD's lack something... this one by far does not.  It has more spirit than the other CD's I own by her.  I would say- if you're thinking about buying this CD, do buy it, it's well worth your money.  ...
0060090383|5.0|I have given this book to several people since I have read it. I can't remember the last time I liked a book so much that I wanted everyone I know to read it!<br />This was the first book by Marian Keyes that I had read (I have since read several more.) The fact that she took a very serious subject (alcohol and drug addiction) and made it hilarious is really great. And don't think she's making fun of the subject, she is just showing all sides if this  problem and the treatmet in the character of Rachel and her counterparts. If you know anything about these subjects and how treatment programs work, this book is for you. Rachel is the epitome of denial when it comes to her problems, as are most addicts. I absolutely love the character of Rachel! I want to know more about how her life went on, so I am hoping she will appear in some more of Ms. Keye's books. I will reread this book (something I don't normally do either)and probably reread it again.
B00006RINF|5.0|As of this writing, this cd has an Amazon sales rank of 2,703.  I suppose that the reality is it will never get that much higher -- which is a crying shame because (assuming you are reading this review) you are contemplating buying one of 2002's best releases.  If you like your music to be heavy and atmospheric, and don't mind electronic flourishes here and there, I can almost guaranty that this record will not disappoint you.<BR>I've been a fan of the Coil for awhile, and have most of their recorded output.  For those unfamiliar, they play a style of music that sort of melds metal, hard rock and goth with touches of electronica -- a style that I have heard referred to as \\"darkwave.\\"  They have two vocalists, one male and one female, who share vocal responsibilities.  Their main strength has always been Christina Scabbia's voice, which is strong, clear, high but not too high, and emotive.  She could mesmerize you even if she is singing a grocery list.  Their main weakness, most noticeable in their last release, has been a tendency to write very similar-sounding songs.  The band is more than competent, musically, but their songwriting was never terribly varied.<BR>\\"Comalies,\\" though is a huge step forward in the songwriting department.  This is in part due to an increased electronica element, most noticeable on \\"Daylight Dancer\\" and \\"Tight Rope\\" -- which are also two of the record's highlights.  The songs in general are more varied and interesting in their structure.  Also, Andrea Ferro (the male vocalist) has much improved.  He accounts for around 30% to 40% of the vocals on the album, and they are all clean -- though some border on a shouted/screamed approach.<BR>Aside from the two aforementioned songs, \\"Swamped,\\" \\"The Ghost Woman and the Hunter,\\" \\"Angel's Punishment,\\" and \\"Comalies\\" are all high points.  All in all, this is a phenomenal record offering a varied and balanced selection of emotion-charged atmospheric music.  Highly recommended.<BR>Tracklist: 1) Swamped 2) Heaven's a Lie 3) Daylight Dancer 4) Humane 5) Self Deception 6) Aeon 7) Tight Rope 8) The Ghost Woman and the Hunter 9) Unspoken 10) Entwined 11) The Prophet Said 12) Angel's Punishment 13) Comalies.  A limited edition version also contains a track, entitled \\"Lost Lulluby,\\" that didn't \\"fit\\" on the last album.
B00005JKZT|5.0|If you have the good fortune (which I did not) of seeing \\"The Two Towers\\" in a theater that doesn't contain a man coughing his brains out with an obvious case of neo-Bubonic Plague strain, then you, my friend, are in for treat.  \\"The Two Towers\\" not only lives up to the grandeur and unmatched spectacle of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" it surpasses it with a greater focus on character and a subdued (but still prominent) focus on exposition.  It is also obvious now, when all is said and done, that Peter Jackson's trilogy will be considered the greatest achievement in the history of cinematic fantasy.  Critics that bash it now as too long or for fantasy geeks only will have to eat crow when these movies are still beloved decades from now.<br />How did Jackson do it?  How did he make a film like \\"The Two Towers,\\" one that cost over $100 million to make and yet still feels entirely handmade?  How did he keep a story compelling that should have run out of gas long ago?  However he did it (one assumes it involved lots of late hours and an inordinate amount of help), you the viewer get the end product, and what a sight it is to see.  \\"Two Towers\\" avoids the plodding narrative of \\"Fellowship\\" by breaking up its main characters into groups.  With three main storylines going on at once, Jackson alternates between subplots so that the story never grows too stale.  It also has a stronger grip on characters, showing them in moments other than fighting or running away, and that actually helps the film breeze by (3 hours have never passed so quickly, unless you slept through Dances with Wolves).<br />And you never feel like you see the same thing twice during \\"Towers.\\"  There are always new things to see, new places to go, or new homages to be alert for (in particular one to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" at the gates of Mordor).  Of special note is Gollum, the CGI creature who never feels forced into the picture.  He's a real character, and at no point does he just feel like a cartoon stuck in a live action flick.<br />Are there problems with \\"Towers\\"?  Sure.  The bad guys have terrible aim and the good guys, natch, do not.  There's so much latent homoerotism between Frodo and Sam you half expect them to start kissing halfway in.  And Jon Rhys-Davies jokes are a little corny, but welcome relief in a movie this intense.  There's also not enough of the prominent villains (Christopher Lee's Saruman or the evil Sauron).  Still, movies don't get much better than this, and \\"Towers\\" seems to only justify Peter Jackson's growing legacy.  A triumph.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I missed this growing up. I became a fan of artists like Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe and made the mistake of lumping the Clash in with no talents like The Sex Pistols. Boy, was I wrong. LONDON CALLING is a perfect blend of punk, reggae, and good old-fashioned rock and roll. The songs are wonderful examples of rock played with emotion and talent; a little rough around the edges, but with a controlled fury only found in the greateset music. Lyrically, the songs comment on love, greed, and the violence that can be found in every day life. While the themes can be occasionally heavy-handed, some songs are often sung with tongue planted firmly in cheek. This is easily one of the best recordings to come out of the 70's and it holds up just as well today.

0679720200|5.0|After reading this book in high school, I wrote an essay about what it would be like to spend the day with Mersault, the completely unsympathetic, detached main character of this novel. My essay had him doing many of the things he did in the book, going to the beach, eating, messing around with his girlfriend and completely ignoring everyone around him. I understood, sympathized with the character and, to my shock and horror, identified with what Mersault was going through.<br />Are we truly alive if we exist only to please ourselves, if no one else matters to us and we, in turn, matter to no one else? Is empathy a necessary aspect of humanity?<br />In the second half of the book, Mersault's situation teaches him to care for others, to care about how his own actions (primarily the killing of the Arab, which he did because the sun was in his eyes and because he was annoyed) affect the people and the world around him. He learns to weep for himself, as his death approaches he sees how little his life matters, because of the way he conducted it.<br />The first sentence of the novel is key. \\"Maman died today - or maybe yesterday.\\" The sentence speaks to how little anyone, even his own mother, mattered to Mersault. People in his life were just there to provide means to an end. That she's dead is an annoyance, taking him away from other things he'd rather be doing. It's very, very sad.<br />He's a \\"stranger\\" because he doesn't care to know anyone - not because no one knows him.
B000062Y98|5.0|Seriously people, these guys cant help but get better in various ways in this album, yet remain in the past in a few others. While most agree that their heavier stuff in the past were their highlights, I find their bombastic turnaround to be a good, predictable one, and this comes from a person who doesnt like dream theater. Hansis voice just keeps getting more powerfull with each album, and its natural for the music to keep changing in that broad, sonorous direction. The only weak song in this album would be 5, too slow, so its good to see most keep a good pace. And while they stay in the past by keeping the bombastic direction of their previous album, you never know what curball these guys might throw in the future.  Furthermore, its cool to see them sing in spanish, since, Colombian born myself, its interesting to see them sing in my native language, and I hope for more of that in the future. Also, they rule live, so check em out wherever possible! Worth the travel.
B0000025KI|4.0|I can`t believe that he recorded songs like you can look,Cadillac Ranch,Ramrod and I`m a rocker.But if you forget those songs and listen to claccics like The River,Point Blank, Hungry Heart,Independence Day and Jackson Cage you realise that this is a good album.3,5 stars

B00006RU5B|4.0|When I first heard about the former members of Rage Against The Machine picking ex-Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell as a new singer for a new project, I didn't know what to think. I mean, I'm a HUGE Soundgarden fan and I miss them a lot...and I'm also a big fan of Rage Against The Machine.  Somehow, I couldn't see how Cornell's unique vocals could blend with the hip-hop-meets-Black-Sabbath sound of the ex-Rage members.  Then I heard the album's first single \\"Cochise\\" on the radio, and I was fairly impressed.  I wasn't blown away by it, but it was enough to prove to me that the band could work.  Once the album (under the name \\"Audioslave\\") came out, I went and picked it up.  It was THEN that I was blown away.  As much as I love the song \\"Cochise\\", it doesn't do the album justice as a single. Songs like \\"Show Me How To Live\\", \\"Gasoline\\", and \\"Shadow On The Sun\\" just rock so hard!...  Audioslave is like a modern-day Led Zeppelin.  It's very hard rock n' roll, yet it's very passionate and emotional music.  The ex-members of RATM still have the same sound they did on albums like \\"Evil Empire\\" and \\"Battle Of Los Angeles\\", but when you listen to songs like \\"Set It Off\\", \\"Like A Stone\\", and many others, you can tell they are going into new territory as well. Chris Cornell sings has hard and passionate as he ever did with Soundgarden, and no matter what you might think, his voice fits in perfectly with the music. This album better get a lot of attention, because it deserves it! It's been awhile since we've seen a rock album like this one, but this is what a lot of people (including myself) have been waiting for. I have as much faith in these guys as I did in Soundgarden OR Rage. Fans of both bands will appriciate this album from beginning to end.
078322687X|5.0|This has to be the most bizzare thing!  I saw \\"The Breakfast Club\\" when I was sixteen, on December 30, 1982.  I remember so well because it was the ONLY date I had during my high school years, THE ONLY ONE (and I graduated in 1984)!!!  Yet, I keep reading that this movie came out in 1985.  Well, no matter, it was the best movie I ever saw.  Here we are, some 15-20 years later and people still like it.  It was absolutely great!
B00005JLWL|4.0|Every once and a while a film comes along that has had almost no advertising or even a decent release to the general public, alas the purgatory of limited released and art house films. Yet in the case of Equilibrium I am more amazed as to why this never received a wider release. Upon seeing the movie I honestly did not have high expectations other then to see some cool gunplay and martial arts as the star of the film. While this factor did prove to be entertaining the true star belongs to the finely crafted script which pays homage to such novels as \\"Brave New World\\", \\"1984\\", and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". <br />The story places the viewer in the post-apocalyptic world of the future. Having suffered the aftermath of World War III the survivors banned together to form a new society one which would rid them of humanities greatest flaw, emotions. Controlled by a drug, which nullifies such senses the future is a utopia free from war, yet enslaved to those that wield power and the establishment created. Art, music, literature, all these are banned and the penalty for committing such sense-crimes is death.<br />The most feared of the establishment's protectors is the Cleric. A group of men trained in mind and body to be the perfect killing machines and the poster children of their ideals. One such Cleric, whom even executed his own partner for reading a book of poems, begins to see the world in a new light when he misses his regular dose and experiences a flood of emotions he had never felt before. While trying to maintain his duty he finds the cruel sadism of his appointed task almost more then he can bear. In a desperate search he tries to find the resistance and bring an end to the madness he has safeguarded.<br />Christian Bale, playing the Cleric, is incredible giving depth and emotion to a role that demanded none. In this he makes the film all the more deeper. The cinematic style and editing while borrowed from such filmmakers as John Woo and Tsui Hark brings enough freshness while adapting such styles. The art direction is fitting in creating a claustrophobic world of grim lies. Although the backdrops of the city are not that impressive and are obviously CG effects. The music which is at times dark and laced with the foreboding conflict arising and then it is a fast paced techno score which sets the pace for the gun fire without missing a beat. <br />In all Equilibrium is a Science Fiction fans dream come true, yet it is also a film that can be enjoyed by fans of classic literature as well. While the ending may seem over-simplified I actually found it to hold deeper meaning as well as an interesting commentary on humanity in general. But most will just be thrilled at the ending ten-minute gunfight, with an impressive sword duel to boot. Equilibrium contains strong violence and language and is recommend for ages 17 and up. For once style and substance collide on celluloid.
0792833279|4.0|\\"Get Shorty \\" in my opinion is one of the most hilarious send ups of the Hollywood movie industry ever put to film.Director, Barry Sonnenfeld and writer, Elmore Leonard have put their talents together to create a satirical film, which 'takes no prisoners' in its look at the underhanded ways, that folks wheel and deal to get movies made.The film centers on a charismatic mobster (John Travolta), who while on a trip to L.A., decides to switch careers. He wants to make movies!This is not as far fetched as it seems. Apparently being a movie producer isn't that far of a jump from being a loan shark or racketeer! Along the way Chilly meets up with with a schlock movie producer, a scream queen, a L.A. hood and his henchman, another mobster from Miami and finally the 'Shorty' (a self-involved, superstar actor)of the film's title. All of them underestimate Chilly and think he is just a dumb hood, who can be conned out of some major, illegal money waiting in a locker at the L.A. airport. But Chilly seems to know all the right moves and plays everyone at their own game.Writer, Elmore Leonard wrote this fast paced, witty story after experiencing a real life, frustrating job of trying to write a script for vertically challenged actor, Dustin Hoffman... Revenge must be sweet, because it inspired a great piece of comic writing.The cast of actors in this movie is wonderful. Normally, I'm not the biggest John Travolta fan, but his take on mobster, Chilly Palmer is electrifying. Travolta plays the character with a swagger, confindence, and a smile that is sheer perfection! Gene Hackman is also hilarious as the sleaziest of sleazy Hollywood producers. This guy would sell out his own mother if it ment getting a piece of the gross!.Finally, Danny DeVito just makes this movie with his send up of every spoiled rotten, self-indulgent Hollywood actor that could ever come to mind. Kudos should also go for great, comic supporting roles from James Gandolfini and Dennis Farina.For an evening of some very funny Hollywood satire, I recommend you to get...\\"Get Shorty\\"!some very funny Hollywood satire, I recommend you to get...\\"Get Shorty\\"!
B00006LLJ4|2.0|It was a great plot... a great potential.  But Tom Cruise as a grieving drug-addicted father?  Plu-eez!!  That's why I think it's badly cast.  I cared more about Danny in the movie than I did Tom Cruise's character.  Great idea, loved the idea of the pre-cogs and would have liked to see more of their work catching pre-criminals etc. and more of the pre-cogs' past.  But it was a good story.<BR>I figured out who the \\"baddy\\" was very early on in the movie, so that's why I call the movie predictable.  Good story overall, but too flawed.
B0000025DD|4.0|So you play guitar and think Gilmour is God? ...No? Well, if he isn't God, then he's definitely sitting on the right hand of the father. <br />Although this album was made before Floyd split up, you can see through listening to this release where much of Floyd's sonic alchemy originates, at least as far as guitar work is concerned. For me, much of Floyd's power came from their concepts and what they (I guess Rodger more than David) had to say about society and the forces that shape the world we live in (geopolitics, remote-control high-tech war, danger of the 'cult-of-personality'). Sadly, this ablum and much of Gilmour's writing is devoid of any unifing 'concept' or theme. <br />This is a strong album musically but lacks a message. It's missing the thread that always seemed to tie together much of what Floyd was well known for producing - audio soundtracks that project the disaffection that many of us feel when we look out at the world. Looking back, most of that cohesiveness must have come from Rodger Waters and is sorely missed on this album. <br />In the end it's still a strong set of songs from a master of guitar and well worth listening to and owning... Just don't expect an overall theme or message.
B00005JLWL|5.0|I am merely writing this review in opposition to the negative reviews seen in many newspapers and magazines. I believe that many critics went into the movie thinking either a)\\"It's a Matrix clone.\\" or b)\\"It's a copy of a previous work.\\" What nearly every professional critic has said is, \\"It's just a copy of Farenheit 451/Gattaca/Brave New World/1984, etc., and therefore is bad.\\" These people obviously weren't paying attention to the actual movie and just read the press release. Yes, Kurt Wimmer drew heavily from previous works for the overall theme of Equilibrium, but the movie transcends its \\"source material\\" and becomes its own entity. If you don't spend the whole time you are in the theater pointing out similarities between this movie and other works, you will enjoy the movie greatly. The scene in which Preston hears Beethoven's 9th Symphony nearly brings tears to one's eyes, and is one of the best scenes in any movie ever. Now, many people are quick to compare Equilibrium to The Matrix due to the similar characteristics of a dystopian future an lots of action. However, the future of the ship Nebuchadnezzer and the fight against the Agents and the future of Libria and the fight against Father's regime differ greatly. Almost no specific plot elements are shared by the two films. Also, the action sequences in Equilibrium blow away those in The Matrix. After nearly every action scene in Equilibrium, I was grinning and just astonished by the awesomeness of what I had just witnessed. And the action of Equilibrium is at least partway believable ;). In short, Equilibrium surpasses its influences and DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Rob Marshall's \\"Chicago\\" is a big, bold, brassy musical that once and for all blows the cobwebs off the Musical Movie genre that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" began last year.<br />The revelation of this film is Renee Zellweger, who can not only play the soft and pathetic side of Roxie Hart with the expected expertise but also plays the cunning and conniving side as well  with conviction. And she can sing and dance also...who'd have thought?<br />Marshall has structured the film in such a way as to dispel many people's aversion to musicals by turning the musical numbers into dream sequences...Roxie's dreams. Frankly, though you still have people bursting into song with little or no provocation so Marshall's efforts are probably for naught. The fact is either you like Musicals or you don't or you're willing to dispel your disbelief or you're not. If the songs and the performances of said songs are good I'm right there with it, if not...I'm not. \\"Chicago\\" has good songs and great performances...enough said about that.<br />For me, the musical set piece of \\"Chicago\\" is Roxie/Zellweger's performance, in a breathy Marilyn Monroe way, of her signature song, \\"Roxie Hart.\\" It's exemplary.<br />Catherine Zeta Jones plays Velma but in many ways this is a familiar style role for her: smart, sassy, sexy. Velma is not a stretch for her but she's effective, as usual.<br />Billy Flynn looks like a role Richard Gere has been wanting to play his whole life because he seems to be having so much fun that we in turn have loads of fun watching him sing and dance and over-act. He's a blast.<br />\\"Chicago\\" is an over-the-top, big Technicolor ice cream cone of a movie that is good to the very last lick. Leave your troubles at home and enjoy.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|I agree that this is one of the best video collections ever assembled.  Watching it from beginning to end was bittersweet.  You get to see the band grow but also see the changes Staley goes through whilst battling his demons.  <BR>I am sad that Layne is gone but am happy that Cantrell continues to create great music.  This is a must have for all Alice fans.
B000002GYN|5.0|With this stunning debut album, the Eagles immediately wrote music history, thanks to a number of very succesful hit singels: Take It Easy, Witchy Woman and Peaceful Easy Feeling. But they aren´t, in my opinion, the most interesting songs; instead I would like to strike a blow for Glenn Frey´s acoustic ballad \\"Most of Us are Sad\\", with its incredible vocal harmonies (but with lead vocals by bassist Randy Meisner!) and Bernie Leadon´s \\"Train Leaves Here this Mornin\\" (co-written by Gene Clark during Bernie´s spell with Dillard & Clark in the late 60s).<br />It is hard to belive that the album, with its strong american country sound, actually is recorded in London (by the genius producer Glyn Johns, who also in the same studio -- his own Olympic Studios -- produced and recorded McGuinnes Flint a couple of years earlier, among others). It was also Glyn Johns who \\"created\\" the band´s sound and made them aware of their vocal harmony skills and country roots, although some of the members wasn´t quite happy with the musical direction. Glenn Frey is said to have been the strongest opponent to the country sound, due to his own aim to lead the band into a more straight forward rock´n roll and white soul band. Thank [goodness] Glyn Johns didn´t give in.<br />...if one -- like myself -- already has heard milestones like \\"Hotel Californa\\", this album could turn out as a surprise, and even maybe a disappointment, because it is so musically different from the music of the Eagles that are mostly played on the radio or on TV. Despite of the very commercial sounding and succesful hit singels on the album, this Eagles debut requires a number of listenings until one can fully appreciate it, like for example the hard rock tune \\"Chug All Night\\" or Meisner´s Woodstock-sounding psykadelic song \\"Take the Devil\\". But when you do, and if you give it a chance, you will soon find it to be their most interesting album, much better than the highly over-rated \\"Hotel California\\" (yes, I amserious!!). A genuine classic!
0805066691|5.0|Maybe, instead of spending your time becoming an &quot;expert&quot; in abororiginal linguistics, you should have studied english. If you did, you wouldn't have so many run on sentences in your review.  It is a great accomplishment that you have become such an &quot;expert&quot; in the field of aboriginal linguistics. It is unfortunate that more native americans haven't become &quot;experts&quot; in red neck linguistics. I am sure that you received your degree in aboriginal linguistics from that fabulous institution of higher learning, TheUniversity of Lubbock, or  Lubbock State University, home of the &quot;Fighting Inbreds&quot;. It is nice to know that people in Lubbock are spending their time bettering the world by becomming &quot;experts&quot; in aboriginal linguistics. It is also amazing that people in lubbock have the time to become experts at anything considering most of their days are filled by combing their mulletts, swilling warm beer, and going to Klan rallies. So my advice to anyone who wants to read this novel, please do. Even though it is historically inaccurate according to the &quot;experts&quot; in lubbock , texas.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD is great, incredible work. The fact that it is a CD of outtakes should shock and astound us all. But some of you are whining and saying \\"It's not as good as 'Toxicity'\\".... well duh! ... This CD was the OUTTAKES... yes, that's right, the stuff they didn't want to have on their album because it didn't fit right. Also, [if] you are sitting there, saying the album [is disappointing] because it isn't as good as \\"Toxicity\\", shows that you are not a loyal SOAD fan. \\"Steal this Album\\" is not a follow-up album to \\"Toxicity\\". It is a collection of songs they left off of \\"Toxicity\\", a collection that should be cherished, not torn down. So, ... buy the CD, and listen to System of a Down kick..., as they always do!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not a lot of people knows, but Radiohead owes a great dill to the Israely public. Before anyboody heared of them, Radiohead came to a small club in Israel and playd their early material included their biggest hit up to date - CREEP. Yoav Kotner, an Israeli radio editor heared the band and started to push them forward in his show. Soon, Creep became a national anthem, espacially after a big clothing company used it in their campaign. About a year after, all Europe and the entire world got to know Radiohead after their charming debut - Pablo Honey was released. Since then, and in a time in which no international star is willing to come to Israel due to the security state we are in, Radiohead are coming to perform in every few years.<BR>The last time they came (before KID-A and they performed for the first time songs from the KID A-AMNESIAC SESSIONS so we were told), they performed 3 sold-out shows (i was in the first one), and the crowd went crazy after them. The reviews were incredible, and Radiohead felt like coming back home. We miss you...<br />Anyhow, OK COMPUTER is the band's MASTERWORK, and one of the most amazing records of all time. All the songs stands tall as masterpieces and its a shame to review each one of them.
B00000DR5D|5.0|This is probably my favorite TD album, even though I am not a real expert in this kind of music.  Its not a total synth album, as Edgar Froese does weild his guitar in a few places, but the impact is magnificent.  This fits very nicely between the meditative trance that is \\"Rubycon\\" and the more urgent feeling of \\"Stratosfear.\\"  The thing that amazes me most is that this almost feels like a jam session that is well orchestrated.  The feelings of all three members come right to the surface, but it doesn't seem like a collection of noise at all.  It took a few listens, and the right frame of mind to properly appreciate this album, but when it finally blooms, it hits you full force.  Cool music, very trippy, and great musicianship.
0684800713|5.0|Let me start by saying I can't believe I am giving this book 5 stars... and only gave 4 to For Whom the Bell Tolls.  I read The Sun Also Rises before I read For Whom the Bell Tolls,  I thought the latter had struck me deeply and made more sense to me... but there's just something about the former. Hemingway had a real knack for telling about the struggles for finding the meaning of life.  He hit the nail on the head time and again.<br />The Sun Also Rises is all about pain and longing.  I'm a couple of months removed from reading it, but that is the truest take I get from it.  Each character has a distinct pain and longing they are dealing with...  Let me highlight some of these:<br />* Brett--  the beautiful and highly desired object in many man's eyes.  She seems to have it all.  She seems to be right where she wants to be.  But she is truly searching and lost.  It seems the one thing that would make her complete is the one thing she can never truly have...  Jake.  The late night conversations between Jake and Brett, really tug at the heart.  You just wish they could somehow get together.  But it could never be...<br />--The longing and pain of unattainable and unfulfilled desires.<br />*  Robert Cohn--  the man on the outside looking in.  Robert Cohn so deperately wants to be part of the group.  He so deperately wants to be accepted.  He so deperately wants Brett.  But he can never realize any of this because the social group he wishes so much to join has already passed judgement on him and will never let him in.  And poor Robert doesn't realize that it is only \\"WHO\\" he is that is keeping him out forever.  Not just the fact of his ethnic background but his very personality drives him out of the group.<br />--The longing and pain of being on the outside looking in.<br />*  Mike Campbell--  He seems to be at ease in the social group.  He seems to have established himself.  But when you look at his constant barbs at Robert Cohn you can see he is really insecure about his position in life.  Mike isn't a main character but you can see yet another longing when you look at him.  He is actually in...  \\"The In Crowd\\" but doesn't seem to be very sure he is really in at all.  To me that is the human condition in a nutshell.  Always pushing... always grasping...  always looking for more... when all we need is probably right in front of us.  What a shame!<br />--The longing and pain of insecurity within security.<br />*  Jake Barnes--  Last but certainly not least....  Jake.  Jake epitomizes pain and longing in this book.  Jake is the glue that holds this whole group together.  That is a lot of pressure on an individual.  The pressure he is under can be seen clearly by his relationship to Robert Cohn.  He is forced to go through such changes in that singular relationship.  At the beginning of the book he seems to at least have a tolerance for Robert Cohn and then through circumstance he has to sway completely.  He keeps the clashing personalities at bay all through the story.  He seems to keep Brett from crashing and burning over and over again.  I'm sure there might have been a murder between the social combatants somewhere in the story if not for Jake soothing and placating all he came in contact with.  He seems to be the only one in the book who has any social graces and tact. What a lot of pressure on one individual.<br />Jake also has this mysterious wound from the war that keeps him from having a sexual realtionship and connecting to anyone in that way.  How much does this hurt Jake?  How does it affect him?  We don't really get a deep picture of it all...  but it seems to impact him at least minimally and I'm sure it goes much deeper.<br />To me the one thing that would make sense in the whole story would be a realtionship between Jake and Brett.  They seem to fit together...  but they can't.  Jake can't physically, of course, but he is also damaged emotionally and can't find intimacy in a purely emotional connection either.  Isthat lonliness or what?<br />--The longing and pain of holding everyone else together and the longing and pain of wanting... yet not being able to.<br />I think the one thing that makes me rate this book a 5 out of 5 is the fact that I have, at one time or another, felt exactly like all of these characters.  Like I said, Hemingway hit the nail on the head consistently...  he knew what we need, what we miss and what we yearn for. Hemingway like no other novelist understood how we struggle and fight for so much but rarely get what we want.<br /> He painted such a brilliant picture...  take the time to gaze upon it.  This is a wonderful book.ss or what?  <BR>--The longing and pain of holding everyone else together and the longing and pain of wanting... yet not being able to.<br />I think the one thing that makes me rate this book a 5 out of 5 is the fact that I have, at one time or another, felt exactly like all of these characters.

B00000DR5I|4.0|I really like this album, but it doesn't have the immediate impact as &quot;Phaedra&quot; does.  What I mean is that you can't really sit down and listen to this album as attentively as you can with &quot;Phaedra.&quot;  You have to be really relaxed to get the full effect...but what effect!  I almost prefer this album to &quot;Phaedra&quot; because there are less songs, ergo less changes in mood, and the sound sort of drifts from one mood to the next. Also, this album is a lot more relaxed than thier previous. Listening to this album is like watching the times of day go by in a little over half an hour.  Definatly not reccommended to those with a short attention span!
B00005JKZT|4.0|When I saw The Fellowship of the Ring I left the theatre feeling confused.  I had been assured by several self-proclaimed \\"Ring Fanatics\\" that it was a close adaptation to the book.  If any of those people try to tell me that with The Two Towers I'm afraid I will have to think that they are liars or idiots.  Very little of the book is left.  I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what the creator's were attempting to say.  There must be some sort of statement they want to proclaim that they are using Tolkien's work for, or should I say, abusing.  Why didn't they just make up their own story, I wonder.  Oh, yeah, they are making millions by distorting these works.<br />My main issue lies with the destruction of characters.  I understand perfectly that you can't fit these books all into 9 hrs of film.  But that doesn't mean you have to destroy the wonderful characters that Tolkien created. ...**<br />If you read the book and liked it you probably won't like this movie.  If you haven't read the book and like adventure movies this movie is excellent.
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is a great novel about  a zookeeper's son named Pi Patel.  He survives the sinking of a ship and floats for 227 days in a lifeboat.  Aboard the lifeboat with him is a 450 pound tiger named Richard Parker,  a mischievious hyena, and a docile zebra.  I enjoyed reading about ther personalities of  these animals and how they physically clashed together.<br /> What is interesting is how Pi's attitude towards the tiger changes through the book.  He is initially afraid of the tiger in the beginning.  As he begins to care for and feed the tiger, his fear disappears though.  Richard Parker becomes Pi's companion as caring for the tiger and ensuring his survival becomes his main purpose in life.  He develops an attitude of toughness and bravery that I liked.  There are many interesting facts about animals in this book.  I learned that tigers emit a friendly roar called prusten. I also learned that a turtle has many different uses.  A turtle can be an excellent source of food. In addition, the turtle shell can be an effective shield for protection against tigers and used as a bowl for eating.  Pi Patel experiences absolute joy in the smallest of things when he finally discovers fresh drinking water.  Pi entertains himself by fishing and survives by fish, turtle, and even shark.  There is such a great transformation in Pi Patel's personality about his situation from fear and loneliness in the beginning to a sense of  courage and resliency at the end.  I enjoyed it very much.
B00003CXD0|5.0|I don't think I have to say more about the movie itself, but the lack of extra stuff on this cheesy DVD is simply sick.  I am, thus, glad I have the Criterion LD (you remember, that ancient technology...), which contains a wonderful commentary track by Mr. Sydney Pollack.
0553801511|5.0|After reading Fool's Errand, I was burning to read Golden Fool. So I bought the UK version which was released in October. Which, BTW, has me amused at the differences in spelling and grammer :)<br />Golden Fool picks up immediately where Fool's Errand ends. Of course, the Piebald threat continues, and there is Prince Dutiful's betrothal to Narcheska and all the problems with that. Added to, though, are the conflicts Fitz has with viturally every friend he has. There are a few surprises :) and Hobb is nicely intregating her Liveships trilogy and the first Assasins trilogy.<br />The book ends much like the first, with loose ends but a resolution of a problem. I have no idea how she'll tie up all the loose ends in just one more book--there seems to be so much going on or could go on. But I have faith :) Hobb is such a great writer. Again, I'm amazed at how she can pull bits from the previous books and give them more importance in her following books  adding a different flavor to the story.<br />For those who haven't read her previously works, I highly recommend that you start with the Assasion then the Liveship trilogy before and Fool's Errand before starting this book. WOuld you be able to understand the book and follow the plot? Yes. However, by reading this book first, you'll spoiler yourself to many of the mysteries and plot twists of the previous books--especially Fool's Errand. And you will want to go back and read those.<br />Overall, a great second book in a trilogy. Can't wait for the third :)

B000022TSW|4.0|As a 5th grade teacher, I am shocked at how many of my students are familiar with the characters of the TV show \\"South Park.\\"  It really isn't meant for children, and the movie even less so.  That said, as an adult, I found it to be hilarious.  The parents of the South Park kids, incensed at the detrimental influence of Terence and Philip's new movie on their children, spearhead a movement to execute the Canadian flatulence artists, thereby provoking a military confrontation with our neighbor to the north and possibly apocalypse itself.  <br />Although it runs out of steam toward the end, this film is frequently a brilliant satire.  Many have mentioned its digs at censorship, but I think that it is much more perceptive as a comment on how American parents so often abdicate responsibility for raising their own children and blame other sources, such as movies, for juvenile misbehavior.  ...
B0000024W3|3.0|I recently became a Dylanist.  I've always loved Bob's 60s stuff and the Basement Tapes is one of the most listened to albums in my collection since I got it around 1985.  Then a friend recommended Greil Marcus' Invisible Republic.  Greil reiterates throughout the book that a bootleg five CD set called the Genuine Basement Tapes is an absolute must have for serious Dylan fans.  After several years of searching I found a copy at a reasonable price in 2001.  <br />Then I finally got around to Self Portrait.<br />It seems to me in light of Marcus' revelations that Self Portrait was an attempt by Bob to recreate the easy, sittin' by the stove, drinkin' whisky, spittin' tobaccy juice on the floor kind of feeling heard on the Basement Tapes.  He admits as much in an excerpt from the 1984 Rolling Stone Interview;<br />\\"And then there was a lot of other stuff that was just on the shelf. But I was being bootlegged at the time and a lot of stuff that was worse was appearing on bootleg records. So I just figured I'd put all this stuff together and put it out, my own bootleg record, so to speak. You know, if it actually had been a bootleg record, people probably would have sneaked around to buy it and played it for each other secretly.\\"<br />He wanted to make his own bootleg record i.e. his own professionally recorded Basement Tape with a mixture of old timey covers and deadpan original lope along cowboy songs with his own devil may care twang.  To Bob it seemed the feeling was right, great sound with the purposefully non-professional sitting on the porch kind of emotion.  If the fans want the Basement Tape, he thought, they'll love this.  <br />Al Kooper: I don't know what he was looking for on Self Portrait. We'd just go in and do 'cover' songs, all day long.<br />In other words the same unhurried methodology was used to record Self Portrait as was used on the Basement Tapes.  He had his group do covers all day long with barely a run through and then do an original once in awhile.  <br />David Bromberg remembers the sessions as \\"stream of consciousness things\\" - one song after another for hours, and he was sick with a high fever. He would work all day, go home, fall asleep and wake up in time to go back to the studio.<br />I think Bob wanted to get away from serious music and just have some fun.  In the 60s and before that he was not a jamming musician as the Band were.  He liked the Band because for a while he could hang out and let the jams flow, something he couldn't do as a loner.  He played that corny cowboy music because he really liked it.<br />For me the \\"mystery\\" of Self Portrait is solved.  The Basement Tapes remain a mystery.  They probably always will.
B00002SWEM|4.0|This documentary presents the rediscovery and reunion of a number of masterful Cuban musicians, all of whom are aged and many of whom have not performed for many years.  It is inspiring to watch how seemingly effortlessly they return to the stage, as well as their respect and affection both for their craft and for each other.  They tell their own stories during interesting interviews.  Although the film is packed with wonderful music, it is unfortunate that director Win Wenders cuts away from so many songs before they have concluded.  Nevertheless, this remains a vital document that led me to contemplate the many incredible talents that must exist in obscurity all over the world.
B00005JL78|5.0|Steven Spielberg's masterful use of special effects in this futuristic film is not the slightest bit distracting because the effects are not where he places the film's focus; rather, his direction places it on the thrilling and often comedic storyline.  For example, the scene in which Tom Cruise's character jumps from a magnetically-powered car into an apartment perfectly illustrates this, as his defiance of both death and authority at high altitude conclude in arrival, partially upside-down, in a yoga exercise class. Absurdly brilliant! That all of this is done without dialogue perfectly illustrates Spielberg's craft. Watch this film, and perhaps you, too, could agree with Roger Ebert that this was the best film of 2002.
B000002UVX|5.0|This album is my utmost favorite album made. The guitar work is incindiery and shows Hendrix full potential as as strummer. It is an amazing album, especially Machine Gun, reflecting the horrors and hippocracy of a Vietnam War battlefield.I'm not sure who is the lead singer 1/2 the time but his voice is interesting and complementary to Hendrix's guitar. If you have one album ever I recommend this one.

B00005QXXO|5.0|An extraordinary live compilation, and as such, one of the best live records you'll hear this year. In this format, the music takes center stage; the songs are good enough to avoid any 'experimental' label the critics might try to bestow on it.<br />Standout tracks: Morning Bell, Idioteque, and Everything In Its Right Place morphing into Dollars and Cents. Any other band would kill to have a back catalogue like this. What's more amazing is that all the songs (save the atmospheric True Love Waits) come from just two albums: Kid A and Amnesiac. The casual fan might be disappointed that there's no 'Creep,' the rock fan might bemoan the total lack of Bends material, and the critic might complain about OK Computer's absence, but if you've liked any of their albums, this one belongs on your CD rack.<br />Even better, with only 8 songs, this is no 70's type double live album. It's just rock music that rocks you, and then leaves the building. Just like its supposed to.
B00003W8NM|5.0|A great movie, running up only up against the movie, American Beauty, Fight Club is a much more dark and slightly less realistic story that gets across the same message as American Beauty:  \\"Life isn't so bad.\\"  Or at least . . . that's the least complicated way that I can put it.  It's actually much more in depth than that simple statement, but any movie that can actually CONVINCE you of that statement, is amazing.  Alot more can be read into the movie,  I simply choose not too, I feel that that leads to too much obsession.  HOWEVER, if you're looking for a movie that will not only make you think, BUT make your head hurt from thinking alot! go right ahead!  It's a great movie and it gets across an amazing message that is both simple and complex, happy viewing!
B000000WF0|5.0|As good an album to come out of Britain in the 90's as any. The Britpop influences are unmistakable; in contemporary terms, there's the Stone Roses' self-titled record, Blur, and Oasis' What's the Story (Morning Glory).<br />Standout tracks: 'Weeping Willow' and 'Lucky Man,' although just about all of them are worth listening to. Its a shame about the controversy over Bitter Sweet Symphony, although I guess the Rolling Stones have a right to preserve their legacy. Other than that, its more than just mood music, and if you've ever found yourself liking a ballad on radio, you'll probably love this album. Don't say I didn't warn you.
B00005JL96|4.0|Ok, this rating would be 5 stars IF it were the 2 disc version.  Disney unfortunately lately has been not only abandoning its marketing division, but has been abandoning its 2d animation program lately, and unfortunately this has affected such great dvds as this one.  While Lilo and Stitch is enjoyable and one of Disney's more successful detatchments from their story norms, the lack of MORE special extras on the DVD simply could add MORE to it.  Recently, however, the demand for a 2 disc special collector's edition of Lilo and Stitch has been announced and will be released within the next year.  I personally, am going to wait until this comes out and purchase it in hopes that this will encourage Disney to put out more special editions like it's Tarzan collector's edition, it's Beauty and the Beast collector's edition, and it's Atlantis Collector's edition, as it will show Disney that people in the audience are not soley interested in the movie, but also have some interest in the process of film making.
B00006RU5B|5.0|With high expectations, the newly formed Audioslave has done some quality work here.  Of course as mentioned by many others, the existing fans of there previous collaborators might have doubted the outcome of what might have been a tragedy in the making, the integrity maintains.  I admit myself that I had my own doubts or at least fears for the band members themselves.  They took a risk and it went well.  The album of course has a sound that echoes some of the past but it's nearly impossible to not have that happen, like they say, if it's not broken don't fix it.  Along with that, I think that the former members of RAGE got the opportunity to branch out a little and to those who bought Cornell's debut album you will know that he definetly had an impact on this.  So for those who want to say that it's strictly RAge meets Soundgarden you're dead wrong.  As for all of the controversy of it all I can sum it up by saying this...<BR>If no one had heard of RATM or Soundgarden before this would be the ground breaking band that would have been talked about like you wouldn't believe.
B000002JNJ|5.0|If you are a Pantera fan this is a must. On this album you can hear them really giving us a great Thrash Album. Phil really could hit some high notes. Dime show's off some of his best solo's. Rex kick's it in this one. Vinnie show's that he's one of the best drummers in the metal scene. Cemetary Gates is probly one of the best Balled's ever made. This is a real must for pantera fan's so buy it.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|E.T., an alien, gets stuck on Earth and wants to go back home. He is aided by Elliot and his family. GREAT FAMILY FLICK!  The DVD has extra scences in it as well as new shots.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is an all out Thrash record. It was one of my first Pantera cd's i've bought and i love it. The Vocal's of Phil just were starting to get hadrcore and so what the music. Cowboy's from hell was great but this album really beat's COf by far. The Solo's that Dime lay's down are amazing. Most Regular People had a badass riff to it. If you are a Thrash fan you should really check this cd out.
B0000508U6|5.0|parachutes is by far the best album i have ever heard. everytime i listen to it i feel so many emotions. it is so powerful and beautiful; it can make you smile or cry. it's good to listen to in whatever mood you are in, and no matter how many times you listen to it, it remains just as wonderful as the first.
B000002H6C|5.0|This cd really shows their anger. They have some of the fastest and heavyest song's on here. Kirk lay's down some of the fastest solo's. The lyric's are every dark and brilliant. ONE is probly one of the best Metallica song's. If you are an 80's Thrash fan you really should buy this.
B000069AUI|3.0|besides &quot;politik&quot; and &quot;in my place&quot;, no songs really stood out on this cd. i was a bit dissapointed with it, but only because i had such high expectations after listening to &quot;Parachutes&quot;. it is still a good album though, and definatly worth buying.
B000002JR8|5.0|Every now and then there come's a record that really blow's you away and this is one of though's record's. When i first listened to it my jaw dropped. It was probly that heavyest cd I have ever listened to. The riff for I'm Broken is kick [butt]. Phil really releases all his anger here, and Dime play's some great riff's. Rex and Vinnie also really make this record brutal. The double bass of Vinnie really kick's your teeth in. If you like Hardcore Metal this is a must.
B00005JKCH|5.0|As a former comic book collector (and former owner of the first 115 or so X-men comics!) I simply had to see this when it came out.  <br />Spidey is done true by this big screen, special effects fest.  Tobey Maguire does a convincing Parker as someone stretching his nerd wings with super powers.  It is especially gratifying that the origin section with its Spidey as entertainer in the ring with wrestler and subsequent robbery, death of Uncle Ben Parker is kept fully intact with very little alteration whatsoever. (kudos to the filmakers).<br />If you ever enjoyed a read of your Spiderman comics (particularly as originally created without the unusual \\"bio-organism\\" costume) then you should get this DVD.  You'll enjoy seeing something as outrageous as a teenager swinging through midtown manhatten.<br />NOTE: Even J.Jonah Jameson is done to a \\"T\\".  I would never have believed it if it wasn't there in the movie!<br />Spidey Lives!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This album is very laid back. Its a step away from normal eminem which is nice to hear. alot of emcee's hae a good going on this record and for sure, the second cd is great. dont buy this however if u want the battles from the movie on a cd. this doesnt have any!
0385503954|2.0|Ok, it's not his first but it reads like one.  Very pedestrian, borish.  The details are charming, a bit Waugh-ish without the humor, but because I knew Briony did something for which she would then atone I wasn't able to _read_, I was waiting for the event which wasn't realistically terrible.  I didn't find it or the aftermath credible.  The writing isn't really that bad but the story is told in a postmodern way that's almost cliche by now--how many novels do we need that are told from different perspectives?  It's not new, it's not fresh, it doesn't inspire me to want to read more of his works.  This was my first McEwan and, unless my husband who loved this book forces me, it's my last.

0385508417|1.0|The book is very interesting it takes a glaring look at the commercial and pagan holiday.  Luther chooses to not take part in this for financial reasons, but unfortunately his wife is not as strong as he is.  In the end they succumbed the all of the pressure,  harassment  and ridicule of the neighbors; fearing to upset their inconsiderate daughter.  It is sad that everyone was willing to lie to her, but unwilling to respect Luther (his wife included). The audio book moved well, but the ending seems to have been written by a different author.
B000001EMW|2.0|i like calassical. i play the cello and when i heard of this band i got really excited.  When i tried to download the music it didn't work so i still have no idea what they sound like. Please make the music easier to acess so people don't have to download it
6300263673|5.0|It would appear that others have reviewed a different movie, with talk about Swayze's character guilty of statutory rape.  Baby's father clearly states that she's 'starting Mount Holyoke in the fall'...that's a college, not a high school.  So she's at *least* 17, but for the purpose of the movie, I assumed she was 18, and that the part of 'Johnny' was a young man of 20 or so.  I was 18 when I graduated from high school! <br />The movie is excellent, IMO.  The clothing was dead on for 1963, as was the music.  Baby is a brainy, sheltered, socially conscious but socially uneasy young woman. In meeting a group of earthy, street-wise young people, she is suddenly awakened, both sexually and emotionally, and the final part of her growing up falls into place.  As well, for the first time, she is introduced to a way of life in which everyone is not treated equally, but is judged on their looks or backgrounds, which she finds unfair.  For the first time in her life, she stands up to authority and begins to think for herself, for what she feels is right, even against her beloved Daddy.  And then she knows she is truly on the road to adulthood.
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago Transit Authority is a major cool album to listen to, and is an unbelievable departure from their popular love songs of the 80s. Unlike those songs all of these songs rock--hard--and it's just refreshing hearing their special brand of rock music mingled with horns blaring everywhere. I really love this album and compared to the type of music they've made lately the difference is like night and day. I have nothing but praise for this album and it saddens me to know that after such a great start, Chicago slowly began going downwards and they have never again created an album quite like this one. This one is one of a kind and I wish they had continued on this path of music. Oh what might have been, indeed! Well anyway, in closing, I want to say shame on you who have belittled this album in its remastered state. Sure some of the music is a bit too loud, and a lot of the vocals are hard to decipher taking a backseat to the music, but who while listening to this glorious album would even care? This is one album that you just don't listen to for the lyrics because the music is so great. Definitely one of the best albums musically I have ever heard. All I can say is buy this one today, crank it up, relax, and just let the music rock you and move you like you've never experienced before. Chicago Transit Authority rules!!!

B00006JO6O|1.0|I slogged through &quot;Black Notice&quot; and skimmed &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; and all I can say is GOOD GRIEF!  What a juvenile style of writing.  Every statment is wreathed with emotion: &quot;raging, seething, trembling, anger, fury, resentment, incensed&quot;, etc.  Reads like a 9th graders attempt at punching up an essay using a thesaurus. Yuck!  I picked up &quot;Black Notice&quot; at the library and the premis sounded interesting but all that emotional emoting with a slow story threw me for a loop.  What the heck, I thought I'd give Ms. Cornwell the benefit of the doubt and try one more time.  I picked up a second book &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; and after about 20 pages gave up and started skimming.  The overall plot between the 2 books was somewhat interesting but unfortunately it was obscured by the noisy, histrionic writing.  I will not waste my time with her books again.
0553277472|5.0|If you look at the customer reviews for this book you will find the gamut: from people who love this book and whose lives were dramatically changed by reading it to people who have vehement hatred of ever having read (or tried to read) it.  If I were looking at this review having never read the book this situation would be clue to me that I should check it out.<br />Many of the negative reviews are from people who had a preconceived notion of what this book was before they read it (either from the title or from a recommendation) and were upset that it didn't meet their expectations.  It seems to me that these folks have received their zen lesson...<br />For myself, I came to this book with no real expectations and fell in love with the story, the lessons, and the subtleties of their presentation.  It truly changed my life.  Since acquiring the book in 1980 I have reread it about 10 times and each time I get something different out of it.<br />My recommendation: Read this book but, before you start, put away any expectations that you have for it.  If you can't do that maybe you better wait until you get to a place where you can.  There's treasure here but you have to be open to receiving it.
0783240236|3.0|Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds was an exceptionaly entertaining movie.  It was an action packed thriller for the time.  This 1963 version of Daphny DuMoure's book The Birds, was well portrayed in the movie with exceptional actors.  However there were extra peices that made the story line more appealing to the American audencies.  Tippi Hedren and  Rod Taylor did a wonderful job in the spot light.  They really made the movie their own.  The romance between the characters Melanie (Tippi Hedren) and Mitch (Tod Taylor) really added more of a dramaic twist to go with all of the films action.

B00005JIZA|5.0|i'm completely addicted and in love.  the lyrics of john's music are so captivating, it draws you in and leaves you begging for more (well me at least).  john mayer is like a new, great laundry detergent.  once you try it, and discover it's the best, you will never, and i mean never, go back.  like other have said, he's been our best kept secret, but now he's getting bigger and its slightly sad to see it happen.  again, he's amazing live and i often find my head tilted and a slight smile crossing my face while i am completely engulfed in his world.

0375414053|1.0|She has a bazillion dollars, a wonderful understanding husband, great lingerie, a fantasy lover and more or less everything else she wants in the world. <br />Terrific. I know how she does it, now can someone tell me how I do it? I only have the kids in common.<br />As a struggling, overeducated, extremely underpaid, single mother, this book was a total disappointment. Even comedy must have some reality to it. There are cute bits - yes, mothers are competitive - but the treacly attitude does them in. And at the end? SHE can walk away and 99% of us cannot; it's a copout. I was very disappointed with this book.
B000002I6X|3.0|Stills never quite got the idea of less is more.

B00005JKZT|4.0|The common (mistake?) interpretation for The Two Towers is that, this is a superior in action, weaker in story follow up sequal to the near perfect \\"Fellowship of The Ring\\". <br />Action lovers raved about it for the gorier, granter in scale battle sequence, CGI fanatics praise it for the astounding special effects that could easily parallel or even top Industrial Light & Magic's recent effort. Drama fans complained about the lack of character developments, and the die-hard book-chewing nerds spat on it because the movie drifted apart from the book. <br />Sure, Peter Jackson and his screen writers took some creativity liberation to condense, alter, or redistribute the original story. The fact is that, Peter Jackson was not trying to do a line-by-line screen translation of Tolkien's book, nor should he. The core story remains faithful, teh characters are more than plentiful for your average fast-food culture population. <br />Please stop comparing it with the Fellowship, and stop comparing it to any other sequal. Lord of the Rings is a complete story, and the Two Towers is only the second act of a complete story. Disect any movie or story: The beginning is normally slow, more drama depth and more character developments, the second should be full of action, and we could almost always expect a grand finale. [Return of the King] anyone?
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones rapts your attention with her sultry voice.  Close your eyes and your in a dimly lit, smoky bar.  This is not pop, it's the style of music that transcends time.  It's great to sing along to in the car, or to get close by the fire.  I bought this as an impulse purchase, and it quickly jumped the ranks to one of my favorite albums.  Definitely a must have CD.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Two beautiful young girls/women that not only look hot but sound hot too.  Welcome to the new sound of music.  Interscope has turned Two Russian Girls Russian pop music into English for the enjoyment of the whole world.  Yulia (Short black hair) and Lena (long red curly hair) have combined the love they feel for each other and a powerful energy to create the English album 200 Km/h In The Wrong Lane.  This cd is packed with a new pop sound about being a girl loving another girl, with twists and turns to surprise the ear.  Being straight I have to admit this record really got to me.  It's some of the best music I have ever heard and I am sure you will agree!  With the released single off the new album \\"All The Things She Said\\" will soon be on all the radio stations throughout the U.S.A and Canada.  Spend a few bucks and buy this new album and you will have a piece of what the world of music is going to become.  I have the greatest respect for both Yulia and Lena for breaking the language barrier to bring us their wonderful new music.  This was truly an awesome and amazing album.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|ok, ok.  took me a while to find out about this band.  i was actually looking for another cover of the Smith's \\"How Soon is Now\\" (yes, the song from \\"Charmed\\"), and the clerk at the record store could only find one by a band named TaTu, but the album wasn't out yet; the shop only had a Russian version, and well, my Russian isn't so good.  I figured if it were any good, I'd hear about it and pick it up at some point.<br />i kinda forgot about it for about a month or so, then saw them on some WWE show or another and said \\"hey, this is a cool song\\" (gotta love the Karma behind channel surfing and lame prime time reruns, otherwise i never would have heard the song!).  i figured, what the heck, it's only 10 bucks, if I don't like it, oh well.  <br />forget that it's some WWE chick's theme song.  Forget that there's the whole \\"are they or aren't they\\" marketing scheme (the guy who produced this worked with Pet Shop Boys and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, so it wouldn't surprise me if they really were, by the way, since these were 2 of the hottest gay bands in the 80's).  this is great music.  Europop tends to be a lot more enjoyable than most American bubblegum pop.  I have been listening to this a lot since I bought it, much to the chagrin of my partner, lol.  on the plus side, he loves that I can sing along and serenade him with gay-friendly lyrics.  you would think that at 31 I'd be a bit old for this, but hey, I'm gay and I'll take the gay-friendly stuff where I can find it, especially when it is this well-done.<br />I'll avoid a track-by-track list, and skip to the good, and one bad, points of the album.  lyrically it's very good.  Julia and Lena have very strong voices; they do well solo and as a duet.  i think the production was well-done, and created a well put-together album.  the music is in that \\"in-between\\" space...it's pop enough for that crowd, rock enough for that crowd, and has a wide appeal without necessarily labeling TaTu with some \\"genre\\".  I was pleased with the inclusion of two Russian songs, mainly because it shows me that these girls have a reason to try and cross-over to the American audience...they rock!  in terms of good, my final bit of praise is that they took a song which is quite whiney in it's original version (\\"How Soon is Now\\") and gave it a completely different flavor without butchering it.<br />my sole complaint about the album is this:  at times, the girls notes are a bit too high and they sing a bit too fast.  I really enjoy \\"Malchik Gay\\", but it can sound a bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks at times.  It's not the perfect outlet for their vocals, but still an excellent song. <br />Favorite tracks: \\"All the Things She Said\\", \\"Malchik Gay\\", \\"Stars\\", \\"30 Minutes\\", \\"Ya Shosla S Uma\\" and \\"Nas Ne Dagoniat\\".  Having said this, all the songs are well-done, and any of the 8 in English could easily be a hit in America.  Hopefully Lena and Julia will find their niche and put out an excellent sophomore album!  in the meantime, I'll search around for the Russian Language albums!
B00000IUT7|5.0|I do not know why so many of the other reviewers have problems with this locomotive. Maybe they got an early version or something. I received mine yesterday and it runs just fine up and down hills, in and out of curves as well as with and without wagons (I have been testing it with up to six wagons without problems even on hills). The locomotive is much stronger and faster than the smaller battery driven engines. It is also easier to control than these engines as the control buttons are larger. It may be used as a traditional hand-pushed locomotive by switching the last button (this is also a feature not found on the smaller engines). And finally it generates sound whenever it starts moving (the sound last for about 5 seconds and then it shuts up).<BR>So, all in all, this locomotive has been a great investment. Check it out if you are running a battery powered Brio railway.
6304806418|4.0|Before I saw this I swore off anything that Madonna did. But I felt that she carried this movie very well.  Everyone was well casted in this movie. It was well done. It is very intense too. It is not a movie for everyone. If you are into action packed constant excitement, this is not the movie for you. If you like movies that have good singing that moves slowly and carefully then it is. It was a really good movie and well done. The soundtractk is for a wider audience then the movie. The soundtrack is good background music.
B000002KKC|5.0|For me, 'Tusk' was and is still at the top of a Desert Island Disk.  One that I would have w/me if stranded.  Almost 25 yrs later (g-d, can you believe it?)it still holds up as being fresh and innovative.  Like Debbie Harry's 'KooKoo', it is STILL ahead of it's time!<br />'Tusk' is not nearly as accessible as 'Rumours'.  Except for Christine McVie's &quot;Think About Me&quot;, there are no obvious singles/radio picks - something that 'Rumours' did not lack.  Lindesy Buckingham said, they did not want to put out 'Rumours II'- and at that, they succeeded. 'Tusk' requires the listener to really notice the music, arrangements and production(&quot;Beautiful Child&quot;, &quot;Ledge&quot;). It is more challenging to appreciate - something radio never did.<br />'Tusk' is really is three great solo efforts that happened to be backed by the rest of the band.  Sometimes.  Lindsey Buckingham clearly has some work here that is entirely solo. But all vocalists pretty much carry their own songs w/a much more limited integration of backing/harmony vocals than either 'Fleetwood Mac' or 'Rumours'.  But when they do come together (again, &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;) it really shines.<br />Song selection and track order add to the non-traditional recording.  No 2/4 opening track, but a very understated McVie song (&quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;).  Steve Nicks has never made better music than her work on this disk. Buckingham as an arranger or her songs really shows how he makes a decent song great (&quot;Storms&quot;).<br />As for the CD quality itself - it could be MUCH better.  When orginally released on CD, the format time would not allow the full version of 'Sara' to be included.  It is still hard for me to listen start to finish w/this flaw.  Now that CDs can hold more - Warner Bros needs to re-release the original recording. The album is also in desparate need of remastering. Listen to the 'Tusk' tracks on 'The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac' and you can hear things that are so missing on either 'Tusk', 'Greatest Hits' or 'The Chain'.<br />For the overall recording I still say - 5 stars.<br />For CD quality on the oringial release - 3.5 stars.  If you can wait until a re-release (if it ever comes), I say do it.ng on either 'Tusk', 'Greatest Hits' or 'The Chain'.<br />For the overall recording I still say - 5 stars.<BR>For CD quality on the oringial release - 3.5 stars.  If you can wait until a re-release (if it ever comes), I say do it.

B000000OUJ|5.0|The GZA is one of the finest MCs in the history of the industry and more than half of that reputation is based on Liquid Swords. This is the RZA at his absolute finest (I hear some of the beats from this album in my SLEEP) and the GZA is downright brilliant with the lyrics. On top of all this, the albums seems to have a true theme and the motif is masterful right down to the scrambled song titles on the Record Jacket. A trademark of Wu-tang has always been that most albums are hit-or-miss. This album is a dead bull's eye. An absolute maserpiece. A must have for any Wu-Tang fan or Wu-tang fan.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Ever since I got this album, don't get me wrong, I really like it. I listen to it all of the time, I've even imported all of the songs into the computer that I use in school.<br />But I, like many, felt there weren't enough songs on here to showcase all Nirvana's brilliance and talent. Some good ones I thought were missing:<br />Pay to Play (rarity)<BR>Chorus Verse Chorus (rarity)<BR>Big Cheese (Bleach)<BR>Love Buzz (Bleach)<BR>Aneurysm (Incesticide)<BR>Dive (Incesticide)<BR>Breed (Nevermind)<BR>Drain You (Nevermind)<BR>Polly (Nevermind)<BR>Something in the Way (Nevermind)<BR>Plateau (Unplugged)<br />I have all of those songs on a Nirvana burnt disc I made. I just think many others should hear these (especially the older ones from Bleach and the rarities; ones they've probably never heard). <br />But overall, nothing really more to complain about. All of their best and biggest hits are all on here.
B00003CXAY|4.0|It is a remarkable achievment to create a film without any actors and without a storyline.. however, it tells the story of a beautifull planet which is rudely interrupted by a certain species known as Men. The message of this film is not very positive, destroying nature, life with stressy hasty people who enjoy to be amused, not to amuse themselves, yes, Life out of Balance! The title covers the subject. The film confronts us with the way we live. For example Scenes of rushing people interchanged with scenes taken in (foot processing) factories  Also the and of the film (Prophecies) is in its way very catchy, the black side of our sociaty with the almost sacred music from Profecies supporting it. The message behind Koyaanisqatsi is perfectly symbolised by the exploding space rocket at the end of the film. <BR>The film is a hypnotic and impressive symphony of music and images. In my opinion, Philip Glass composed is first symphony in 1982 and not in 1987.<BR>Last but not least a few words on the DVD quality. of course the picture and sound quality is much better then the VHS copy I already had. However in my opinion it could be better; the music is sometimes slightly out of tone especially at the end, a church organ sound is very sensitive to variaty in tape speed. The pictures are a bit reddish. That's the only reason to rate this film 4 instead of 5 stars. Geffry Reggio, Philip Glass and Ron Fricke did a outstanding job!
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman:the movie DVD is the best it has tons and tons of <BR>deleted scenes threw out the special edtion.I loved how they <BR>went back and cleaned it up and added new sound effects to it <BR>also this is far better than the origianl VHS verison of the <BR>film.And the extended krypton sequnces was neat to.I give this <BR>DVD a five star rating because I am a big fan of this particular<BR>movie..............
B000063DS1|5.0|This is a great Box Set<br />It's an enjoyable set with a great list of artists as well as the Band.<br />Recomend it!<br />Well packaged and great sound!
B00005JKCH|5.0|This film is spectacular. I thought it was a bit Hollywood, but anyways a great film. The first film i saw by Sam Raimi was Army of Darkness, which was hilarious. I then went on to see Evil Dead 1 and 2, quick and the dead, and the Gift. When i saw this though i was very excited. this film has great acting from tobey mcguire, kirsten dunst, and william dafoe from one of my favorite movies Platoon. Although it doesn't follow the comics exactly and modernizes a lot of things, it still manages to keep things drawn out and easy to figure out. it revolves around the green goblin and spider-man fighting each other for right and wrong and such, but also talks about mary-jane and peter's relationship. although not true to the comics, the relationship is still interesting to watch. i do wish the dvd had better commentary by sam raimi and the crew, like the evil dead commentary he's done, too bad. the dvd has a lot of material, but most short and boring. movies still great though
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has a beautiful voice. Mariah, Celine, Christina, and Whitney before crack are the best female singer out vocally. I love the song \\"Walk Away\\" she sings it so emotionally you just can't help but feel the pain she feeling. \\"Impossible\\" is a good song to with Alicia Keys. Oh my other favorite \\"Loving Me For Me\\" my repeat button is broke for listening to that song over and over.All of Christina songs on this album was good. I didn't really like her last album so I had to decide if I want to waste my money on it then be mad when I got home. But I'm happy that I did buy it. Was a good investment in music. I hope she gets a Grammy for it. Cause it's the best female out right now. Ya know?
0375414053|5.0|I thought this book was very entertaining. At first I thought this book would hold no interest to me, as a stay-at home mom, but I found many of the Kate's insights and dilemmas so true and often comical. I know exactly what she is talking about in her book--all the different characters--the muffia, the moms who write thank you's for playdates and have their holiday shopping finished in August. I truly enjoyed this book! A must read for all moms!
B00006RU5B|5.0|The rumors ran rampant for almost two years before this jem was dropped in out laps.  This album has what all the true rock fans have been questing for: something that is different, but familiar to what we all embraced in the early 90's.  Cornell + Rage = Fantastic!  \\"Cochise,\\" the first single has the bottom that we loved in Rage and Morello's guitar work is stellar.  \\"I am the Highway\\" is full of strength and meaning, stuff that Cornell tried to spread on his solo effort, but comes through much better in this attempt. At times, the guitar work seems a little too progressive, like Tom M. is trying to show you all the tricks he can bring to the table, but it doesn't wander to far into the trippy. All in all, a extremely solid debut. I hope there is more to come. Buy this album, tell a friend, spread the gospel.
B00005YXZH|4.0|After reading many of the reviews of this album (good and bad), I decided to give it a chance.  In short, I'm glad I did.  It's definitely one of those albums that it best absorbed in one complete listening, not in pieces.  It will never beat A.M. in my opinion, but it's a great addition to my collection.  Here's the skinny:<br />1) 4-star album<BR>2) Not a radical departure as some have suggested.  In my mind it's really a stripped-down acoustic record with some well-timed noises<BR>3) I like placement of the noises and effects, but don't always like the sound of the noises chosen.  Does this make sense?<BR>4) As mentioned, best digested in one sitting<br />Enjoy.
B0000524CY|5.0|This film has gained a lot of notoriety through out the years.It has been ridiculed in spoof horror films such as 'Repossessed' but there is one inescapable fact...it is a truly disturbing and has a realistic feel to it that is missing from other films of the same genre.<br />You probably all know the story from here on in so I won't bore you with the details.<BR>The one thing that makes this film truly scary is the STYLE of the film.When you are watching the scenes in the US, you feel like you are watching a documentary and not a feature film.<BR>The acting of the main characters especially Linda Blair as the little girl, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Jason Miller as the priest are exceptional.When you look in Jason Miller's eyes you can sense the fear that he has of the evil he sees in front of him and his doubt in God which is caused by the sudden death of his mother.<BR>The film slowly evolves from a quasi-documentary into a total nightmare.It is like a bad dream.You want it to end but are totally spellbound by the malevolent spirit which awakens in the little girl.The sound effects are amazing and the imagery is shocking in places eg. when the young girl masturbates with the crucifix.<BR>Overall the film packs a large punch because it is about the fear of the unknown that is in all of us.<BR>The demon knows more than we do and can cause us to doubt our faith and can even read our minds and that is what makes it truly scary.<BR>The degeneration of a beautiful little girl into a demonic beast is really well done.That is down to skill of the director William Friedkin and his crew.<BR>Finally the screenplay is also excellent and this is because it is done by the author of the book William Peter Blatty so it has not been compromised.<BR>All in all this is one 'hell' of a film (sorry about the corny joke !)
B000000JO3|5.0|This IS hardcore punk. Nothing will ever be as good.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Watched this on a long haul flight from Kenya.It kept me awake and I was exhausted! A very good fast moving movie - not as good as Minority Report but excellent.
B000005ZGZ|5.0|Fugazi had been progressing musically on every album since their inception but &quot;End Hits&quot; is probably the crowning achievment of  those progressions. The album starts with &quot;Break&quot; an amazing song which showcases more of Brendan Canty's great jazz-influenced drumming. After &quot;Break&quot; it rolls right into &quot;Place Position&quot; a really propelling song that also manages to be different. The album continues on displaying so much blending of styles, riffs, drumming, effects, moods, feelings and subtle nuances to keep you involved in it for years. That's right I have been listening to it for years and STILL pick up new things (noises, sounds, all kinds of stuff). This is the way an album should be. Also the title joke is kind of funny too, if you can figure it out. Another must-have.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|At first, I was skeptical of the CD.  I downloaded &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; on an MP3 website, and then I realized that I became addicted!  The beats on this album pulse a pure, club beat, and the lyrics actually have meaning (unlike so many other artists out there today).  I have listened to both the Russian and the English CD, and they're both in heavy rotation in my CD player.  Whether it's &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; with the amazing drum line, or the beautiful &quot;Stars&quot;, this album will last a long time on the charts.  These girls know what it takes to make a great album.  I'm not lesbian myself, but you really can just put that beside you, and enjoy this CD entirely.
B00000099Y|5.0|From the beginning of the album &quot;Stinkfist&quot; until the end &quot;Third Eye&quot; this album does not have a weak moment. In my opinion Tool's best album. Every member of the band pushes his instrument to the limit creating amazing riffs, sounds, textures, moods etc...such a progression from &quot;Undertow&quot;. Aenima is Tool's crowning achievement.
0802130208|5.0|As I neared the end of the book I was extremely disaappointed...not by the book...but by the fact that it was almost over.  Amazing use of the English language makes this book an absolute joy to read.
0316666343|3.0|Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is everything I needed from a book on my all-too-short two-week winter vacation from college.  I read it in a day and a half.  The style and flow of the writing make it a quick read; the reader sort of &quot;floats&quot; through the afterlife with Susie, as gentle as a cloud.  It's an intelligent book, giving an interesting answer to one of our favorite &quot;What if?&quot; questions: what if I were dead?  At the same time, it isn't a literary heavyweight that stresses the mind (exactly what I DON'T need right now).  I would recommend &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; to anyone who needs to unwind, and wants a nice ending-- I won't say happy, because that's impossible, but nice; a RESOLVED ending, something that's all too rare in modern fiction.  So, sit back, relax, and destress!
B000065U1N|3.0|Ridley Scott is one of the finest film directors of all time, an expert technician whose formal training as a painter has never deserted him. Unfortunately, like many technicians, he's oblivious, or wilfully ignorant of some of the wider issues that surround his work.    Black Hawk Down is based on a well researched history book of the same name that describes a special forces operation in Somalia in 1993 that went horribly wrong. A simple \\"in, out\\" arrest and capture task intended to take less than an hour turned into a chaotic 18 hour battle that killed 17 elite soldiers, wounded more than seventy more and killed several hundred Somali militia and civilians including many women and children.    As we've come to expect from Scott, this film is wonderful to look at, by turns exhilerating, frightening and (to this cowardly inexperienced civillian) seems very realistic. War films are replete with cliches, but very few are encountered here, in fact the standard uniforms, equipment, haircuts, and language of the American soldiers make them hard to differentiate, and emphasise they are a team composed of interchangable members. This must be deliberate since at the start of the film we're introduced to a lot of characters but aren't given much background information on anybody.    This leads to the first major problem - since we don't really know the characters, we don't really really care much about them, despite a variety of horrible fates that await them in the backstreets of Mogadishu. Here and there there's a flicker of interest, of sympathy, or of humour, buts precious little to base a judgement on.    The second major problem is the imbalance in the entire presentation; namely that each American death is treated as the tragedy it is, while barely a second or two of compassion is displayed towards any of the Somali militia who die like flies while trying to engage their better trained, better equipped American opponents. In some ways this is inevitable, given our point of view and the realities of commercial film making. But none the less, unlike the original book which took some pains to explain the Somali position and describe the experiences of some militia members in the battle, nothing much makes it to the screen here.    At worst, Black Hawk Down reminds you of an updated \\"Zulu\\" which also featured a tiny force of whites (but with superior weapons) against thousands of fanatical yet poorly armed blacks. Most of the time it rises above that, but a simnple scene or two (perhaps Somalis grief over their dead) would have dismissed the notion outright.    Three stars then, perhaps a fourth for this excellent DVD which offers an superb alternative long ending sequence (which is very powerful and satisfying) and some excellent commentaries from Ridley Scott himself, the writing team, and veteran soldiers who actually took part in the battle itself.
0002005549|4.0|This book talked about some neat stuff about programming. I'm a Computer Engineering Student.. and it was all very interesting. <br />I couldn't put this book down .. read it straight through.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I really enjoyed the album. It's a great mixture of his hits and I think if anyone wants to get to know Elton better through his music, then this is the album to buy. If you haven't experienced much of Elton John's music before, then this CD will give you a good idea of how his music has changed over the decades. A definite must buy for any fan.
B000003S0P|5.0|This album from start to finish is amazing. Not one dull moment. From the raw energy and tight playing of &quot;Red&quot;, to the soft flow and hard end of &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; as well as one of the most heavy riff's Crimson ever wrote &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; this album is great. &quot;Providence&quot;'s jamming quality is mesmerizing and &quot;Starless&quot; goes from soft to urgent perfectly. Perfect record.
B00006J9OT|4.0|One case of a CD sounding better than its DVD version. Unbelievable but true. Diana Krall fans should definitely have this one on their collection. Put this on your CD player and re-live her concert again and again. Diana Krall may well go down in history as the female version of Frank Sinatra. Now, I know a lot of people out there would raise their eyebrows, cry foul, protest, say its blasphemous to make this kind of statement, but, that is just an opinion. I'm sure it has already been said about her so, I'm not the first one. <br />Sonically, this CD is a great live recording. Diana' voice is well centered, she's lush and clear which is typical of all her recordings.<br />The only complain I have is in the technical aspect of this CD. I don't know why John Pisano (acoustic guitar) was put on the left portion of the recording. He was supposed to be on the right side of the concert stage. What was going on? There can be no acceptable reason for this.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I sat in a packed theater during this film's opening weekend (back in '79), so full of enthusiastic fans of Star Trek that every seat was taken.  It was one of those magical movie experiences.  Plus I was just a sophomore in high school and a huge fan of the TV series (although I didn't dress up as my favorite character/alien to attend the showing like some people I saw while waiting in the ticket line).  Therefore, my positive opinion of this film, STTMP, is admittedly biased.<br />Years later, when I watched it again on a TV (from a rented VHS tape) in my quiet living room, I was somewhat disappointed.  It wasn't nearly as great as I remembered.  If I were rating this film from that version, I would have given it three stars tops.<br />Well, I felt the old magic again while watching this new DVD version.  I'm so glad Robert Wise was given the opportunity to &quot;finish&quot; his film after 20+ years, because this version is far superior.  I especially admire how the new computer-generated effects were merged into the film without &quot;out-doing&quot; the original model and matte painting -based effects.  The best example is where Kirk and Co. go up on the Enterprise saucer and cross the &quot;bridge&quot; to meet V'ger, but there are many other places where the new effects shots greatly enhance the experience without looking like they are the &quot;new and improved&quot; effects (as in the Star Wars special editions).  In fact, without the commentary tracks, I would not have noticed them all.<br />Some folks criticize this DVD version because the pace is still slow and it still has long special effects oriented sequences.  That's silly...  As I have heard many times, a film is the product of its time and the circumstances of its creation.  I'm glad Wise and his Director's Edition team did not try to re-edit STTMP into a Matrix-generation movie.  STTMP was released soon after Star Wars.  Back then, seeing a great special effects sequence on the big screen was still a &quot;special&quot; treat.  And for a Trek fan, seeing the newly updated movie version of the Starship Enterprise on the big screen for the first time was a true spectacle by itself.  It deserved a 12-minute flyby.  The changes made in the DVD version only serve to create the movie that Wise would have released in 1979, had he been given the time and resources to properly complete the final editing and effects.  He does not attempt to create a new movie to better fit today's tastes and expectations.  He and his Director's Edition team showed commendable skill as well as restraint.<br />Every fan of the science fiction movie genre should see this Director's Edition of the STTMP, especially if old enough to have seen the original release in theaters.  In the future, I hope it gets a special showing in a real movie theater, because I'd really love to see it again on the big screen in its greatly improved form.<br />[Watch the trailers on Disk 2.  They are unintentionally hilarious and really help date the film back to the late 70's.]
B0000047CW|5.0|This is supposedly the original bossa nova record.  If so, it's  now clear why bossa nova was such a craze in America.  The music is an effortless sounding marriage between fine melody and rhythm.    <br />Jazz Samba sounds a lot like a great soundtrack to a movie from the 60s.  Maybe it was. Or, more likely, many soundtracks simply tried to emulate the sound.  In any case, it's most pleasurable.  Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz complement each other so well, neither playing over the other. The sax and guitar are not a common duo but these two pull it off like they were long lost brothers. I like this recording better than Getz/Gilberto because it seems more fluid, more natural. <br />This is not the light/kixy/kenny/smooth jazz foisted on the radio public these days although it would probably fit in that format.  Jazz Samba is the real deal.  It does not pretend atmosphere; it creates one.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I laugh and cry during the whole movie!<BR>It is one of the greatest movies to see with the family (kids, parents, and grandparents), because everybody will love the story!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is a progression from Aenima which was incredible. This album is 79 minutes long and all of it is worth the time. The standout song is the title track &quot;Lateralus&quot; abosolutly amazing worth the price just for this song. With this Tool have definitly established themselves as the new King Crimson.
B0000714BP|5.0|I took the time to read some of the reviews and although I try to be as objective and respectful of everyone's opinions as I can, one particular review that annoyed and irritated me is of one who is in a sense critical and judgemental, as if it were personal, believing his views and comments are above anyone else's. I saw this movie and in fact loved it because in it's own way, it shows us that no matter who we are or where we come from, we all deserve, perhaps not acceptance(and it's a shame that in this day and age, we're still not there yet), but respect and tolerance. Whether this reviewer chooses to believe it or not, we are all GOD's children. He whom is without sin, should cast the first stone. This is not a gratuitously violent or sexual movie. It is a movie about facing and overcoming adversity, about learning to respect each other's differences. This is a fun and entertaining movie. Enjoy it for what it is, and I highly recommend it...
B00005221M|2.0|This is one of my favourite movies! I bought the DVD, even though I already owned a VHS copy because I thought it would be even better in the DVD format, but I was disappointed. The director's cut adds footage, but it also deletes dialogue/scenes and part of the musical score. I don't know what the people in charge were thinking! If the scenes were good enough to be in the theatrical release they should not be deleted for the DVD version! People normally buy a movie on DVD because they liked it in the theatre or on VHS! It is folly to cut parts out of a movie that people love in the original!
0789723107|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. It was full of a lot of useful information. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in making their website more effective.
6303314015|5.0|I've rented the VHS edition and have just seen the 2003 New Year's IMAX release which is spectacular.<br />My (then) three and a half year old found the VHS too scarey.  But now at 4 1/4 she loved the IMAX edition and wants to play at being Nala.  We are waiting for the DVD, but might have to buy the VHS if Disney doesn't promise an early release date for the DVD.<br />The plot is familiar:<BR>Hamlet's (Simba's) father (Mustafa) is murdered by Claudius (Skar) about a 1/4 way through the movie, and Hamlet (Simba), still a young cub, is tricked into feeling responsible.  He banishes himself and goes off to the desert to die.  But is saved and befriended by comic relief side-kicks, Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern (Timon and Puumba) in the desert, where he grows into a confused adolescent, guilt ridden and not knowing his place.  He encounters Ophelia (Nala), his childhood playmate, and with a few bits of magic and intervention, Simba decides to face up to his past help rescue his kingdom from the misrule of Skar.<br />Besides the [demise] of Mustafa, there are three encounters with hyenas.  These are scarey, more so than the wolves in Beauty and the Beast, more so than anything in Snow White.  The final battle is particularly violant.  Parents should be ready with the fast-foward.  Still my four year old daughter is fine with it as long as someone holds her hand.<br />The music is not as good as in Beauty and the Beast, in which every song is a masterpiece.  But it is very good.  Here it is the background scenery that is so spectacular.  And whatever your kid's favorite African animal is, it will be included in there somewhere (though maybe just for a few seconds).  It is the grand \\"Circle of Life\\" scence that open and conclude the film that really show the full quality of the animation.
B000000993|4.0|The album began the progression Tool would make with their music on every album. The force of \\"Intolerance\\", \\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Sober\\" at the start of the album set the stage for the rest of it. Engaging, angry, intelligent and exploratory this established Tool.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This is a very good movie. The story is great (and the movie is better than most at following the book). The movie also has amazing special effects. You can really care about these people.
B0000033OZ|4.0|Very good. With this one album you get a long span of all listenable songs, instrumental virtuosity (especially on piano), atmospheric music with imagery (especially on &quot;Take A Pebble&quot;), powerful and sonorous vocals (especially on &quot;Take A Pebble&quot;), classically based music (e.g., on &quot;The Barbarian&quot;), exotic synthesizer sounds, good songwriting, a pretty guitar ballad with a message (&quot;Lucky Man&quot;), and enough intricacy and depth to make the album interesting for a very long time. Why didn't I give it 5 stars, then? I'm not sure, except that being a Yes fan I felt the music wasn't quite perfect. It didn't carry quite as much energy, or have as much melody, or enough versatility, or enough balance of instruments, or as much non-keyboard virtuosity as it could have. There's a bit too much piano throughout, relative to the other instruments, too many of the keyboard parts are based on the dissonant tritone interval to make it sound strange instead of just making it sound good, some hot guitar solos or vocal harmonies would have helped, and the &quot;Lucky Man&quot; lyrics were a little too obvious for my taste. But these are minor squabbles. It's a very good, high quality album that doesn't get dated, at least not to my ears.
B000002A33|5.0|Firstly, when i bought this record and listened to it for the first time it was not what i expected. The only song i had heard from the album was the kindof &quot;happy&quot; sounding &quot;All I Know&quot; this track is great, it love it and i kindof expected the rest of the album to be like it too. However it wasn't. There is a feeling of loneliness that comes across in the Trees' music, perhaps reflecting the places they grew up or their &quot;misfit&quot; image in society that only kids like the Trees can show. <br />However, although it was nothing like anything I had ever heard before, i was attracted to it. It's not depressing, it's not happy, its something in between that i can't exactly put my finger on, it just gives you a good feeling in some way and i think thats what makes it so good. I dont think it &quot;classable&quot; its not any genre, its all by itself, and it definately appeals. This was my first trees' record that i wanted so bad i bought in HMV of all places (ripoffshop)!<br />I have no idea what most of the songs are about, theyre good though. My favourite has to be &quot;All I Know&quot; theres something friendly about it in  a way. &quot;halo of ashes&quot; is a great beginning song, again its hard to describe, its very Trees'. I like all of this album, but i couldn't tell you why, theyre one of those bands that just have that something that appeals, its very special and they certainly didnt lose it for Sweet Oblivion. and it was there before Dust aswell. <br />If you are/have been into alice in chains, pearl jam or beat happening, nirvana and grunge stuff, i reckon youll like it, its a great record to have. Mark Lanegan really did shine on this one.
B000068TPN|5.0|Hal Moore was there. With this movie he states \\"Hollywood finally got it right\\". Nothing more need be said.
B00000IACG|4.0|This is the soundtrack to the spectacular VHS/DVD &quot;Instrument&quot; by Fugazi, it is a great album for fans. It contains early/different versions of Fugazi songs that are already on Fugazi albums. It also contains some unreleased material. These different interpratations and unreleased songs are intresting but people who aren't as involved fans might not like it that much. The quality ranges from track to track and there are only 2 (I believe) songs with vocals on them &quot;I'm So Tired&quot; (one of the unreleased songs) is just Ian MacKaye playing piano and singing almost a ballad-like song, to me this song alone is worth the price. But, if you aren't a devoted fan I would advise buying another Fugazi album.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is conceptually one of the most brilliant pieces of work throughout Hollywood's history. I am absolutely awed by the fact that Orson Welles was only 26 when he directed and co-wrote this masterpiece.<br />Here is a personification of the theme &quot;The road to hell was paved with good intentions.&quot; For it is Charles Foster Kane who, by running a newspaper, has an initial desire of providing the citizens of New York with information that has both truth and integrity but who later decides to use his daily circulation to control what people read and think. <br />If you take this movie to heart, it will make you ponder over what news media sources can be trusted.
B000001F29|3.0|I see this album is quite popular, but I was never particularly impressed by it, either in the '80s or now. I liked Jon &amp; Vangelis' album &quot;Short Stories&quot; much better. There's nothing wrong with these songs, but there's nothing much outstanding about them, either. It seems whenever Jon Anderson is left to his own devices, he falls into the same simplistic, hypnotic, 1- or 2-chord strumming mode. It wasn't that way in Yes' golden era, when his chord progressions were all outstanding due to an interesting and unique style whereby they slowly pivoted between different keys while using all major chords in rock relationships. But here he falls back into his usual simplistic songwriting style: &quot;I'll Find My Way Home,&quot; although catchy and pleasant, could have been written by any half-competent musician, &quot;State of Independence&quot; is nearly 8 minutes of the same 2 chords, &quot;The Friends of Mr. Cairo&quot; is nothing deeper than a fun tribute to old gangster movies with an excessively simple melody, and &quot;Back To School&quot; is a mindlessly commercial song using a standard blues progression. &quot;The Mayflower&quot; tries a little too hard to draw an analogy between exploration of the seas and the exploration of outer space, but it's the most promising and deepest song of the lot. Its beautiful, lush orchestration and sound effects would be ideal soundtrack music for an IMAX film of space travel, for example. Overall, this is a good album for pleasant, dreamy, sing-along songs with great-sounding synthesizers, but it's not likely to be to the taste of hardcore Yes fans or of songwriting analysts.
B000002MU3|5.0|Don't listen to people who say that Monster is R.E.M.'s worst album.  I think it's brilliant.  In fact it's my favorite R.E.M. album.  Most people don't like it because it's loud and distorted, but thats the point!  Their last couple of albums were mostly acoustic and they felt they took that as far as they could.  So the right thing to do was to go the opposite way and make an album like Monster.  I kind of think of it as their version of The Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat (but better).  If you are a fan of bands like Nirvana and The Smashing Pumpkins this should be your first R.E.M. album.
B00006GA48|4.0|I was over a friend's house and she put a CD on and I had no clue what band it was.  I soon found myself listening to the songs and becoming enthralled at the quality of the sound from not only the CD, but the music itself which was just amazing.  <BR>After listening to the entire CD I decided to buy it even though I had never even heard of the band before (that's how good it was).  I bought it at B&amp;N and listened to it at least 2 times every day for about 2 months.  If someone is interested in classic rock with early heavy metal and blues influences, this is the CD for you.  The live bonus tracks are great, especially the sound and energy of the crowd.<BR>However, the three tracks of Mean Mistreater are a little excessive, and after a while I found myself skipping over the re-mix and the live version.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Nemesis, in my opinion, was an excellent movie, in the sense there were lots of action scenes and angles that the viewer could focus upon. Despite all the informative comments concerning how this fared in comparison with the previous nine Star Trek motion pictures, as well as the Star Wars box office blockbusters, there were some holes in the story I could not quite fill in.<br />The part that bewildered me by far was where upon the destruction of the core of a massive ship that contained several doses of radiation that were to be used to destroy an entire planet, there was set off an explosion comparable to that in either Stargate or Independence day, and after that incident, the Enterprise, which seemed to be in close proximity while being in a dire predicament of no warp capabilities and virtually no shields, somehow remained intact. How could this be possible, even in the Star Trek universe?
B000008H4E|4.0|My #1 favorite song from all of 1980 was a minor hit that came off this album: \\"I Hear You Now.\\" That song is gentle and beautiful, but I have to admit the rest of this album is pretty dull. \\"Bird Song\\" is the next best, and is also quite pretty, but it's only a short tag-on composition at the end of \\"Each And Everyday.\\" \\"The Road\\" is next best, with a nice ending, but it wanders in the middle and has some problems with its chord progression in the beginning. The remainder of the album is unremarkable except for the nice synthesizer sounds. \\"Curious Electric\\" is a spacy, semi-humorous song with gobs of reverb and a ring modulator, singing about a sick television tube. The thing that holds this album together is the great sounding synthesizers with special sound effects, even though the playing itself isn't anything dazzling. Vangelis' musical style with lots of lonely sounding reverb and downbent synthesizer notes sounds very '80s-futuristic, reminiscent of the film \\"Blade Runner,\\" or of the Tomorrowland Transit Authority ride in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. So, if you like that type of sound the CD will be worthwhile, otherwise not, since you can get \\"I Hear You Now\\" on Jon & Vangelis' greatest hits album.
0060974176|3.0|If you are just starting out learning about Lean Manufacturing, and you only have time to read one book, &quot;The Machine that Changed the World&quot; is an historically important book but &quot;Lean Thinking&quot; is the one that actually gets you started toward implementation. It's one of those rare occasions where the sequel was better than the original.
B000002ADT|5.0|33 Seconds into the first song on this classic album, you are wondering what exactly you are listening to as the music kind of rambles and wanders...  Then the base line picks up some kind of funky rythm and you hear the drum and piano charm in playing off the base line, then add saxophone to the piano creating bigger sound.  After another minute of groovin' this rythm, you hear Davis' horn pierce the air with a clear, shrill, note that goes straight to your soul.  And from there it's ecstasy.  It is incredible that this was created without thorough practice and multuple takes.  Mastery.  If you have ears, listen.
B00006LLJ4|4.0|Minority Report is a triumph that pairs up the talents of Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise. Set in the year 2054, the story has scenery very similar to that presented in Blade Runner. <br />Without giving any of the crucial elements away, I will summarize the description of the movie by saying that it is essentially Gattaca meets The Fugitive, in the sense that the protagonist, John Anderton, is involved in several chase scenes, perpetually eluding authorities who are maintaining a conceptually flawed, futuristic, Brave New World society.
B000075BFK|2.0|I never thought I'd see the day where I would give a bad review to a 2pac album. This album is 20% good material, 80% mediocre filler. There's probably a reason why this material wasn't released on the Makaveli album or any of the subsequent releases - it's not as good. Much of the remixes sound worse than the originals. Johnny J produced some decent R&amp;Bish tracks, but the remixes try to hard to catch up to modern day production. The originals were much better. Unless you're a loyal 2pac fan, save your money and skip this album. It's just not as good.

0784011176|5.0|The Piano is truly a hypnotic film. It takes you away to a bleak, desolate New Zealand island where Ada McGrath, a shy woman who stopped speaking at the age of six is getting off a boat to meet her soon-to-be husband Stewart, arranged by her father, with her daughter Flora. Ada communicates through Flora, who can talk. Ada uses her old family piano as a way to express her feelings, and she needs it to remain calm and stable. The men could not get the piano up to Stewart's house, which frustated Ada immensly. Stewart's neighbor George Baines then brings it to his house after much of Ada's pleading and lets Ada play it in exchange for sexual favors. <BR> This is an extremely intriguing, beautiful, unique romantic drama that all interested in film should definitely check out. It is one of my all time favorite movies.<br />The Piano<BR>Directed by Jane Campion<BR>Starring Holly Hunter, Ann Paquin, Harvey Keitel, and Sam Neill<BR>Rated R for moments of extremely graphic sexuality
B00005JKZT|4.0|The Two Towers is an excellent sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring. The strengths of the movie lie in the special effects, the acting, and the battle scenes. <br />For those who have not read the book, it would be difficult to identify the territories and the characters upon first viewing of this movie, even if you happened to see The Fellowship of the Ring. Upon second viewing, one will likely get a much better ability to perceive the significance of each territory of Middle Earth. <br />There are those who criticize the movie for its tendencies to stray from the original storyline, and they may have their case. I say that perhaps the main weakness that both purists and nonpurists could bring about would be that the sequel has a weaker focus on the main plot, which is to take the ring to the fires of Mordor and destroy it.<br />However, there was not really that much that could be done to prevent this from really happening, for from the conclusion of The Fellowship to that of the Two Towers, the team was split up, leaving the factions fending for themselves in the various regions of Middle Earth.<br />If you have not seen it, here is a recommendation. Though the all-consuming goal and the final product, essentially, is to get to Mordor, think primarily of the intermediate territories in the process. In other words, spend your time comparing and contrasting the scenes from Rohan, Helms Deep, Isengard and Minas Tirith; for Mordor is still ahead.
0802130208|5.0|This book surpasses all other as the greatest novel ever. Hilariously entertaining, A Confederacy of Dunces describes the life of Ignatius J. Reilly, a slob of a man, a rebel against society and a spellbinding character. In no other book have I ever been so pleased by the author. John Kennedy Toole deserves to be placed among the greatest authors of all time.

B00005JKDR|5.0|OK, so some people didn't like my last review; I'll edit it in an attempt to be more helpful.<br />I really enjoyed this movie, and my kids both enjoyed it.  The story does get a bit scary in places, and some younger children may need a little extra assurance, but they get past it pretty quickly.  When the monsters become laughable (instead of scary), the kids can relax a bit after watching it.<br />This is not a \\"princess\\" movie; this is a story of two friends who's world starts to fall apart because they do the right thing.  It's a great film, honest.
B00006J3T4|4.0|I've dug Mark Knopfler ever since \\"Sultans of Swing\\" and like a fine wine...well, I don't know much about wine...but Mr. Knopfler is definitely growing even better with age. \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\" is proof positive of this. Fantastic album that grows on you with each listen. Don't expect the second coming of Dire Straits here. This is a different Mark Knopfler. A fusion of folk, rock and country with a touch of blues and a dash of humor all with an ole time feel. Mr. Knopfler has become quite the storyteller through his songs. It is a very \\"visual\\" album and it does not take much effort to visualize the people and places that his lyrics lead you. His quitar may have mellowed a bit over the years but it has not lost any of its impact and has picked up a sort of understated beauty...the man knows his way around a fret board. Beautiful stuff to listen to. And that voice...grown finer still over the years...soothing and charming as ever...and now you believe even more that voice knows from which it is speaking.<br />This album will charm you. If at first you don't quite get it give it a few more turns and it will begin to become clear that Mr. Knopfler has got it going on. It will leave you with a good positive feeling despite its low key, understated feel and at the same time perhaps a bit of a tear in your eye that it is over. That is quickly remedied by another spin through this wonderful collection of tunes.<br />Dig through the rubble and pick up \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\".
B00006IR5S|5.0|I thought that this soundtrack was awesome- it kept alot of the old soundtrack's theme, but added about double the amount of beautiful themes at the first soundtrack. The highlights of the CD were -(this was probably the best one)- FAWKES THE PHOENIX, the Flying Car, Gilderoy Lockhart, The Spiders, Prologue:Book II,THe Chamber of Secrets, Dueling the Basilisk, and Reunion of Friends. As you can see, I like almost half of the songs alot, and the rest are still great- on the 1st soundtrack, I only liked 3 songs- one of them was Harry's Wondrous World, WHICH IS ON THIS CD, so get it, get it, IF YOU ARE A FAN OF JOHN WILLIAMS, A HARRY POTTER FAN, OR A FAN OF CLASSICAL MUSIC, OR IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST SOUNDTRACK AT ALL!!!! gO GET IT
6305127638|5.0|To a treckie any Star Trek movie is good.  But this one is special, this is what Star Trek can be, a story of courage and honor and a tale of good vs evil that demonstrates how vengeance and hatred lead to torment and frustration.  This is a film beloved by treckies with a message that should be heard by everyone.
B00005JL96|4.0|I liked this movie in the theatres, and my kids have watched it over and over at home.  While the storyline is good, it doesn't have the laugh impact of Monster's Inc.
B00006X06U|5.0|Wow! What a gorgeous retrospective! Beautifully produed, wonderfully arranged, and soulfully sung! As always, Joni Mitchell's artistic standards are high and Travelogue is no exception. On Travelogue, Joni revisits some familiar territory albeit from a wistful and matured perspective. It really shines as a testament to Joni's fine songcraft -Expansive, filmic, and symphonically cool. New fans and old fans alike will appreciate this refreshing take on &quot;the old familiar&quot;. Travelogue works on many levels- much like a &quot;Memory Play&quot; -recapping a brilliant musical career with supreme confidence and clarity.
B00004YRQA|4.0|These memory cards work excellently. I have two and the only problem is the high price. I am glad to see the price has started to come down. It is pretty bad for Sony to still be going the memory card route, but you have to get one and this is the best.<br />I have had the mega memory cards and they are great at first. Then you start deleting information and moving stuff around and the mega memory packs just start falling apart. Just play it safe and get this bad boy.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary movie is a great solution for someone who doesn't laugh that much. Just watching 5 minutes into the movie I was laghing so hard. You just want to Say bravo, bravo.

You want to watch the movie again. beacause all the fun is in SCARY MOVIE
0064407667|5.0|I bought the box set of the first 3 books for my kids (ages 7 & 4 1/2) for Christmas.  As I read this first volume to them, they were sucked into the story right away.  Any book that keeps my kids interest and makes them use their imagination is good with me.<br />There are so many things I like about these books.  Yes...they are dark...yes...they are depressing...but they show how these 3 orphans overcome the bad things that happen to them and use their smarts!<br />We've already started book 2 and we can't wait to find out more from this incredible writer!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie was just dreadful.  They took an important part of American history and wrapped a stupid love story around it.  The acting was awful; the fictitious events created for the movie are so predictable that it hurts your head.  That was 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.
B00005JLZL|4.0|This is in response to the, as yet, unreleased \\"Life of David Gale\\".  In this review filled with sour grapes one of the movies I particlarly like is K-Pax.  It was a good picture, and very different from most. I get the feeling it is written by someone who just plain doesn't like Kevin Spacey.  The writer panned just about every one of Mr. Spacey's movies. I am a big fan and will continue to go to the movies he is in.  Pardon my ignorance, but how does one critize a movie not even released?  If the writer is a critic by profession, i.e.,Ebert, my advice is forget it go see it for yourselves.  Those people are usually all wrong.

B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna had already had moderate success with her self-titled debut with it spawning a handful of club hits and the top 10 hit &quot;Lucky Star.&quot; It was this album, however, that made her a superstar and a household name.<br />The first single &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was a huge #1 hit and is still one of her biggest and most infamous songs. In addition,the album spawned three other top 5 hits. &quot;Material Girl&quot; would give her a nickname she would never completely live down. &quot;Angel&quot; was is another great pop song and was a big hit, although it was neglected by the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; as was &quot;Dress You Up&quot; which is still one of my favorite Madonna songs. Other gems include the original &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot; *it was later remixed for &quot;Something to Remember&quot;* and the fantastic dance track &quot;Over and Over.&quot; This album would go on to 10x platinum becoming her bestselling album, although the Immaculate Collection would later tie it. It is a worthy purchase.
B000060MY6|4.0|In the love it/hate it debate, I'm in the &quot;like it&quot; group.  This is another of the illusion of reality &quot;you need to see it twice&quot; movies that have been popular in recent years -- think The Usual Suspects [the way the Kevin Spacey character made up his story from random details he observed], The Sixth Sense, The Others, Memento, etc.  Because much of the action occurs during a dream fantasy, David Lynch can give full rein to his &quot;weird&quot; tendencies with echoes of Blue Velvet--an exotic naked woman, a Roy Orbison song in a surreal setting, the great Badalamenti soundtrack, spooky car rides at night, etc.  As such, Lynch isn't being terribly original in his approach here, but he had the good sense to use one of the best actresses (Watts) and one of the most beautiful women (Harring) in the world, which makes re-viewing the film to figure out the plot a pleasure.
B00006RU5B|1.0|This cd is by far the most over rated cd of the year. The only thing it has going for itself is who is in the band. The truth is if this was a first cd for any other band it would bomb. So do yourself a favor, think for yourself, dont follow the crowd, give it a listen and I bet you will soon feel the same. Dont let the media tell you whats good, for this is a cd that has been done in the 80's to the 90's. Chris Cornell seems so out of place with the sound of rage backing him. Rage was awesome we all know that, and Chris Cornell is no replacement for Zack, just like the former Rage boys are not a replacement for soundgarden. This just smells.

B000060P79|3.0|I disagree with people who try to classify punk and contain it as what they had when they were growing up or whenever \\"it was real.\\" Simple Plan's CD is at exciting, energetic, and just a feel-good youthful experience that doesn't follow any guidelines. Just because a bunch of bands sound similar (which is why i gave it a 3 and not a 4), doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong. At least they're music isn't dismal or depressing. Honestly I think bands like soundgarden and stp are ...boring, cuz all theyre songs sound the same too, except they make me wanna crawl up in a corner and [hide]. Smashing pumkins is weird ... and never would I say that I don't like Nirvana, but how many times can you listen to someone scream \\"Rape Me\\" over and over again. It's a good sign that these so called \\"pop-punk bands\\", filled with people who don't hate their lives (What a Concept!), are growing in popularity. Good CD, go buy it.
0060001941|1.0|This book is 3 words over and over again: MY LIFE IS BAD. 500 pages and that's all it says. It's exactly the same as any other book about a poor family with an irresponsible father and a child who manages to be alright (Angela's Ashes, Black Boy, Riding in Cars With Boys) the only difference is - THIS ONE IS FICTION. Don't waste your time, money, or your sympathy on the most over praised book ever written.
0060955775|5.0|A simply amazing story. About a girl who wishes to commit suicide, as she believes that her life has meaning. After all, she had experienced all that she wanted - why live out the rest? The rest is all downhill from here according to her. It's her choice anyway, her life right?<br />It's a really interesting book that has given me insights on possible reasons about WHY someone would want to commit suicide. One of my friends just recently committed suicide for reasons I could not even begin to guess. People live beautiful lives, and you don't think about it - until it happens to someone who is in your life. You'd never expect it.<br />What a book. The most unexpected ending. It's all about living life to the max, living every second. I don't want to give away too much, but let me say that - the realization of death is something that can help you experience much more of life.<br />Cheers - Vaughan Allison
B000069CWE|5.0|... First of all, its original. LP adds great hiphop, awesome percussions and incredible new verses. And I'm not overblowing it either. This cd is filled with emotional stuff that will hit you right in the face and you will instantly relate. It has so much variety too, there's rap, hiphop, rock, violin stuff, screaming of course, and you get to hear more of Chester's depression through his amazing voice. You get a little soft sometimes, a little dance stuff, a lot of heavy metal, and just an overall great cd that you cant listen to without smiling.
B0000025YL|4.0|Accept and Judas Priest were arguably the biggest influences on the NWOBHM and speed metal in general, and I must say Restless and Wild is one of those albums that will make you forget who is in the room and incite random headbanging sessions. There are no pompous jaggoffs attempting to show off or expand your mind here... just pure 100% HEAVY METAL. <br />Fast as a Shark and the title track kick things off with a back to back speed metal assault.. Udo sounds like a constipated granny, of course, but that's the beauty of it all. There are a few slower, hard rock oriented numbers (move your head, neon nights) but they rock hard all the same. <br />I have never worn leather/studs in my life... this album makes me want to. Hail to Accept.
0743216458|5.0|\\"War is hell!\\"<br />Stephen E. Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\" proves that the above saying is no mere cliche.<br />Having been born in Amsterdam in 1950, I grew up hearing firsthand stories of the hellish war from the perspective of an occupied people. I married the daughter of an American G.I. who served in the Pacific during WWII, but it hasn't been until my son began asking him questions a few years ago that we began to hear about his experiences.<br />Ambrose vividly tells the story of Easy Company, from their rigid training in 1942 to their drop on D-Day and their brutal marches and battles to help liberate France, Belgium, and Holland before crossing the Rhine and heading for Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest.\\"<br />This book is not for the faint of heart. The following quote gives you a brief idea of what I'm talking about. \\"The soldier's concern is with death, not life, with destruction, not construction. The ultimate destruction is killing another human being.\\" Here Ambrose pauses on page 310 to summarize what he spells out in graphic detail on the pages preceding and following.<br />Why was this book written? Ambrose quotes Captain Richard \\"Dick\\" Winters who wrote, \\"...we wondered if the people would ever know what it cost the soldiers in terror, bloodshed, and hideous, agonizing deaths to win the war (page 316).\\" War IS hell, and these guys went through it.<br />I thank Dr. Ambrose for writing this book, and especially for telling the readers what these men did with their lives after the war. Many of us know men (and women) from this generation who haven't talked about what they went through. This book will at least give you a taste of what it was like.<br />I recently talked to a Vietnam War veteran who said that war veterans are often the last ones who want to go to war. If you read this, you'll understand why.
B000065AQU|2.0|a few good songs, buy this one if you are going to buy this cd at all, because it comes with some cool features.
B000056NX4|1.0|This is the worst adaptation of this musical -- ever!  This was my first experience with JCSS and after watching the video, I hated it -- vowed never to watch or listen to anything related to this musical ever again.<br />The leads, although obviously talented,  are not suited for the range needed to sing these songs.  At times, listening to Pradon as Judas is just too painful for words.  The only saving grace of this video version is the supporting cast -- Caiaphas: Frederick B Owens, Annas: Michael Shaeffer, Simon Zealotes: Tony Vincent, Peter: Cavin Cornwall .<br />Avoid this at all costs.  I was later introduced to the 1973 film version and fell in love with the story and the music.  Ted Neely and Carl Anderon are wonderful and hit every note just right.  Buy the 1973 version instead and save yourself a headache.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I know lots of people have already reviewed this, but oh well, I'll think I'll go for it. This soundtrack bears some of the coolest music you can hear. Howard Shore perfectly captures the ancient medieval feel of Lord of the Rings in this CD. Here's my brief summary of each track.<br />Track 1: An alternate theme for the opening sequence for the history of The Ring. Excellent choir vocals work to provide the feeling of the desperate fight of the Elves and Men in Middle-Earth.<br />Track 2: Almost an Irish-sounding melody, this track chronicles Gandalf's arrival in the Shire, and an introduction to the light-hearted life of hobbits. Very light, happy music.<br />Track 3: A shadow darkens the doors of the Hobbits when the Frodo realizes he bears the pivotal tool of the Enemy. Dark, ominous sounds dominate this track.<br />Track 4: Frodo leaves the Shire with the Ring, and Gandalf goes to Orthanc. The wizard Saruman betrays Gandalf, and defeats him in a duel of wizardry. The music is slow as Frodo begins his journey, and swells into Gandalf's arrival at Orthanc. Danger peaks, and so does the choir during the fight sequence. Perfectly captures the horror of the battle.<br />Track 5: Frodo meets three friends, and they in turn meet with the Black Riders. Excellent work by Shore to capture the musty, ancient-evil-awoken feel. He makes brilliant use of his choir to create the fear of the ghoulish chase that ensues.<br />Track 6: Slow music as the hobbits escape the riders, and arrive at the town of Bree. The music then reverts to the evil strains of the Black Riders when Frodo draws them to Bree by donning the Ring. Tense at the end as the Riders arrive, and nearly murder the hobbits in their beds.<br />Track 7: Darkness is heavy as the Black Riders attack the hobbits and the Ranger Strider, their new friend on a dark hill in the wild. The Ranger drives the riders off. Disappointingly, the heroic music that resounds as Strider crosses blades with the Riders is NOT includedin this track. Then the tone changes to the black tune of Isengard, the land of Saruman. The music has the sound of chains rattling faintly in the background. Once again, a perfect theme for his black kingdom. <br />Track 8: Enter the beautiful Elf-maiden Arwen, who spirits the wounded Frodo to Rivendell on her horse. It begins with the soft vocals of Enya at Arwen's entrance, builds up as she rides away with him, grows dark as the Black Riders persue her, and finally triumphant as a great flood defeats the Riders.<br />Track 9: The city of Rivendell is practically paradise, and the music is wonderful along with it. The music fits for a Thomas Kincaid rendition of the hidden city, as Frodo happily reunites with his friends.<br />Track 10: Half of this track is beautiful singing on Enya's part; an Elvish love song to go along with Strider (now revealed to us as the kingly Aragorn) speaking with his love-interest, Arwen. It then grows solemn and noble as great minds of Middle-Earth convene to discuss the Ring. It builds to a triumphant end when the Fellowship is formed. Enter the theme for the Fellowship. Great listen.<br />Track 11: Begins quietly, and builds excellently as the Fellowship departs. Wonderful, majestic brass and horns sound as we watch the valiant Fellowship journey though the different terrains of Middle-Earth on their Quest.<br />Track 12: Very dark. The Fellowship enters a former Dwarf-city and finds it strewn with the skeletons of the former occupants. At approximately 2:06 on the track, it grows more grandiose as they arrive at a massive and glorious Dwarven hallway. It then grows dangerous as the company is attacked by Orcs. The danger-tune is enhanced by violins that rapidly climb up the scale, much like a chill running up your spine. <br />Track 13: The best track here. The Fellowship tune sounds in a majestic way as the Fellowship defeats a part of their attackers and flee a greater enemy. A haunting male choir dominates the background, onceagain giving us this ancient evil feeling. The tune peaks as Gandalf confronts a massive opponent--a fiery demon called a Balrog--and then falls into a quiet funeral-like tune as Gandalf falls with his enemy. Enya's funeral-like wail is accompanied by a quiet yet meaningful choir in the background. This should bring tears to your eyes.<br />Track 14: We now enter another habitat of Elves, but a more somber place. Much more solemn and noble are these Elves, but the tune branches off into beauty as they encounter the beautiful Elf-Queen Galadriel and then the Elves mourn themselves at the news of Gandalf's death.<br />Track 15: Beautiful music sounds for 50 seconds, then falls away into music for the Fellowship's journey down the Great River. Gradually, as the company encounters the great Argonath, stone statues of former Kings, the music carries a sense of wonder and awe. It slows down as the company arrives on dry land.<br />Track 16: The track opens with the theme of temptation, as Aragorn-like the man from Gondor, Boromir, before him-undergoes a temptation to take the Ring unto himself. Aragorn comes through, implores Frodo to flee, and then defends him in a big Orc fight. It grows quiet and sad once again as the mighty Boromir falls in battle.<br />Track 17: A great tune to display Frodo's sadness at the sordid tale of the Ring, but then rebounds with resolve as he determines to follow through on the Quest alone. His faithful friend Sam catches up, and the two continue together. A nice go at the hobbit-tune. It then goes into the song sung by Edward Ross, \\"In Dreams.\\" It transitions into the next track.<br />Track 18: Enya's closing song. I wasn't entirely impressed with this song, to be honest. It just doesn't go anywhere. But then the Fellowship theme majestically ends the CD.<br />Under 1000 words!
B00005JLS0|4.0|Okay, let me start off by saying that I AM NOT a romantic comedy fan.  The movies are predictable, sappy, and I have yet to laugh aloud or smile to myself when my sister rents one for the family to watch.<BR>  <BR>Then why did I see this?  Well, I had nothing better to do, and my sister and her friend were going.

She was also passionate and witty (although, let's forget about the moments of her \\"eating problem\\", as it is not believable at all that she would be so thin if she ate that much in real life).<br />I havn't seen many movies with Hugh Grant, so as someone \\"new\\" to reviewing movies, I can't really compare his other roles to this one.  However I can say the only times I laughed during the movie where when he said something.  Bullock was good humor-wise, but I believe that Grant was the heart of the movie in that regard.<br />What I enjoyed most about this movie (and what set it apart from other romantic comedies that I have seen)was that it didn't give in to society's pressures and gender roles on women.  In the movie, Bullock actually told a prostitute to go home and finish her education, so she could be all she could be.  Now that is something positive to say about movies in this type of genre, where the woman's sole trait is almost always her beauty.  I don't mean to sound like a devout femminist, because I am definitely not.  It's just nice to see a positive influence on females where women generally try to find role models, the movies.<br />To sum this review up, \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" was a touching movie, that contrasts with other movies in this genre in certain areas.
B000065V41|3.0|I really liked both &quot;A Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;.  I think the Muppets to a fantastic job adapting literature to the screen in an enjoyable manner and I sincerely wish that they would return to this type of work (especially after the abysmal &quot;Muppets From Space&quot;).<br />HOWEVER -- unlike the first three Muppet movies, the DVDs for &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;A Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; contain the &quot;fullscreen&quot; version only.  &quot;Fullscreen&quot; is a euphemism for the cropped image, instead of the &quot;widescreen&quot; image (also called &quot;letterbox&quot;).  In other words you've lost bits of the image to the left and right of the parts you can see ... and with the Muppets there are always little interesting bits going on _everywhere_ in the image.<br />Kudos for the movies, but a BIG &quot;shame on you&quot; for not releasing the widescreen edition on DVD.
0553801511|5.0|Book 2 of the Tawny Man series is everything that book 2s from Robin Hobb should be and generally are.  What does that mean?  She makes, it seems, book 2's her epicenter.  A lot happens.  Little gets resolved.<br />However, where she excels-- where she *exceeds*-- is drawing the vivid portrayal of characters.  In this case, as with Fool's Errand and the Farseer Trilogy before it, in the first person perspective of protagonist FitzChivalry Farseer aka Tom Badgerlock.<br />I won't give away a thing of the plot, suffice it to say that the book jacket's contents, provided by Amazon here, are all you need to know.  That and, if you haven't done so already, pick up Fool's Errand and read it first (if not the Farseer and Liveship series).<br />This is a wonderful book.  I absorbed it and loved it.  I await eagerly book 3.
B00005JL2O|1.0|Most reviewers of this dreck start off by saying \\"I loved the first movie but...\\". I don't give this series of filmed train wrecks that much credit. The first one hurt my eyes and brain, the second one was completely unwatchable and this one is just plain evil. It is like the writers thought \\"the last one was full of stupid jokes, lets pour alot more into the third version of the same story!\\" Bad idea.<br />It is a sad commentary on how inept comedy film writers have become; to create an unfunny waste of a film like this.
B000060MY6|1.0|With the exception of Cameron Crowes pretentious and truly abominable \\"Vanilla Sky\\", I have never felt quite as much like I wasted too much time trying to figure out an incomprehensible movie plot.  That is until I watched THIS even MORE over-convoluted David Lynch film.      I think David Lynch has done some fascinating work in his interesting filmography.  I thought \\"Blue Velvet\\" was riveting, and \\"Wild At Heart\\" certainly a fun surreal noir adventure too.  Those films had a PLOT.  They didn't meander back and forth between reality, fantasy, fancy camera angles and nuances too subtle to fathom.  From the weird beginning to the anti-climactic unfinished close  that I waited for desperately to arrive, and yet took WAY to long to reach, I wasn't sure what I was watching.     Who are these weirdos?  Why do they exist, and how do they connect to eachother?  How does a young girl stay at a relatives house, find a strange amnesiac woman naked in her shower when she arrives, and not be alarmed?  Does she call the police? NO.  She comforts her with a sweetness normal folks reserve for relatives and long time friends.  She tucks her into bed, then in the morning, forms a close  and lasting relationship with her, houses her, all the while knowing nothing about her.  That happens all the time, doesn't it?  Loophole?  Rita the \\"amnesiac\\" also knows nothing about herself, so why should we?  She MUST be a safe and trustworthy person to keep close then. That's the least of the confusion.        Then there's Billy Ray Cyrus playing some movie casting buffoon who looks like the son of Roy Orbison and Elvis.  I know they are both men, but in this kind of film it seems plausible!  He's trying to figure out why his money is gone, while his estranged wife or lover, whatever, has men at the house and he shows up for some confrontation.  He seems like some space creature with his thick rims and silent demeanor.  For a quiet dude, he sure is popular.  Even  more folks show up looking forhim.  There's no rhyme or reason for any of it.  Someone actually thought a series of senseless scenes that never connect to the big blank picture, like a huge fat guy smashing the wife and lover in the face, and never appearing again, would be artsy and entertaining.  Did they really think that viewers would swallow this?  Just when you think you know what MAY be happening, the landlady becomes Billy Ray Cyrus' mom at a party that materializes out of nowhere.  What IS that?  Other characters suddenly take on different meanings too.  Meanwhile Lynch takes advantage of the so-called world of \\"Lesbian Chic\\" by making the two female lead characters into lovers, one obsessed, and the other, that Rita...who even KNOWS what her story is.  Does she have amnesia?  Is she a famous star?  Does she tend Billy Ray Cyrus' Elvis hair-don't personally?  Does she like girls, boys or both?  Only David Lynch, his writers, and the heavy hallucinogens they popped while writing this mess, know for sure.  Even THEY probably can't remember.  I'd want to forget I made this film if I were them too.      So go ahead, waste nearly three hours on this senseless pointless celluloid yawn if you like. Just keep some headache medicine nearby, and a free hand to hit \\"eject\\" whenever you've had enough.  I recommend at the last trailer preview before this movie starts.

B000002UVX|5.0|Do they not know good music? Uncertain applause for the Band of Gypsys and for Miles Davis who killed this place three months later. Maybe these two just boggled minds live. It only makes sense.

B000003TA4|5.0|Love it..hate it..It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew..it was called the underground scenes)<BR>I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away..Mainstream rock wasnt supposed to be THAT good.. not at that time anyways.<br /> It changed the mainstream..for the better? I dunno, .....basically \\"hmmm, i wonder what they'll like next\\" Remember the spin doctors? Bush? Yea. <br />  As far as the underground goes..I've never read any underground legends say anything bad about Nirvana..Biafra, Rollins, Joey Ramone, Iggy..heck Iggy used to go to nirvana shows and go insane. If anything Ive heard all of them say how much they were flattered about being inspirations to Nirvanas music. Yea, even Jello.<br />Bottom line is this: They put out 3 lps, 1 b-side LP, A acoustic album that blew everyone away a 2nd time..and basically had EVERYONE talking. Acts like Korn, System of a down, Tool, Manson, Blink, where are they gonna be in 10 years..more importantly how are they gonna be REMEMBERED? I have no idea, but i know how Nirvana is going to be remembered for the next BILLION. This album is the reason why. Nevermind.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavinge's &quot;Let Go&quot; CD is an excellent choice for people who simply like their music to be fun. Avril's punk style is enjoyable to listen and sing along to. Her voice isn't exactly unique, and her style isn't exactly orginal, but she puts a flair into music thats catchy to the ear. Now, Avril Lavinge is really popular where I am and I hate to follow the crowd, but the more I listen to her songs the more I like them. Her music is the kind in which you and your friends would sing at the top of you lungs with the volume jacked up high in the car. It's just fun, laid-back music. I highly enjoy it, and I think you would too.
B00000IN5G|5.0|After listening to all three of Children of Bodom's albums, I found Hatebreeder to be their best.  Children continues to use the amazing guitar work with the perfect supporting keyboards, but they manage to improve upon it.  The band not only makes the keyboards flow better, but also makes the keyboards act as a device to directly boost the listener's interest in the song.  The best way to see what I mean by this is by listening to two prime examples, \\"Hatebreeder\\" and \\"Black Widow.\\"  Additionally, the album is a good length, and each song gives the listener something to look forward to.  Once again, however, the band neglected to give the U.S. version a song from the Japanese version.  This time it is \\"No Commands.\\"  The song is quite good, but the CD does just fine without it.
B00000DRA9|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about ten, when it first was released.  Now, at twenty-seven, it's still my favorite movie and I find the music just as wonderful as I did then.  I always remembered the music and how intense it was.  When I was about seventeen, before I even had a C.D. player, I bought the soundtracks to The NeverEnding Story and Labyrinth.  I loved the music from both of them so much that I HAD to have the soundtracks, even though I had nothing to listen to them on.<br />While you're listening to this soundtrack, you can see and feel every moment of the movie taking place without even watching it.  Some of it is sad, and some, uplifting.  All of the while, it's magical and exciting.  I could listen to it over and over and always find that it pulled me into the spirit of the movie.  Of course, I always had an obsession for this movie, so it may not be that way for everyone, but I really do think that scenes from the movie would come alive for anyone who listens to the music.<br />I can listen to &quot;Swamps of Sadness&quot; and see Atreyu struggling and crawling through the swamp and reaching out for the luckdragon who comes down out of the red clouds while the Gmork is close behind, closing in on Atreyu.  I listen to &quot;Atreju's Quest&quot; and see him riding along the horizon and I get the same intense, excited, nervous feeling I got when I first watched it.<br />The same can be said for hearing &quot;Fantasia&quot;, although it's altogether a different tone--it's very somber and serious, but it fills me with similar emotions and I feel the same uncertainty and apprehension about what is ahead while I listen to &quot;Fantasia&quot; as I feel from &quot;Atreju's Quest&quot;, even though I already know what's to come.  I can clearly see it before me, the moment when Cairon solemnly presents Atreyu with the menacing quest ahead of him.  It's all so vivid and alive for me.<br />I think anyone who knows and loves the movie would feel the same.  Even if you don't know the movie particularly well, the music is original and exciting and touching.  I'd recommend it to anyone.

6300183971|4.0|This video would have gotten 5 out of 5 starts if it had been in better condition when I received it. This is the ORIGINAL, David Lynch version of the story, which seems to have a LOT more \\"warmth\\" or \\"soul\\" than the colder, somewhat blander Sci-Fi channel treatment. The casting is excellent, bang-on, in fact, and I would have LIKED it if more key scenes from the book had been put in it, but all in all, the story of Paul and Jessica Atreides gets told quite well by this dream-like production. Even though this movie supposedly bombed at the box office, fact is is that just about every cast member went on to bigger and better things: Voila...<br /><br />Patrick Stewart - Your friendly neighborhood Capt. Picard<br />Kyle MacLachlan - Agent Cooper from Twin Peaks, and a good movie career to boot, which included \\"Blue Velvet\\", another Lynch vehicle, which had almost exactly the same cast as \\"Dune\\". (It also did much better at the box office!)<br />Brad Dourif - A lucrative run as the voice of Chucky in the \\"Child's Play\\" movies and various TV sci-fi roles. However, he generally plays psycho killers these days. Oddly enough, one of his first jobs was the lead role in an odd John Huston movie before this called \\"Wise Blood\\" and a scruffy chaffeur/gofer in \\"The Eyes Of Laura Mars\\". All three films, \\"Wise Blood\\", \\"Eyes\\" and \\"Dune\\" were more auspicious than the stuff he's KNOWN for. Go figure.<br />Everett McGill - Nice run of movies where he played people very different from the noble Stilgar. For instance, the corrupt Killefer in \\"License to Kill\\" and a belligerent, overbearing CO in \\"Heartbreak Ridge\\".<br />Francesca Annis - Much work for the BBC<br />Alicia Witt - \\"Cybil\\", various movies.<br />Dean Stockwell - A career completely revived by his work with David Lynch, starting with this movie.<br />Jurgen Prochnow - Unfortunately, this man has taken two very auspicious movies, \\"Das Boot\\" and this one, and parlayed it into a career not much better than Dourif's confinement to the horror ghetto. He has been in COUNTLESS 2 1/2 star or worse movies , generally playing villains or weirdos.<br />Freddy Jones: Worked with Federico Fellini in \\"..And The Ship Sails On\\". He was also in an underrated little fantasy movie called \\"Krull\\" with Francesca Annis. This is one which you should look up, BTW. It's a little tacky around the edges, but very charming.<br /><br />For all you Vittoria De Sica [fans] out there, Silvana Mangano, Dino De Laurentis' wife and a former actress, makes a cameo appearance here as the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother of the Fremen. She's just about unrecognizable under the make-up.<br /><br />So, maybe it didn't set the B.O. on fire, but it still stands as one of the better movies of the 80s and one of the few decent translations of an epic sci-fi novel to the big screen. I practically played the oxides off of my first copy in the eighties and early nineties and became very fond of the characters, particularly Stilgar, Muau' Dib and Jessica.

B0000399WI|5.0|Unlike Frank Darabont's more recent efforts, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is near perfect. Not only the pinnacle of the prison film genre, it's one of the best films of all time. Everything works here: the screenplay is stunning; the performances flawless; it looks great, sounds great; and at 142 minutes it's perfectly paced. A film spanning two decades of developing friendship needs to be long, but Darabont unwinds his tale with such consummate skill that your interest never wanes. In fact, it keeps growing. He makes us feel for Andy, Red and their fellow cons, so their quest for dignity and survival becomes our own. The vignettes mix comedy and violence, striking just the right balance between hope and despair. It's never allowed to stray into self-indulgent mawkishness. For raw emotional power, the climax and denouement are almost unrivalled; and the themes of hope and self-determination will stay with you forever. If you can get your hands on a copy of Darabont's screenplay, read it. I picked it up the other day in search of a character's name. When I looked up, two hours had passed and I was on the final page with tears in my eyes. It's that good.
B00005YTFG|5.0|When Moulin Rouge first came out, I took no interest in it. After seeing parts of it at a friends house however, I was immediately intriuged and bought it for myself. I LOVED it! Nicole Kidman was amazing and she and Mcgreggor were flawless together. I was shocked to find that every minute of this movie was Kidman and Mcgreggor's own voices. Be prepared to cry at the end but overall it was a fun, uplifting movie about a girl who couldn't fall in love and a young man who wanted to but didn't...until now. The extra money for the Dvd is definetly worth it, I loved the extras. If you haven't seen this movie, you are definetley missing out!
B00000K2SC|2.0|The Matrix - great special effects - one hell of a lousy movie. The movie just tended to be rather dull without all the action. Their attempts at making what the Matrix really is about is rather dull and heavy handed. Other than that the film was high on action but not enough on class<br />Incidentally I thought Fight Club was a better movie - had more humour in it
B00003CXA6|4.0|This is an outstanding contribution to Civil War Heritage and until \\"Gods and Generals\\" premiers at least, the most sweeping and historically accurate film.

I greatly look forward to the prequel.

B00002ND77|5.0|There appears to be a debate by reviewers here that Spike Lee altered some of Malcolm's history to make a more entertaining movie.  Others feel that the civil rights leader was the embodiment of evil, undeserving of this filmed tribute.<br />No film is perfect and no docudrama is historically accurate (see \\"Braveheart\\" or \\"Titanic\\", for example).  But, \\"Malcolm X\\" is totally engrossing from start to finish, with great acting from not only stars Washington and Bassett but from Albert Hall (\\"Baines\\"), Delro Lindo (\\"Archie\\") and a remarkably realistic portrayal by Al Freeman, Jr. as the Honorable Elijah Mohammed.<br />Veteran actors Lonette McKee, Peter Boyle, Christopher Plummer, and Ossie Davis round out the superb cast and add a touch of clout to the proceedings.<br />Whether or not all of the story is true, the outstanding performances make up for any inaccuracies.<br />And, yes, I, too, read the book.

B00006IU73|5.0|What can I say about the best album of 2002?  Simple-it's the best album of 2002!  Porcupine Tree has continued to amaze me with each of their releases.  In fact, they are hands down my current favorite band.<br />\\"In Absentia\\" is clearly Porcupine Tree's heaviest album to date.  Steven Wilson, after producing extreme metal band Opeth, has obviously brought his love of metal into the PT sound more than ever.  From the opening crunching guitars in \\"Blackest Eyes,\\" to the hard-edged instrumental, \\"Wedding Nails,\\" this album will please the fans of harder rock while not threatening or discouraging those who like calmer music.  The lighter side of PT is still there however, and the spaced out vibe and psychedelic influences have not left the band all together.  These more laid back moments, mixed with the heaviness, make for a truly interesting, unique and powerful record.  <br />What else would you expect from Porcupine Tree?  Here's a band that has continued to evolve and change-never recording the same album twice.  They push the limits and pre-conceived notions of todays rock while creating experimental, yet quite accessible music.  This one-time solo project turned into a full-fledged band three records ago and now, this once underground, progressive, rock band has potential for major commercial success as \\"In Absentia\\" is Porcupine Tree's major label debut.  Once Lava officially releases that all-important first single--watch out!  This band's going to explode!<br />Porcupine Tree is, hands down, one of the most exciting things to happen to rock in years.  There aren't enough great things I can say about all aspects of this group.  From their early and odd beginning material, to the more accessible albums like \\"Stupid Dream\\" and this new record, Porcupine Tree is going to be a huge force to reckon with in 2003.  They are simply the best rock band currently making music.  This may be a bold statement, but once you discover the Tree for yourself, you'll understand!

B000050XEI|5.0|But I think this is my favorite Enya cd currently - from the haunting opening track \\"A Day Without Rain\\" to the closing sunshine drenched \\"Lazy Days\\", this seems to be all of one piece, carefully considered and put together for the mazimum effect.<br />If you're not familiar with Enya, I recommend you start with this cd or her greatest hits cd. If you weren't too hot on her previous cd (some folks weren't), you'll find this one invigorating. Buy this and enjoy.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I would have to say that this is my favourite movie of all time. The acting is near perfect, cinematography and directing are beautiful and inspiring, and the music (which really makes this movie) is brilliant! <br />So the story is about two people who meet by accident and get along quite well, so they decide to do something on the spur of the moment. They have a great time with each other, but both are already engaged in a relationship; so they go their seperate ways. A few years later, both are about to be married to different people but can't forget each other. So they both go searching for each other, and it is by chance that they meet once again.<br />This movie is not one to be taken so seriously. Ok, so coinsidences like these don't really happen in real life, but hey; IT'S A MOVIE!  <br />In my definition, to categorize a movie as as &quot;romantic comedy&quot; is to define it as a feel-good, light-hearted, mood-lifting romantic story. Just because it isn't exactly the funniest movie doesn't mean it's a bad romantic comedy. <br />I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend one and a half hours on an amazing, magical dream-like ride of life, love, and fate.

B00003CX5P|3.0|I was dissapointed with this movie entirely because of how George Lucas took a well developed series of movies with good stories and everything and turned these new ones into just plain old money makers it just makes me mad that he didnt take the time he took on the last movies  with these ones....so many of the books that he himself has approved were so good with such great stories.  If he cant write a good story or movie what ever then he should have gotten one of them to write it ..this way the movie would have been better with someone who understood star wars .... I just dont get how someone who started something so great would go and mess it up .... dont get me wrong the last saber battle was great but miniclorines or however you spell it come on the whole point of the force is that it is mystical and that no one really knows why some can use and why others cant...I love stars wars the second one was much better than the first one that is for sure the second one is good but the first one.... well I wouldnt watch that one again I would buy the dvd because of it being star wars and the special features are wonderful very enjoyable ..... I love star wars and I hope the next one just gets even better.
B00005JL2O|3.0|The best parts of this Austin Powers installment are the beginning and the end.  The middle is a little too over-the-top or just down right stupid.<br />Goldmember is a character that sounded good on paper.  But seeing him come to life was a disappointment, and at times a real stomach turner.  Myers' Austin Powers is a fun character and I hope he will give us more Austin...but I hope he realizes that his audience is more than 14 year old boys. (The level of gags and jokes in this rarely emerges from the bathroom.  Once or twice in 90 minutes is OK...but relying this much on such low brow humor is just a complete waste of time if you are a viewer.)<br />That being said, the opening tag is one of the most brilliant gags ever seen.  The strength of this gag (If you don't have tears rolling from your eyes with laughter, you are dead.  It is sheer genius in casting and execution.) mistakenly set up my hopes for an equally strong movie.  The ending as well incorporates a current staple of pop culture send up that makes sitting through the credits a worth-while experience.<br />I was encouraged by the ending set up, which almost insures a 4th Austin. Let's hope the next Austin Powers doesn't take all it's cues from Goldmember.
B00005UEAR|3.0|This is a good album.  The only problem with this album is that it comes on the heels of Scenes From A Memory (SFAM), which is in every sense of the phrase a \\"five star album\\".  Yes, these guys are incredibly talented and have become the benchmark for all other progressive rock bands.<br />That being said, a 3-star rating indicates that this album is definitely worth buying, if not only for \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"The Glass Prison\\".  I have listened to alot of pseudo cutting-edge prog rock wannabees and really, no one else compares with Dream Theater, maybe Shadow Gallery or Symphony X's V album, - other than that I go all the way back to Rush's Permanent Waves before I find anything that tops SFAM.<br />Somehow Rush followed that up with Moving Pictures (probably one of the greatest albums of all time, really); Dream Theater followed up SFAM with 6DOIT, which is a really good album worth buying.  <br />BTW, I will send you a copy of either Permanent Waves or Moving Pictures if you don't own it.  Twenty+ years later these two albums still sound incredibly en vogue.
B00005JL96|1.0|I assumed it would be a cute movie for my 3 year old to watch.  I found the space aliens looked very much like the monsters of Monsters Inc. ,so no originality there.  I also found it to be too violent and too many bad examples for young children.
0671027344|5.0|I would recomend this book to anyone, and I think I have. I read it straight through the first time and was left speechless. I can't count how many times I have read it since. This book is simply amazing.It is a journey that everyone should take. Anyone can relate to Charlie in some way, and any true wallflower can understand his woes. His journey through his freshman year is what we are all faced with at some point in our lives. Love, death, friendship and change are human truths that we all have to deal with.  The sincerity and feeling in Charlie's letters is refreshing. This book is true to life, it is very real and very honest. It has gotten me through hard times and truly changed the way I viewed the world. This book is full of epiphanies. You should read it, think about it, and then read it again. I have loaned this book to most of the people I know and would recomend it to anyone, whether you are beyond high school or not. There is a little Charlie in all of us, and this book will touch you.

0312305060|1.0|No fancy verbiage here, only helpful info for other average, avid readers, that don't have bachelors, masters or PhDs in English or Literature, who read to relax and enjoy.  Probably the majority of us.<br />This book was extremely confusing and totally lacked continuity until the last dozen or so pages.  Have you ever dropped your book and lost the page you were on, then picked it up and started reading in the wrong place? That's what it was like reading this book!<br />So much space was wasted by the author displaying his vocabulary, and supersaturating the reader with descriptions that added little to the story.<br />I am surprised by the high ratings by other reviewers.
0312305060|5.0|I found this novel to be haunting and beautifully written. Mr. Cunningham clearly loves his characters. Some of the passages were so moving, so searingly true they took my breath away. One of the best books I've ever read, one that will stay with me for many hours to come...
0451207521|5.0|What can I say?  I bought this book in the airport in Houston and finished it in the same day - no small task with a 500-page novel.  I have been a staunch Follett fan ever since &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; and &quot;The Eye of the Needle,&quot; and he does not disappoint with this new novel - quite the contrary, in fact.  Felicity &quot;Flick&quot; Clairet is the most intelligent, pragmatic, hard-headed, and yet vulnerable heroine in years, and she makes &quot;Jackdaws&quot; into a wonderfully engrossing page-turner.  It is truly a &quot;female Dirty Dozen&quot; (or perhaps &quot;Half-Dozen&quot;) Bravo!
6305363668|5.0|When you compare the original theatrical release of Bladerunner to the Directors Cut, it's proof positive that those on the business end of the motion picture industry should keep their grubby paws off of the creative end.  I was a big fan of the original (narrated) version, but the Directors Cut, when I finally saw it, just blew me away.  BR-TDC is so much better than the original.  Like another reviewer, I was also disappointed that there were no 'extras' on the DVD version.  I believe I read, once, that Harrison Ford was not the original choice for the role of Deckard.  I think I read it was Dustin Hoffman.   Now I think that Hoffman is a fantastic actor (even better than Harrison Ford in some ways) but I just cannot see him as Deckard (Sorry Dustin).  Ford was, IMHO an excellent choice for the role.  Bladerunner-The Directors Cut tops my list of favorite films of all time.
B0000028M7|3.0|Well, it's better than Godsmack, Staind, creed etc. But still nothing to write home about. They sound like a really depressing and droning version of Metallica to me (yeah i know everyone is anti-metallica now, but i meant it in a good way).
B00005QDW5|5.0|As an avid classic rock fan, I'd had a minor interest in Pink Floyd by the time this collection was released.  My friends all said things such as \\"WHAT!? I can't believe you don't listen to Pink Floyd, you'll love them.\\"  Two months into my freshman year of college, a friend played me the Dark Side of the Moon album.  I wasn't that nuts about it, but I liked it enough to borrow it.  The more I listened to it, the more I liked it.  Not long before this, I saw the ad for this album on the TV and was thrilled to see that Pink Floyd had a best-of.  I asked my parents to buy it for me for Christmas, which they did.  That Christmas Day 2001 would change my life.<br />When I first listened to it, it wasn't the greatest thing I had ever heard, but enjoyed it enough to continue listening to it.  It wasn't long before it became one of, if not the most frequent visitor to my CD player.  Soon, I could take no more and started buying the albums.  It is now the beginning of 2003, and I am a Floyd-head for life.<br />One thing my friends said was \\"don't get the best of, get the albums to understand them, the albums have a flow, this won't, etc, etc, etc...\\"  I ignored them because I wanted to sample Pink Floyd in the best way I could, and that was with this collection.  And what I thought would happen did; I fell in love with this and with Pink Floyd, and started buying their albums.<br />Speaking from experience, this IS an excellent introduction to Pink Floyd, and made me fall in love with the band.  Pink Floyd's career pretty much in its entirety is represented here.  Though the soundtrack albums (which I haven't heard yet) and Atom Heart Mother are ignored completely, this will still give you a good idea of what the PF catalogue is like.  Contrary to what hardcore fans said before hearing this, the tracks DO in fact have a flow to them.  The songs were wisely selected and sequenced, and as always, Pink Floyd uses excellent studio trickery to make the songs flow from one to thenext, which they do flawlessly.  Another thing that some people complain about is that some of the songs were edited.  For the most part, some must be to fit all these songs onto 2 CDs.  The longer ones like \\"Echoes\\" and \\"Shine On\\" were edited from 23 or so minutes down to 16 or 17 minutes.  The shorter songs for the most part have been left alone, with a minor cut out here or there.  The only complaint I have now is that the incredibly beautiful \\"Marooned\\" from the Division Bell album is not only edited, but only the beginning is used.  That didn't bother me then, because I didn't know.  Other than these things that new fans won't notice, this is an enjoyable collection and a great introduction to one of the greatest bands of all time.<br />Syd Barrett here is represented quite well, with \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and \\"Bike\\" from Piper At the Gates of Dawn, \\"Jugband Blues\\" from Saucerful of Secrets, and two non-album singles (which I believe can be found on the Relics comp) \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play.\\"  Most of the essentials, such as \\"Money,\\" \\"Time,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"Another Brick In the Wall Pt. 2\\" are here.  Fans may be complaining about the omissions of some songs, but you can't put everything on a best-of.  Believe me, after some time with this, you will want to buy the albums that have the songs you like, and then more, more, and more.  You will become hooked for life.<br />Also awesome is the cover art by Storm Thorgeson, who is also responsible for many other Pink Floyd covers (and the cover of Audioslave's debut, BTW).  You will also become a fan of Storm Thorgeson, as I have.  That aside, the music here is truly stunning and serves as a great doorway to the wonderful world that is Pink Floyd.  As I bought more albums, this has become the least listened to CD in my Pink Floyd collection, because the albums are simply better than the comps, as it is in any case.  However, I still dig it up occasionally and listen to it.<br />One warning:  You may not like this CD that much upon first listening.  But trust me, the more you listen, the more you will like it.  Soon you will depend on this music like a drug.  I know, because I'm speaking from experience.  Check out this album, then buy the albums as you like.  In the long run, you will be glad you did.  I know I am.<br />5/5
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have now sat through \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings\\" several times, including a few viewings of the film's extended edition, which was released on DVD earlier this Winter. When I originally saw the film theatrically, I liked it, but didn't love it and found it rather flawed - the first hour seemed too slow and I never really found myself fully involved in the characters. However, I warmed up to the film after its first DVD release and consider the extended version to be a very considerable improvement over the theatrical cut.<br />I'm pleased to say that I found \\"The Two Towers\\", the follow-up to the first picture, to be mostly a phenomenal piece of cinema (once again, I have not read the books - I'm going simply on what I thought of the film). The film may be the middle part of the trilogy, but that actually works for the opening of the picture - we know these characters and after the sudden close of the first film, most will likely be eager to see the adventure continue on-screen. The opening sixty minutes of the picture opens at a full-throttle pace as Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) continue to try and rescue hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) from their Orc captors. Elsewhere, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to destroy the ring, guided by Gollum (Andy Serkis), a CGI-creature who is obsessed with the ring, but decides to serve as the guide for the two hobbits. There is also the return of Gandalf (Ian McKellen).<br />The film does split the story into a few pieces, although it's a credit to director Peter Jackson and the film's editors that the film cuts between the stories perfectly, with not too much time spent on one or another. This film focuses on Aragorn's character considerably more than anyone else, but that's not a bad thing: Viggo Mortensen is a terrific actor and the progression of this character is the most engaging part of this picture. Still, Frodo's quest is compelling material and even Merry and Pippin's ending up on the shoulders of a giant tree creature, Tree Beard (voiced by John Rhys-Davies) is enjoyable - a good mix of comedy and drama. While Gollum's tragic battle with his own soul is often very well-played, there is one darkly funny sequence with the creature battling himself that is quite amusing. The human actors also all provide uniformly stellar performances, with even some of the performances that have less screen-time (Liv Tyler's Arwen) remaining memorable.<br />All of this eventually builds towards the battle of Helm's Deep, a giant stone fortress that Aragorn, Pippin, Gimli, king Theoden (Bernard Hill) and an army of a few hundred men have retreated to. Sauruman (Christopher Lee)'s armies are sweeping across the lands, however, and its only a matter of time before they reach the gates. When they do - the film's last 20-25 minutes - it's something truly breathtaking. Facing impossible odds, the band of a few hundred looks out to face nearly 10,000.<br />The film does have a bit of a slow point around the middle, but both the opening and closing of the film proceed with more forward momentum than the first picture did in general. \\"The Two Towers\\" story, split into several sections, also feels larger than the first film - there's more going on, there feels like even more at stake and the urgency and emotion that Jackson is able to give many events in the film is remarkable.<br />Technically, the film is also remarkable. Peter Jackson and team, whose careful use of CGI mixed with astonishingly beautiful real locations only enhances the film, shows how computer effects should be used, unlike the latest \\"Star Wars\\" pictures, where the effects overwhelm everything else. Gollum, for example, is a far better character - in animation, voicing, writing, emotion and movement - than Lucas's horrid Jar-Jar Binks. Andrew Lesnie's cinematography once again makes the New Zeland locations look breathtakingly beautiful and epic. Howard Shore's score adds drama, tension and excitement without calling too much attention to itself. Production design is, once again, first-rate.<br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is not a flawless picture, but it is grand, epic filmmaking unlike anything I've seen in recent years. The continuing story of these great characters continues to be compelling, the realization of this world by Peter Jackson and crew is visually stunning and many scenes here are powerful and incredibly memorable - especially the Helm's Deep sequence, which is more amazing than anything I've seen on the big screen in recent memory.<br />One of the year's finest films.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul, released in late 1965, saw the Beatles evolving still further into their unique sound, and experimenting with exotic instruments like the sitar.  One look at the cover and you can guess that these guys were into other experimentation as well, and this is also evident in the music.  This record has often taken heat for its misogynistic treatment of women in the songs, but there is a range of attitudes, and not that it's justified, but if you had been chased around by screaming females for three years, wouldn't you be a little over it?  Still, even without the double-whammy single of &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;We Can Work it Out,&quot; the Fabs hit this one out of the park.<br />Key tracks include &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird has Flown)&quot; with one of John Lennon's most beautiful melodies and interesting lyrical couplets.  &quot;I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.&quot;  Does the narrator really burn down the girl's apartment or did he just start a fire in the fireplace?<br />&quot;Nowhere Man&quot; features outstanding three-part harmonies, and the lyrics can be aimed toward an individual or a country.  This song shows that the Beatles were taking their songs beyond the poppy love songs, and despite sweet melodies, there is substance as well.<br />&quot;Michelle&quot; is one of Paul's best, a simple acoustic love song, with the oft-misunderstood lyric &quot;sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble&quot; translated as &quot;these are words that go together well&quot; and not &quot;someday monkeys won't play piano songs.&quot;<br />&quot;In My Life&quot; is another reflective John Lennon song.  &quot;Some are dead and some are living...&quot;  Used as the theme to the TV show &quot;Providence.&quot;<br />George Harrison scores with &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone.&quot;  The former features the cool &quot;fuzz bass&quot; by part and nice harmonies.  The lyrics are kind of mean-spirited, but a nudge for the person to get out and do their own thing.  The latter has a distinctive Harrison guitar part, his best melody yet, and lyrics about what might have been.  Love?  Friendship?<br />Paul's &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; are more songs about relationship challenges.<br />Ringo gets a lead vocal on the country-tinged &quot;What Goes On.&quot;  I've never been sure if &quot;Girl&quot; had a not-so-subliminal meaning, with that inhaling sound, but it's also a nice song.<br />Perhaps the most alarming lyric is on &quot;Run for Your Life,&quot; the disk's closer, with &quot;Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to see you with another man.&quot;  This is probably the most mean-spirited tune on the record, despite the nice melody and haromonies.e for the person to get out and do their own thing.

B00004W510|5.0|If you like classic rock and, like me, are sick of listening to songs about elves and LSD then this CD is for you.  I'm sure when this was released in the late 60's it was a breath of fresh air, blowing back all the psychedelic smoke.  I can't recommend \\"The Band\\" enough.  This is rock n' roll at it's finest--pure and simple with a little bit of soul and country twang.  In addition, the alternate takes shine.  Three in particular, \\"Whispering Pines\\", \\"Jemima Surrender\\" and \\"King Harvest\\" are better and funkier than the official releases and in the case of \\"Jemima\\", raunchier.  Go on!

B00006LPK5|1.0|If you think that this a big battle movie featuring lots of dragons, big explosions, and war in devestated London, think again.  <br />Reign of Fire is nothing more than a textbook example of wasted potental.  Instead of gigantic battles, we get a few confrentations of people running away in terror and hiding in castles.<br />the problems start almost imediatly.  A young boy, who smokes and drinks, judging by his dialog walks into a mining operation and desceneds into a tunnel under construction (How come nobody bothered to make sure he was wearing a helmet?) there, he awakens a evil dragon (Opps), has his mom killed (Shoot) and triggers what is basically the end of the world (Aw nuts!)  During a very brief sequence, we hear a man writting a letter to his son explaning that the dragons killed off the dinosaurs and have waited for the world to rebuild itself so they can eat.  They breed very fast and after about 50 years, the remnants of humanity live in poorly constructed castles, leaving crops to grow in the open and trying to survive.<br />At this point, the film still has potentional, but that is quickly tarnished as you realize that the movie is nothing more than a bunch of people winning about dragons and trying to survive a dull script.<br />The Actors in the film try hard with what they have to work with, and come off with only marginal results.  The best actor is probably the American, (I forgot his name)  Who loves carrying a big Axe around, and act gung ho.  Quinn is ok, but dosent do anything special.  Everybody else is basically spare meat, with no real exceptions (Except for the girl)<br />The highlight of the film is of course, the dragons, so how do they come off?  Pretty well actually, although we never really see enough of them (Usually ony 1 at a time)  The effects are quite good on some of the sequences (Especially during the final confrentation), and at other times quite bad.<br />The main problem with the movie is that is stays in the same placefor 80% of of the film, so we dont see much of the ruined world.  London, which provides the finalie, dosent look anything like what we would all like, with mostly burned out buildings and empty ruins.  <br />Also, how come there is never any big final battle between Humanity and the dragons at night in a blazing london like on the box?!?!?  Instead, we get 3 people taking on a singe big dragon in broad daylight( Another thing, the American says that the dragons cant see well at dusk, so how come the humans attack during the day?)<br />Overall, Reign of fire is a big dissapointment, and should be renamed Reign of Boredom<br />The good:<BR>The final confrentation is moderatly exciting<BR>The Americans final scene in London is hysterical <BR>good dragon effects<br />The bad:<BR>Mediocre actiong<BR>Film takes place in one place 80% of the movie<BR>very little in the way of action<br />The ugly:<BR>NO BIG BATTLE LIKE ON THE BOX!!!!<BR>misleading box art<br />Summary:<BR>you should probably just stick with reading about dragons
B00005JLRR|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed STAR TREK: NEMESIS. If this is indeed the final film featuring the Next Generation cast, it is a fitting swan song. The film brings together the cast in a way that the other movies did not. It is also probably the 2nd best Next Generation film (FIRST CONTACT being the best).<br />The film opens with the wedding of Riker and Troi. Wesley Crusher is seen (wearing a Star Fleet uniform nonetheless!), but only at the wedding table. Riker gets command of his own ship, but he doesn't get to helm it in this movie and his honeymoon is delayed because of the discovery of the quartered B-4 (the prototype for Data) and a new leader on Romulus. The film has some fairly interesting fight scenes and most of the main cast members get some decent screen time. However, the movie parallels (among other films) THE WRATH OF KHAN a great deal and that unfortunately makes the essential elements of the plot predictable. I don't want to give anything away, but will say this: Lear just won't be the same without his Fool.<br />A fairly decent sci-fi movie and one of the better Star Trek films. I doubt this will be the last Trek film, but if it is, the song ends with a sweet melody.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|Here's the story: A woman who sees the future, predicts that Cruise will commit murder, so he escapes capture from the cops and attempts to find this man he is suppose to murder. Is this man an innocent victim or is he part of a conspriacy to frame Cruise ? On his way to find the truth, he meets new allies and old foes. He is also trying to find the where-abouts of his 10 year-old son who was kidnapped ten years prior.<BR>This movie has a lot of suspense. The story held my attention from beginning to end. There is also a few scenes with great special effects. In my opinion, this is Tom Cruise's best film. Its much better than Impossible Mission 2.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I saw TTT on opening day, knowing ahead of time that there were changes from the book, and I loved it. <br />I admit I was annoyed by some changes. But others I didn't mind (and actually kind of liked).<br />In spite of the changes, I thought this movie was great. Legolas is amazing (love the shield surfing and the unbelievable horse mounting--there were audible gasps of amazement from the audience) and well-acted by Orlando Bloom. The Elf is bad and oh so nice to look at. (And, no, I'm not a teenage girl. I'm in my 30s. *S*) Sean Astin is perfect as Sam. I don't think anyone could do it better than him. Another reviewer said it and I agree that Sam is one of the true heroes of the trilogy. Gollum looks great. He's quite life-like and worthy of some sort of Oscar. I loved the comic relief of Gimli--necessary and well-acted. Grima Wormtongue is wonderfully sinister and creepy. Every performance was well done--Gandalf, Theoden, Eowyn, Arwen, Saruman, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Eomer, Aragorn, and the Ents.<br />The battle scenes are great, the scenery is beautiful, the CGI is top-notch (not overdone), the story is interesting, the acting believable. It's not boring at all (I was practically on the edge of my seat, figuratively speaking, the whole time) or unoriginal (it all came from the imagination of Tolkien long before any of the movies a reviewer mentioned were ever made) as some have claimed.<br />Though I've read (and loved) the books and didn't like some of the changes in the movie, The Two Towers is one of the best movies that's ever been made. I loved it, can't wait to see it again and can't wait to own it on DVD. :)
0881032646|5.0|this was a interesting book to read. i found that not haveing a main charactor was a good thing i kept me interested and i never got bored. i also liked the ending it was a surpise i am not going to tell what happened at the end because it would ruin the book. but it was good. when i first read this book i thought that it would just be another sci-fi book. But it is more then that. it is fast pace and i like how the book happens over many years.
0312305060|3.0|Well, needless to say I was not too impressed with this novel. I understand it won the Pulitzer, and has been raved about from here to Timbucktu. However I just didn't find &quot;THE HOURS&quot; that entertaining. As a novel it was slow and laboring reading. However like all reviews I try to find the silver lining and here is this novels saving grace(TO ME). M.C. the author was able to show the inner feelings of depression, the internal silent screams so to speak,that we each feel each day. He instilles in he characters those thoughts of shear bleakness of which we call life. Yet many of these characters like the rest of us face our demons day in and day out, till we are withered with age. It is at this point that we reflect on our years and wonder was it all worth it? Thats what the Hours relized for me.<BR>Now, &quot;The Hours&quot; is not a clear cut novel, it doesn't answer all of it's questions cut and dry, it is actually left up to the reader's interpretation on how they should deal with them. Kind of like life, where we don't know why other people behave the way they do, as well as ourselves for that matter. Enough of that topic.<BR>Don't let my thoughts on this novel ruin your wanting to pick it up to read, I think that this novel has alot to say, but I guess I wasn't the right audience for it's words
0385495323|5.0|The Code Book, by Simon Singh, is a tantalizing peek at the history of cryptography.  He begins with the brilliance of the Egyptians, moves through the breakthrough discoveries of Arab scholars, to the European aristocratic intrigues of the middle ages, wartime use in WWI and II, to today; where security and encryption is part of our everyday lives and daily transactions.  The author is skilled at presenting both \\"sides\\" of the drama - the needs and desires of the code-makers coupled with the motivations and thought processes of the code- breakers!  He has taken an amazingly complex topic and presented it in a way that is mostly accessible to the average interested reader.  I was mainly captivated by the historical documentation and the wartime code use. I found the quantum leap less understandable, although Singh does an excellent job at bringing up questions about civil liberties and the responsibilities and consequences of living in a \\"secure\\" world.   It is important to include that Singh explains \\"Public Key Encryption\\" - arguably, the very most important development in security in recent times, along with the personal stories of the men who were credited with public key discovery, and those unsung heroes who were not. <br />A fascinating off shoot of The Code Book is the Cipher Challenge consisting of 10 cyphers of increasing difficulty that the author provides in the appendix.  Singh understands that nothing is as engaging as a secret to be uncovered or a mystery to be solved.  Over 10,000 people participated in his challenge and it was finally solved 18 months later by a team of Swedish researchers. One of the amazing facts of their solution was their ability to crack the most difficulty RSA cipher by writing a number field sieve algorithm thereby letting an \\"ordinary\\" computer crack the code! Will the development of a truly unbreakable code ever exist?  If it does, Simon Singh will be able to tell us about it.   His website is even more fascinating than TheCode Book.  It has joined my \\"favorites' list!  ...
B00005JKZT|3.0|I'm a Tolkien-literate movie goer,wishing I didn't know the books so well that the movies are ruined for me; we had Arwen do Glorfindel's job in the first one, now we have Faramir do a replay of Boromir and dragging Frodo&co. off somewhere they didn't go, and we've ended BOTH films in different places than each book did. And, really, Tolkien's version of the cliff- hanger was the better one in each case.Can't say that these changes in the plot,(lots of others, too), actually improve the flow for cinema,and saying that you're putting  classic literature on the screen suggests you must have some faith to that. AAA+ visuals and creatures, way too much time spent on arming for battle;could've spent that on realizing the STORY.  Cool to see how these folks realize entities like Fangorn and Smeagol, feel that the characterizations are loyal to Tolkien's vision. Wish the script were just as faithful,(what the ... happened to Shelob?!?),then you'd have a perfectly bang-on movie! BTW, I think TheHobbit would have made a ripping prequel film;Dragons generally gross well at the box-office......

When I first saw this movie I fell in Love with DavidBowie and I have a major crush on him to this very day.Thanks for reading and remember even when your little you still remember the movie that changed your childhood!
B00006X06U|5.0|This work is brilliant - kudos to Mendoza, Klein and Mitchell for orchestrations that complement and renew the majority of these tracks.  Once again I find Ms. Mitchell's choices for material VERY interesting and thoughtful.  &quot;Heijra&quot; and &quot;Refuge of the Roads&quot; should be nominated for Emmys for the richness and perfect harmony of orchestration/vocalist.  This could not have been an easy task with the interesting chord structures that are a Mitchell trademark.  Her voice sounds stronger than ever and the energy she shares indicates an enjoyment in re-creating some of these beautiful compositions.  &quot;Chinese Cafe&quot; is a winner on this outing.  If this is her last album - it's a brilliant conclusion to a stunning career - perhaps her paintings will lead the next passage for Ms. Mitchell.  BRAVO!
B00004TS0E|4.0|MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (1994) is an updated version of a classic film that has a lot of heart but not quite the charm of the original. Definitely a good Holiday film for the whole family, it has a certain message for kids to keep the Christmas Spirit and ideology alive.<br />Directed by Les Mayfield (Encino Man, Flubber) it tells the tale of Santa Clause being set up for failure. Does and or should the world believe in him. Thanks to the efforts of a small non-believing girl...the magic of the season prevails!<br />Starring Sir Richard Attenburough (Jurassic Park, Hamlet) as Father Christmas himself, he is left with wits and efforts of lawyer Dylon Mcdermott (The Practice, Twister, Steel Magnolias) to save his life and gain him his freedom before Christmas. The skeptic, Elizabeth Perkins (Cats &amp; Dogs, The Flintsones) who plays the department store promotions manager who hires and then has to fire Santa himself becomes a tough cookie for her daughter, played by Mara Wilson (Mrs. Doubtfire, Matilda), to convince he IS real.<br />This also has a great final performance of the late J.T. Walsh (Pleasantville, A Few Good Men) and as the judge who must decide the fate of Santa, Robert Prosky (Mrs. Doubtfire, The Chamber) gives a phenomenal performance for his small role.<br />A great Holiday film for the whole family to watch. Give it a chance - it may bring some Christmas Spirit into your day! (1-2-03)

B00006LFGD|4.0|BARBARA STRIESAND - DUETS is a collection that is trying to mirror that of the Frank Sinatra album - of the same name - that came out years ago. It's a good collection of some songs you will definitely be familiar with but I want to focus on one song in particular.<br />It is called \\"I Won't Be The One To Let You Go\\" and it is a duet with Barry Manilow. This is the first time the two of them - in the 35 year career ever did a song together. It is technically vibrant and someone mystical in its medley. The songs sentiment is a little predictable, but so are most songs these days. The two of them sound great together and should have done this a long time ago! Maybe even do a whole album together.<br />The other duets include popular songs with Donna Summer, Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra, Bryan Adams. Johnny Mathis, Barry Gibb, Judy Garland, Kim Carnes and more.<br />If you are a Barbara fan, you'll love it. If you are not, the music will bring back memories. (1-2-03)

B00005JLSC|5.0|CHICAGO is a fantastic and energetic adaptation of a great Broadway musical to come to the silver screen in a long, long time. It has magic and electricity and is filled with extremely brilliant musical performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic, American Sweethearts), Richard Gere (Pretty Women, An Officer And A Gentleman) and Rene Zellweger (Jerry MaGuire, Me Myself & Irene). They all have extremely well refined voices and the performances of Zeta-Jones's singing with her incredible dancing was memorizing. And, who knew Richard Gere could sing and dance?<br />The movie stayed true to the original Broadway production originally co-written, directed and produced by Bob Fosse (Cabaret, Sweet Charity, Lenny & All That Jazz). It is faced paced and quickly edited and with some clever usage of stage scrims/screens and neon you will ever see on the big screen. It is amazing! The production design and the camera work keep you on your toes!<br />Other standout performances include John C. Reilly (The Perfect Storm, Magnolia) as the not-so-bright husband of Rene and then the \\"mother of them all\\" as far as tough female wardens go - Queen Latifah (Sphere, The Bone Collector). They both have incredible voices and screen presences.<br />Directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall (Annie) who also choreographed Annie, Mrs. Santa Claus and Cinderella for Disney ABC TV productions. It has a very big \\"showman\\" type feel and look to it.<br />The story is sharp and witty and revolves around the women in prison who kill their boyfriends, lovers or husbands.. The music and energy are well worth the ticket. Don't miss this movie! (1-2-03)
B00005JLSC|5.0|...From the first frames I was sucked in.  Hafway through I was ready to sing along.  By the end I was ready to get up and dance.  There it was - the witty screenplay, the infectious music, the sequined sexiness (here I really have to applaud the genius behind the most focused and judicious use of sequins I've seen in a long time), the in-your-face energy I have craved for years.<br />When was the last time you were sitting in an audience that burst out in applause after a scene?  When was the last time you were still singing a piece of music from a movie the next day?  When was the last time you felt sated, like you needed a cigarette after you left the theater?<br />If you want all that, GO SEE THIS FILM.<br />It provided the answer to my question above - would a 21st century musical fail simply because no one can sing and dance anymore?<br />Answer:  No.  What's more, because the Director was smart enough to work with the weaknesses of the actors, and incorporate them, it assisted the credibility of the exercise.<br />Catherine Zeta Jones was astonishing.  Really!  It's been a long time since ANYONE has projected that amount of energy onto celluloid.  She's a sex bomb.  Poor MD!  That woman will kill him!<br />Richard Gere has been the love of my life for as long as I can remember, and he still doesn't know it.  However, he really can tapdance, plus he makes a good slimeball attorney.  So talented.  Sigh.  Who knew?  <br />And RZ?  Dazzling.  Simply dazzling.  She fleshed out Roxie in often surprising ways.  She embodied a special kind of determined vulnerability.  Her Roxie looks fragile and vulnerable, but she allows us just the right glimpses into a determined, steely interior to keep us on her side but wary.  She was the least trained of the cast, but that maybe compelled her to rely more on the acting of the part than the dancing of it.  All is forgiven.<br />My only lingering question:  WHY ISN\\"T QUEEN LATIFAH GIVEN MORE BILLING?  Her Mama gave me chills.<BR>    <BR>Were there problems?  Not big, unforgivable ones.  If you are the kind of person given to looking for reasons to dislike or dismiss films, you might find something to pick on, but I suggest you seek professional help and get on with your life instead.  My audience meter says you are wrong-headed.<br />Overall, this could be the crash cart that gets the heart of musicals on film pumping again.  I wish long life and happiness to all who made it happen.
0316666343|2.0|As a writer, I was very much looking forward to this novel.  The hype was incredible and the concept seemed remarkable (Susie Salmon, 14, looks down from Heaven and tells the story of her rape, murder, and observes both her family and the man who killed her).  Sadly, the novel falls into one cliche after the other.  Alice Sebold tries to appeal to everyone with this novel through the optimistic, peaceful portrait she paints of Heaven, the bizarre recounts of violence and perversion, and the poignancy of a family trying to cope with an unspeakable loss.  Unfortunately, what Sebold really needed here was a focus and \\"The Lovely Bones\\" really does not have one.  It's choppy, far too smart and preachy for its own good, and seems to tell us all we really need as readers in the first three chapters, leaving the subsequent fifteen as unnecessary.  \\"The Lovely Bones\\" feels either like the master work of an amateur or a severe lowpoint in the career of a writer who may have once been great; I have trouble deciding which.  Wait for the inevitable film version I'm sure will be cruising our way in a year or two.
0767811070|5.0|This movie(at the time), was the best example of south-cantral L.A.  It tells a great story of three boys in the hood who suffer tragic outcomes throughout the story... Well this is a masterpiece people should have, by now, checked out.  The sad thing is, John Silvingston couldn't cum up with any other movie that could match this, unless it was Higher Learning, a good movie, nah.
B00006IR5S|5.0|I LOVE this CD! I listen to it every day in my car, and as I listen to each song I can see the scenes and hear the dialogue in my head. It's a blast! All the music is full of Harry Potter magic and nothing puts me in a better mood. It's great to listen to after reading the books or seeing the movie. Plus, the collectable covers are really fun. I have Hermoine, but I want them all! My hope is that they'll eventually sell the whole set together. I would highly recomend this to anyone who loves Harry Potter or is just looking for some exciting music!
0066214122|1.0|Crichton has always been tops with his scientific savvy and vision of the future but, Christ has he run out of story ideas. Hasn't he done this before. His super beings are destroyed a little too conveniently to tie up this [weak] novel. Can't you just see this was written as a screenplay, not a novel. Get James Cameron to direct. You can use left over effects from The Abyss and deleted scenes from The Swarm. Won't cost much. Any d-rate actor could act out this crud.<br />Skip it.
B000006IUQ|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie of all time.  It is the greatest representation of what would happen if someone was to be stuck int he predicament that they were in.  It is not only a seriouse story, there is much truth to it, unlike other hollywood movies.  I love The Edge, it is simply amazing
B000069AUI|3.0|in my place, god put a smile on your face, and clocks are strong songs ... but the rest fall a bit short. <br />&quot;parachutes&quot; remains a masterpiece. <br />while &quot;a rush of blood&quot; is merely a competent album.

B00005JL78|4.0|First, lemme just get this part out of the way right now.  Personally, I like the movie, but I assume that if you're reading this right now, you're more interested in what the DVD has to offer and have already seen the movie.  There are pleanty of other reviews that will give you the basic idea of the plot.  However, what I'm going to tell you about is the technical pros and cons of this DVD...something that most people seem to forget to mention (oddly enough).  First off, the 2:39:1 anamorphic video transfer is flawless...those of you with luck and money to have a 16x9 ratio digital TV will marvel at how beautiful this film looks, and amazingly enough, on a 10 year old mitsubishi non-flat screen, it still looked amazing.  That says a lot.  Second, the Audio, the 5.1 Dolby Digital audio is impressive.  Good, clean, and the levels are right on with no ambients or hums or hissess, which is always good.  All that's left to the ears is the wonderful sound recordings of the original footage.  As for extras be prepared to be dissapointed.  If you were expecting a director commentary, or any commentary at all, forget it, speilberg doesn't do them.  If he didn't do one for the special edition DVD of ET, his claim to fame movie, that pretty much sets the tone for everything else.  Also, none of the little, and I do mean &quot;little&quot; behind the scenes are really worth the price of the DVD.  They show &quot;some&quot; parts of the behind the scenes, but only three minutes for each little montage?  Altogether it comes out to about an hour to two hours of &quot;going into less than expected detail&quot; footage with some other non-video extras thrown in for good measure.  Personally, knowing Spielberg and his skill as a director, I would have like to see some more &quot;umph&quot; thrown into this look into what he did with the movie.  The movie is so good and did so well, they can afford to give the people buying the dvd more stuff...hell I would pay the extra just to have the small featurettes be even a couple of minutes longer.  Either that or give me more of them, like on the T2 DVD, where there are 40 some odd mini-featurettes that give more about the movie than any of the ones on the Minority Report DVD.<br />This is not to say that everything is a total loss.  I did give it four stars.  What they have here is a good start with a great movie and great transfer, and ok extras.  If this thing had a commentary, it would make up for it.  <br />In closing: If you love the movie, it's a must buy.  If you've never seen it before, save it for a rental.
0140143505|5.0|This charming little book is a collection of letters between New York author Helene Hanff and London bookseller Frank Doel.  In the course of 20 years from Hanff's first book order from Marks & Co,, till Doel's death in 1969 they connected through the mail they exchanged and built a wonderful relationship.  While Hanff became friends with Doel's family and his co-workers at the bookstore, what the two had was something special, revolving around their love of literature.  Despite plans to do so, the two never met as Hanff didn't make it to London until after Doel's death and the publication of the letters.  This book beautifully demonstrates the power of correspondence and how two people can connect, solely by the written word.<br />Heartwarming, funny, sad, all rolled in one.  I went on to read other books by Hanff where she describes her trips to London.  After reading her books, I too went on a pilgrimage to 84, Charing Cross Road.
B00005JKCH|4.0|The Basic Plot: Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire), the school whipping post, gets bitten by a genetically altered super spider.  Almost overnight, he gains wild spider-like powers.  While at first he uses them to attempt to get into Mary Jane's proverbial pants (played by Kirsten Dunst) he realizes that he should use his new found powers to put a stopper in local crime after his uncle and parental guardian is killed by a car-jacker, a crime which he himself could have stopped.  At the same time, a strange creature named the Green Goblin has begun terrorizing the city.  Who is this \\"Green Goblin\\" character, and will Spiderman be able to stop him?<br />The Movie:  It has a very comic book feel at times, which is a good thing.  The acting moves back and forth from very good to rather hokey.  The best acting comes from Willem Dafoe, whose scenes as the split personality Dr. Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin stand out as some of the best in the movie.  Kirsten Dunst, while great to look at, is nothing special as Mary Jane in Spiderman.  Even in the very emotional scenes I don't buy it.  And Toby, perfectly cast as Parker, and although some say he isn't the one they would have pegged as Spiderman, he's a perfect Peter Parker, and since Spidy and Parker are one and the same, it would only make sense.  As for Direction and Cinematography, don't expect anything really new here.  It's your clear-cut action movie with the classic Raimi touches like his brother being in the movie, the Cadillac makes a return appearance, and Bruce Campbell makes a cameo as the Ring Announcer.  All in all it's not a bad lil' flick.<br />The Video:  Talk about a great transfer.  Although I only buy Widescreen for the most part, this DVD comes in either the widescreen or fullscreen version.  I would have to push for the Widescreen, especially if you got the home theater for it, or if you're just a purist movie buff like me!<br />The Audio:  This is where 5.1 audio is key.  Every little soundbyte comes through crystal clear from the metallic whooshes during the spidy sense scene to the big explosions during the Oscorp Gala scene in Midtown.  Yay to Columbia Tri-Star and the Spiderman Team for this audio!<br />The Disc one Commentary:  For the love of GOD, do not put Kirsten Dunst on a commentary with Sam Raimi.  Shoot me in the foot, put a skirt on my head, and call me Sally Struthers before you put anyone with ears in front of a set of speakers and force me to listen to that girl talk.  It's ok when you have a good script behind her, but I'll tell you, in 2 hours, every time I heard her say something, I couldn't help but feel dumber.  As for the rest of the people on the Commentary, including Raimi and producers Laura Ziskin and Grant Curtis, they all said stuff that was interesting and worth listening to (in reference to the visuals of the movie).  But please, know whom you are putting on a commentary Columbia Pictures.  Some actors aren't meant to do improv!<br />The Extras:  First off, unless you actually care about Sum 41, you're not going to care much for their music video.  So exnay on that.  As for the other extras, there is no original behind the scenes from the cast and crew of Spiderman.  The only thing you do get is the HBO and E! behind the scenes, which are ok, but half of it is all about stuff that you probably could have figured out from picking up a copy of \\"The Amazing Spiderman\\", doesn't matter which.  The screen tests of Toby and J.K. Simmons, while at first glance sound great, aren't very long or really all that worthwhile.  There are some ok DVD-ROM features, but unless you have a DVD-ROM in your computer, it doesn't really matter because you can't access them.  The outtake reel is sub par.  I'll say it again, IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE AN OUTTAKE REEL, REALLY DO IT!  However, there is a lot of interesting background info on the Spiderman Comic book and it's leap from comic to screen.<br />The Bad:  If there is one thing that killedthe extras disk, it's the horrible layout of the menus.  Very hard to navigate and easy for you to miss parts of the extras that you might have overlooked.  When I buy a DVD, the extras are key, and they have to be laid out so that someone can access them.  Now, if I can build a computer, but have a hard time accessing the extras on a DVD, something is wrong.  Oh, and Kirsten Dunst in the Commentary (I can't mention this enough!)<br />The Final Word:  Buy the DVD for the movie, stay for some of the extras and come back to it every now and then when you need to watch a straightforward action movie.  But don't expect Spiderman \\"THE EPIC\\"...
B000002GYI|5.0|In the early 70s, while most pop acts still seemed contended to churn out their 2nd hand version of the musical blue print created by The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson, Kraftwerk were bravely forging a new musical form. Kraftwerk's Ralf Hutter admired how Brian Wilson managed to create a virtual California perfectly on vinyl and Kraftwerk, called \\"the Dusseldorf Beach Boys\\" by Lester Bangs, pulled off the same trick with post W.W.2 Germany. Computer World, originally released in 1981, is the masterwork of Kraftwerk's output so far.  Computer World is prophetic piece of work (the Jules Vernes of pop) predicting a world run by computers and even computers in the home. This might seem like rather a cold and sterile subject for an album but don't be fooled ...this record is full of tremendous warmth, beauty and humanity. While many acts using cutting edge technology soon sound dated, as soon as newer technology appears, Kraftwerk's Computer World still sounds ultra modern and vital.   This group changed music forever and this album should be on every \\"10 greatest albums ever made list\\" out there.
B00005T30L|5.0|There are many great reviews of the film on this site so I'll just add my little bit. Although the film is primarily based on the graphic novel of the same name, the relationship between Enid and Seymour only exists in the movie. However, I don't think it just came from nowhere, it seems very similar to the first story from another Daniel Clowes book: Caricature.
B000000Y27|5.0|Without question, ``The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery'' is the best representation of Wes Montgomery's truly incredible playing.  It should be in every jazz guitar aficionado's collection and should be the first to own if one is just starting a collection.  Furthermore, the aspiring jazz guitarist could not go wrong relying on this album as the best training CD available: many of the voicings of even the standard chord progressions are both subtle and sweet.  The only other album that comes close is the second cd in the ``Impressions-The Verve Jazz Sides'' collection, which has some examples of Wes playing live (even the ``mistakes'' are a thing of beauty as he recovers).
B00003CXTG|2.0|To me it seemed like two separate movies spliced together. As previously stated the romance was inept and ridiculous. The behavior of the main characters made me dislike all three of them. But I was drawn to the movie because I am a war buff so I won't dwell on the romance.<br />First of all what are the chances that Ben Afflecks character Volunteered for and fought in the battle of Britain, got shot down behind enemy lines [what was he doing there it was the Battle of BRITAIN?], almost died but was smuggled out by partisans, came back to Pearl (why in the world would the Army send him all the way back to Pearl Harbor to recover) just in time for the Japanese attack, Then fly there against the Japanese. And it doesn't end there he then is hand picked by Doolittle to fly the famous raid on Tokyo where he crashlands in China and wins a firefight (with a handgun) against seasoned Japanese infantry (with rifles and certainly no slouches at the time). Why not keep going? He could have fought in the battle of Midway, then arrive at Guadalcanal just as Henderson field opened, later D-day then the Battle of the Bulge then maybe he could have  dropped the Bomb on Hiroshima. Why would a fighter pilot be picked for a bombing mission they had plenty of well trained B-25 pilots at the time? Does the Army send all of your friends and flight crew and super mechanic with you when you get transfered to a top secret carrier mission? A bit too far fetched for me. <br />Ok Now this Mechanic. He has a radio that can talk to anything anytime, wow. I'm no WW2 communications expert but I am pretty sure they did not have that capability. Then while he carried  the radio and a large machine gun up ten flights of stairs he kept full communication with the pilots and his crew on the ground! He arrives at the top of the tower just in time to get off a sweet deflection shot just as the Zero happened to be going by. I won't comment about the game of chicken, just think about it please. Oh and they used the dud bomb thats not a dud twice, tsk tsk.<br />Historically accurate?  The big picture maybe, but there were so many farcicle details that I felt it took away from what really happened there it wasn't a drama it was a disaster. Not any less of a disaster than 9/11.<br />Now I have to say some thing nice. The special effects make this movie worth seeing once, but don't buy it. Rent it or wait for it to come on tv. I collect war movies but I don't want this one
B00005JK1C|5.0|This is by far the best suspense thriller I have ever seen in my  lifetime. I can't remember any other movie that left my mouth agape at the end totally surprised. What a great plot this movie had. To top it off the characters in the movie, especially Kevin Spacey, do an excellent job of delivering the script which is also well-written. I can't usually watch suspense thrillers more than once or twice. However, I can watch this movie as many times as I am allowed because the script is so well written. They got me hook, line, and sinker. If you want the standard for suspense thrillers, you need to add this to your collection.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The fusing of Chris Cornell, and Rage Against the Machine to form Audioslave is unbelieveable! First time I listened to the entire CD, I liked EVERY song, and I can't say that about many CD's.  Chris is so talented, and somehow they manage to almost sound like a completely different band with each song.  The rhythms, and the lyrics are tight, and entrancing.  I can't say enough about this CD!
0792841344|5.0|The Movie is a startling 1979 cult horror fantasy shocker about a evil mortician named \\" Tall Man\\" ( Angus Scrimm) who is mysteriously stealing bodies from the local cemetery and using them to turn them into Dwarf-like Zombies, a couple of brothers and a Ice Cream vandor ( Reggie Bannister) discover that these mysterious beings are from another dimension. A geniunely scary movie that has decent performances, b-movie special effects such as the infamous silver ball that drills through your skull and sucks your brains out and a spooky if twisting ending that will scare the crud of you, it's a must see for fans of the genre.<br />The DVD: Excellent transfer with great sound and picture, the extras are phenomenal too such as Documentary, audio commentary, trailers, TV spots, audio extras such as the disco version of the theme score and more.<br />Similar movies recommended: City of the Living Dead ( a.k.a.

B00005B36H|5.0|after waiting so long for a new tool album, they release this... and in the process completely blow away everything i've ever called music in the past. I adored the CD... and so I went to a show. And another, and another, and another. Never have I heard music like this, it's beyond music. It surpasses everything they've done in the past. It's even more amazing live. If you are at all open to it, it will take you on quite a journey, through the music and yourself. For those who don't like it, they may go and purchase another manufactured band's CD and leave tool for those with open minds.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The movie itself will be known as the best Comic Book movie of all time, this Sam Raimi directed film is based on the beloved Comic book about a nerd named \\" Peter Parker\\" ( Tobey Maguire) who is a loser, he has a crush on a beautiful girl named \\" Mary Jane\\" ( Kirsten Dunst) and wants to get her to like him.

B000002GLE|4.0|Upon leaving the Police at the height of their fame, Sting embarked on a bold new solo career with a group of expert jazz musicians in this fusion rock band. All of the players are superb: bassist Darrel Jones (Sting played guitar instead in this band), the late keyboardist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Omar Hakim, and famed saxophonist Branford Marsalis, along with some backup singers. This lengthy live album, taken from the band's tour through Europe in 1986, showcases a unique, skillful sound; it also highlights many of the more obscure corners of Sting's songwriting career, breathing new life into many forgotten Police songs. Indeed, it seems ironic that the band's live versions of songs like &quot;Children's Crusade&quot; and &quot;We Work the Black Seam&quot; (from the Sting album &quot;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot;) are the most ragged offerings here, considering that this same band played them on the studio recordings. Various lengthy medleys are entertaining, although Branford's &quot;rap&quot; during the opening set is slightly embarrassing, as are his occasional bum notes during tenor sax rambling. Be this as it may, when the band turns to odd Police oldies like &quot;Low Life&quot; and &quot;Demolition Man,&quot; they cleary improve on the flawed originals. (Don't get me wrong, the Police were one of the finest rock groups I ever heard; rather, this group takes material that the Police had treated as second-rate and elaborates upon it into something better.) Quieter numbers like &quot;Moon Over Bourbon Street&quot; and a drawn-out &quot;Tea in the Sahara&quot; lend themselves very well to this band's jazzy stage sound; in fact, the moody &quot;I Burn For You&quot; is perhaps the highlight of the set, building to an intense climax of longing and menace that is truly frightening. However, the band also proves they can cook with upbeat numbers like &quot;Another Day&quot; and the straight blues of &quot;Down So Long.&quot; Overall this recording is worth having. It shows Sting at the peak of his confidence and daring, when he was still riding the forward momentum of a career that has since become more tame. Music fans of many stripes can enjoy this atmospheric collection of lesser-known songs made wonderful onstage. It should also be noted that this CD contains many songs not featured in the concert movie of the same name.
B00000ILDF|1.0|This film is so full of mistakes it's disgusting. The first mistake (and possibly the worst of them all) was to kill off the characters of Hicks and Newt in the beginning of the film. This completely negates everything in \\"Aliens\\". The director was quoted as saying something about how bringing only Ripley back would be the most powerful message. Right. Their death hangs over the entire film like a black cloud of death and despair. And these are never good emotions for a science fiction film. Bishop is torn apart, Hicks is impaled through the chest by a support beam, and Newt is drowned in her cryo tube. Ripley just happenes to be the only survivor and not only is she in good condition, nothing is broken and she feels fine the rest of the film. Another mistake is the planet she landed on. Who cares about a bunch of murderers and rapists? Aside from a few main characters the prisoners all look and sound alike (and by this I mean they all say the f--k word every five seconds, f--k this and f--k that and f--k you, great script writing here) you do not care when they die, and you cannot remember their names half the time. Hicks is missed in the film horribly, such as the gang rape scene for instance. Even with the horrible actors and plot and script writing, it would have been better if the characters from Aliens where around. Watch this film and you'll wish you had died with Hicks and Newt in the beginning. Another mistake is their religion bashing. If Weaver has something against religion I don't care but don't interject it into the film just because she thinks it will be interesting. Another mistake was making Sigourney Weaver co-producer. Whoever told her she knew anything about creating a movie aside from acting? The tag line for this film was \\"The B-tch is back\\", where they talking about the Alien Queen or Sigourney Weaver? Hard to tell. Another mistake was the sets. A big huge prison that looks exactly the same everywhere. Alien was different because the Nostromolooked different. It was just some big hallway. Another mistake was Ripleys character. She mourns the death of her friends in the first part, but then she's seen sleeping with the local doctor. Wonderful writing here. And why in the hell did they make her bald. The cover of alien 3 shows a bald Ripley in a tank top. What's that supposed to tell you about the film? As a stand alone this film is below mediocre at best. But as a sequal to Aliens? Never. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this film. I choose to end Ripley's adventures with Aliens.
B00003CXRM|5.0|If you're thinking that a depression-era adaptation of Homer is going to be like a humidity-soaked 10th grade English lesson, fugheddaboudit.  \\"Brother\\" just comes alive in your mind as you watch it!  The brilliant writing and direction, the genius camera work, the dead-on charicatures, all of it comes together and sucks you in to the Coen's off-kilter world.  Clooney is a natural for the silver-tongued Ulysses, and Pete and Delmar are perfectly cast - every subtle shift in their simple thought process is clearly written on their face.  Pappy O'Daniel, the Bible salesman, the weasly suitor, each one feeds off of the others to generate a bizarre reality full of omens and prophets and insane cow-killing bank robbers with insecurity complexes.<br />Try it, you'll like it.
B00006JIAF|5.0|These guys are the best thing out there, and finally have the skills to play and sing music. I love this band!!
B000000OAN|5.0|This is my favorite Queen album. Ranks as best album of all time in my list, among Led Zeppelin 4 and Toys in the Attic(Aerosmith). <br />1. Death on Two Legs- Good opener, this song was about the man who financially screwed them over. Very dark, something Queen didn't do much of. 4/5<BR>2. Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon- Like a musical, short though, but I still like it. 4/5<BR>3. I'm In Love With My Car- Good song. 5/5<BR>4. You're Best Friend- Good song, dedicated to his wife. 4/5<BR>5. '39- Nice little song by May. Pretty good. 4/5<BR>6. Sweet Lady- Pretty good song. 4/5<BR>7. Seaside Rendezvous- Like \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\", except longer. I like this one too. 4/5<BR>8. The Prophets Song- This song is amazing. Great stuff here, one of my favorites by Queen. As many other reviewers have said, listen to the middle part with headphones. 5/5<BR>9. Love of my Life- Nice ballad by Mercury. 4/5<BR>10. Good Company- Good Song. 4/5<BR>11. Bohemian Rhapsody- Most people just say \\"need i say anything\\" to this song, thats true, its one of the best songs ever made. I've known many people who like punk/...rap, and they like this song. Its loved by all. GREAT SONG. 5/5(i'd give it a lot more than that, more like 10/5, but im being fair here.)<BR>12. God Save the Queen- Good guitar playing by May here, its good. 4/5<br />All in all, very good cd. Highly recommended. Enjoy it
B000070WJE|4.0|Robbie Williams has made a great CD here.  From beginning to end it is original, poppy and has that &quot;Robbie &quot; touch.  In theory this CD is suppose to break the American charts.  However, that is unlikely to happen.  Even though the music is awesome, it still has a &quot;Brit&quot; feel to it and is somewhat reminscient of the Spice Girls.  But if there is anyone out there looking for a great artist to turn to, or if you are a Robbie fan from way back, make sure you pick up this album.
B00005JL96|3.0|I read  the reviews and was eager to get this for ourselves and our two small sons. Parts of the film are wonderful for a small child, but there is altogether too much anger and violence and suspense. I was disappointed in the ratio of quiet / character-developing scenes to oppositional / threatenting / chase scenes. Yes, on the spectrum of movies today it is better than most  - but it will have to wait another two years before I will share it with my 3-year-old. (I recommend _My Neighbor Totoro_ for small kids - there is emotional stuff but not too strong.)
B00005JL0I|4.0|The &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series sure could take a few hints from &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.  Whereas the former is predictable and obvious, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; is a good example of that famous dry British wit.<br />What else could you call it when wealthy Ursula Andress tells Peter Sellers that she gets her newspapers BEFORE they're printed, and he replies, &quot;Well, I suppose you can do anything if you've got money...&quot;  Or when Joanna Pettet comments on her estranged mother's oversized bed and is told, &quot;The German army was very large in those days.&quot;<br />I've withheld one star because the movie does tend to have an episodic feel, due to the five different directors who worked on it, and because it drags a bit in places.  Still, the witty jokes more than make up for those small flaws.  Considering how many hands this movie was in, it's amazing that it works so well.  Woody Allen gives his funniest performance as neurotic Jimmy Bond.  Peter Sellers is terrific, as usual.  And watch out for an appearance by a young Jacqueline Bisset as Miss Goodthighs.<br />The movie's crowning touch is the music by Burt Bacharach, which manages to be catchy and loopy at the same time.<br />Finally, one of the best reasons for owning rather than renting this movie is that some of the gags go by so fast (Q's laboratory, the art auction), that you might not catch them all until your second or third viewing.  And, like a lot of good humor, some of the jokes just get funnier with repeat viewings.
B0000039QA|5.0|i am a true rap fan, and listen to rappers that deserve my attention.  this excludes new fake rappers like Ja Rule, Nelly, Cam'ron, NORE, Clipse, Nappy Roots, etc.  They may get radio play, but real rap fans know that they lack skill that once was needed to be a great rapper.  Now Biggie is my second-favorite rapper, beside the late genius Tupac.  Biggie had by far the best flow and beats that rap has seen, besides Snoop's flow and Dre's beats.  Life After Death is, I think, on par with Ready to Die.  Both albums portray Biggie as a big-time roller, but also a street rapper.  He had the lyrical ability of any rapper that ever touched a mic, and he backed it up.  King of the East Coast.  Life After Death is a weird album, that shadows Death in many ways, not unlike 2Pac's Makaveli album.  Biggie flows about everything from fame to death to beef on this double-disc set.  He has classic tracks in \\"Hypnotize,\\" \\"Mo Money Mo Problems,\\" and \\"Sky's the Limit.\\"  He also has underground hits in \\"I Love the Dough,\\" \\"Miss U,\\" \\"Going Back to Cali,\\" and \\"Notorious Thugs.\\"  This album cannot be doubted of its amazing content, as it was the first rap album ever to hit Diamond status in sales.  This, I think, is the next best rap album ever, second to 2Pac's \\"All Eyez On Me.\\"  Be warned though, there are a few tracks that should have been cut, such as \\"Another,\\" \\"Playa Hata,\\" and \\"Nasty Boy.\\"  Other than those three tracks out of 24, all songs are classic Biggie.  Buy this album if you call yourself a true fan of rap, before it went down the drain after Biggie and Pac passed on.  RIP Big, King of the Coast.
B00000JLWW|5.0|... Its scope and ambition is so far beyond what most films ever attempt -- and it succeeds on so many levels -- that it's hard to believe anyone could trash it. I've seen it repeatedly, but only on video and DVD, not theatrically, where I would imagine it would be even more spectacular. But more than that, as a novelist and screenwriter myself, I ADMIRE James Cameron's script. Using footage of the ACTUAL wreck itself is emotional enough, when, with Gloria Stuart's narration, he dissolves into the past when the ship was new and mighty. The personal story of the girl who's looking for meaning in her life and the guy who helps her find it before they're both caught in unimaginable tragedy is something we all can relate to... The sequence of the ship's collision with the iceberg -- the frantic calls to the bridge, the shutting of the watertight doors and the men rushing to escape, everything -- is one of the finest and most exciting sequences I've ever seen. The special effects? I've never seen better in ANYTHING ...My only quibble is with the lack of extras on the DVD. While I'm glad to see the trailer, this is one DVD that SCREAMS for a making-of documentary -- who wouldn't want to know how it was done? Wish they'd added it! My quibble with the film? Nothing. See it and revel in another time and another place.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Arguably one of the most influential science-fiction movies of all time, the 2002 re-release of Fritz Lang's 1927 epic \\"Metropolis\\" was truly one of the miracles of modern times.  Not only had a generous amount of footage been re-integrated to the cut, but the entire film had been gloriously restored and the exisiting title cards re-translated from the original German.<br />\\"Metropolis\\" tells the story of a massive city split in two: under the earth is the city of the workers, slaves to the 10-hour clock.  Their endless toil provides for the rulers of the upper world, a class of rich and indolent nobles.  In-between these worlds steps Maria, a beautiful worker that tells the workers that a mediator will come to join the city and that \\"Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind.\\"  But her goal is not so easily reached, and a mad scientist, his villainous robot decoy, and a resistant upper class work against her.<br />Lang's vision is astounding, and the special effects are fantastically rendered for the time.  The film's production costs were so great, it almost bankrupt the studio.  The result is a fantastic blend of drama, allegory, romance, myth, and classic science-fiction.  The score is evocative like few others, and the newly restored film has a new recording of the original soundtrack.  While some of the footage is lost forever, title cards fill in the gaps, and this is the only thing the movie can be faulted for.<br />This is the ONLY version of the movie to own.  All others use an inferior print and some even tell an entirely different story.  Also, avoid the 1984 Georgio Moroder-scored version at all costs.<br />This DVD is a must for anyone who even has the slightest interest in cinema.  It truly is one of the most wonderful films ever made.
B00004WGAI|5.0|Is there any other version of this movie that comes this close to the book? I don't think so. Don't get me wrong. The book is much better, but I love sitting down with this on a Saturday afternoon.<BR>I hope it comes to DVD.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a wonderful read - the setting and perspective are fresh, and Sebold is an artist in her development. Most of us are scared of the whole notion of death, and the only people who want to talk about \\"another life\\" are religious conservatives. There are some prophetic remarks, and the metaphor she creates with the title is excellent. I loved it.
0783222955|5.0|What can anyone say about this movie except that it's perfection itself! With outstanding performances from all the actors, especially Gregory Peck. For having very little time on the screen I think Robert Duvall was amazing as Boo Radley, he was everything I ever pictured Boo to be without having so much as one line, he was absolutely terrific! The children in the film also give wonderful performances and I think overall it's one of the best movies ever made. Don't miss this one!
B000002J20|5.0|Yes's \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" will definitely go down in history as one of the most debateable (double) albums in rock music history, or, at least in the annals of progressive rock. Many avid Yes fans are quick to praise this double disc work a masterpiece - the best Yes ever did, while others point out that \\"Tales...\\" is an overly-flawed, ultra-bombastic disaster, or the worst album in Yes' history, or, in the minds of most prog-heads, the worst \\"effort\\" to grace the prog-rock scene in the genre's rather varied and storied history. Those who are apt to hate it, either have a short attention span, or they just don't appreciate good...make that GREAT music. And \\"TFTO\\" isn't just GREAT music...it exceeds boundaries of sheer GENIUSNESS and exudes BRILLIANCE. Here is a somewhat brief track-by-track synopsis of each of the four \\"movements\\": \\"THE REVEALING SCIENCE OF GOD: Dance of the Dawn\\": A down-to-earth, yet musically and lyrically breathtaking arrangement. The band starts off on the right foot, combining moving and soothing instrumentation, which segues nicely between time changes. Rick Wakeman's keyboards are just awesomely dazzling - the highlight of this track. Steve Howe and newcomer Alan White provide a rather homogenous rhythm section (on lead guitar and drums, respectively) thoughout parts of this track as well. All in all, a very \\"revealing\\" and enchanting listen. \\"THE REMEMBERING: High The Memory\\": The circus-like calliope opening (courtesy of Wakeman) permeates this track, coupled with Howe's acoutic-styled guitar playing. Chris Squire's thumping bass adds a little something extra to this \\"excursion\\", but otherwise, the track as a whole comes off as being the least strong of the four, only to be saved by a tender and romantic vocal from Jon Anderson. Still worth tuning into, though. On to Disc #2... \\"THE ANCIENT': Giants Under the Sun\\": What can I say about this particular movement? It is the intro of Alan White's and Chris Squire's percussive introspections and \\"liquid\\" bass playing that makes this track for me. There are other audio delights to keep an ear out for as well, so stay tuned! \\"RITUAL: Nous Sommes Du Soleil\\": The final movement of this double-CD masterpiece is the most spine-tingling and profound music ever committed to record. A prime example is chillngly displayed at around the 14:20 mark, when Alan White's chimes and Rick Wakeman's mesmerizing keyboard/synthsizer pulsations reach their ultimate climax, which make a calming transition into Steve Howe's soothing guitar crescendo towards the final minutes. Yes displays some upstanding bluesy/jazzy arpeggiations, which make sporadic appearances here, too. Now, if only Jon Anderson could work on pronouncing his French a little more properly! Overall, \\"TFTO\\" is one of Yes' most introspective and brilliant masterworks to date, with \\"Close To The Edge\\" being a close second. If only those Yes naysayers would put their own shortcomings aside and give \\"Tales...\\" another careful listen, they might like what they hear...and they, too, would regard it as a work of pure musical and lyrical genius. Yes, folks, \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" will cause your ears' auditory system to experience spontaneous orgasms, so please be sure and listen with great caution!spections and \\"liquid\\" bass playing that makes this track for me.

038533558X|4.0|This was the first Harlan Coben novel that I had the pleasure to read.<br />I found the plot to be suspenseful and quick paced.  While others here did not find Will to be the best main character, I enjoyed the fact that he was fallible and not always on top of his game.  I tried to figure out how everyone was linked while reading the story, but soon realized it was pointless to speculate because all of the characters had a secret that needed to be revealed.  Coben has written a thriller that hooks you from the beginning and takes you for a ride. Sit back and hang on.<br />I currently have &quot;Tell No One&quot; on my bedside table to read next.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Where is 'Empty Garden'?<BR>The quality of disc 1 and the first song on disc 2 (Don't Go Breaking My Heart' have the same problem as the origional - overwhelming bass. Then the sound improves considerably with 'Little Jeannie' and continues through disc 2. I feel 'Nikita' is technically one of the best pop songs ever produced. Note the tight sound. All instruments are where they should be. Then we get to the bonus CD, which in itself is worth the price of the album. This live version of 'Candle in the Wind' is incredible. Ever since it was released on the 'Live in Australia'. I've wondered what instrument begins with the piano in the second verse. Is it hammond, wurlitzer, synthesizer or what? Then follows the Elton John/George Micheal version of 'Don't let the sun go down on me' which is very very good, 'Live Like Horses' with Paravotti and finally a totally unique version of 'Your Song' with Alessandro Safina. Note the choirs on the last 2 selections.<BR>All in all, these discs are well worth having in your collection.
0790729970|5.0|This movie is so funny i had to pause it several times to go to the bathroom. It is a typical Jim Carrey movie no one could have done this line but him i strongly recommend it for people wiha good sense of humor
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink has schosen to make her own music, and that was a good choice. It's refreshingly different, in the sound, and varied too. This album is one of my favorites. Though i dont think she has released her best songs yet. There's hip hop, rock, soft rnb, vietnameese rythmes, and eaven an indian kind of sound. My favorite tracks are:                   <br />get the party started<br />18 wheeler<br />missundastood<br />dear diary<br />just like a pill<br />family portrait<br />don't let me get me<br />lonely girl <br />my Vietnam<br />catch 22<br />That's 10 of the 15 tracks. The rest is more slow, and not so catshy, but the lyrics are great though.
B000075BFK|5.0|This whole 2 disc set is hot, every track is fire, he's still alive, here.
B00005B36H|5.0|For a start, this album will appeal to a select few people. It is not a commercial album, it is not Nu-metal, or grunge or heavy metal. It simply has no genre. <br />It is an album for the open-minded and intelligent, for those with a large concentration span and can appreciate what tool do. This has to be Tool's finest recording to date, and man have they changed! Ever since Opaite, they have continued to develop and mature their music, and on Lateralus it seems they have done what they set out to do. They are one of the only bands that can get away with making fans wait nearly 6 years between albums and make that wait worthwhile. They have shredded their sound down, they lyrics and music in general is much more mature. No silly amusing lyrics and stupid song names, Lateralus really is reaching into the occult and unexplainalbe. It is hard to work out how this album was created, it is as if there is some sort of 5th member controlling their movements and creative mind, as Tool themselves have admitted in a recent interview in Metal Hammer, that they cannot explain either how their songs come to be. This album really does make a strong impact, and it will leave those that can appreciate it wondering and trying to explain truly what this album is. From the lyrics and harshness of album opener &quot;The Grudge&quot;, anyone capable of appreciating this album will realise that it is going to be both unexplainalbe and out of the ordinary. The way the lyric, guitar and rythm patterns fit together to create the multi-layered masterpieces that piece this album together is just extraordinary. This album works in so many layers that you can just get completely lost in it, as if you are in some sort of paranormal ecstacy! Even in parts of songs where there is just a guitar, or parts where there is just the rythm and vocal sections playing, it sounds as if an entire orchestra of talented musicains is playing. Even on the guitar only  instrumental &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot;, it sounds as if 20 people are playing, not 1! And yes, to many the title of that track compared to the nature of it may seem extremely cheesy and stupid, but when you do listen to it you realise just why it is caled that. In all, this album is the most amazing and gripping contemporary release i have heard, more than able to sit alongside such classics as Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;, Led Zeppelin's 1,2,3 and 4, Sabbath's &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and many other rock and metal classics! Must buy simply amazing!
0736648771|4.0|This book recounts an amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and the will to live, despite dire circumstances. The author, Joe Simpson, and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, attempted to ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes. Near the summit, tragedy struck when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, fell and hit a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg, rupturing his right knee, and shattering his right heel. Beneath him was a seemingly endless fall to the bottom.<br />When Simon reached him, they both knew that the chances for getting Joe off the mountain were virtually non-existent. Yet, they fashioned a daring plan to do just that. For the next few hours, they worked in tandem through a snowstorm, and managed a risky, yet effective way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain.<br />About three thousand feet down, Joe, who was still roped to Simon, dropped off an edge and found himself now free hanging in space six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge was over hung about fifteen feet above him. The dark outline of a crevasse lay about a hundred feet directly below him.<br />Joe could not get up, and Simon could not get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale.<br />What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles. This is an absorbing read and one of the great stories in mountaineering literature.

6303257801|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on &quot;Million Dollar Movie&quot;. I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as &quot;Kong&quot;, and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious &quot;Kong&quot;.<br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious &quot;Kong&quot; is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of &quot;Kong&quot;. Notwithstanding the fact that &quot;Kong&quot; has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls &quot;King Kong&quot; and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. Watch both the black and white original, as well as the later colorized version. I am sure that you will agree with me that, while the colorized version is a curiosity to be viewed, when available, the black and white original is the way to go. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!he black and white original, as well as the later colorized version.

B00006JDVV|4.0|If you are a hard-core fantasy fan, you should watch this movie. However, be aware that while the movie has its good points, it also has plot holes that you will have to disregard.<br />This movie is essentially a B-movie which relies strongly on its special effects. The DVD has a couple of extras well worth watching that shows how some of the numerous special effects were accomplished. I was very fascinated by how the fire effects were created and combined with the digital dragons. The dragons themselves I found to be quite believable. For example, the big male dragon had holes in his wings, which you could believe would happen during fights, landings, mating, etc.<br />The acting is surprisingly good as well. Though the lead actors did some pretty dumb things, a characteristic of many movies of this type, their reactions were reasonably plausible and appropriately self-serving in a post apocalyptic world.<br />There were a few things that were partially explained and left more confusion than clarity in this movie. There was mention of nuclear attacks against the dragons, with the statement that the attacks failed without giving a reason why. I'm guessing the reason was that the dragons were already too wide spread and breeding too quickly, but that wasn't explained. Another thing that was confusing was how the numerous and over-armed militaries of the world were unable to put up a better fight. Given that most larger militaries are heavily equipped with anti-armor weaponry which should have been more than capable of killing a dragon, there should have been a better fight, particularly in the early days of the fight when there would have been few dragons.<br />The most disturbing lack of plausibility was that there was only one male dragon. For anyone that knows anything about reptiles and amphibians, you know that it is known for some animals to change sex if there is a shortage. Since nature is quite wonderful at finding alternative paths, I have to believe that there is provision for replacement of the male dragon that would not involve the male dragon, given that he would not know in advance that he needed to be replaced. Having one male dragon was another plot weakness that perhaps is to be exploited for a potential sequel.<br />In spite of the flaws in the plot, I still enjoyed the movie for the action. I would definitely watch it again, and think that any fan of dragon movies would find this one to be worthy of watching and owning. Just don't forget to leave logic at the door.there is provision for replacement of the male dragon that would not involve the male dragon, given that he would not know in advance that he needed to be replaced.

B00007L4LL|3.0|Hands down, this romantic comedy is a Hugh Jackman vehicle, as he totally steals the show from Meg Ryan. Jackman plays the role of the Duke of Albany, Leopold Mountbatten, an English nobleman visiting his uncle in New York in 1876. At his uncle's behest, Leopold is to find a rich socialite to marry, so that he may replenish the family's depleted coffers.<br />While at a ball in his uncle's New York house, awash with rich and eager heiresses, he notices a stranger who had earlier caught his attention. He follows the stranger and finds himself in the year 2001, as he falls through a portal in time. Landing in the apartment of Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), the stranger whom he had followed, he soon meets Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's former girlfriend of four years and a modern day everywoman. Let the games begin.<br />What follows is nothing earth shattering. In fact, it is pretty predictable. Leopold and Kate fall in love, though the big question is why, as there is nothing to suggest why they should. Meg Ryan does her usual Meg Ryan thing, though she is starting to get a bit little long in the tooth to be playing the brash, cutesy ingenue. She is, in fact, getting to be quite tiresome in these sorts of roles, as she plays them all exactly the same, making them virtually indistinguishable one from the other. She needs to extend her range, before her adoring public stops adoring her.<br />Jackman, however, does a star turn with his gently effective and ingratiating portrayal of Leopold. He is simply sensational. Charming, handsome, and warm, with a light British accent that rings true, he is totally believable as a chivalrous gent from another time. Jackman totally upstages Ryan without meaning to do so. It is a good thing that he does. Were he not to have done so, the film would most likely have totally tanked. Clearly, Hugh Jackman is big time, leading man material.<br />Liev Schreiber is unappealing as the film's erstwhile time traveler and Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke. Moreover, it is  not believable that Stuart and Kate would ever have dated, much less have been lovers for four years, as there is no chemistry between them. Still, it is more believable than the relationship which blossoms between Leopold and Kate. The happy ending also makes Stuart's and Kate's former relationship somewhat distasteful, if not downright incestuous, in retrospect.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is fine with an excellent performance by Breckin Meyer in the role of Charlie McKay, Kate's somewhat goofy, but lovable, cute, younger brother. Bradley Whitford of West Wing fame also gives a winning performance as J.J. Camden, Kate's smarmy boss, who ultimately has second thoughts about what constitutes professional behavior and lets the cream rise to the top, so to speak.<br />All in all, this is a moderately entertaining film, all but forgettable, but for the memorable performance of Hugh Jackman.art Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke.

B00004XONN|4.0|I'm not that big a fan of Radiohead, but I have heard all of their work and I even bought this CD. It is IMO much more complete and sophisticated than their other albums.<br />That said, I got this CD at about the same time that I started listening to ambient and electronica. I discovered a world of good AND innovative music. Just because some artists don't have money to advertise everywhere doesn't mean they aren't 1000 times better than anything you have ever heard.<BR>If you think Kid A is the greatest CD ever you need to explore the music scene, you are missing out.
B00005MM67|3.0|This is essentially a buddy movie clothed in mountaineering garb. It is a story about two climbers: one, a Seattle based attorney, the other, a physics instructor. They are a mismatched pair of friends who are brought together because of their love for climbing. The story line is about the ultimate test that their friendship endures while high on K2, the second highest mountain in the world but the most perilous to climb.<br /><br />The rock climbing scenes that take place in the first fifteen minutes of the movie are terrific to watch, even though they may not be technically correct. After all, it's a movie, not a documentary. The scenery is spectacular and the cinematography is excellent.<br /><br />These friends decide to grab an opportunity to climb K2 with an expedition that lost two of its team members to an avalanche on Denali. The attorney has no problem going to K2, but the physics instructor leaves behind his weeping wife and child. Yet his friendship with the attorney and his own desire to climb K2 compel him to leave his distraught family.<br /><br />There are a number of scenes in the movie that seem to be taken from real life. While on expedition to K2, the porters leave them stranded, refusing to go any further on the mountain, as they have portents of doom. They also want more money. One scene has the attorney burning rupees in defiance of the porters' strike. World class mountaineer Jim Wickwire did the same thing, when he climbed K2, and under similar circumstances.<br /><br />In another scene, a number of climbers fall into a crevasse only to be saved at the last minute by the physics instructor, as he digs his ice axes in and grips the road. The film also include a scene that shows the expedition leader succumbing to high altitude sickness, necessitating his descent of K2 as soon as possible.<br /><br />Animosity on the mountain between the climbing leader and the attorney over who will be part of the first summit team is also reminiscent of real life expeditions. It is here that the attorney's friendship with the physics instructor becomes strained, as he lays claim to be on the first summit team and does not include his friend, even though they had been climbing partners for ten years. So much for the brotherhood of the rope.<br /><br />After the first summit team is finished off by the mountain, the two friends summit, but on the descent the physics instructor falls and is seriously injured, breaking his leg. As you can imagine, this is really bad news, as it is tantamount to a death sentence, especially when you are in the death zone and without oxygen.<br /><br />Since this is a buddy movie, the attorney comes up with a plan to get his friend down K2. I won't tell you what it is, but I will give you a hint. The plan used is to be found in Joe Simpson's book \\"Touching the Void\\".<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the movie is dedicated to two mountaineers of renown: Seattle attorney, Jim Wickwire, and physicist, Lou Reichardt, both of whom were among the first Americans to summit K2 in 1978. This film seems to be loosely based upon some of their mountaineering exploits. It is a moderately enjoyable film that should appeal to armchair climbing enthusiasts everywhere.life expeditions.

6305949972|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's Best By Far!! This is my favorite movie of all time!!! The Music is great also. I love all of tim burton's movies!!(with the exception of (\\"Mars Attacks\\" and \\"Planet of the Apes\\" wich are bolth a horrible disgrace to such a talented director)It's not childish at all it is great for all ages!!<br />  The features are just as good Burton's debut \\"Vincent\\" is a great short film that is along the lines of The Nightmare Before Christmas(anamation wise). It is about an 8 year old boy who dreams of being like Vincent Price......<br />  I recomend this to anyone in the world, I think no matter what kind of movies you like you could LOVE this one!!!!
B00005YXZH|1.0|I purchased this CD solely on the strength of reviews here, and actually listened to it twice.  Like some previous reviewers here, I must say I just don't get it either!  How many seem think this band is a modern day musical marvel is beyond me!  The songs are too plain, uninspired, and most certainly not well written.  In fact, they are downright boring and un-memorable.  But, considering how today's youth arguably has [worse] music to listen to than previous generations, it doesn't surprise me that they would like this Wilco release.  Music is getting worse and worse these days.
B000024D4R|4.0|This review is in response to a reviewer who said that because Waters adresses the shortcomings of capitalism on Animals he is making a point that is the reverse of the point that Orwell makes in Animal Farm and other works. This is just not true. Animal Farm and 1984 have been used by many on the right and the left to attack Soviet Communism, which Orwell was in part attacking, but few know that Orwell was a socialist. This fact is in any biography of Orwell but it is somehow little known or just plain ignored. He even wrote of the benifits of socialism over capitalism in some of his political essays. Orwell condemned totalitarianism whether it was on the right or the left. In fact one of the reasons that Orwell was so good at attacking the failings of socialism was because it was the system that he believed in. Don't let Orwell be hijacked by the incompetent rulers of the right or the left. He was criticising totalitarianism in all of its forms. By the way this is an excellent album.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is great stuff!  Quite 'hook laden' and catchy, hummable tunes with a rawness about it that 'sucks you in'.  The songs are memorable, and most importantly, there is an effortless feeling I get when I listen to these dudes.  The songs seem from the heart and not contrived, and there is a simplicity and 'back to basics' approach that is appreciated by certain demographic segments of the rock community.  'Is This It', and the venerable Aussie band THE CHURCH, with their release 'After Everything Now This', are the the 2 best releases of 2002 in my opinion.
0060005424|5.0|I was surprised that Lireal started out Sabriel-less. I was really hoping for a Sabriel repraisal... despite the intital disappointment, I got [pulled] into the world of Nix again and finished the book within days. Lireal's character is slightly less (for lack of a better word) strong than Sabriel's character, a lot [weaker], yet just as likeable.<br />Lireal is a daughter of the Clayr, a group of women who are like a cult of Sister Cleos (hah hah...?). Seriously, they're basically all psychic and can see bits and pieces of the future. They're all blonde and light-eyed beauties who can be absent-minded, too (future events can confuse them with the present). Lireal, on the other hand, is nothing like her kin. She is dark-haired, dark-eyed, and pale-skinned. She feels alienated. I'm sure many readers will and did sympathsize with her feelings of being left out and different. She doesn't even have the Sight (the psychic abilities) and resigns herself to working in the library, where she finds her destiny...<br />All the characters from the first book make an appearance (I don't remember about Kerrigor, though) and its kind of fascinating to see how they've grown and changed. I particularly enjoyed the new character, the Disreputable Dog.<br />On a final note, Nix has this uncanny ability to make you involved with the characters. There's plenty of action and humor. I'm wondering, though, if there might be a romance for Lireal in the third book...
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is one of my favorite 2 CD's of 2002 (the other being 'After Everything Now This' by the venerable Aussie band THE CHURCH).  The pieces are memorable, haunting, evocative, melancholy at times, and just permeate your being while listening.  I can't listen to this in my car, because it makes me want to shut my eyes and drift off to faraway places.  So when I want to feel soothed and relaxed, I listen to this at home on headphones or my high end Magneplanar ... speakers, and I am blown away and transported right into a lucid dream!  Highly recommended (as is The Church's disc)!!!
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was 12 and I remember loving it enough to read it again. When Lireal (the sequel) came out, I  read Sabriel again (age 17 now). The novel was still the fresh, exciting, and enthralling book I first read five years ago!<br />Garth Nix is simply masterful in creating the world Sabriel lives in - a seemingly modern, timeless country complete with cars and ordinary people right next to an old-world, magic-filled country filled with monsters, undead, and villages. You actually believe that these places can exist! Nix's many details and background information don't overwhelm the main story of Sabriel's hero's journey, either.<br />I wish this book could be made into a movie, a la Lord of the Rings. Although Nix is not on the same scale as Tolkien, the details and story are still perfect for the silver screen. The whole time I was reading this novel, I imagined the beautiful imagery in the style of Japanese fantasy video game images (leaning towards Square's style) and the stark realism of movies. Did that make sense...?<br />Just read it! If you don't, you're really missing out.
B00004XONN|5.0|This, and THE CHURCH 'After Everything Now This', are my 2 favorite CD's of the new millenium so far.  'Kid A' is a very atmospheric, hauntingly beautiful release that has the ability to affect and soothe you.  The music ebbs and flows into your consciousness, and is an example of atmospherics at its best.  The pieces are very well written, and a good example of thematic segments that meander into various experimental alleyways!  If you like good, well written atmospheric, layered music, check out 'After Everything Now This' by the legendary Aussie band, THE CHURCH.  It is my other fave CD of the past few years, and delivers in spades if you're into atmospheric, psychedelic alt-rock.  Cheers/Beers!
B000002J6H|5.0|After 32 years of hearing the standards from this record, I've finally got round to buying it. Absolutely wonderful set. I've always thought of Stills as a good tunesmith and guitarist, and only just realised that the Hammond B3 work was all his as well.<BR>Add the dual guitar work with Eric Clapton and its one of the really great CDs that has stood the test of time. Please remove the quite ridiculous Amazon.com provided review, which was clearly written by a buffoon.<BR>Buy it!!
B00005UW7V|5.0|I don't understand why this movie was so unfairly treated by the critics.  Sure, at first I was turned off by the names Kubrick and Osment.  But after finally watching this film, it definitely is one of the best I have ever seen.  Great performances, great effects, great score.  No, there isn't a happy fairy-tale ending here, but the ending, I think, is perfect for the film.  I believe that in the future this one will be considered a classic.
0783228317|4.0|Terry Gilliam wants to get us into total delirium, an absolutely limitless trip into acid, ether and other drugs, in Las Vegas, the city of all extremes and unreasonable excesses. He succeeds in that direction perfectly by accumulating junk and all other types of objects you may think of in luxurious and maybe luxuriant hotel suites. He also uses a lot of car chasing, car reckless driving, car violence, brutality and speed to get us into an ever-rolling and whirling and tumbling vision of the world. He does not hesitate in running after violence, unjustified most of the time, delirious the rest of the time, that attacks people, objects, buildings, and anything he may comme across. He wants to give us a vision of what he calls acid culture, that extreme psychedelic culture that developped from the mid 60s to the mid 70s last century, with the Vietnam War in the background, with Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew superimposed onto the main pictures, thanks to TV news programs. We are in an ever erupting adventure that really leads nowhere except into the depth of two minds that are no longer themselves but are entirely manipulated by the drugs and other substances they take as their basic food. It is a recent (1998) revival of films of the period itself that had probably more force, i.e. Fritz the Cat, Zabriskie Point, among a few others. But this recent film is also a sign that we are going back to that old period because our own times are out of joint and need some hallucinatary view to cope with a reality that is unthinkably thick and dense.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan
B00003A9QL|5.0|This CD is a must-have for Metallica lovers. I know people who don't like it because of the orchestra; I myself am not a huge fan of classical music, but the heavy metal fused with the orchestra makes a very pleasing combo on this work. In fact, some of the songs I heard for the first time ever on this CD, and then when I hear the original on the radio I think, &quot;That's rather boring.&quot; True Metallica aficionadoes will find this an &quot;essential&quot; CD for their collections.
0451207521|5.0|After participating in one failed operation, Major Felicite Clairet of the Special Operations Executive returns to France to blow up a heavily-guarded telephone exchange just before the allied invasion in June, 1944. The team she leads will impersonate a crew of cleaning ladies in order to gain access to the building.<br />It is possible to view the story as being about a duel between the strong-willed Felicity and a cruel, fanatical German Army officer named Major Dieter Franck. Even though we know the British wonder woman will probably defeat the German superman, there is still enough suspense to keep us interested until the outcome is certain.<br />Follett is a trained journalist who is an excellent writer. He is also a skilled storyteller and he seems to be at his best when spinning yarns about World War II.<br />The book was supposedly inspired by the example of Pearl Witherington, a British courier who was recommended for a Military Cross for her wartime exploits.
B000001FYZ|5.0|The Scorpions have always impressed me... in my opinion anything they have ever done has been incredible.  This album is the best of them all... Everything about it screams rock and roll... Matthias Jabs is simply killer on Restless Nights espescially... he just tears it up! This is proof that he is simply the best guitarist to ever grace this planet... but I digress.... the point is this album is wonderful... not to mention it has the famous ballads &quot;Wind of Change&quot; and &quot;Send Me An Angel&quot;.  They really outdid themselves on this album... I can honestly say there is no song that I didn't like. A must for any Scorpions fan...  or someone who wants to experience some of the best rock and roll out there.
B000066NW0|3.0|While Avril may have an amazing voice, and some OK lyrics, she is not punk; maybe emo (emotional punk), but definetetly no punk as she tries to say.  Her first two singles were in fact very pop-like, and it wasn't until her &quot;I'm With You&quot; that I even considerded giving this a chance.  It is an average album, as the songs are more geared towards a younger more audience, probably one that is only at the begining stage of asserting one's identity.  Though she did write her own songs and that deserves credit.  Hopefully her next album will be a lot better.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Catchy music and a great voice. Period. (Chip on the shoulder gets old, though.)<br />Why is this \\"image\\" thing such a big deal? I'm not thrilled that another young woman in the music industry is sexualizing herself, but she's vehement that she's comfortable sporting hooker-chic. Personally, I think she looks ridiculous, but if we judge her...well, she'll just sing another song about \\"keepin' it real\\".
1573228737|5.0|Breath taking story in which a young woman plays into the hands of love. This enrapturing tale is one for those of modern times. Great read, barely able to put it down as it's simply beautiful. Enjoy.
0802130208|5.0|This is truly a great book. Humor is much underrated in our lives. The ability to laugh at our selves is important. This is not a book of flowery words. This is a humorously philosophical look at our selves and our condition not a didactic diatribe. For that it deserves serious consideration and respect.<br />Ignatius J. Reilly is not a hero. He is an exaggeration. He is both rigorously, uncompromisingly correct and absurdly tragic at the same time. We have met the enemy and he is us. <br />This book, with its protagonist so heroically intellectual and pathetically tragic, is an exaggerated mirror of our own situation in life. In addition Ignatius is so extremely and precisely developed in his own philosophy, no one could possibly understand him. In truth we are all just as unique as Ignatius J. Riley is but we rarely notice our uniqueness or come to grips with our isolation. We are all misunderstood and frustrated with our inability to express ourselves and our inability to pursuade others of what we know is right.<br />This is not a book about heroes with a happy ending. There is no didactic, simple message here about good vs. evil. Those people, who read this book and reject it because they don't like the characters, fail to see the point, that we are all a crazy mixed up mess of good and bad. There can be no simple message in the mess. We are after all... human, we are fallible. We are stupid about some things, smart about others. We succeed and we fail. We are all industrious and lazy to some degree. We are locked into this absurd existence, but to be human and aware and alive is to endure our absurdity with glee and joy of life wherever we can get it even if it's just a guilty hotdog, to laugh at it all. Because we are all part of it, and if we could stand back and look at it from the outside, we would see it is wonderful.<br />This is a book for beatniks during the rightwing, conformist '50s. A book for anyone who has ever known they were right about something despite being a minority of one in a crowd of thousands of idiots. A book for flawed people who can still be amused by their flaws. A book for outsiders who have retained their dignity in dirty clothes.<br />So just read it and take it for what it is. Enjoy the crazies and clowns while you still can.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Besides being very entertaining music, System of a Down's latest album is filled with messages about political issues as well as everyday issues such as prostitution and drugs.  This shows, again, that the band has more than tremendous musical talent, they have BRAINS! this cd is filled with unbelievably intelligent songs with very (as corny as it sounds) catchy tunes that i found myself humming and singing the day after i had listened to them for the first time.  Serj's great singing adds a slight comicality to the songs as well as just great singing.  I recommend this album, as a huge System of a Down fan, to any other System of a Down fans.  It is overall a fantastic album.

B00012FXAE|5.0|When a sequel is so many times better than the original, it's hard to believe that the first was so exciting and pioneering. James Cameron, fresh from his groundbreaking Terminator, proves he was no one-hit wonder by maintaining the perfect balance of action, suspense and sub-text.<br /><br />Fifty seven years after a lone Xenomorph killed everyone on the Nostromo, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) awakes in a space station orbiting earth. Happy news does not greet her. Her only child has died an old lady and she has no life left to get back to. Plus, she is having disturbing nightmares and is facing charges of willful destruction of private property, which seems ludicrous when you consider that she destroyed the Nostromo before any of the \\"suits\\" were born.<br /><br />Back on LV426, a family has stumbled upon the same mysterious spacecraft that John Hurt ventured into in Alien. And sure as sugar, the dad doesn't leave until a face-hugger is, well...hugging his face. Before you know it, the Company - actually called Weyland-Yutani - has lost contact with the entire colony on LV426 and Ripley is enrolled to help a bunch of Marines deal with the problem.<br /><br />Many Vietnam subtexts are played out as well as a more gentle subplot, in which Ripley becomes a surrogate mother to Newt (Carrie Henn), an orphaned child, who has more guts and initiative than the entire platoon put together. Bill Paxton plays Hudson, the wimpiest but most likable Marine ever in movies. Lance Henriksen is Bishop, an android who tries to convince Ripley that he is not like the deceitful and perverted Ian Holm from the original. Michael Biehn is Hicks the reluctant corporal who takes charge of the futile mission after the first, scarifying attack by the Xenomorph.<br /><br />Cameron assaults us with so many shocks and stingers and keeps us on the edge of our seats for well over two hours. At one point Hudson says, \\"They're comin' outta the goddamn walls\\"- you better believe it! We never know where, or when, another alien will strike from the damp darkness and drag away a hapless Marine. And you can't shoot these monsters close-up because they'll spray acid blood all over you.<br /><br />Backing up the claustrophobic, nerve-wracking mayhem is James Horner's Academy Award nominated score, which is haunting and cold and thundering and bombastic. This is definitely not a film for the nervous, or those with a pacemaker. Rapid fire editing, tense close-ups and an extremely oppressive atmosphere, reeking of death, take over the movie.<br /><br />The final showdown with the massive, no-nonsense - but still quite feminine - Alien Queen is one of the best ever filmed. To think that Ridley Scott provoked so much tension and dread from just one is strange. When they are all over you, it makes for a superior sequel.<br /><br />The Director's Cut of Aliens is now considered the official so skip the shorter theatrical one.<br /><br />If the movie doesn't scare you, Weaver's Afro will. And stay the hell away from AVP!where, or when, another alien will strike from the damp darkness and drag away a hapless Marine.

6305090564|2.0|Stephen Sommer knows how to make a dumb b-movie. His career has been full of them. His early movies were mainly family entertainment, but for his first R-rated feature he delivers a monster movie on a cruise ship that could have been spectacular, but isn't.<br /><br />The story has boat-for-hire Captain Treat Williams (imagine Colin Farrell's dad) drive a bunch of mercenary goons out to a rendezvous with the Argonautica luxury ship in the South China Sea. The goons plan to loot the ship and sink it, but when they hop aboard they find it abandoned with all lifeboats intact. The presence of blood and undigested skeletons doesn't alert them to the fact that a hungry sea monster has taken over.<br /><br />What disappoints the most about Deep Rising is that ALL of the creature and gore effects are in late-90s quality CGI. Why even hire Rob Bottin, known for his stunning effects on The Thing, RoboCop, and Total Recall, to create the monster if you're not even going to feature a single practical effects shot? The fact that Dreamquest Images and Industrial Light and Magic handled the CGI really surprises me as they are not that good, even by 1998 standards.<br /><br />It is made watchable by a few decent kills, a macabre attitude, an above average Jerry Goldsmith score, and the presence of the beautiful Famke Janssen (who is full of yum, yum, yum). Though the dialogue is repetitive, some of the goons are woefully miscast (especially Jason Flemyng), and almost every scene takes place in 'flooded grey room with pipes'.<br /><br />Deep Rising is enjoyable trash for a night of non-cerebral movie-watching and nothing more.<br /><br />The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and non-anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen and is a port of the ancient laserdisc.
B00006F2TV|3.0|Wait what?!?!?! What was this? Where was the charcater development? (and showing how Peter changes into Spider-Man dosesn't count as character development.) Where's the good action scenes? (And Spider-Man tying bad guys up in a giant web does not qualify as a good action scene.) Where is the drama and emotion? And what in the hell was up with the script??? What is with all those cheesy lines??? One sentance to sum up all of these questions--THE MOVIE WAS TOO LIGHT HEARTED, LITTLE-KIDDISH, AND \\"FAMILY SAFE\\"!!!!!!!! <br />I walked into this movie opening night with high hopes of a kick ass superhero film full of action and good acting (based on what I saw in the previews).  But what I got was Spider-Man going through typical high-school problems, action scenes consisting of saving a woman's baby from a burning building and performing matrix-like moves to dodge homing-razors, stupid moments that were supposed to be funny but just fell flat such as Peter making stupid hand gestures trying to figure out how to use his web, and most of all--some of the CHEESIEST lines ever used in a superhero movie.  Here is some of thse lines that just make me wanna puke:<br />1. Spider-Man to Macho Man Randy Savage during a wrestling match:<BR>-Spider-Man-- \\"That's a cute outfit. Did your husband get it for you?\\"<br />2. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin squaring off:<BR>-Goblin-- \\"Are you in or are you out?\\"<BR>-Spider-Man-- \\"it's you who's out, Gobbie, out of your mind!\\"<br />3. Spider-Man to Mary Jane after rescuing her and swinging her accross the city to the top of a building:<BR>-Spider-Man-- \\"Well, beats taking the subway, haha.\\"<br />--AND THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THAT THIS MOVIE WAS INTENDED TO BE FOR LITTLE KIDS--<BR>4.

Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!\\"<br />I'm sorry, but that kind of talk does not deserve to be in a superhero action movie, but instead in a little-kids superhero movie. This movie was not at all what I expected it to be. It was just way too light-hearted for my liking. <br />Now the movie did have some good action scsnes and a few good parts. Willem Dafoe did a great job as the \\"green goblin\\". And the special edition DVD made the movie worth buying. But all-in-all, if you are looking for a top-notch, action packed, dramatic superhero movie, Spider-Man definately does NOT deliver. Watch Batman, Blade, The Hulk, or even X-Men.<br />\\"SPIDER-MAN\\" runs for about 2 hours. It is rated PG-13 for light cartoonish action violence. Really could have been rated PG--it is safe for any age really. Parents do not have to worry about letting their little kids watch this movie.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam ... Really, that's all that needs to be said in this day and age.  They have withstood the test of time.  Not to mention all the other Seattle bands and continue to grow as people and musicians.  Riot Act is not my favorite Pearl Jam record, but it is no doubt their best effort.  They keep getting better at playing, writing, recording and sharing.<br />Can't Keep - A brilliant opener, not flashy but a perfect introduction into the next track.<br />Save You - The defining rock song on the album.<br />Love Boat Captain - \\"Lost 9 friends we'll never know, 2 years ago today.\\"  PJ fans will know what this line references.  Imortalizing those fans.<br />Crop Duster - References several songs from the past records.  Very subtle.<br />Ghost - Haunting tune.<br />I Am Mine - 1st single, a Vedder penned song about life and death.<br />Thumbing My Way - Another Vedder penned song that I've heard people call, \\"Their best song ever.\\"<br />You Are - Crafty Matt Cameron's 1st addition to the album.<br />Get Right - Cameron's 2nd song on the album.  Intense!<br />Green Disease - This song is \\"Ramonesque\\".<br />Help Help - Obviously Beatles inspired.<br />Bushleaguer - Any Bush-unsupporter will enjoy this one. Music - Gossard/Lyrics - Vedder.<br />1/2 Full - great song that moves record towards a close.<br />ARC - Vocally amazing...<br />All Or None - GREAT CLOSER!<br />To sum it up, best effort yet.  It takes several listens before you really enjoy it.  Unlike Ten, which grabs you right away.  I was listening to \\"10\\" today and every single song is 4/4 (four beats per measure)...It was annoying.  They have gotten so much better and have expanded to other time signatures.  Records like that are hard to listen to sometimes.  They are the best records in the end, though.  Thanks for reading.<br />-damon
0790730960|5.0|In my opinion, the Batman series just goes downhill every movie. BATMAN was just too good. BATMAN RETURNS was excellent, but not was good as the first. BATMAN FOREVER got worse than the second. And BATMAN & ROBIN was just the worst out of them all. But sticking with Batman Returns, it was an awesome movie. <br />It still was directed by Tim Burton which was why Batman Returns was the last really good Batman movie. He stuck with the gothic, dark look and kept Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight, as it should have continued with. The villains in this movie are The Penguin (played great by Danny DeVito), The Catwoman (played acceptionaly well by Michelle Pheifer) and Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Now Max Shreck was definatly not one of the best aspects of the movie but I disagree with some people saying that the movie could have done without him. It is hard to explain but Max Shreck did complete a big gap in the movie. <br />The plot was fairly simple, more complicated than the first, but still played simple. The Penguin wants to become a citizen of Gotham City with the help of Max Shreck. He does this out of the Penguin's black mail threat to expose to the world that Max's power plant produces toxic waste and that he killed his partner. So whle he is becoming a citizen, Max brings on the idea of The Penguin running for mayor. The plot gets simple from there, the Penguin wins over the people but on the inside, he is still evil and is planning a crime to slaughter the first born of every family because he was the first born and because he looked different, his parents abandoned him. <br />And while this is all happeneing, Selena Kyle (Catwoman) is getting revenge against Max for killing her when she found out about the evil plans of Max's new power plant. But just like a cat, Selena has 9 lives. So she comes back to life and joins forces with The Penguin to kill Batman while still planning revenge on Max. <br />So The movie turns into this huge triangle of revenge. The Penguin wants to kill the first born children, Catwoman wants to kill Max, and Max wants to keep everyone from knowing about his evil secrets. And all three of them want to [terminate] Batman. This movie is definatly the second best in the BATMAN series. A great and worthy buy.<br />\\"Batman Returns\\" runs for about 2 hours. It is rated PG-13 for some scenes of strong violence and some language
0446677450|5.0|This book presents many interesting ideas and facts on how the rich do things differently than most.  The one downfall is that it doesn't really explain how to accomplish the things the rich do, but it does provide a list of good books that take care of the explinations.  As a college student this book will hopefully get me off on the right foot prior to graduation and it is a must read for everyone.  We can all benefit from this at least a little!
0790729652|5.0|Tim Burton's BATMAN was a masterpiece. The way he took the legendary comic-book character and brought him to life was just excellent.  The set peices he used and te dark, gloomy, and gothic atmosphere is perfect for the Batman story. No one could have done a better job.<br />Everyone knows the story behind Batman: Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered right in front of him and years later, he became Batman to stop crime and hopefully seek revenge on his parent's killer.<br />In Tim Burton's version of BATMAN, Batman (Bruce Wayne, played by Michael Keaton) is a myth in Gotham City and described as not human. They say he can't be killed, drinks blood, and are not sure, if he exists, if he is good or bad.<br />Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) works for a gang of criminals.  But all hell breaks loose when he is set up for a heist at Axis Chemicals by his boss. The police bust them and the chemical plant is destroyed.  Of course, Batman shows up and has a showdown with Napier which ends with Batman accidently dropping him into a pool of toxic chemicals.  Now Batman is wanted for the murder of Jack Napier.<br />Napier is presumed dead, but somehow survives with a disfigured and discolored face. He becomes The Joker.  He takes charge of the gang and becomes Batman's arch enemy.  Joker then wrecks havoc on Gotham creating toxic products for people so after they use them, they die, but with a smile on their face.  He also is set on wooing Bruce's love interest, Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger).  Batman is set to do battle with The Joker and his gang of thugs, but the city does not know weather to think of Batman as a friend or an enemy.<br />Batman is definatly the best hero. But warning to those who have not seen it:  This is no Superman movie or Spider-Man movie.  It's not light-hearted and fun for the whole family.  It's very dark, violent, and action-packed. More of a movie for fans of Batman and action movie fans. BATMAN will remain my all time favorite movie for a long time.<br />\\"BATMAN\\" runs for about 2 hours.

0684800713|4.0|The Sun also Rises, a book that you either are going to love or hate, there is simply no middle ground.  Like all other classic examples of a Hemingway novel, you have the unreliable narrator who is simply trying to go about his life living in the now, but realizing better than anyone what is the future.  Hemingway, as in many of his stories, is exploiting the lives of the \\"lost generation\\".  The story has no definite beginning or ending, and is almost just an excerpt from Jake's life (main character and narrator).  Hemingway expresses just how \\"lost\\" this generation is by their lack of any true genuine feelings.  In true actuallity the only time they ever truly express real feelings is usually at the end of a bottle, and most likely not the first one ither.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story because of the relationships that are discribed throughout it.  It shows that a group of people who share interests and act civil towards eachother, may not be friends.  And just how thin their friendship can be when one falls from social grace.  By far though the greatest aspect of this story is the relationship shared between Jake and Lady Bret.  One of the only stories where I enjoyed finding symbolism, this relationship goes on more ups and downs than Mr. Toads wild ride.  Although both express their love for eachother, they also state how a relationship could never work out between them.  Mainly due to the lack of \\"manhood\\" left in Jakes life.  Overall this is no story of a happy bunch of friends, there will be no Ya-Ya sisterhood found here.  This novel is about real relationships formed by men, their boundries, and what it means to be a \\"lost generation\\".
0790731002|4.0|No doubt about it, the BATMAN series is getting worse as it goes down the line. The first two were great. The first one was better than the second, but now the second is far better than the thrid. It is mostly because the BATMAN series is basicly starting over from scratch. A new Batman, a new director, and a very different and irritating scenery. First: the new Batman/Bruce Wayne played by Val Kilmer. The chemistry just isn't good at all. And a lot of people say it was because it just takes to much getting used to after Keaton's great portrayal as the original Batman, but I can assure you, there is nothing to get used to. Val Kilmer is not good as Batman. The new director Joel Schumacher, is a somewhat good director in movies like THE CLIENT and the newer movie BAD COMPANY but definatly not cut out to direct a Batman movie. And the scenery just [stunk]. It went from the really dark and gothic feeling that Batman is supposed to be to a lighter, neon color filled Gotham Ciity. It's like a little kid's Batman movie. The thing that really saved this movie was Tommy Lee Jones's awesome performance as Two-Face. He was great at bringing the schitzophrenic character to life. And even Jim Carrey gave a surprising perfromance as The Riddler who he was pretty much born to play. The plot was ok to a certain degree. More com;licated than the first two were. And now the moment everyone waited for has arrived. ROBIN is now part of the Batman cast. Everyone knew it was going to happen. And I wished it would have happened also to continue the Batman series. But it was very unfortunate that they introduced him in this kind of a Batman movie. But the movie over all was good. Overlooking the bad Batman, director, and scenery, the movie was still fun and worth buying to add to the Batman collection. I mean it's still Batman and Batman is still the best superhero so you can't go wrong with any Batman movie.<br />\\"Batman Forever\\" runs for 2 hours. It is rated PG-13 for some strong violence and very brief sexuality.
B000002UAU|5.0|Surely more words have been spewed on this disc than on any other Beatles recording.  I personally think &quot;Revolver&quot; is the Beatles' masterpiece, but every Beatles album deserves a five-star rating.  So I'm giving &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; its five stars and asking a question- where's George???<br />If you trace George Harrison's contributions to successive Beatles albums, you'll notice the old boy gets better at songwriting.  He also gets more space per album, &quot;Revolver&quot; features three of his best songs.  Then along comes &quot;Pepper&quot; with only one- &quot;Within You, Without You&quot;.  Possibly the most dated sounding song on the entire &quot;Pepper&quot; album.  <br />I realize that &quot;Only a Northern Song&quot; was recorded during the &quot;Pepper&quot; sessions- one of George's weakest numbers.  It didn't make the cut.  What happened to George during 1966-67?  Did Indian music really take up all of his musical thoughts and creativity?<br />George came back strong with the &quot;White Album&quot;.  He wrote great tunes for the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions and wrote the best songs on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  I still find it puzzling that during that long stretch of time, roughly six months, when &quot;Pepper&quot; was &quot;in preparation&quot; George couldn't come up with some great stuff?!?
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is fantastic! The Comte is not the moral character in this movie. He stands for legalism and Vianne is someone who wants to help others and yet she is cursed by her mother's actions. The true moral character is the young priest who is forced to give sermons written by the Comte. <BR>The Chocolate is the main character and it brings comfort to others in an almost magical way.<BR>The soundtrack is wonderful. The scenery is exotic. My wife and I love this movie and you will too!
0743464117|5.0|I picked up this book at accompany the series on HBO, and to my delight, it was even better. More in-depth, provocative and emotional, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in WW2 and people who would enjoy a book about comradeship. This book was awe-inspiring and a delight to read.  It's unfortunate that Stephen Ambrose has died; I have enjoyed this book and will buy others that he has written. This book made me see WW2 in a different way and gives me a new view on the veterans that fought to keep the free world free.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Brainwashed is George Harrison's best album taken as a whole that he ever made. Now, All things Must Pass was a masterpiece, yet it had its filler or weaker songs/and jams. His 70's material has some stellar/masterful moments, but are only required for true fans......others have simply the best of.<BR>His 'comeback' album in 87 (Cloud Nine) was a great cd and a new poppish direction and Brainwashed follows in its style. However, this is no 'sophmore' slump, but a refinement of a musical style/journey that reaches the top of the mountain.  This is simply-beautiful music made by a true artist. Thank you Mr. Harrison (my favorite beatle).
B000069AUI|5.0|What a tremendous album.  I'm new to Coldplay, but I'm loving it.  It's a splendiferous, melodious, completely enthralling disc.  Don't let Politik (track 1) sway your listening one way or the other.  In My Place (track 2) grabs ahold of you and this band does not let go til the end of the disc.  Tremendous.  Highly recommended for old folks like myself that were fans of World Party and The Church.  Excellent!
B00005JKCH|4.0|Almost anyone associated with popular culture in America knows the story and hero of Spiderman; A nerdy teen named Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider thet gives him superhuman abilities.  Ever since the '70s, studios have tried to get the comic book hero made, but many snags in the process kept it from getting released until 2002.  But with this movie they got it right.  They chose a director with a energetic, comic book style in Sam Raimi and the right actors.  The best is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne, he can be creepy when he needs to be and fanatical when he puts on the Green Goblin suit.  Also a near perfect choice to star in the movie was Toby Macguire.  He fits the persona of the relavtively timid Parker, which is what the film needed, a dominate Peter Parker, not a dominate spiderman.<br />The plot is basically the origins of Spiderman, and his first enemy in the Green Goblin.  But before we see them fight on the rooftops of New York, we get to know the characters,  who they are, and why they are important to the story.  Peter Parker is timid and unsure of himself, Norman Osbourne is a selfmade businessman who sees his company slipping from him, Peters' aunt and uncle are loving and want to see Peter succeed but find it hard sometimes to be the role of substitute parents and Mary Jane seems to be a carefree girl but maybe is really in pain because of a verbally abusive father.  We know them, before the action starts.<br />Then when the action starts, it is eye filling, but not always perfect.  Spiderman swinging from building to building on his web is the best effect, along with his battle to save Mary Jane and a lift full of children on one of Manhattans' bridges.  But the scenes where Peter is jumping from rooftop to rooftop when he first finds out he can, looks a little like it's out of the video game, as with some other shots.<br />But overall, this a movie tht is sure to please you.  The core of the film is rock solid, even if thesome of the trappings are a little frayed.  Spiderman does the classic comic book hero justice, and they are many movies that can say they did that, and did it well.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Listen . . . you gotta buy two, that's all there is to it!  You'll wear the first one out.  This disc is tremendous.  I never get tired of MOBY!  He gives of himself everything that's inside.  His unselfish collaborations with other artists are priceless!  18 is soulful, funky, melodious, hypnotic, creative brilliance in a small plastic box.  From start to finish this is, by far, Moby's greatest disc.  From the first song he draws you in and he doesn't let go til the end.  Moby is a GENIUS!
0060523794|5.0|Mr. Gerstner poetry lies in his direct, simple, and precise way to frame the challenges he faced at IBM, on the measures taken by him and his leadership team, as well on a selfless and honest assessment of their results.<br />I'm a manager far away in the corporate ladder from the perch where Mr. Gerstner's perspectives comes from. Regardless, my copy is full of marks that I'm now trying to distill into lessons that I will use to assist me in my leadership challenges.<br />One of the most salient points addressed by Mr. Gerstner is that of belonging. Can someone ever be an insider at a company like IBM? Can someone ever be an insider at a company like mine (less than 200 employees)? It seems to me that, according to Mr. Gerstner, it does not matter; what really matters is to have compentency, passion, commitment, and the wish to win.
B000066NW0|5.0|Wow this is just the best cd ever i love it. you can just put it on and listen to it from begining to end. You can get so into the music and really understand what she is talking about. She puts alot of her heart and soul into every song.Losing grip is a good song with alot of emotion. Complicated is just great you have it stuck in your head all week. Skater boy is cool cause its like a story and you just want to listen to it over and over. i'm with you is a great song also.I just found myself repeating over and over My World, Things ill Never Say, Nobody's Fool well gee all of them. Anything But ordinary is great to you can really relate to it i mean nobody really wants to be ordinary. All of the songs are great im with you and naked were great also.She just has so much emotion an she displays it beautifly.
0375414053|4.0|As a working mom, I found myself intermittently laughing, cringing, weeping, and cheering throughout this novel.  In many ways, I was able to identify with Kate.  However, I, too, was disappointed with the ending (but will not give it away).  Nonworking moms might enjoy it, but the book probably would not have the same impact for them.  I WOULD NOT reccomend it to a new/expectant mom who has not yet decided what to do about her career.

B000063COX|4.0|This is the first album that my favorite band, Iron Maiden, released.  Although the production quality isn'r exactly top notch, there are still of classic songs on here.  People familar with Iron Maiden's later stuff will notice that Bruce Dickinson is not the vocalist, however Paul Dianno is till a decent singer.  His style seems to fit well with the mood of this album.  The album opens with the track Prowler.  As good as it is, I prefer the way it sounds on a few of their live recordings were the sound quality was better.  Another well known song on here is Running Free which is probably my favorite on here, and it continues to be part of their set list after all of these years.  Transylvania is a great instrumental, and probably the best instrumental they have ever done next to Losfer Words.  So overall this isn't a bad place to start if you are getting into Iron Maiden, but I would recommend maybe The Number of the Beast instead.  Still this is a decent album.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" is one of the most anticipated albums of 2002, and all the wait was worth it. Christina delivers 16 songs and 4 interludes on this album and all i can say is that it is AMAZING. <br />Christina finally proves that she is no longer a bubble-gum teeny-bopper. She has one of the BEST voices in the music industry and Christina is definetley going the right way, muscially. This album is more dark and full of emotions than her debut album, I give this album 5 STARS because it is the best album of 2002 in my opinion. <br />\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is full R&B with Lil'Kim rapping in the end. \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" are two stand outs on the album. Christina shows her best vocals and does not over-sing on any song. \\"Fighter\\" is my favourite song becuase it is very rock mixed with R&B. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\", \\"Cruz\\", and \\"Soar\\" are just nice and easy songs, and its great to listen to. \\"Infatuation\\" adds latin vibe to the album and \\"Impossible\\" which is written by Alicia Keys is likeley to be the 3rd single off the album. <BR>\\"Im Ok\\" is about her childhood on how she suffered and was beaten by her father. \\"Keep On Singing My Song\\" is a very STRONG end to the album. In total, there are 20 tracks which is OVER an hour long. <br />Don't let the first single which is \\"Dirrty\\" disgust you, because of the horrifyng video. \\"Dirrty\\" does NOT belong on the album becuase it does not have a meaning to it and it just doesnt sound right with the album. Although \\"Dirrty\\" is a very good dance/club song, becuase you can start dancing when you hear the song. <br />I strongly reccomend this album to ANYBODY who likes R&b/Pop/Soul. Christina DESERVES Grammies for this truly WONDERFUL record. If you dont have this album, Please buy it because it is definetley worth your money. .jaa.
B000062TU1|2.0|I had read the book before I watched the movie, and actually didn't like it.  So I decided, well... maybe the movie and their little cubbie pop star Radcliff could fix the story line and all a bit up so that it would make a tad of sense<BR>I watched the movie, and was utterly dissapointed.  If you have a child with you, its a great movie, but when you really think of all the unrealities Harry Potter and his frends could have taken i.e Ron as a Knight and not dying??  To me, Ron not dying is like in the Lord of the Rings FOTR, except its Boromir, and it made 1000's of times more sense.  <BR>For childish minds and children, great movie.  For people who love happy endings or want a family movie.<BR>For Lord of the Rings realists, and people that like good movies, a dissapointment.

Svefn-g-Englar opens the album (after a pointless, noodling intro) - Falsetto vocals over bowed guitar and keyboards?  What year are we in again, 1975?  Anyway, the next track opens with a string section; I think it's written law that if you put a song with a string section on it on your album, you will appear to have artistic merit.  This went right out my car window.  The arty kids in every local high school will eat this junk up.

His special voice reaches really high and lets the hear on your arms raise!<BR>The first track, Newborn, is a masterpiece.  It begins with the beautiful piano and ends in a tornado of guitar and drums!  The same for Bliss: it begins really soft but than, the guitars are blowing your speakers.  The third track, Space Dementia, can be considered as a piece of art.  And that only with piano and drums!  Track number 8, screenager, is on the contrary real soft and touching.  The lyrics are mostly a bit depressing, but overthougt.  Muse is a young group and I expect more progression as far that is possible after this amazing album.  OSS is with not any doubt the best rock CD in my collection and it is a real step forward for Muse after Showbiz, wich was also good but not more than good.  OOS is a must in the collection of every self respecting rock fan!

1558908382|1.0|GROSSE POINT BLANK is an astonishingly unfunny movie, with shallow characters, unbelievable emotional situations, ill-timed and obvious comedic efforts, and the always unwelcome Dan Aykroyd. Even Alan Arkin is wasted as Cusack's psychatrist (a *hitman* is seeing a *psychatrist*! Get it? Get it?). The hitman-goes-to-his-high-school-reunion concept is mildly interesting-- would've been funnier as a five-minute SNL or MAD TV sketch. Here, the movie grinds along for an hour-and-a-half to no discernible satisfaction whatsoever.<br /><br />John Cusack is always likeable, but isn't believeable *at all* as a professional killer. Minnie Driver's character seems like just a way for Cusack to get his favorite music into the film. I found their \\"relationship\\" to be forced at best, and never believed these two belonged together or that real people, hitmen or not, would behave this way.<br /><br />The violence in the film doesn't jibe with its sarcastic, supposedly comedic tone, adding to the viewer's disorientation. The climactic showdown is noise for the sake of noise, suddenly trying to switch gears into a crime caper and failing miserably.<br /><br />This is a plodding mistake of a film, one I found painful to watch (particularly any scene in which Driver and Cusack engage in \\"witty\\" banter) and even more painful when I think about how the great soundtrack, made up of British punk, new wave, and ska (the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Specials) is utterly wasted. GROSSE POINT BLANK is as bad as I thought it would be when I saw the trailer for it in 1997 and avoided it then. I should've stuck with my first impression.

I now realize as much as I love steve perry &amp; will always enjoy his talents with journey or solo, I can try to enjoy the newer version of journey. If it can make me feel like it did years ago that wonderful rush of excitement just waiting to hear another stomping, pulsing heart beating ,rhythmic ride ,then I'll give it a go. All these long time fans of perry can't all just be dreaming.Steve Perry's contributions can never be undone,&amp; I feel Steve Augeri's heart &amp; soul are in the same place as steve perry ,not forgetting two fabulous reasons they exist Neal &amp; Jon.There will always be a synergy between these guys &amp; I wish you all the best . Journey....still they ride.

B00005U11Z|3.0|Not really a competition between the two singers ,can only rate it by the sound bites on line.Thanks for all the wonderful input from all the reviews I have read .They make me rethink not wanting to listen to journey because of steve perry's awkward departure. I now realize as much as I love steve perry &amp; will always enjoy his talents with journey or solo, I can try to enjoy the newer version of journey. If it can make me feel like it did years ago that wonderful rush of excitement just waiting to hear another stomping, pulsing heart beating ,rhythmic ride ,then I'll give it a go. All these long time fans of perry can't all just be dreaming.Steve Perry's contributions can never be undone,&amp; I feel Steve Augeri's heart &amp; soul are in the same place as steve perry ,not forgetting two fabulous reasons they exist Neal &amp; Jon.There will always be a synergy between these guys &amp; I wish you all the best . Journey....still they ride.
0425180638|1.0|The motto of the Last Precint (&quot;where you go when there is no where left&quot;) may as well be the motto of this rather disappointing excursion into the life of Dr. Kay Scarpetta.  I'm starting to wonder if there is any where left for Cornwell to go.<br />Scarpetta finds herself involved in a heated battle to regain her credibility as a medical examiner after the end of BLACK NOTICE.  Normally this would sound like a wonderful plot to me, however what this book seems to turn into is more of Kay whining and complaining about how her life has turned out.  More time is spent analyzing her thoughts than analyzing evidence and Kay starts to appear powerless and weak by the end of the book.  This is not the Scarpetta I followed doggedly through CRUEL AND UNUSUAL and BODY OF EVIDENCE.  Rather this is a shadow of her former self, one that is by turns pitiful then meloncholy then annoying.<br />I'll pick up the next Scarpetta novel to see where Cornwell takes Kay and Lucy and Marino, but I won't be buying it.  And sadly enough, I won't be expecting to like it either.
B00005JL78|5.0|I have to admit, I checked the DVD cover more than once to make sure that this wasn't a film by David Fincher. The nuance and presentation was quite fine, but not as &quot;up&quot; as one would expect from Spielberg (not counting &quot;A.I.&quot;, which was an homage to Kubrick). Regardless, the film is wrought with intrigue not yet imagined, and some great sets. The photography was maybe too &quot;artsy&quot; but was certainly appropriate to the goings-on. The performances were great, with Cruise gaining confidence as the film went on. Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow were customarily fine, and there's a particularly touching performance from Samantha Morton that left me a bit haunted. This film gains momentum, due to excellent editing and very taut direction, as well as a literate script, and the result is an imaginative and exciting adventure, great ecapist fare.
0385508417|4.0|Skipping Christmas is an entertaining look at the strain of the holiday season.  Like A Painted House, it is a deviation from John Grisham's usual law-only plots.  Skipping Christmas is a quick, light read.  Many will be able to relate to Luther's frustration with the over-materialistic, non-stop hecticness that comes with Christmas.<br />In Skipping Christmas, Luther convinces his wife Nora that with their only daughter away for the year that they should simply skip Christmas, take a year off from the chaos.  The couple does not realize what an unpopular decision this will be.  Friends and neighbors react with everything from quiet chagrin to out and out distain.  The story has a few surprising plot twists, some entertaining, some frustrating with a nice storybook-type ending.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is an excellent project in every way! Well casted, well engineered and well produced! And what is the deal with the 'is this a real deal?' commentary? It is openly stated that the girls are hired acctors and nothing more, a prefectly common thing in todays pop-music... the only difference is that European producers openly admit to it and the US 'entertainment industry' still insist on claiming that Britney Spears, Blink 182 or even NASCAR is real and genuine.....
B000002UJQ|3.0|So what is this?  3 stars?  I'm sure you are thinking \\"what is wrong with you?\\"  This just so happens to be my LEAST favorite Radiohead album.  I'm not saying it's not the most artistic and most talent driven album by Radiohead.  It is.  But it lacks one important thing.  It isn't very listenable.  Or for you idiots, it's often times boring.  <br />Now this album doesn't completly disappoint.  It opens with \\"Airbag,\\" a fine opening.  Radiohead tends to open with a great song, and they don't fail to live up to this.  It follows with \\"Paranoid Android,\\" also quite good...and listenable.  But then comes \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\\" which is quite pretty, but also quite boring.  It continues it's sinking with the next song, \\"Exit Music\\", which really isn't very good in any respect.  The album then goes back on the upside with \\"Let Down\\", which actually isn't a let down at all.  Followed by \\"Karma Police,\\" also quite talent driven and the most listenable song on the album.  From then on, the only good song you get is \\"No Surprises\\".  The rest of the album is completely a sleeper.  <br />In short, if you want a good Radiohead album, pick up The Bends or Kid A.  If you become a hardcore fan, get this.  One's Radiohead collection is empty without songs like Airbag and Karma Police, but is more empty without the other albums.
B00006HBUA|5.0|First of all I am annoyed because I cannot find the music video that's supposed to be on this DVD. I found two of the easter egg (1 about the weather and the other about Pamela Anderson)Is the music video only viewable if you put the DVD into a computer that has a DVD-Rom drive? My computer doesn't have one, so I guess I miss out! DVD distributors should put a sticker on the front of the box to tell people that some of the content is only availed if you have a DVD-Rom drive. <BR>I saw this movie in the theatre and thought it was even better than I imagined! The most enjoyable parts of the movie for me was Spooky Island and the music, and the deleted scenes and the wonderful Rowan Atkinson (Black ADDER, Mr. Bean)and the wonderful Matthew Lizzard and his relationship with Scooby. Spooky Island was so cool I want to go there! The music is great and compliments the movie well especially performances by the Baha Men and Outcast. The cartoon intro was fantastic, and the best scene in the movie was the deleted scene with Velma singing \\"Can't Take my Eyes off of you\\". It's a shame they didn't leave those deleted scenes in the movie, especially Velma's song. The acting was great especially Rowan, Velma, and Shaggy. <BR>This movie is for everyone who enjoys having a good time. You don't have to be a fan of the orginal series to enjoy it. It is one of the most enjoyable movies of 2002. Other movies of 2002 I reccomend are Ice Age, Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones, Lord of the Rings 2, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
B000066NW0|5.0|I thought Avril's cd was awesome! I really liked the songs\\"Things I'll never say,\\" \\"Naked,\\" and we must not forget  the one and only \\"Complicated.\\" They all have a nice beat to them. I don't see why people judge her so much. Who cares if she's a \\"poser.\\" She's cool! She's her own person. And allthose people that diss her songs, let's hear you sing. You probably sound like crap! I think Avril's songs are uplifting, expecially \\"complicated.\\" Just the beat of it makes me happy. ADIOS AMIGOS! Rock on homies! Feel the burning wrath of AVRIL!
B00000IL26|4.0|The standouts on this classic are the first two tracks, the well-known, funky, blues 'The Sidewinder', with its instantly memorable background riff that carries on for most of the track, and 'Totem pole', a piece in a more traditional jazz style, with beautiful soloing from sax and trumpet.<BR>This CD was one of Blue Note's biggest commercial successes, and started a trend with the label of releasing similar albums, opening with a catch blues, and often followed by half-a-dozen or so forgettable tracks.  This, however, is the original, and the best- it really does work, showing the skills of Morgan as a composer and performer, playing with a carefully judged ensemble, but also had value as a surprise popular smash.  <BR>One of the essentials.
B00005QFE5|5.0|The movie starts with a son returning back from the city when his father dies to help his mom fulfill her wish to give her husband a traditional burial.  Starting in black and white the films turns to color during his mother's flashback, as she explains how she first met her husband and WHY the traditional burial is so important.  A story of love coming first, even before, funny enough, the tradition of arranged marriages.  Full of culture and touching moments.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've recently read some of the reviews for this masterful work. I just can't understand them. A Rush Of Blood To The Head is one of the very best albums that I have heard, and I listen to rap! From the very beginning, Chris Martin, the head of the band, put his soul on display, without regret, and continued to do so until the 50 minute plus set was over. <BR>All in all, I think that A Rush Of Blood was a growth from Parachutes. Martin has seemed to accrew all the heart and soul that experience can't teach you in the two years between albums.<BR>&quot;Yellow&quot; was great, but the songs on Rush were better. The single &quot;In My Place&quot; is one of the most emotional vocals I've ever heard. &quot;Politik&quot; and &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot; were also fantastic. &quot;Whisper&quot; which is a little more mainstream will appeal to the close minded who thinks that Coldplay is just depressing. I say they're just emotional, and I hope that they stay that way.
B000002NC4|5.0|This album is a masterpiece on all levels.  This is the third BTS album I have bought, and it's my favorite.  My favorite song is &quot;I Would Hurt A Fly,&quot; followed by &quot;Kicked It In The Sun&quot; and &quot;Untrustable Pt. 2&quot;.  I would recommend this album to any pop/indie rock fans, and especially to all BTS fans.
B000002KHH|2.0|GOsh!! PARANOID is really a bad album! It is &quot;sandwiched&quot; between BLACK SABBATH and MASTER OF REALITY, both of them wiht MUCH BETTER PRODUCTION. THat's right! PARANOID's sound is obnoxious, boring, a real pain to listen. Only the famous tracks are killers, the rest is some of the worst Sabbath (with Ozzy) ever wrote, obvioulsy due to the sheer speed this album was written and recorded, soon after their homonimous great (thi is really a a great album!) debut.<br />PARANOID has so much fame due to it's title track. Nothing more than that.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers hands down wins my vote for best action film of 2002.  Fans of the first movie on a whole should love the second film as well as the action TOTALLY picks up.  Fans of the books may not be as thrilled with the greater emphasis on action over story.  On a whole though, MOST should be pleased with Peter Jacksons second look at Tolkiens legendary work.<br />THE STORY:<br />Sarumon the White and Sauron, lords of the Two Towers (Isengard and Mordor), have joined forces to wipe out the denizens of Middle-Earth.  The Fellowship of the Ring has split into three where our story picks up following the storylines of Frodo and Sam who continue to journey to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring; Merry and Pippin who were captured; and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf who seek to rally the people of Middle Earth to rise up and take on the combined Dark Forces. <br />THE ANALYSIS:<br />Overall, if you love action and FX, this movie BRINGS it in spades.  This nearly three hour film is almost exclusively fight scenes and suspense.  Tolkiens story is still in the background, but the film tones it down in favor of the fights scenes which is cool with me but may not leave Tolkien purists overly happy.<br />The character of Gollum easily steals the show with his schizophrenic episodes.  The character of Gimli the Dwarf is also played well as comical relief throughout.<br />BEST SCENES:<br />- The battle of Helms Deep (easily tops Attack of the Clones final battle scene)<br />- Gollums schizophrenia<br />- The Trees at Isengard<br />- Gandalf saves Theoden<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, the intense action and the awesome special effects rendering of Tolkiens world will easily put LOR: The Two Towers at the top of anyones favorite movie list.<br />You know you dont want to miss this.<br />Highest Recommendation
B00005JL7Q|1.0|I finished watching this movie about 20 mins ago, how I got through it I'll never know. <br />Imagine Having a really simple plotted romantic comedy with thin but easy to understand plot, then imagine having not one but TWO patronizing voice-overs accompanying the picture, narrating it - both of witch go to point out what any one with a brain cell or two should have figured out long ago.<br />Hugh grant is likeable enough (as usual) but the boy (i forget his name) is so irritating, you start to emphasize with the kids that bully him for being strange.<br />But above all this films worst crime is plane and simple Unfunnyness! There was perhaps two points where I laughed, which is not good for a film which bills its self as a comedy and is made by the directors of comedy hits like American Pie.<br />So over all I'd say give this one a miss and rent something else, it doesn't really matter what - its bound to be better than this movie.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Based on a true story that is so amazing and shocking, &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; is a fantastic film that hooks you from start to finish.  With stars like Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, and many more, this is a movie that should be seen by all.<br />FBI Joseph D. Pistone is an undercover agent who's goal is to get into the violent and unpredictable mob world.  He goes the by name of Donnie Brasco.  Soon he is discovered by Lefty Ruggiero, who sees potential in the kid, not aware of who Brasco really is.  He brings him into the family and the world of the Mafia.  It doesn't take long for Joseph to get so deep into the action that he starts to become one of them.  This unforgettable picture shows us that sometimes you can become what you chase if you're in too long, and that in order to catch a monster you may become one yourself in the process.<br />I became addicted to this film in no time.  It's one of my favorites that I have seen over and over again, and it hasn't gotten old yet.  The acting and directing is all fantastic.  Al Pacino really shines, as always, and Johnny Depp gives an Academy Award performance as the FBI agent.  He actually spent time with the real Joseph Pistone to get his character down, as he did when he was working on &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&quot;  Michael Madsen is also terrific and can once again send chills down our spines just as he did in &quot;Reservoir Dogs.&quot;<br />This new special edition of the DVD is much, MUCH better than the original.  First off, the sound and picture quality has really improved.  Especially the picture; it looks a lot better than the first version that came out.  There are also a lot of extras, including features such as director's commentary, and exclusive featurette, the original featurette, deleted scenes, trailers, and more.  The featurettes are very interesting and makes the DVD that much more special.  A very high quality special edition, if you ask me.<br />All in all, &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; is an outstanding picture on all fronts.  Filled with drama and suspense, this is a film that will take you deep into the world of the Mafia.  The only question is how far would you go?  And would you risk becoming one of them when it's all said and done?  Excellent all the way!e Brasco&quot; is an outstanding picture on all fronts.  Filled with drama and suspense, this is a film that will take you deep into the world of the Mafia.  The only question is how far would you go?

0786868694|2.0|I absolutely love her show on the Style network. I've watched her prepare so many recipes that i would love to try. I don't normally purchase cookbooks but loved her show so much that I made an exception. Bad exception. The book is nice but does not have very many recipes. For the price of the book, I would have expected much more. For this i gave it two stars. I've learned to go directly to the Style website for the recipes instead. The only caveat is that you must do so the same week she prepares the recipe on her show as the website does not catalog all of her recipes.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers, the second in the famous trilogy, is at least as good as the first. Yes it's true, the plot is much darker than in The Fellowship of Ring but that's how it is in the book as well. Although the plot isn't as lighthearted as the first movie, the more serious nature comes across well and there are plenty of amusing moments that help to lighten the mood. <br />   The movie starts off right where the Fellowship ended(it might be a good idea to watch the Fellowship before watching the Two Towers for the first time). The first scene is of Gandalf fighting the Balrog. The difference is, this time when he falls, we follow him. We end up watching a dramatic battle as both the Balrog and Gandalf fall into a vast cavern. Then we join Frodo and Sam. Frodo wakes up, and we end up thinking the battle was just a dream. We then meet up with Merry and Pippin in the hands of the Uruk Hai. Then we move on to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as they give chase to the Uruk Hai in hopes of rescuing Merry and Pippin. We are then in for a long ride of a fight to conquer evil, friendship, loss, delightful humor, and, of course, action packed fun.<br />   The movie is extraordinarily well done and will undoubtedly be even more loved than the first. The only criticism for it that I can find is that since the beginning introduces so many characters, it's a bit hard to follow. I also think that the love story between Aragorn and Arwen was a bit overdone. The Ent's appearances weren't what I'd pictured but they were very well done. Everything else is done to perfection. The Battle of Helms Deep is amazing, the numerous special effects are just as good, or better, than anticipated, and Gollum is absolutely perfect! Everything(acting, script, layout, special effects, etc.), was done to perfection. The Two Towers is one of the best movies ever! A must see for everyone. A+<br />   <br />   The Cast: Frodo-Elijah Wood, Sam-Sean Astin, Merry-Dominic Monaghan, Pippin-Billy Boyd, Aragorn-ViggoMortenson, Legolas-Orlando Bloom, Gimli-John Rhys-Davies, Gandalf- Ian McKellan, King Theoden-Bernard Hill, Eowyn-Miranda Otto, Eomer-Karl Urban, Faramir-David Wenham, Saruman-Christopher Lee, Wormtounge-Brad Dourif, Arwen-Liv Tyler, Elrond-Hugo Weaving, Galadriel-Cate Blanchett, Haldir-Craig Parker, Gollum-Andy Serkis(voice and movements), Treebeard-John Rhys-Davies(voice),
B000002INR|5.0|I think skid row self title  cd is a classic recording of late 80,s hair bands . there front man vocal jumps out there grabs you and wont let go .in other words this band  kicks ... .worth adding to cd ,s you own .
B00000IXL1|2.0|I purchased this CD based on the reviews here, and mostly based on the names: Warwick, Bacharach, David. But after listening to the album, I very much doubt that any of the three would endorse it.<br />The \\"Import\\" label was suspicious, and the songs sound like imitations of the originals. There's no doubt that this is Dionne's voice, and Burt and Hal's lyrics and songs, but these are not the renditions that we've fallen in love with. Dionne's voice lacks the familiar soul and mastery of the originals (just where did they get those vocal tracks?), and the musical arrangements lack depth and texture and do not blend well with the vocals.There is distortion and poor balance between vocals and music in this production, making it disturbing to listen to. <br />This is an album I thought I would want to listen to over and over, but it lacks the musical magic we know of these songs and these artists. Warwick, Bacharach and David will always be five star by my estimation, but this production is a zero.
B00005LMBK|5.0|this cd rocks. i like this cd. the best song is rock the house.<BR> the rest of the cd is great.it has some djing.my bro rob burned<BR>me a copy.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Those who fail to find value in this record only validate its title. Queens of the Stone Age has done nothing other than set the benchmark for rock and roll since their self-titled debut. What QOTSA doesn't to do is meet the standard format of radio friendly Fred Bizkit &amp; Co. Queens of the Stone Age isn't about thirty-years-olds pretending to be filled with juvenile angst or faux Satan homage; these boys are straight amphetamines and coffee. Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri, since their days in Kyuss, have been making nothing but great rock'n'roll on their own terms. If you think you love the rawk and you don't own this record, think again. Pure and simple; it's time to embrace the love of QOTSA. The addition of Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees) and Dave Grohl (Scream/Nirvana/Foo Fighters) only makes &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; that much more untouchable. Definitely one of the best records of 2002.
B000002MZ9|5.0|this cd rocks. neil is at his best. pearl jam is chilling in the back but they combine for a solid effort. i have this cd in heavy rotation.
0385247125|5.0|ahh michael jackson wrote this pretty well and at the end he defintly left me wanting more. it's all about his life and all the hardships he had as a child proformer and never having a real childhood to his adult life where he mentions all the pain he went through with the tabloids about his looks. this is a woderful book for any michael fan.
0767817478|3.0|I have been a die hard Godzilla fan ever since I was old enough to pronounce the word \\"Godzilla\\", and unlike so many [people] who I hear complain about this film and how it's \\"Not really a Godzilla movie\\", I actually liked it. Except for two blemishes on this otherwise fun movie, who's names are Matthew Broderick and Maria Pittilo. Their acting is too awful to ignore.<br />The movie is quite a bit different from the original G movies, that's for sure. There are no monster melees, wich IMO was the biggest thing that was missing. Basically, it's the same concept as the original 1954 godzilla. Giant, radioactive lizard with fire breath comes to the city, blows stuff up, and the military attempts to stop him. There are a few minor similarities here and there, but most of them are more homage to the original than anything else.<br />Basically, if you liked Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's other big action movie \\"Independence day\\", you'll find alot to like with Godzilla. However, ID4's sucsess went to their heads unfortunately, and they forgot to work with their main actors. I cannot stress enough how terrible Matthew Broderick and Maria Pittilo's preformances are. Also, there is rain thoughout almost the entire movie, and while it does give the film a distinct look, it gets old fast, and you wonder \\"Gosh, where did the sun go?\\".<br />In the end, many Godzilla purists other than myself will call it a blasphemouse peice of filth, but I say shut up to them. If you want to know what a BAD Godzilla movie is, then rent \\"Godzilla's Revenge\\". However, if you can put aside that this is NOT a Japanese Godzilla movie, that it was in fact made by AMERICANS, and you can look past the terrible acting from the two leading \\"actors\\", you'll find a fun movie with memorable action sequences, lots of explosions, and excellent special effects.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Its a lot of fun exploring music that you might have written off as too hard core in the past.  Californication by the Red Chili Peppers is an enjoyable recording loaded with spunky bass and guitar riffs, strong drumming, and creative vocals particularly the harmonies between the band members.<br />Compared to By The Way, this CD is more riff bassed and has more funky overtones.  There are some well written songs.  However, the band has not crafted their tunes as they later would on By The Way.<br />Nonetheless, the CD gets off to a hard core start with Around The World.  Love The opening rap and the change of pace to the more structured chorus.  Parallel Universe is quite mesmerizing with the bass effects.  Scar Tissue, Californication, Get On Top, Purple Stain, Other Side, Road Trippin' and Easily are other strong tracks. The rest is pretty listenable although the tones are a bit excessive on Right On Time and I Like Dirt.  Also, Porcelain and Savior just aren't very captivating hook wise although some of the tones are creative.<br />The general consensus is that this a very good recording.  Not quite on the same level as By The Way but certainly appropriate for most music collections.
B000069CWE|4.0|Alright, here's the story.  This isnt just some cheap collection of Remixes, its an entirely new artistic interp of the old stuff.  This is LP at their best, with some of the other big names chiping in, and almost all of it is better in a different way than the original.  Good stuff, includes My December and the best version of With You thats ever been made.  A definite must-have.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|It is hard to fault this film, it is such a wonderful fairy tale. I am very glad that the original 1982 version is presented here untouched. I watched the retouched 2002 version and have mixed feelings. The space ships look cooler but the CGI E.T. looks out of place especially in the restored bathroom scene. He just looks too computery. I prefer the puppet E.T. and when both are in the same film it just looks wrong. Also I have no idea why Spielberg digitally removed the guns out of the hands of the government agents. In the original at the park scene a bunch of blood thirsty agents stampede towards the white van thinking E.T. is in there meanwhile Elliot's mom is chasing them screaming \\"no guns, no guns they are just children!\\" and of course the agents could care less. This was scary and sad in the original and created a great sense of danger for the kids. Removing the guns and replacing them with digital air or walkie talkies is weak. Come on Spielberg, don't cave in. Plus it also shows why E.T's are always contacting regular people and not the governments, they don't want to get shot! Of course it goes without saying that the DVD transfers of both films are perfect and the extras are great as well. Check out the girl Elliot kisses, its the best babe of baywatch Erika Eleniak!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Lord of the Rings in book form.  My three favorite books of all time are the three that tell of Frodo's quest to destroy the ring.  With such a love of the books, it would be easy to pass this movie off as [junk] because it changed way too much.  And yes, if it were truer to Tolkien I would probably have liked it even better!  But here's how I think of it: Tolkien said that he wasn't so much writing a story as he was discovering and retelling it.  He went so far as to think of LotR and his other writings on Arda (the LotR world - Middle Earth is only part of it!) as a mythology that England could call its own.  So the books are Tolkien's version of the story.  But like any great mythology, details change in every telling, and now Jackson is telling a slightly different yet equally enthralling version of the story.  The details may be different, but the big plot points are there, and when it all comes down to it the story is as grand and epic as ever.
0385508417|5.0|This is one of the most fun books that I have read in a while. Actually, my wife and I read this book aloud to each other on a road trip during a Christmas vacation, so part of the joy was in the total experience. Nonetheless, Grisham knows how to tell a good story. Luther Crank is a modern day Scrooge. Enjoy this book during the holiday season!
B00005QZWI|5.0|Ok, I'll say here that up until Star Wars I never really listened to a movie's soundtrack. Yeah, I heard it, but I didn't actually stop and think about it. Then when I saw Star Wars and listened to the soundtrack, I realized that part of what makes a movie as good as it is is its musical score. I mean, who wants to watch a scary movie and have this weird, happy music playing in the background? I can't say I've ever had that happen to me, but it gets my point across. I was wondering what they were going to come up with for the Fellowship of the Ring. Well, composer Howard Shore came up with a score that could hardly be more fitting to the film, from the upbeat yet peaceful sound of Concerning Hobbits to the mysterious yet sorrowful tune that plays during the meeting of Arwen and Aragorn. If you're like me and can easily get a good song from a movie stuck in your head for days on end, get this soundtrack.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that I've now seen over a dozen times, but not only is my son (2 years) not tired of it, neither am I.  Every time I see it, I notice something that I missed before.  It just gets funnier.  The computer graphics are great and the voices (especially Billy Crystal and John Goodman)are spectacular.  Some of the best \\"acting\\" I've ever seen in an animated film.  My son got a little freaked during the opening scene the first time he saw it, but once the \\"monster\\" was hopping around, screaming, and picking jacks out of his hind-end, he was all amazed and smiling.  Great movie for children, doesn't have all those sneaky double-entendres and sexual innuendoes that seem to be becoming more prevalent in \\"children's\\" movies of today.  Also, excellent for adults.  A definite must buy.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I think the plot starts out slow, but it explains plot, and some history about some of the characters.  Paying attention to all aspects and dialogue in this movie is imperative, but aside from the (GREAT but) wacky setting they have a pretty good story running parallel with it.  The story describes the life of one of the mental hospital patients (the mental hospital is abandoned, but there are still records and REEL-To-REEL recordings that our characters find... when snooping around), who has Schizophrenia and the very rare Multiple Personality Disorder.  Well you should see it for yourself; I thought it was truly original!<br /><br />If you get the DVD, there's some interesting parts about the building that the movie was shot within.<br /><br />Update: I beleive the hospital building tht the story takes place within, has been demolished to make way for an apartment complex.  IMO, kind of ashame... only because I wanted to go check it out some day, haha.
0316666343|4.0|I thought this was a great book, very intriguing perspective.  It was touchingly sad how she saw her family eventually, though not forgetting her, move on with their lives.  I got really attached to Susie's character and also the father.  I was very disappointed with the mother's reaction to the death of her daughter and her inability to cope and help her living children with the grief process.  I found it very thought provoking in terms of life and death and how life just continue on without us. I recommend it even though there are parts that are a little out there.  I think George Harvery deserved a worse death than he got.
B0000062FL|5.0|...buy this and throw those two CDs away. One listen to this album and you'll realize that you were suckered in by a clever marketing ploy and that THIS is the real deal. When Santana didn't need guest stars or MTV to score hits and sell records, this is what he sounded like. This is great music. A wonderful fusion of rock, jazz, latin and soul. Buy this album along with &quot;Santana&quot; and &quot;Santana III&quot; and you'll never listen to Supernatural again.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I loved this piece of art. It is truly a masterpiece. The actors that played these real life heros did an excellent job of showing the hardships that the Easy Company had. You can tell that they were a unit as actors. They wanted to tell the story of the heros of WWII and they did so with such a vigor and intelligence. I loved this story and I felt for those men as one by one they lost someone close to them or they themselves were lost.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Having seen the original 1975 production 30+ times, I was rather concerned about it's transition to film.<BR>I worried for nothing.<BR>Forget this \\"best film of the year\\" nonsense, we're talking the best film I've seen in my 49 years.<BR>Right from the opening notes of the \\"Overture,\\" I was hooked.<BR>It's impossible to single out a performer, or a number in this film, because it's one of two perfect films I've seen in my lifetime, the other being \\"Cabaret,\\" which shares the same pedigree.<br />Run to your nearest cineplex!
B0000047EC|4.0|For those who know each of Haden's and Metheny's careers, this is an unusual album, somewhat out of the \\"mainstream\\". Similarly, do not expect to find similarities to other past Metheny-Haden projects such as the \\"Rejoicing\\" CD. Yet, both musicians deliver a solid musical communication that trascends their respective musical paths. That is perhaps what makes this album unique. Guitar-bass interactions go hand in hand, nothing on top of anything. Not-so-very-acoustic elements have been nicely incorporated into the recording. This is a rare opportunity to fully listen to Pat Metheny playing the acoustic guitar. At times his play is a bit rough (too much electric fingering?), but overall his performance is excellent. It reminds me of his earlier collaboration with Milton Nascimento's \\"Angelus\\" CD where Metheny plays the acoustic guitar on the track titled \\"amor amigo\\" on this 1994 album. <br />If you do not know Pat Metheny and Charlie Haden, I nevertheless recommend this album for the jazz listener. For most of the tunes, the performing quality of both artists will fly over any musical preconceptions. Buy it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|at 15, i'm probably the youngest Elvis fan in the world. i was first introduced to his music by my dad, but i am now a fan myself and bought this cd for me. <BR>what is great about this cd for younger generations is that it introduces them to the wonder that is Elvis Presley, the greatest entertainer that ever lived (at least this century). Out of the thirty songs here, most of the younger generation will be familiar with about 10, but will soon love the others. for older generations i think it's a good nostalgia trip. it features a good selection of songs, including classics like 'heartbreak hotel', 'hound dog' and 'suspicious minds', which puts gareth gates' cover to shame. it also features some perhaps lesser known ones like 'don't'. the only odd thing is that the novelty track 'wooden heart' is here while 'i want you, i need you, i love you' is absent. <BR>this cd shows how great the influence elvis had on music was (on some tracks, you can hear how some of today's music has evolved from it), and lays to bed any claims by some that elvis 'stole' black music. first of all, you can't 'steal' music, and second of all, no one can say that elvis presley stole anything. there were rock n roll artists before him, in the 40's and early 50's, such as Little Richard, but Elvis was the first one to take it into the mainstream, and the first one to make it what it is today. <BR>most of the songs are from the 50's and early 60's, but there are also strong tracks that came after his 68 comeback special, showcasing elvis' versatality and ability to move with the times  - something many artists lack. <BR>overall, this is definitely the reissue of the year, and probably of the decade. there is something for everyone. buy it!
B00006AG5N|5.0|\\"30 #1 Hits\\" is probably the best Elvis Presley compilation yet released. I can say that with confidence even having not heard all of the other Elvis compilations. For 2 reasons: 1) Remastering and 2) Value. <br />1) This collection was remastered and remixed with 2002 audio technology, so it's obviously going to be the best sounding of the lot. And it is, believe me. Just put on the disc and listen to the first track, Heartbreak Hotel. The music BOOMS from the speakers with astounding richness and clarity. The first five seconds alone of Heartbreak Hotel had my jaw on the floor. This is not even SACD or DVD-A, but regular old Compact Disc. Commendable job. Very good song notes and information too. <br />2) The CD is JAM-PACKED with music. In earlier years, particularly in the early days of CD, record labels did not take full advantage of the storage capacities of CDs, so you'll probably find some Elvis collections that run around 45 minutes, 55 minutes, 1 hour, etc. \\"30 #1 Hits\\", however is stuffed with a full 79 minutes of music (79:36 according to my CD player). This is without the inflated price tag of so many Elvis box-set collections which run more than three or four times the price of this CD. <br />Quality and value are there. I just have a few small quibbles with the song selection. Most of these songs are indespensible. Heartbreak Hotel, Hound Dog, Love Me Tender, Don't Be Cruel, All Shook Up, Jailhouse Rock, Return To Sender, You're The Devil In Disguise, etc these songs belong in any rock and roll collection. However, I would have dropped Wooden Heart (completely out of place among Elvis classics) in favor of the not-included holiday classic, Blue Christmas. And Crying In The Chapel should be dropped in favor of the classic, classic Blue Suede Shoes. And, finally, the dance-pop (?!) remix of A Little Less Conversation, should definitely have been dropped altogether or replaced with the original 1968 recording. <br />These changes might, however, conflictwith the motif of presenting 30 #1 hits, but big deal! Just change the album title! Why leave out certified, tried and true classic songs just because they weren't #1 hits? But, alas, that's the only fault of this fine collection. An ideal choice for newcomers to The King.
B000065U1N|3.0|This is a documentary-like presentation of the Ranger/Delta incident in Somalia. The main good feature of the movie is that it shows the Rangers and Deltas doing their job under extremely difficult circumstances and demonstrates that the casualties taken were actually light considering the situation. Not that the mission couldn't have been carried out better but the grunts in the field did great. Now that all that is said the movie is also very sad. One does not have a feeling of success or accomplishment at the end but pride is definitely in the picture. Many said the movie was too documentary-like and that the human interest was missing. But I believe for many it was too much that the U.S. military was presented in that particular light. People should just realize that it was a no win situation and take the movie for what it is.  Another reason that many in Hollywood thought it was too documentary-like is that the movie does not contain any of the typical Hollywood anti-war scenes/subplots.
0553579908|5.0|It's way harder to do a second book in a series than the first book.  After all, the shock of the new has worn off, the writer has to think of new situations without making them look contrived, and continue old plots without looking like he's coasting.  The first book put the wheels in motion, setting up the premise just long enough to bring it all crumbling down, at the same time almost gleefully permanently ruining a lot of characters' lives.  But the great thing about having a cast of thousands is that there's plenty more where that came from.  And boy is there, this book clocks in at substantially longer than the first book but somehow it still retains an almost gripping readability.  Basically everything that got messed up in the first book continue to get messed up even more here . . . where in the first book everyone was trying to kill each other in secret, now everyone decides to be open about it.  Martin juggles what feels like eighty plots with ease and you really get the sense that a hundred things are going on at once, his ability to depict battle scenes from many different viewpoints (plus his skill at showing how rumors spread, often unless a character was present they don't know exactly what the heck happened) is effective and gets a lot of practice.  The plot twists unpredictible, and while Martin continues to show no mercy or love for his characters when deciding who lives or dies, he gets the reader so used to anybody being fair game that when he pulls the opposite trick, you're surprised and impressed all the same.  Don't be daunted by the size of the books in this series, pages will literally fly past as you read them since something is always happening and the book never becomes bogged down or becomes a chore.  He actually manages the rare feat of having a second book just as good as the first, a book where events actually happen and change the world irreversibly, as opposed to everyone just treading water.  And if the plot threads still left for the next book are any indication, it's only going to get more interesting.  If you have any interest in epic fantasy, get started on this series while you can.r the next book are any indication, it's only going to get more interesting.

B0000029DD|5.0|\\"Grace\\" by the immortal Jeff Buckley is certainly the most passionate album of the 90's. The cover, classic, the music, undescribible. Buckley possesses a slick guitar ability and perhaps the most expressive, most beautiful, softest voice in the history of rock, and uses them to maximum effect. His reading of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" is perfect, beautiful and pained, far superior to Rufus Wainwright's pretty but less substantial version in \\"Shrek\\". \\"Eternal Life\\" is a high-octane mix of guitars and piety that puts the entire canon of Creed to shame. \\"Mojo Pin\\" and \\"Grace\\" are superb as well, \\"Dream Brother\\" is incredibly beautiful and fragile, and \\"Last Goodbye\\" and \\"Lover, you Should have Come Over\\" are mournful odes that show off Buckley's profound voice and lyricism. If he were alive today, no one would bother listening to those pathetic boy bands, for while they deliver pre-packaged clichés that they drive into the ground, Jeff Buckley turns his soul into poetry as light as clouds, which his voice then lifts and carries into the stratosphere. Buckley is without a doubt the best singer-songwriter of his kind since at least James Taylor. Many albums and songs speak to the emotions inside us. This album is emotion itself.<br />Grace indeed.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against The Machine is a great band all around, but this CD is probably one of their most heavily influenced political CDs. Zach De La Rocha (lead singer) is a very talented lyricist and his lyrics are passionately angry. Zack's lyrics however should be understood, or they wont make sense. For example from the song &quot;War Within a Breath&quot; a verse goes like this - &quot;Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist. Clenched to smash power so cancerous. A black flag and a red star.&quot; etc. This wouldnt make sense to someone who is not very up to date with conditions in the world. &quot;Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist&quot; -- Zack is talking about Chiapas (the southern state of Mexico) and the jungles of the region. &quot;A black flag and a red star&quot; -- thats the flag of the EZLN (Zapatista National Liberation Army) they are located in Chiapas, Mexico and are currently fighting for reform. Also part of the chorus of &quot;War Within A Breath&quot; -- &quot;Everything can change on a new years day&quot; -- Zack is talking about when the EZLN started to take over towns which happened on the New years day. So as you can see, his lyrics are politically influenced. And as for the band, they're great. Tom Morello showing his skills on the guitar, Brad Wilk on drums, just all in all a great band. They are able to blend sort of a rap and rock together and pull it off. Great band. Great CD. Five stars definately.
B000002KBH|5.0|...I thought The Grateful Dead was a heavy metal band. You know, one of those big, scary evil metal bands like Megadeth and Slayer, etc. Well, with a name like \\"Grateful Dead\\" who could blame me? And look at the cover of the \\"What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been\\" CD. That's a scary friggin' cover to a 7-year old! How many album covers of The Dead's have skeletons on them, anyway? Probably five or six, at least.<br />Imagine my surprise, many years later, at hearing this album, \\"American Beauty\\" by The Grateful Dead, this evil scary band, and listening to a song called \\"Friend of the Devil\\" expecting to hear hellacious screams, fierce guitars and straight-from-the-smoking-pits-of-hell lyrics and instead hearing a gentle acoustic guitar intro leading into a mellow, country-folk ballad, complemented by touches of mandolin, sung by a somber voice almost reeking of heartbreak and despair. <br />The last thing I expected was an album filled with folksy, countryish ballads with gorgeous poetic lyrics. The sixth song, \\"Ripple\\" was almost the most loveliest, most beautiful song I had ever heard. <br />Well, needless to say, I'm not scared of The Dead anymore. But I did become a fan of their music and this was my introduction to them. After this, I picked up the wonderful \\"Europe '72\\" and \\"Workingman's Dead\\", both among the finest in the Grateful Dead catalog. <br />So if you're new to the group, don't be scared. \\"American Beauty\\" may well be the most beautiful album ever recorded by a group with the word \\"Dead\\" in their name and skeletons on their album covers.
B00005NGZX|5.0|This is chaos in it's most horrific, destuctive, and beautiful form. Unlike anything Converge has ever done, Jane Doe turns the tables of metalcore--or at least for Converge.<br />Converge smash your teeth in with the opener, &quot;Concubine&quot;, a beautiful display of instrumental mastery and musical complexity. Each and every song afterwards has its own uniqueness, causing this album to seperate itself from the rest of the hardcore and metal world.<br />And for those of you who aren't too keen on Dillinger Escape Plan-type hardcore, fear not--Jane Doe is just as equally melodic as it is painfully intricate.<br />A must for all open minded fans of hardcore and metal.
0792844882|5.0|There was movement in NYC in the late 1990's to turn this into a midnight flick ala' ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.  There were regular showings at a multiplex in the East Village...and the audience even had cues to yell out at certain points during the movie.  However, this never really caught on because the bridge and tunnel crowd did not quite meld well with the NYC midnight crowd.  Half the crowd came to see the movie and the other half merely wanted to have fun with it.<br />Watching SHOWGIRLS as an exercise in campy fun is a real blast.  I don't think Elizabeth Berkely is at all to blame, as she plays the character for all it is worth.  The script is clearly the culprit in this expensive debacle of unbelievably tackyness.<br />Watching SHOWGIRLS is really like watching a bunch of drunk drag queens turn hateful one evening at a local gay bar.  But in SHOWGIRLS the drag queens are all women. If SHOWGIRLS had been made in the 50's, Gena Gershon's role would have been played by Joan Crawford.<br />The dialogue, production numbers, and everything about SHOWGIRLS is still so tacky, you just can't believe that it was ever made for a mainstream audience.  I mean it almost like BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS with an 80 million dollar budget.<br />If you like camp, you will like showgirls.

B00005JKNF|4.0|Robert Altman uses his multi-character, overlapping story style that we loved in Nashville, to make a homage to the Merchant-Ivory style of English movie. I say \\"homage\\" because it's not a parody.<br />Altman shot the scenes with very many characters talking at once, often with multiple cameras. The result is convincingly realistic, although the sound quality is often maddeningly muffled and the dialog is difficult to pick up through the various British accents.<br />The casting is fabulous, and Maggie Smith as the witheringly sharp-tongued dowager is the best. But close behind is Ryan Philippe's impression of an American doing and impression of a Scottish accent deserves an academy award.<br />You'll need to own this on DVD as you'll watch it 50 times before you catch all the dialog--you'll love it more with each viewing.

6301880447|5.0|How can a 40-year old Hungarian woman portray a twenty-something pre-Medieval Chinese princess? Very well is the answer. Many people feel that Marton is the definitive Turandot of our generation. She has power to spare in her voice, and although her acting is minimalist, it's by no means wooden. There's an economy of gesture, but she mimics many of the hand movements of the Peking opera and comes across as convincing.<br />Leona Mitchell, a large American woman playing a frail Asian slave, is less convincing to watch, but was in great voice on the night this was recorded at the Met. Domingo is the favorite tenor of many people and sings well here too. All the supporting cast members are well-chosen, and the ensemble movement is particularly effective--it looks as if there's a cast of 1,000s on the stage.<br />If you've seen opera at a provincial house, this is a good way to see how they do it at the Met, with the good (excellent musical preparation), the bad (endless curtain calls) and the ugly (Jimmy Levine mugging a self-satisfied smirk for the cameras, or is that how he really looks?).<br />It isn't quite a perfect opera: Puccini was beyond weird in his relations with women and knows nothing other than \\"love at first sight.\\" And this opera was famously finished after Puccini's death by Franco Alfani, his pupil. There's a big bump in the score when you get to the Alfani bits--we move from daring modern harmonies, to something that sounds like a rehearsal pianist vamping major triads. But interesting for all that.<br />Highly recommended--if you own one opera on tape, this should be it.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe--what a wonderful way to express the action and fantasy in this novel by C. S. Lewis. The story begins when Peter, Lucy, Susan and Edmund go to live with an old professor in the country.  While exploring the professor's large house, the children walk through an almost empty room.  Lucy is the only one who stops in the room because she is curious about the enormous wardrobe.  She goes inside the wardrobe. Surprisingly, she soon finds herself in an enchanted land, which she finds out is called Narnia. When her brothers and sister find out about this enchanted land, they learn that the white witch has made it always winter --but it never reaches Christmas! The white witch also has a spell on Edmund.  But all is not lost.  An ancient rhyme in Narnia reads:  Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight. At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more. When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death. And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.  <BR>     How will this mysterious rhyme help Lucy and her siblings save Narnia?  Will they be able to rescue Edmund?  People of all ages will enjoy reading this book to find out.
0451191153|3.0|It makes no sense to attempt to separate the story of The Fountainhead from it's philosophy, because they are one in the same. I read the first page of this book while bored at a yard sale, and was immediately hooked. Rand's character introductions are excellent, and immediately give picture to the character. This is especially important because for the most part, her characters each represent a personality type consistent with a particular aspect of her philosopy.<br />What I believe unique about this book is the singular challenge Rand had in crafting a novel that can stand on it's own as a story (it can), while each page advances the specific set of philosophical, political and economic positions that are the true reason the book was written. I imagine that other writers have sat down to write \\"the novel\\" deep within them, with major philosophical themes providing dramatic tension. Other writers, wanting to advance their own complex philosophy, would simply write a non-fiction book presenting themselves as gurus of this \\"new\\" way of thinking (whole sections of bookstores are full of such books). Rand's courage to attempt to write a great novel that is in fact a primer for Objectivism, and her skill in doing so is what makes The Fountainhead the achievement it is.<br />Now, why only three stars? A couple of reasons. First, although her story arcs are superior, her paragraph by paragraph writing is often heavy handed, and beats her points to death. Secondly, the length and scope of some of the philosophical speeches given by her characters, particularly in the last quarter of the book, are simply not believable. Employing other writing techniques could have achieved this more believably. It's as if Rand hasn't trusted her own characters to carry the point she put them in the book to illustrate. The speeches do however, make their points crystal clear, especially Toohey's speech about collectivism. It's just that you don't believe Toohey would have made that speech,to that person, in that setting. <br />I said at the beginning that it makes no sense to separate the story from the philosophy, and though I know I am now criticizing the philosophy and not the writing, here goes. If I read this correctly, Rand's \\"ideal man\\" is entirely self focused, does nothing he doesn't want to do regardless of anyone else's need, does everything he wants to do regardless of how it might effect others, places himself above the rule of law, commits several felonies, watches virtually everyone around him self destruct and leaves the novel entirely self satisfied. Rand calls this the \\"ideal man\\". Others might read the same book and identify Roark as a sociopath, just a very talented one who also possesses many admirable qualities. By the way, on a factual point, the idea of Roark being acquitted after admitting the deed in open court is ludicrous.<BR>Wasn't it Shakespeare who told us \\"To thine own self be true\\"? The notion of being your own man, and standing on principle is as old as philosophy itself, but Rand has given it entirely fresh treatment and perspective. <br />One last note- my wife was reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" at the same time I was reading \\"The Fountainhead\\". It took until I was nearly finished to notice that there are no children in the book. None of the main characters are raising the next generation of ideal men. I asked my wife about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", and she said the same. I wonder if this isn't the fatal flaw of Objectivism- can you be true to Objectivism and be a good parent? Or raise a family? Or preserve a marriage where \\"the two shall become one\\"? Her two major novels show that her characters can't, and a glimpse around you might show that the \\"me\\" generation isn't doing such a good job either.

As for the bonus CD Sampler from Shady Records it features music from Joe Beast, Shaunta and another new track from Eminem \\"Stimulate\\" plus 50 Cent doin' an awesome freestlye to the \\"Till I Collapse\\" instrumentals.<BR>Bottom line: Even if you ain't a big Eminem fan this CD is still a must have for any rap fans collection.
0780624890|5.0|Blade is an action-packed movie with lots of blood, gore, violence, and special effects. The opening sequence in the nightclub is excellent and the plot moves along nicely, never slowing down with some genuinely chilling moments and cool special effects. Wesley Snipes plays the part of Blade so good you never doubt his character. Also, Stephen Dorrf is excellent as Frost, the new leader of the vampires, and Kris Kristofferson makes a remarkably good performance as Whistler, Blade's human sidekick. The fight scenes in the movie were some of the best I have ever seen along with a tight soundtrack. The special effects in Blade are very good as is the art direction, set design and makeup.<br />Overall an excellent action movie equipped with a good plot and an energetic screenplay. I would recommend Blade to anyone who likes action/horror movies with the DVD version being a must see due to the alternate ending!
0425074811|5.0|Chariots of the gods? and other works of Erich Von Daniken stimulate the imagination.  Although others criticize his work, and cry out &quot;unscientific&quot; and &quot;doubtful&quot; pertaining to his evidence and methods.  I am certain that some of his work is based on pure speculation (develop a hypothesis) or observation (form a theory), the two initial steps in solving a scientific problem.  A problem of puzzles that for hundreds or thousands of years have mystified the best and brightest of society. Von Daniken's is but one possibility.<br />There are many many things that we take for granted everyday that are not &quot;proven&quot;.  Until someone finds an alien corpse inside a pyramid on a world premier TV exclusive, there will always be doubt.  <br />The approach used is not &quot;hard science&quot;, paleontology, anthropology, history, and the like are based on pieces and fragments and often more than a little guesswork.  This is one interpretation coming from an individual outside the box. <br />Also, his work is but one opinion.  I'm sure he's not 100% right, but he is also not 100% wrong (as some reviewers say).  If some of histories great minds were to give in to ridicule and the majority disbelief, Einstein would have never achieved and modern physics would have postponed indefinitely.  Likewise Gregor Mendel (genetics) and Madame Curie (Founder of Radiation chemistry, 2 Nobel prizes) would have been defeated early on in their careers for their riduculous ideas and/orgender respectively.  <br />All &quot;hard&quot; scientists! thank you, to the skeptics out there.
0316666343|4.0|I think that \\"The Lovely Bones\\" has been the best novel I've read in quite a while. I don't think another author could have had Ms. Sebold's perspective. I thought it was beautifully written & I didn't want to put it down. I found the plot engrossing and the characters well developed to the point that it didn't feel like a book, it felt real. It was very sad, but really worth reading anyway. I gave it a 4 becuase it had some awkward moments & seem to twindle a little near the end, but overall, I really enjoyed \\"The Lovely Bones\\" & would recommend it.
B00005JLF5|4.0|You need to watch the first season of DS9 in order to fully understand the ending of the show. Unlike Babylon 5 which is an incomplete work at best, DS9 follows it's storyline and look to have a coherent line of events. It is a living work that gets better over time and brings in the darker side of the federation. Someone just loaned me season 5 of TNG and all but 5 episodes bored me, by season 5 of DS9 it was cranking every week.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<BR>If you want a series where the problems are solved in 45-90 minutes then pick up a copy of TNG. However if you want to see the progression of character over a long period of time and a long term story line pick DS9.<br />With DS9 there are no MR. Data's and no Seven of nine's to save the day in the last 5 minutes. In DS9 they work the whole way thru and sometimes (just like in life) they don't find the answers or they will not be revealed for 6 or so episodes.<br />You will miss out if you miss the first show.

I found out that if you play the song in mono, the guitar solo sounds totally different. It makes a really weird phase-shifting type of sound and goes out of sync with the rythym section.<br />Mind you that you have to play it in MONO - you can't just turn off one of your stereo channels and get the same effect (if you do that it will sound strange but not AS strange). To play it, you either have to find a receiver that can be switched from mono to stereo, or use cable splitters to run both of your CD player's channels into one channel of your reciever. It sounds weird, and I actually like the song better that way.
B00001MXXH|5.0|I'm 15 and my dad can't stand it but I love this movie to pieces. Not only is Mathew Broderick funny and cute but let's be honest every highschool has a student like this. This is a must see.
B00005YW4H|5.0|don't know why is not the best song on the disk in my opinion.  it was good at first to me, but then it kinda got.......well...really old.  i'm not a fan of jazz, and this cd has not just jazz, but country, a mix that a northerner would most likely not like.ick!!!!  but for some reason this c.d. is so captivating to me.  youll see why when i rate it.<br />1. Don't Know Why: it was good at first, but then it wore away.  i guess the lyrics are the best thing about this song now. 76/100<BR>2. Seven Years: very well done in such a short period of time.  i love the instruments used in this song. 94/100<BR>3. Cold Cold Heart: cover of Hank Williams, and this one is done much better than his icky version. 91/100<BR>4. Feelin' the same way: good song. 86/100<BR>5. Come Away With Me: the best on the c.d. i can really relate to it easily, even though it has some \\"Country\\" in it. 125/100<BR>6. Shoot the Moon: blues, and blues, and more blues, one of the best on here. 99/100<BR>7. Turn Me On: convincing cover. 95/100<BR>8. Lonestar: cool song about getting lost and deserted from your lover. 93/100<BR>9. I've got to see you AgaiN: Desperate singing. 88/100<BR>10. Painter Song: This one faded out of sight really quickly. (good at first) 70/100 <BR>11. One Flight Down: \\"drifts like smoke\\". 86/100<BR>12. Nightingale: 2nd best on c.d. \\"nightingale, teLL me your taaille\\" 104/100<BR>13. Long Day is over: ok song. 82/100<BR>14. The Nearness of You: bad bad horrible cover.  i do not know why people are getting crazed over this horrible song................yuk. 60/100
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Julia and Lena of the group t.a.t.u. put out a great album! They have gotten tons of recognition, and have a totally new fan base. They are all over the place, litterally. The album has a nice mix of balads as well as funk and dance. I think that just about anyone can listen to this album and be completely satisfied.Not to mention the fact that there is Russian on it too. Emagine how many people out there, actually know russian? And how many of T.a.t.u's fans are out there learning the words to they're russian songs? Tons, which says something. The album is great from the first song to the last. Knowing they put so much work into such a great album is inspiring. They broke boundaries with this one....Thats for sure!!!!!
B0000256KE|3.0|If you're about to buy this album thinking that Eno will be playing really wacky synthesizer stuff all over the place, well, he doesn't. I approached this record under the impression that his VCS3 would be everywhere, and I was shocked to find out that it wasn't. In some of the songs (&quot;In Every Dream Home A Heartache&quot;), all he does is treat the rest of the band, and in others (&quot;Do The Strand&quot;), I don't even think he's playing. He does have one solo - in &quot;Editions of You&quot; - but it is only part of an awesome triple solo by Manzanera, Eno, and Mackay.<br />But if you already know and are familiar with Roxy (especially with the Jobson band), you'll like this one. The best tracks are the three aforementioned, with &quot;EOY&quot; providing some really freaky lyrical moments (&quot;Too much cheesecake to soon&quot;, Ferry Yells over the din), &quot;IEDHAH&quot; featuring a great solo by Manzanera, and &quot;DTS&quot; being just plain surreal, which works.<br />All in all this is a great Roxy album. They aren't my favorite band, but the fans will love this one.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Musicals are back baby! Complete with catchy showtunes and choreography. Though the ending is revealed at the very beginning of the film the love story completey draws you in and makes you want to believe that love of that magnitude truly does exist.
B000002KKC|5.0|After 20+ years, this album still sounds as great to me as in did in the 70's. I hear so much &quot;me too&quot; sounding stuff on the alternative stations I occasionally listen to that the uniqueness of this album really stands out in comparison. It's true that there are two CDs worth of material here. Still, there isn't a single song that I personally would want to do without.<br />Some groups are have one great songrwriter. A few have two. Fleetwood Mac is the only group I know that has three (McVie, Buckingham, Nicks) that also happen to be great singers. The three styles are quite different, but complement each other well. Tusk has to go on my list of one of the top albums of the 70's.
0767903862|4.0|I can scarcely remember a book that has made me laugh out loud so many times, and I've read several passages aloud to my spouse.  Overall, I highly recommend it for the same reasons other reviewers do.  The main reason I am writing this review, though, is to warn readers away from the appendix of articles written about the Sydney Olympics.  The articles are overtly anti-American, written with the arrogance of a Yankee liberal who still thinks Boss Hogg is representative of the American south.  I just loved the book, but the appendix nearly ruined it for me.  Their snide tone is quite at odds with the book itself, and they make me reluctant to read Bryson's accounts of travels within the U.S.  And notably, although Bryson brings up the &quot;Aboriginal question&quot; several times in the book, all he can do with it in the articles is mention how Cathy Freeman could be elected pope.  He missed an obvious opportunity to provide a postscript to the book relating how the celebrity of an aboriginal athelete may have impacted the fundamental race problem in Australia.  Do yourself a favor -- read the book, but tear out the appendix!
B000000W5P|5.0|I remember the sheer shock yet complete enthusiasm people had when this record came out. Within months everyone had this album. I consider it the last great, original Stones album.<br />Sure there have been great songs here and there since, but never the complete awesome and original albums the Stones became so famous for. It covers the gamut from hard to ballad, from exploratory to silly... but always uniquely Stones. They just rehash this stuff now. Cannot go wrong w/ this record!
B00005T30L|5.0|In \\"Ghost World\\", a critically acclaimed film based on the underground comic book of the same name, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are the best of friends.  They have just graduated from high school, and while other students are heading off to college, Enid needs to take a summer art class to officially graduate as Rebecca gets a job. In the meantime, they get their kicks by harassing their fellow townsfolk.  But when they play a mean trick on a dorky middle-aged record collector named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), their lifelong friendship begins to weaken as they drift further and further apart from each other.  Over time, Enid discovers the challenges of becoming an adult in a world where she \\"can't identify herself with 99% of humanity\\".   <br />First and foremost: \\"Ghost World\\" is not your typical \\"teen\\" movie.  It is not a scary movie either, in spite of the title.  It is, instead, an extremely difficult film to review.  It is an unusual film in many ways, being both funny and sad.  Nevertheless, I still found myself having a great time with it.  It's a daring little picture with terrific writing and top-notch performances that turn its convoluted plot into something so deceptively easy to enjoy.  <br />I personally could not relate to any of the characters portrayed in this film, but their personalities are so well-defined, and the performances convey all their emotions to such remarkable credibility that I wound up caring for their situations anyway.  Enid doesn't actually know who she is or what her talents are, although she's quite certain of what she doesn't want to be.  Throughout the film she goes through different personalities, including costumes and hairstyles, but none of them really work out for her.  Rebecca is a little more up on her feet, with a better idea of who she wants to be. <br />Yet, at the same time, both girls are so deliciously sarcastic and cynical that almost any 5-minute section of the film will make you chuckle.  (The scene where Enid gets a job in a local movie theater is absolutely priceless.)  The script is so sharply written, going perfectly with Enid and Rebecca's spunky teenage spirit, and at the same time it can be quite stirring when it drives home the realities of growing up.  <br />Meanwhile, Steve Buscemi creates Seymour, another indelible character who in some scenes curses the world for providing such an awful life for him, and in other scenes simply quiets down and accepts it.  Later on, he and Enid learn a lot from each other, and how some things in life just don't go as planned.  <br />But the main reason why \\"Ghost World\\" is such an intriguing film is because there is so much going on and so many little subtleties being thrown at the viewer in every scene, although the viewer doesn't notice it.  The first time I saw this film, I thought the plot was going nowhere in some scenes, when really it was moving quite fast.  The film's title comes from the concept that the old, familiar world of the nowhere-town in which the film takes place is slowly dying away, as it is being overwhelmed by fake 50's diners and malls.  At the same time, it refers to the tiny little 1% of humanity which Seymour and Enid actually can relate to.  All throughout there are references to both \\"ghost worlds\\", ranging from Seymour's record collection to Enid's art class.  <br />Eventually, the film comes to a curious ending that leaves all the main characters in a new state of mind.  The ending doesn't explain much, but it suggests a variety of feelings, including tragedy in one character's case, and hope in another's.<br />There's so much more to this film than what I can explain in words.  I didn't realize what a brilliant film this was until a few days after I saw it.  At that point, I wanted to see it again to catch all the little details I'd missed.  \\"Ghost World\\" is a unique little gem, a refreshingly smart and insightful look at the lives of two girls developing into the adults theywill eventually be.  It is a quiet little film, and only the most intrepid moviegoers will decide to watch it for themselves.  It will not have the same effect on all its viewers, but anyone who sees it with an open mind should have a pretty good time.  If you see it, see it on DVD; the special featurette on the making of the film may help you understand it better afterwards.<br />(Also, if you see it, stay seated until after the ending credits.)
B000068PQ0|2.0|Yes, at first I was astounded at how different a single band could sound in a world full of packaged [garbage], and if first impressions were everything, I would say that this cd is a definite keeper. So, if you're one of those people who buys a cd and listens once, this cd is for you. It has some catchy riffs and some interesting concepts, until you realize that this is what every Flaming Lips cd is like. They're known for pushing the envelope. This is not nearly as weird as much of the stuff they've put out, which makes it not as effective. As for their live performances of the material (yes, I did see them live, and they were outshined by Modest Mouse and Cake), it was disturbing to say the least. They're a studio band, and a poor one at that.
B000002UAO|5.0|Yes it's a classic, and yes, half of them are gone now, and yes, it could be considered overrated...<BR>...but...<BR>...those songs. I'll pick one. &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;. Not one of my &quot;favorites.&quot;<BR>Using my little bud headphones, a double-tracked John Lennon sits right behind my right eyeball. One face looking straight ahead, the other sitting in profile like a Picasso portrait. Paul and George, necks straining, providing harmonious backup further out closer to my right ear. The crisp guitars and the previously unnoticed nimble bass line, spread out behind my left temple. <BR>That's one.<BR>Listen to the rest, and bring John and George back where they belong.
B000001FS6|5.0|I have read some of the other reviews of both the album and documentary, Rattle and Hum, and I have to say that I don't think U2 is given enough credit for this album.  I found their exploration into American music to be quite passionate.  The boys were recovering from the huge success of the Joshua Tree when this was made and any sense of being &quot;pretentious&quot; is probably in reaction to their sudden fame and an obvious struggle to hold onto their artistic integrity.  However, I did think the documentary was sophomoric in their approach to a band with such depth as U2 and that it didn't even begin to explore the inspiration and talent behind their music.  <br />I have every U2 album and this is among my top favorites.  It is an excellent example of their range as a band and also provides a glimpse into their personal inspirations through the musical tributes littered throughout the album.
B000002UA0|4.0|First people should know that this is what Pink Floyd used to be BEFORE it became the big mega-band of the 70s that we all know so well. Almost all tracks were written and sung by Syd Barrett who soon went insane after excessive drug abuse. The album contains a mix of noisy psychidelic tunes which is probably better enjoyed on an LSD-trip, but also some highly innovative songs like \\"bike\\", \\"mathilda mother\\" or \\"the scarecrow\\". I give it fours stars for its originality. Sadly the CD format cannot communicate the full experience of this music, as this would require seeing one of their live performances were they took use of various visual effects which really needs to be there if you are to understand what the noises were all about. A live-video would be a better choice, although the CD is definately worth buying if you like psychidelia or are curious about Syd Barrett.
B000002HMH|2.0|Granted, Metallica are giants compared to any other modern hard rock band, but this cd is simply pathetic compared to any of their previous or following cd efforts. While there are some glimmers of hope in this cd, namely \\"King Nothing\\" and \\"Ronnie,\\" the rest of this cd is the same old stuff from Metallica, but not nearly as powerful. Metallica have major talent and have reinvented the genre, as well as their own look. Released by any other band, this cd would be considered a masterpiece, but Metallica released 5 other masterpieces before it, and they all outshine this hunk of worn-out riffs. It sounds exactly like everything else Metallica has ever written, which is the problem. It almost seems like they were trying to transcend genres (in \\"Mama Said\\" for example), and failing, so they hid the attempt in a batch of same-old-same-old. For the hardcore Metallica fan, this one should be left on the stand. For the newcomer to hard rock, this one is for you: beginners only.
0385503954|4.0|I couldn't believe this book didn't win the Booker Prize while Amsterdam did!!! Atonement is a MUCH better novel and while I still think some of the hype is over-rated, it's definitely worth a read, even in spite of the lack-lustre ending.
B000070WJE|5.0|Fifth album released, including that one \\"Swing While You're Winning\\", and Robbie is still the world's most fabulous pleaser. <BR>The kid's come a long way since his boy band days in Take That back in the 90's. It's been ten years since Take That took over the British charts. A decade has passed...who would have ever thought that Robbie out of all the members would be ruling the charts singlehandedly? <BR>Escapology is a remarkable elevation for the entertainer. A little bit of R'n B, Rock, and those signature Robbie songs and you have yourself a new type of Robbie. A much more musically focused artist. <br />The saga begins with 'How Peculiar'. A rock anthem in the steps of past songs 'South Of The Border', and 'Let Love Be Your Energy', short and easy to digest. Then comes 'Feel' which is by far one of Robbie's finest songs. A dramatic boost for Robbie in the direction of artistic excellence. Elton John, George Michael and Sting come to mind after hearing this. This is the most intimate Robbie song ever caught on tape. The song will move you like no other. And it's no wonder that it was chosen as the first single from the album. 'Something Beautiful' is bubblegum pop extraordinary at its best. Highly influenced by the anthemic blues of Billy Joel and the performance of Tom Jones. This is the first new ground that Robbie covers on Escapalogy. 'Monsoon' is a hard rocking track. Expect this to be a live favorite. 'Sexed Up' is the Angels of Escapalogy. I said before in a review of \\"Sing When You're Winning\\" that it's songs like these that give juice to Robbie's albums. Well 'Sexed Up' is more than just the juice, it is the fruit itself. A beautiful tune. In fact, the highlight of the entire album. With an open message to former love Nicole Appleton, Robbie declares that it was he who broke up with her and not vice versa. Whatever the song is based on, it is a universal message for all those who can't seem to stick to one partner. 'Love Somebody' follows suit. A goodsong where the music is much better than the lyrics. 'Revolution' covers the second new ground for Robbie. This time in the rhythm and blues direction. On this one he duets with an unknown, Rose Stone, and what you get is an impressing sweet tune. 'Handsome Man' is a charmer. A rock anthem in the same theme of past tunes 'Let Me Entertain You' and 'Old Before I Die'. What you can't ignore about this song is Robbie's ego surpassing the norm with lyrics like 'I put the brits...in celebrity' The Ego Has Landed? Actually, it has taken off! 'Come Undone' is where he lands once again. A gentle tune where Robbie proclaims 'I am scum....but I'm your son...I come undone' Britain, are you listening? Next Robbie takes on the freshest new ground that he never covered but only wishes to. America. 'Me And My Monkey' is a spoof on modern day pop culture where the stars are...monkeys? A western theme flows throughout the song that steals the title of the famous John Lennon penned Beatles song 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey' and the storyline of the Paul McCartney penned 'Rocky Raccoon' both from The White Album. The song is weird. Funny weird explains it best. But Robbie sure does a good American accent. One of the albums highlights and at over 7 minutes, the longest track Robbie has ever done. 'Song 3' is a hard rocking jab at Blur's 'Song 2'. Not as good as the Blur hit but worthwhile. The following track on the list is 'Hot Fudge'. This song's got \\"potential future hit single\\" written all over it. Robbie covers the ground he's trying hard to capture again. In the same theme of John Lennon's \\"New York City\\", here he praises Los Angeles in every verse and line of the chorus refering several time that 'there's a green card in the way'. Robbie planning to make the same move that the previously mentioned did to America? 'Cursed' is a low key rocker with a disco orchestration in the background. Whether he is or is not refering to Spice Girl Geri Haliwell in the song, it doesn't matter. Skip! The album ends with Robbie's first ever solo composition titled 'Nan's Song' An ode to his deceased grandmother. A sweet acoustic tune ending the album on a good note that Robbie is a much more talented artist than most people think. <br />Escapology is a staggering effort put together by Robbie Williams and his mate since the very beginning, Guy Chambers. No doubt about it, this pair is one big hit making machine. <br />As for Robbie individually, he's grown and is growing into a dynamic entertainer. Escapology is a step up from his previous album 'Sing When You're Winning'. It's not necessarily reinvention because Robbie needs no reinventing. Straight and simple, he knows how to make good music. <br />Escapology is an instant classic! <br />Highly Recommended
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book!  I thought the premise sounded a bit gruesome and figured it wouldn't be that good since it had gotten so much press, but I found the book hard to put down and strangely comforting. I think that writing from the perspective of the 14 year old murdered girl is what made the book so interesting.  Her yearning for her family and friends were very real.  I also liked the fact that she wanted to help/intervene, but could never do anything but watch.  I don't usually read books more than once, but I've already started reading it again.
B00005JL2O|3.0|I also have problems playing this DVD on a one year old DVD player, except my copy will freeze up every few minutes to a still picture; very aggravating. I have tried two copies of this DVD; same result. However, the dumb thing plays just fine on a new $100 special I bought for a second TV in the house.  Unless you have a brand new DVD player, I would expect problems with this thing.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|I consider this an exercise in \\"artiness\\" -- it's not really profound, the story is kind of weak, but man, oh man. Everything else is so ...gorgeous, it's worth a look.<br />My first impression was that this is like Disneyland on uppers. I mean, *every* scene is gorgeous, twinkly,  opulent. EVERY scene. You can freeze frame every few seconds and admire the artistry in every shot. It's that focused on the beauty of detail.<br />It's also a bizarre blend of slapstick silliness and lush music (with ingenious blends of old and new song, brilliant arrangements and performances). There's fantastic dance and choreography -- and oh yeah -- there's a plot nestled in there somewhere too.<br />I greatly admire the performances of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman too. I thought they were fabulous. I thought their singing was fabulous. They were wonderful, as was the rest of the cast.<br />I recommend this film highly. As long as it is understood that it probably won't deeply move your heart, but it'll impress you and you will admire what it attempts to do. It is an outstanding film. Just not an entirely deep or profound film.
B000053VAF|5.0|In Smith's 4th masterpiece, we join Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as two fallen angels, don't even make me try to spell their character's names. These fallen angels were banashed from heaven many years ago, and ever since have been looking for a way to get back in. So, when a New Jersey church is celebrating it's 100th birthday (I believe it's 100 years) it is believed that if you go through the arches you are forgiven of all of your sins. So, Damon and Affleck believe that if they walk into the church their sins will be forgiven, they then have to cut off their wings (which makes them become human) and somehow die sinless, so they can get into heaven. However, if they successfully do this, all of existance will be unmade, because God is infallible and to prove him (it turns out to be a her in the movie) wrong would unmake everything.<BR> <BR>     So, now the last Zion, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is summoned to stop them from this deed, before it can take place. Bethany is completely taken by surprise when the angel of the lord tell her what she must do. She meets up with the two, so called prophits, Jay and Silent Bob by her job at the abortion clinic. They volunteer to help her, in hopes of getting some action from her later on.<br />    The then meet up with Rufus (Chris Rock) who is the 13 Apostle. He helps inform them that the deamon Azrael (Jason Lee) and three of his minions are trying to stop them, so that Affleck and Damon can make it to the church, because Azrael wants existance to end due to his hate of living in Hell. Rufus also tell them that Jesus was black, they left him out of the Bible because he was black, the virgin Mary had children AFTER Jesus, and they had more children, until there was Bethany, who is the last Zion, who had a cancer rot away her uterous, now she is incapable of having any more kids, which is why she is so angry at God.<br />    Later they meet with the muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek) who helps them on their quest, of sorts.<br />With plenty of wit, and TONS of laughs, I was glued to the TV...when I wasn't in fits of laughter on the floor. Smoth does it again bringing an already long list of taboos (gay love/sex, drugs, necrophilia, etc.) under his belt, but now he adds roligion to that list. This movie is sure to offend deeply religious people, but for people who don't mind the ocassional religious joke, this is a great addition to anyone's movie collection and a very, very funny addition at that!

B00000IQC8|5.0|As rude, low-brow, and dirty as his first movie was Kevin Smith captures a certain spark that he would keep for his later movies (with the exception of Mallrats, which was his comic slump) that were later known as the Jersey Trilogy.<br />   In his first movie, Kevin lets us meet Dante. Dante is the clerk at the local Quick Stop store. He has a girl friend (Veronica,) a pretty good friendship with the next-door, movie store clerk (Randal,) and a pretty good grip on reality.<br />   The whole film is shot over the course of the day, and we begin with Dante being called into work on his day off. <br />   He's exhausted from the night before, and has a hockey game that day. The locks on the metal *shudders* are jamed with gum, so there is no sunlight in the store, and he is forced to make a sign to stick to the front of the store (assuring that the store is in-fact open) out of shoe polish, a smell that people comment on almost every five minutes.<br />   The first customer of the day happens to be a gum representative trying to scare everyone from smoking, and instead, chewing his company's gum. He eventually gets soo many people interested that they start to throw cigarettes at him.<br />   Later, Dante learns of the sex life of his girlfriend, which shocks and disgusts him to no end.<br />   Then we meet the later stars of the next couple movies, Jay and Silent Bob. Already we have the main factors of their lives down; the obsession of pot, hot chicks, beer, heavy metal, drug dealing, foul language, and Silent Bob's one line *inlightenment* that we get, sooner or later, in ever movie. <br />   I don't want to give away the whole movie, but the next hour or so, is one roller coaster after another. Between selling cigs to 4-year-olds, dead ex-girlfriends, hockey games on roof tops, Russian metalheads, weddings, and a lot more, you leave thinking how boring your life is compared to your own.<br />   Although the sound and picture are definatly not the best, they have to due, since this WAS after all, a cheap, underground movie.<br />   All together, I'd say that the movie, as a whole, if very entertaining, and extremely funny. Although, there are some plot holes, and short commings, this movie is incredibly insightful and whitty, for a first movie, and show the true genius of Kevin Smith and what to look forward to in the future from him.
B000066NW0|5.0|You either love Avril or you hate her--there is no in between.  Some believe she is a poser, a fake.  Others believe she is an individual with her own style.  Those who are annoyed by Avril may state that she has no talent, when it is evident that she does.  Avril writes her own music, plays guitar, and has obviously sold a lot of records.  A lot of people need to get over the fact that Avril was the first singer in recent times to break the phony look of a pop/rock singer.  Unlike Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Avril was the complete opposite.  Avril's songs have a pop/rock sound with some punk mixed in.  This album shows true talent and every song is catchy.<br />My personal favorites are Unwanted, Things I'll Never Say, Tomorrow, and I'm With You.  This CD is worth buying!<br />I have to admit that when Avril first became popular, I was against her completely, but it was only out of jealousy...because she is very similiar to me...  but when I gave her a chance I realized how truly talented she is.
B000050HTO|5.0|this but a brief glimpse into the continueing career of the one true master singer/songwriter. god willing there will be many many more essentials coming our way from Mr Dylan.
B00006F83Y|4.0|This review is based solely on the music, not on the little `comedic' DJ babble between songs.<br />I originally only bought `Songs for the Deaf' because the of the Dave Grohl aspect, but Queens of the Stone Age have quickly become one of my favorite bands ever, with or without Grohl.<br />`Songs for the Deaf' is a masterpiece of psychedelic punk/metal music, QOTSA are completely undefinable, and completely original. The music on `Songs' is fast, melodic and best described as dreamy. Josh Homme (vox & geetar) has a great, I hate to say it, stoner-rock voice, he's mastered the high and low notes for an amazing performance. I've tried to play some of the bass parts on `Songs for the Deaf,' but although it sounds fairly easy when you listen to it, I found it's really pretty hard, Nick Oliveri's very good, and is singing, although very strange, is good too. I shouldn't even have to comment on Dave Grohl because, I mean seriously, we all know that Grohl is an extremely talented musician. <br />My personal favorite tracks are `The Sky is Fallin',' `No One Knows,' `A song for the Dead,' `Hangin' Tree,' `God is in the Radio' and `A Song for the Deaf.' What sets this apart from any other album I've ever heard is the backing vocals, they're dreamy `ahhhh's and `ooh's (you'll notice Dave Grohl kind of stole the concept for the Foo Fighters' new CD)<br />This CD is great, I bought all of QOTSA's albums and thing that this one is by far the best, I've recommended it to all my friends.<br />Also I would like to say I am not able to the Queens of the Stone Age enough, if it wasn't for them I would have never discovered Kyuss, one of the best bands I've ever heard.<br />P.S. on the only 4 stars thing, one; it should be 4.5 and two; I did that because I'm truthful, I've never actually heard an album actually worthy of five stars.

B00005QDW5|4.0|This album has it all - the best songs from the pre-David Gilmour, Syd Barrett years, to the post-Barrett, Gilmour/Roger Waters to the post-Waters albums, this album is the best yet.  Those of you who dislike Pink Floyd, one of these days, you will eat your words and come to realize that Pink Floyd is one of the greatest rock bands ever.
B0000027RL|5.0|Shaping the style of 90's rock and roll that spawned from Seattle, Ten is a masterfully crafted, mixed, and mastered LP. Taking likeable minor-chord progressions and turning them into catchy, timeless rhythm-lead licks, the band struck gold with the Zeppelin-esque numbers \\"Even Flow\\" and \\"Alive.\\" The songs sound original even though they are deeply rooted in classic rock, which makes Ten both artistically credible and easily likeable. Also important is the fact that there is no \\"filler\\" material. Every song is bathed in warm, enriching sound, which makes even the hardest rockers like \\"Once\\" and \\"Why Go\\" sensual. And Pearl Jam's ability to restrain and filter their talents to create gentler, calculated numbers like \\"Black\\" and \\"Jeremy\\" proved that the band was capable of stepping outside the comfortable limits of minor-key rock and roll. Vedder's powerful and deeply poetic lyrics also bring Ten to a higher level of contemplation and ingenuity, while the odd but sleep inducing \\"Oceans\\" and the opening and closing psychadelic instrumental \\"Master/Slave\\" hinted at the innovative and unique style of music that Pearl Jam would identify with in their later work.<br />I would highly recommend this album for anyone who loves classic vintage rock and roll. Ten was the first LP I ever loved and it still stands the test of time, something that many of today's bands have failed to do. <br />This is a little punch at the review below...Creed came nearly a decade after Ten was released...
0446604844|4.0|Thought I had run out of good thriller authors to read but when I read Total control I was enlightened. Have since read two other Baldacci novels and have enjoyed all of them. Total Control is a fast paced, interesting story that's both technical and suspenseful without being bland or tedious.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Wow...this album is outstanding. Aquilera has come along way and matured greatly since her first album. Now she has branched away from the pop songs she was famous for and this CD is packed with different genres ranging from hip-hop to soul. 'Can't hold us down' feat. Lil'Kim and her #1 single 'Dirrty' feat. Redman are the predominantly 'hip-hop' classified tracks on the album whereas 'Impossible'(written by the talented Alicia Keys) and the hugely emotive 'Walk away' branch out into the 'soul' and 'blues' category. As said by Aguilera herself, the track 'I'm ok' is the most personal to her in describing the abuse her mother suffered from her father. Aguilera still maintains the 'pop' elements in tracks such as 'get mine, get yours' and the bangin' track, 'fighter.' If you wanna get over someone, just listen to that track- very powerful.<br />I would say, the only reason to why i didn't give the album a 5* status would be due to a few tracks such as 'cruz' and 'soar' which sound rather like B-side tracks. However, overall, the album shows Aguilera's sexual side, and shows she has matured, both in life and in music greatly.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters and story.  I feel that there is not enough movies out there that look into a story like this one did.  It had witty dialogue and wonderful actors.
B00007BH5C|5.0|How do I compare this to The Fellowship of the Ring's soundtrack?  Well, this one is even more integral to the film.  However, it doesn't stand on it's own as well as the first.  That said, Howard Shore has outdone himself with these two scores for The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  All of his work before it seems to be a warm-up to the orchestral brilliance he displays here.  That's not slight his incredible work for David Cronenberg or David Fincher.<br />  Another note.  The trailer music is a re-orchestration of Lux Aeterna, used in Requiem for a Dream, and it isn.'t included here.  That's unfortunate, because that music reaches an intense high that leaves the listener exhausted.  It's an incredibly dramatic piece of music.   Nevertheless, there is some wonderful pieces to be found here.<br />  \\"Gollum's Song\\" is one of the sharpest songs released this year.  It's haunting, tortured, and a perfect compliment to Gollum, the schizophrenic soul who's been corrupted by the ring. \\"The Taming of Smeagol\\" starts off similarly to \\"Concerning Hobbits\\", but goes off in a different direction, more dramatic and intense.  The orchestral flourishes of \\"The Riders of Rohan\\" work extremely well.  Nothing tops \\"The Bridge of Kazad-Dum\\" for sheer power, but \\"Isengard Unleashed\\" comes close.  Along with \\"Evenstar\\", it provides really the only moment of catharsis.  \\"Evenstar\\" may be the saddest piece of music on the two CD's, a yearning and painful melody.  It's heartbreaking.<br />  There are no particularly weak tracks, which in and of itself is something good.  If I say it isn't as good as The Fellowship of the Ring, that's more of a compliment to Fellowship than a slight to The Two Towers.  As is, the music for the second installment is certainly worth your time.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears has become what Madonna was 15 years ago. She has become so popular that she can not be seperated from pop culture and continues to get bigger. Like Madonna again, Britney is calculated and very much a product in terms of selling her image. With \\"BRITNEY\\", Britney gets it right at seamlessly transfroming herself from \\"Girl-Next-Door\\" to \\"Sex-Goddess\\",unlike Christina Aguilera who failed horribly. Britney is a \\"Slave\\", \\"Overprotected\\", and \\"Not A Girl\\". It appears that Britney is finally ready to follow in Madonna's footsteps and continue to evolve with her 4th disc due in late 2003. This record isn't perfect, some songs are a little too cheesy at times, but is very close to pop perfection. With this record, Britney gives a glimpse into her future as the \\"Pop Queen\\" of this generation. She always comes back stronger with each album, just like Madonna.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots are the torchbearers for rock and roll, briding the gap between todays generation and the acid zeplenish rock of the seventies.  This album flat out rocks.  Totatlly original, balls to the wall rock and roll.  &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; is THE best song of the early nineties and &quot;Big Empty&quot; is an odd poeticly challenging monster of a song.  Scott Weilands voice is the heart of this album, pumping raw emotion into the energetic and sometimes erratic music.  Definatly an essential album
B00006HBUB|4.0|Good movie, better than than the cartoons, but more mature.  Great film except at what point in time did mary jane get tunrned into a monstor.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This is up there with some of the best comedy CD's ever. It reminded me a little bit of Adam Sandler's first CD.<br />The guitar work is actually quite good. A distinguishing factor from Adam Sandler. Most of the CD is actually songs, although there is a substantial bit of spoken word.<br />My only beef is that Jack and Kyle only sing about sex and drugs, they don't really expand their horizons for comedic zaniness. All in all, it's a really funny CD, just buy it already!
B00005JKZ3|1.0|The only thing good about this film were the special effects. Everything else was downright awful. It was boring, the acting was bad, the jokes were weak, and the action was uninspiring.<br />I physically hurt just thinking about this film. Please don't waste your time.
630289915X|5.0|With the possible exception of either 'The Wizard Of Oz' or 'The Sound Of Music' there isn't a movie in history that has had more genuine and lasting appeal than 'It's A Wonderful Life'.  Also recognized as director Frank Capra's masterpiece, better than fifty years past it's original release the film still garners new fans with every generation in spite of it's sometimes sticky sentimentality and outdated elements.  I have yet to meet anyone who can resist watching it during the Christmas holiday season at least once; I myself dust it off every Christmas Eve without fail and even watch it occasionally in between.    'It's A Wonderful Life' nearly defies anyone to criticize it accomplishing another rare feat in cinema history.  Though director Capra stacks the deck emotionally forcing the tears to well up in our eyes, he keeps the film well balanced with equal moments of humor, memorable true to life characters and even a dreadful nightmarish sequence that culminates with Jimmy Stewart realizing that life is indeed wonderful (\\"I want to live!\\").  Donna Reed and Stewart are the closest thing to perfection as a couple you are likely ever to see in a film; Capra's stock company of gifted and talented actors round out the rest of the cast.  Each of them has an opportunity to shine in both the comedic and the touching moments, though clearly the focus is on Stewart.  Perhaps the most memorable character in the film though is Henry Travers who portrays Clarence Goodbody (\\"Angel - Third Class.\\") Stewart's guardian angel; his warmth and charm offer a great contrast during the sequence of Bedford Falls without the benefit of George Bailey's lifeblood flowing through it.  Contrariwise, Lionel Barrymore as the despicable Mr. Potter is also unforgettable - he is the only character that remains unmoved and unchanged by George's predicament and resolution as is demonstrated in the terrific finale.    It's hard to imagine this film being produced today and still manage to have allthe qualities present here - just watch (and wince) at the 70's TV movie remake with Marlo Thomas if you doubt me.  All the schmaltz, sentiment and the genuine affection that the characters show for each other would be simply glossed over; in the conclusion Clarence leaves his copy of \\"The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer\\" for George signing it \\"Love\\", a scene that I doubt would make it into a movie being made today.  There are many good family and \\"feel-good\\" movies being made today but they don't begin to compare with this venerable holiday classic.  Here's hoping that Hollywood won't get itchy to do another remake!    Worth noting: in the scene where we are first introduced to Bert the cop and Ernie the cab driver the newspaper one of them is reading has a headline that blares SMITH WINS NOMINATION!; I assume this is a sly reference to the earlier Capra and Stewart movie 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie rock's. It's my favorite movie. I remember watching it as a kid and still love it, ive watched it atleast fifty times and i'll never get bored of it. I had it on tape it it's much better on dvd plus you get alot of extra features.
B00006V9A0|5.0|First off, if your not a Nirvana fan...why would you buy the album in the first place? If your not a fan, dont buy it then rat on about it being terrible. Quite frankly...the true Nirvana fans (like me) know that Nirvana is quite frankly the best band in the world. This album certainly shows and proves that is true. Yes, most of us are upset that certain songs aren't added on there, and quite frankly I would have atleast liked a double disc album with even more of their songs. And like many of you...a box set. But this album is certainly a must buy, and very worth your money. So all you Non-Nirvana fans, dont freakin say bad things about this band, and make peeps think its a bad album. So everyone...Im a true fan, and I am tellin you...BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005JLO2|5.0|I thought that this movie was so well written and performed.  I loved the plot and thought that it was such an inspiring film.  I can't wait for its release!
B000007R1E|5.0|This is the last of the Moodies great albums. Alot of acoustic and electric guitars from the brilliant Justin Hayward. Great piano and mellotron playing from Mike Pinder. They became victims of bad 80's production, (cheesy, dated synthesizers, bad drum sounds, etc.), when they regrouped years later. This mix for 5.1 surround sound is excellent. The instruments and vocals are seperated beautifully. There are subtle differences in the mix, louder guitar parts, for example. Justin Hayward contributes 3 great songs. &quot;You &amp; Me&quot; and &quot;New Horizons&quot; are amoung the best he's ever written. &quot;You &amp; Me&quot;, an uptempo rocker, was co-written with the drummer, Graeme Edge. &quot;Land of Make-Believe&quot; is a gem. Mike Pinder's &quot;When You're A Free Man&quot; is a hauntingly powerful song with great guitar work from Hayward. His openning track, &quot;Lost in a Lost World&quot;, sets the mood for the lp. John Lodge contributes the 2 hits off the album, &quot;Singer in a R-N-R Band&quot; and &quot;Isn't Life Strange&quot;. Two rocking and uplifting numbers. The latter is the best version of this song. &quot;Strange&quot; was rerecorded, not remixed, in the 80's along with &quot;Question&quot; with horrific results. Ray Thomas adds the lovely sea shanty, &quot;For My Lady&quot;. It's not a very generous album, only 8 songs. But, along with &quot;To Our Children's Children's Children&quot;, &quot;On The Threshold of a Dream&quot; and &quot;Question of Balance&quot; it's one of their best.
B000060MY6|5.0|If you see this film a lot of times, and try really, really, really hard to make sense of it, it can be done.  It might not be the correct view, because there might be no such thing, but it can be a view you can live with.  On the other hand, if you do not want to go through all this trouble, it's much easier to find a movie that will explain it all to you.  For those, I hear they're planning to film &quot;Rocky VI&quot;.  <br />This is one of the few films where I'll form the opinion that style over substance CAN be a good thing.  There might be substance to this film, and you can go through the drill described in the preceding paragraph to dig it out, but for those that also like to just drink up film technique, this movie is loaded with it.  Practically every scene, even if it doesn't make sense, right away or ever holds your interest and begs repeated viewing.  <br />Those that give it more chances are rewarded as things become at least a bit more clear.  It doesn't matter that you know the ending, because arguably, there is no real ending.  In fact, it's fun to give it repeated viewings because you can take care of a few of those &quot;Huh?&quot;s you will encounter on the first few viewings.  <br />The only problem I have with it is that the characters are so fascinating I want to see more of them or where they could have gone.  Betty and the director have instant chemistry, and it would have been great to see it develop.  Actually, the &quot;Betty&quot; character is so sweet I could see a completely new movie with her.  As that probably won't happen, I'll just resort to more viewings, where I'll no doubt learn more
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm not a huge music buff, but did like some of the tracks enough to buy the CD.  I played it a lot in the beginning, and it's nice music to have on while cleaning the house.
B00006WUWP|1.0|What makes this movie frustrating is that a lot of work obviously went into it.  This was a big-budget movie, and it looks like they used mega-millions for it's \\"look\\".  Also, different types of gags took a lot of care to construct.  One of the very few gags that works is a cameo appearance by Nathan Lane, looking very comfortable in drag, mouthing the dialog of the chick from Destiny's Child, while said chick is sitting right behind him.  <br />But disappointingly, there is almost nothing else in this film that was watch able to me, and I thought this one would be enjoyable, which the first one was.  The second had it's moments, but was already getting very repetitive.  This one's totally forgettable.  <br />Going back to the careful construction of gags is partially my point.  It was humorous and creative in the first movie when Powers and his lady friend carefully avoided showing genitalia by all sorts of clever tricks.  Well, they kind of rehash that in reverse with dialog here, showing parts of phrases, which start out as potty humor, but are revealed to be different messages entirely.<br />Which is the biggest complaint, which is the writing.  The first movie threw a lot of sexual innuendo into the horny Austin Powers character, who not only came from a more promiscuous time, but had a lot of adjustments to make for modern society.  May of these were clever, but there's none of that freshness now. It's now all been replaced by bad pun after assembly-line bad pun, and it wears thin very quickly.  <br />Finally, the title character villain is as uninteresting a character as one can imagine.  Dr. Evil was a pretty good imitation of James Bond Blofeld character, but for whatever reason, they decide to make Goldmember Dutch.  This leaves room for golden wooden shoes as part of the costume, which is only mildly amusing, but then it takes the character absolutely nowhere.  <br />Like the now-defunct Batman series, this one decided to go the route of expensive sets and high-class choreography.  What destroyed both series was the virtual desertion of any kind of original plot whatsoever.  My biggest disappointment is that while Batman died the death it deserved, this one might be around for a few more installments.
078062999X|3.0|ACHTUNG!  THE TITLE IS SARCASTIC!  TAKE HEED!<br />And so follows the actual review...<br />This lengthy, pompous film is quite typical of Branagh, and I really can't stand it.  If you can, good for you, but I found the Gibson-Zepherelli Hamlet truly much more entertaining AND thought provoking.  So, if you're looking for something more modern than Olivier's excellent version, I'd personally recommend Gibson over Branagh and his 50-year old butler, Horatio.<br />Seriously!  Horatio is supposed to be a fellow university student and friend to Hamlet, and in this movie, he looks like the oldest character!  What gives?  Horatio is, for some reason, one of my favorite characters, so perhaps I make a bigger deal of this than most people.  Still, that casting is a bit off.  And Kenneth Branagh isn't too far behind.  I thought he looked older than Mel Gibson, and a few have complained that Gibson was too old to play Hamlet.  Double standard?  Um, yeah.  (Yes, I just said, &quot;Um, yeah&quot; while talking about Shakespeare.  Deal.)<br />Anyway, my gripes with this film are various.  I think Kenneth Branagh is overhyped as an actor.  He's not horrible.  I'd even say he does a passable job as Hamlet.  He's nothing special though.  Most of the cast around him didn't do much of anything to help.  No one other than the gravediggers stood out as particularly good to me.  Kate Winslet was pretty sad, and whoever did Laertes (No, I'm not taking the time to look it up.) was about as good as my friend, John, in our last homemade film.  That being really really bad.<br />And, Fortinbras somehow makes his way on screen!  That's ridiculous!  The most superfluous character ever (and strangely Italian looking rather than the Norwegian prince he ought to be) somehow gets this extravagant procession and sits in the throne with that smug look on his face.  Bah!  Throw it back!  Fortinbras is only in the play so that they would have a way to get all the dead bodies off stage.  He has no place in the movie.<br />It's Shakespeare, so you know what you're getting.  The story will be of a more than decent caliber.  I just think there are much better versions of Hamlet around.  Shakespeare wrote his plays both to entertain and to make us reflect.  In that sense, the pompous grandiosity of Branagh's films irritates me.  It reflects an idolization of Shakespeare and his work to the point that suddenly it isn't allowed to have fun even whilst whole royal families fall into ruin!  Instead we get overly lavish, Cecil B. DeMille sized Shakespeare plays with static actors and no fun; plays where the sell is that, &quot;It's Shakespeare!&quot; and not, &quot;It's entertaining!&quot;
B00003CXBK|5.0|This anime is the best one I have ever seen.  It is VERY well put together, things flow well, they dont have that run of the mill anime reactions or such, like if one made this into a MOVIE with actors, real places, etc, it could be done almost exactly.  It is easy to follow the basic plot which makes this a favored item amongst children AND adults.  The only problem with letting small children watch this is because there is death and killing involved, but the idea of death is a basic idea in the plot.  Not \\"glorifying\\" death, but the idea of death plays a very key role in this movie.  Even if one does not enjoy animes or \\"cartoons\\", this one goes beyond those simple terms and gives them a new meaning, I have had relatives who despise cartoon movies or animes watch this, and after they watch it, i had 19 out of 23 relatives say it turned out to be a very good movie, the others didnt like it simply because it was cartoonish, but they liked the plot.  Again, young or old, this movie will please you again and again!
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is an action movie with a lot of heart.  It will surprise you in ways that you might not expect, even if you think you can guess the ending well ahead of time.  More than just an action movie, this film should leave you asking a few questions.  Hopefully it engages your brain just a little, because the notion that all it takes is one moment of courage - one choice - to change the shape of the future is a very powerful one that I think many people take for granted.  And, it's not as if what the movie has to say stops there.<br />There's plenty of cool imagery and top-notch suspense and action to be found here, besides the &quot;boring&quot; messages loaded into the plot.  The vision of the future on display here seems so...possible.  It's nothing far fetched, and it's magnificent to behold.  You can see yourself driving down one of those freeways in 2050.  Personalized advertising at malls.  Retinal scanning.  Talking cereal boxes.  It's all relatively believable given current technology.  That &quot;real&quot; nature of the setting helps you to really empathize with the characters in the story, something that has often been a bit of a difficulty in scifi movies.<br />Anyway, I'm getting wordy about what's really just an out and out great movie.  I think anyone can really enjoy it.  It's an awesome experience.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down easily became one of my favorite novels.  Its fascinating plot and beguiling characters could hook any reader, teenagers and adults alike.  Richard Adams, the author, has an extremely incredible imagination.  Throughout most of the story, I was on the edge of my seat, waiting to turn the page to see what befell Hazel and his followers next.  At first glance, one might think that this novel is just a childish story about talking rabbits, but it's so much more.  It reflects human life and character.  Watership Down is tale of rabbits that leave their warren, in fear that a prophecy that their home will be destroyed is true.  These rabbits, lead by   Hazel-rah, encounter many hindrances and dangers in their search for a perfect warren.  When Hazel's group finally finds this ideal home, they are faced with many harsh realities, including a full-fledged war with another warren.  Watership Down has a little bit of everything in it:  suspense, action, drama, even comedy.  The list is endless!  It imposes strong values of loyalty, friendship, determination, leadership, and standing up for what's right.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read, in my opinion, one of the most enchanting novels ever written.  Once you read this book, you will never look at rabbits the same way again.

Two of the best on here include &quot;Rising Son&quot; and &quot;Run So Far,&quot; but all of the songs have great guitar and ukelele work, as well as lyrics that will make you think. His lyrics have something for everyone to identify with, and the lyrics are included with the CD as an added bonus! <br />&quot;If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there,&quot; George sings on &quot;Any Road.&quot; The CD has a lot of similar wise lyrics and catchy riffs. You're sure to enjoy &quot;Vatican Blues,&quot; &quot;Looking for My Life&quot; and &quot;Never Get Over You&quot; as well. And the title track, with its refrain &quot;God God God&quot; will make you smile, too. This CD evokes some of the humor that the Traveling Wilburys CDs did, and George's voice sounds a little like Bob Dylan and Tom Petty's, too!<br />&quot;Rising Son&quot; conjures thoughts of his son Dhani who helped Jeff Lynne complete this CD, and though it is overdone a la Electric Light Orchestra in some spots, it is all fairly close to how I think George himself would have produced it. Obviously a labor of love for Jeff and Dhani. <br />Definitely a must-have for your Beatles solo collection, in many ways it's better than &quot;Cloud Nine,&quot; George's 1987 solo release.
0060523794|1.0|The initial history as presented is interesting, but much of the rest seems to lack consistency with what one reads in the press.<br />Lou Gerstner began his career at IBM with one of the biggest layoffs in history, and finished by moving out roughly equal numbers.  In between the culture changed; the new \\"culture\\" lost more ground to Microsoft &amp; Sun, gave up billions of $'s to upstart EMC, slipped Lotus' marketshare, gave away networking to Cisco, bailed out of the \\"unprofitable\\" PC business while Dell was growing like gangbusters, spun off \\"unprofitable\\" printers via Lexmark, sold off big segments of the business to competitors, etc.  (And now want to get into highly competitive consulting practices.)  <br />I'd like to get an accuracy check of the book from some of the consultants who follow IBM for a living...
B0000029AL|5.0|Granted, there have been many, many rock bands that have exhausted their best stuff on their first album (like Van Halen).  With such a great debut album as this, Aerosmith had a tough act to follow with their subsequent records.  The now classic 'Dream On' was a hit, and now has acheived legendary proportions as one of the best rock ballads ever.  <br />If 'Dream On' was the only good song on the record, this would still be a great album. But there is so much more.  'Mama Kin' is a great rocker, and so is 'Movin' Out.'  The rest of the album is great too.  All in all, Aerosmith's debut album is highly recommended.  Don't settle for just the Greatest Hits--this album is a gem in itself.
B000002UKS|5.0|This is really just one of the most fun to listen to albums i have ever heard. It shifts and changes so much, you really dont know what the next song will sound like, but it will sound great. <br />Oh, and you cant forget the perfectly written line in \\"My Poor Brain\\"...<BR>\\"Sometimes i feel im getting stuck, between the insane and the (***)\\"<BR>that describes my view on the world pretty well.
B0000029AP|5.0|If there was one album that put Aerosmith on the map and firmly established the band, it was this one.  After an awesome debut album and a good follow-up (Get your Wings), Aerosmith exploded with this record, which contains two hard-rock staples, 'Walk this Way' and 'Sweet Emotion,' which almost everyone has heard enough to sing along to.<br />Of course, those two tracks are by far the best on the album, but the rest is good too.  All in all, its a great record from start to finish, and if you can get past the somewhat immature innuendo (like the song 'Big Ten Inch Record'), you are in for a great treat.  No one does classic rock quite like Aerosmith.
B000056HRZ|5.0|This is truely a classic film. It has everything, drama, suspense, comedy, and romance. Very well written. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I have it, and it's cool, but what I want to say is: &quot;HOW CAN YOU SAY &lt;PINK FLOYD UNPLUGGED SOUNDS SO COOL&gt;??? As the band said, 'David Gilmour' doesn't mean 'Pink Floyd'! Is the same as 'John Lennon' or 'Paul McCartney' doesn't mean 'The Beatles'! Sincerely, to say that David Gilmour is the same as Pink Floyd, is not to be a true fan, is to be a stupid. Thanx.<br />P.D. I don't even matter if you reply this message with insults to me, I won't check this thread again.

B00005LOUQ|1.0|I watching this in writing class for a holiday treat.  Everyone was like, \\"Let's watch the Grinch.\\"  I of couse had other ideas, like Christmas Vacation or the Nightmare Before Christmas.  And of couse no one agreed with me aside from my friends.  I really liked the older animated one.  I remember that.  I used to watch that every Christmas along with the other two menchined.  My friend warned me it was almost nothing like the original.  My other friend said that it \\"was garbage\\".  I watched it, seeing some crude humor that Dr. Suess himself would never put in his books.  The Grinch landing head-first in some womans. . . uhh. . . chest?  In a childrens' movie??  The new plot was terrible.  It wasn't special and was stupid.  Putting an orgin to why the Grinch hated Christmas?  It said that in the older film!  His heart was two sizes too small and he hated the noise and food!  It had nothing to do with a girl he was trying to get and ended up embarrassing himself!  Jim Carry just plain distroyed the Grinch's personality.  The older Grinch is cold, menicing, and cunning.  This Grinch is stupid, over hyper, and ferthermore too ideotic.  Jim Carry was awsome in Ace Ventura, but in the Grinch I'm beginning to think he's losing his touch.  I agree with the reviewer from LA.  If Tim Burton had his hands on this movie it might have had a chance.  Too bad.  If Tim Burton did refuse, I don't blame him.  I actually congradulate him.  I did like Max.  He (actually it's a girl dog playing that part. ;) Watch Animal Planet) was a great actress.  Whoever was Cindy Lou Who should get into a different movie.  She was good, but the way the director wanted it kinda blew it.  Her song is not sad or anything, just annoying.  I hate it that when nobody sings in the movie, then all of a sudden they're like, \\"Hey, let's sing an annoying, boring song!\\"  They do, and go back to not singing.  If your gonna sing, sing.  Also the older Grinch theme (You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch. . .) was renewed into something that was annoying also.  The older one was better.  And what's with all of the drama?  It's Christmas!  Drama's for Valentine's day!  Christmas is ment to have something funny or touching.  This is not either of those.  And was it nessarsary for a renew of this movie?  It was fine the way it was.  The animation I loved, since it was from the guy(s) that did some of the Tom and Jerry animation.  I can't belive my class likes this thingamajig over Chevey Chase. . .
B00005RDVW|2.0|I am a Disneyphile and own a lot of the cassettes and DVDs of the animated movies.  I enjoyed Peter Pan a lot as a kid because I was obsessed with the fantasy of flying. I have to say, however, that I am not a big fan of Peter Pan now because of the sequences with the Indians. The stereotypes are more harmful than in any Disney movie, even more so than Dumbo and Song of the South (which, interestingly, is not in circulation in the United States, although it is more condescending than outright racist than Peter Pan.  I think that speaks volumes about the racial situation in this country, that not every ethnic group has made the same strides in civil rights). <br /> Unlike the animated sequences in Dumbo and Song of the South, where characters were simply given \\"Black\\" dialects, in Peter Pan, ethnic stereotypes are given form.  All the Indians have bright red skin except for the beautiful chief's daughter. They are \\"cartoon\\" characters with four fingers and exaggerated body types (again, with the exception of the chief's daughter).  The dialogue is insulting, of the \\"me smoke-um peace pipe\\" variety.  And all the white kids play \\"Indian\\", making the bwu-bwu-bwu sounds, something I really don't wish to encourage in my own children.  <br />I know the movie is a product of its time, but I think that a big indicator of where racial attitudes toward Native Americans stand today that people still refuse to be offended by it and dismiss any condemnation of the movie as politically-correct B.S.  I don't believe it should be changed, because I think it's important not to erase history. But I think its problems outshine its trimphs.  There are dozens of animated Disney movies out there.  I'd rather not have this movie be my children's first glimpse at Native American culture.
0553573403|5.0|Simply the best book I've read in a long time.  I actually held off reading this book when it first came out, thinking that the hype was just that: hype.  At the time I couldn't believe that some new book could be better than Jordan's WoT.  I was wrong.  I bought the Game of Thrones when the second book (Clash of Kings) came out in paperback, and after 100 pages I knew why everyone who reads this book loves it.  Martin effortlessly gives you a dozen characters that you may not love (some are revolting), but you understand them.  No character is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad;&quot; they are simply people, with private motivations, reasons, and prejudices.  Part of what makes these books so great is that the characters are not flawless.  Some likeable characters are blinded by thier pasts, or even thier sense of honor.<br />Another thing about this book that is refreshing is the lack of &quot;magic.&quot;  Not that the world is without any, it takes a major backseat in the plot.  Many stories today have the &quot;magic-user&quot; as some kind of god-on-earth, and rely on him/her to save the world by some miraculous display of magic that only they can perform.  This book has more to do with ruthless politicking than Messiahs.<br />To wrap it up, BUY THIS BOOK! Not to lessen the greatness of Jordan, Goodkind, or any of the others...This series is on a different level.  I know that as you read this many of you're probably sceptical, like I was.  Just try A Game of Thrones, and at worst you'll be out a whooping 7.50.  More likely, you will be floored by this unique book.

630463949X|5.0|One of the best music video I have ever seen. I had seen FM twice before in the 70's, but never up close like this. <BR>I was saddened to learn that Christine had retired after the video. And yes, she did look better in the video than in earlier years.<BR>Great quality video and audio.
B00005JKNF|3.0|The story was fine.  This is very much a 30s Agatha Christie type movie from the servants' view.  However, I had a difficult time understanding much of the conversation.  In the comments section of the DVD, this was explained as a deliberate action in order to recreate more of the servants' perspective.  I thought the technique was ineffective.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is great.The two girls have great voices.They sing songs of love and life.My favorite tracks enclude, Malchik Gay, 30 Minutes, How Soon is Now, Not Gonna Get Us, and All the Things She Said.All the songs are in English except track numbers 9 and 10, they are the Russian versions of Not Gonna Get Us and All the Things She Said.Even thought it has a Russian title, Malchik Gay, is in English except when they say the title.The only thing I wasn't happy with was that there are only 11 tracks, and that's if you count the Russian tracks and the extended version of Show Me Love.One last thing that I disliked was that the enchanced section didn't work on my 7 month old computer but, oh well.Overall, this album is awesome.I don't have anything like this in my collection and I'm glad I added it.
B000079B0A|5.0|Fever was one of the best pop dance disco of the past year and in a while. Kylie took her time to emerge victorious with Light Years in 2000 but even then that record cannot match the panche of this album! Containing the right grooves and enough hi enegry tailored for the dancefloor, this is dance pop at its very best!<br /><br />The revised version appends a second CD of remixes to the original which also has a newly recorded version of Come Into My World, the curent single. While this is admittedly a cash-milking exercise, it is a good one for the bonus CD is really worth the price of the 2CDs. There's the trance club mix of In our Eyes by the famous Roger Sanchez, the excellent Scrumfrog and Fischerspooner remixes for Love AT First Sight and Come Into My World respectively and the Blue Monday-infused mix of Can't Get You Out Of My Head which has now become a classic.<br /><br />Get this before it runs out in stores!
B00005OWEG|4.0|I recently viewed Apocalypse Now Redux on cable, and even more recently purchased the DVD of the original cut of Apocalypse Now.  To anyone who has never seen the movie, I strongly suggest that you watch the original cut first.  It is by far the better movie, and I would easily give it five stars.<br />Naturally, I was chomping at the bit to see the expanded movie.  Who wouldn't be excited at the prospect of seeing so much added footage to one of their favorite films?  And it is interesting, of course, to see all the scenes that were left out.  Alas, they're not very good, they slow the movie down, and, although they do add interesting character development, they dilute the film's power considerably.<br />The French plantation scene is both boring and puzzling, the playmate scene is creepy and incomplete, and such business as stealing the surfboard diminsihes the impact of the preceding scene.  <br />I have no idea what happened to Coppola's judgment.  But the first cut is the product of the vision of the man who made the first two Godfather films, while the new cut seems to reflect the judgment of the man who made the third Godfather movie and Jack.  I mean no disrespect to Mr. Coppola, and I continue to hope that he will yet make a movie that can compare to his towering achievements of the 70's.  But although he has made some good movies since the One From the Heart disaster (I'm quite fond of Bram Stoker's Dracula, for instance), his output of the last two decades no longer places him in the first rank of directors, I'm sorry to say.<br />I guess my basic advice to you is to rent the original cut.  If you like it, then of course, you'll want to see the long version (Redux).  Then make up your own mind.  I'm sure that many of you will disagree with me.  But I truly believe that you'll have a better chance of recognizing that this is one of the greatest films ever if you see it as Coppola originally conceived it.
B00000DGRX|5.0|In 1972 Deep Purple released the third in a trio (the others being Led Zeppelin's Zoso and Black Sabbath's Paranoid) that is now considered the &quot;How to...&quot; guide to heavy metal. 25 years later the Purple strike again, releasing one of the best &quot;remastering&quot; remastering packages ever!<br />I'm going to try to not put much emphasis on the album quality, as anyone who is considering this has already bought the vinyl/tape/CD, and is also a hardcore collector. I will however say that if you are a heavy metal fan, it is your obligation to own this in one form or another, as it contains some of the most influential riffage in rock and roll. Thundering, powerful riffs and solos (Thanks Blackmore) such as the opener to Smoke on the Water, Highway Star, Maybe I'm a Leo, and Space Truckin' have been plaguarized in one form or another by everybody from Aerosmith to Judas Priest to Metallica. At the same time the progressive keyboard-guitar jams throughout the album (particularly Lazy) proved just how far the heavy metal genre could be stretched, and layed down the groundwork for the progressive metal movement of the '80s and '90s. Then there's Ian Gillian, relaxed and more toned down in a genre dominated by over the top screamers. And who could not forget one of the finest rhythm sections of their generation; Roger Glover and Ian Praice. Add in some great ensemble playing and some unique lyrics and you have quintessential '70s rock and roll, and something that every person claiming to be a rock fan should own.<br />Now to the package. This is the first time that a re-release really tried to offer something to the collectors, as opposed to ripping them with this one &quot;new&quot; song on a best of. First off, the originally Machine Head, while a classic, sometimes was a little tinny. With this the instruments are given more breathing space, spread out through the full range of your speakers (which, I should add, should be turned up until you can't hear yourneighbors shouting at you) There is also more depth in the bottom end of the music, giving you clear, resounding bass and drum lines. The album also contains When A Blind Man Cries (a B side which makes its first CD appearance)which shows a haunting, melodic side that is rarely seen in this band. The quadrophonic mixes are also interesting displays, giving the instruments more power (particularly the bass), but less clarity, over the vocals. Then there are the remixes. This is the true gem for collectors. The album is given a more live in the studio feel, with chatter, unheard intros (brief drum solo at the start of Pictures of Home), and false starts. There are also many never before heard instrumental parts, such as the new guitar solo on Highway Star and an extended Smoke on the Water that keeps going past the original's fade point until they completely stop.<br />If you have been a long time Deep Purple fan then this is a must have for your collection. Packed with rarities, killer sound, and some of the greatest music ever, no fanatic could possibly go wrong!
B00005JKBC|2.0|I couldn't wait to pick this one up, but my enthusiasm was quickly abated; expecting the full-throttle excitement of a colourful, booming, state-of-the-art espionage game for my computer, I discovered I'd purchased a wholly predictable and woefully pedestrian Hollywood &quot;thriller,&quot; instead. Here's hoping the schlub behind the misleading marketing is swiftly court-martialled.
B000002TLX|5.0|This honeyed voice , baby faced singer song writer just puts it all on the line, time &amp; time again. Really showing his writing abilities with the talent to sing these songs and baby each one like a child of his own. Well they really are , his voice caresses this collection with such powerful emotion, it makes you  stop and take a moment to realize hey that could be me.Very enjoyable sound that sticks in your head .Sit back and play the whole collection at once or in your car , it will really put you in a great mood.Here richard shows us it's ok to feel or to bare your soul. Take a chance it may be worth it. Another of our gifted musicians from the 80's, shows you a very different but entirely wonderful time. Hold on to the nights!
B00005ASHM|5.0|This is one of the 2 greatest albums ever made.  Pet Sounds and Sargeant Peppers are considered the 2 greatrest albums ever produced, its experimentation with orchestral accompaniment, outstanding harmonies puts this at the top.  It doesn't matter if you're a beach boy fan or not, although I myself am a huge fan, This album should be owned by anyone who thinks they know about music.
B000002I6T|5.0|I can only echo the sentiments of other reviewers here.<BR>This is one of my all time favorite recordings and it<BR>still astonishes me on every listen since it came out.<BR>What astonishes me even more is that this cd has not<BR>been remastered...can you imagine how it would sound?<BR>I really love the Stephen Stills remasters and can only<BR>continue to dream about the day that If I Could <BR>Only Remember My Name is remastered...what a magical<BR> day that will be.

B000002KHF|5.0|The romance and wistfulness that accompanies this Van Morrison album are sure to bring you memories of summer days.  Songs such as &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Brand New Day&quot; have quicker beats.  &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; is retrospective of a warm breeze and you just have to smile at some of Morrison's lyrics that could easily bring back childhood memories (such as in &quot;And It Stoned Me&quot;).  And of course, there is the fabulous love song &quot;Crazy Love&quot;.  &quot;Moondance&quot; is perfect for those who feel like dancing.<BR>As you can see, I have nothing but praise for every song on this album.<BR>Listen to it.  Trust me, you will feel the summer sun on your skin.
0316666343|1.0|I was expecting a very good read, after hearing and reading so many positive reviews on &quot;The Lovely Bones.&quot; Sebold needs to take a different route in her writing.  This is diffently a book you either love or hate.  I will sell my copy to someone.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix could be viewed as a turning point in modern movies. It was the first major production that introduced the idea that the world isn't what it seems. Lots of the special effects were created for the movie. I thought the whole thing was very innovative.<br />Thomas Anderson was a fairly normal guy. He had a day job with a respectable programming company, and he did a little less honest business on the side. The only thing that was wrong was that he was looking for the answer to a question: what is the matrix? Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is, but they can be shown. Somewhat to his dismay, he was shown. Some problems arise, as you may have suspected, and Anderson, better known as Neo, finds a nice violent solution. Generally I avoid 'R' movies, but this one is an exception. I would say that only reason it was 'R' was because of the disturbing, sci-fi themes; anyone without a firm, established belief about life may end up a little rattled by the end of the movie.
B000070WJE|5.0|Robbie Williams comes back with an excellent album for all tastes. Great songs from this cd are \\"Feel\\" , \\"Come Undone\\" \\" Cursed\\", and \\" Sexed Up\\". Definately worth buying.

B00006LHYC|5.0|Following in the heavy footsteps of so many other foreign Divas must be daunting for Italy's gorgeous Laura Pausini, but she takes it in great stride here with her stellar US/ full English-language debut. The songs aren't too different from the usual foreign diva fare but the voice is amazing; clear, confident, soaring and a total pleasure to listen to. Right from the start, with the gorgeous, uplifting, mid-tempo gem I Need Love, Laura Pausini stands out as an Artist to watch and remember. Lead single, Surrender, looks like being a sleeper hit; one of those slow-growing anthems that eventually goes to dizzy pop heights, spreading the word in the same way that I Will Love Again did for Lara Fabian. A great, upbeat power-hit with shades of Michelle Branch and Cher. Surrender is the start. As with every high-profile Foreign-Diva debut, the album is jam-packed with radio-friendly and club-ready hits like the rocking, piano-powered, Patrick Leonard-produced Love Comes From The Inside/ the bright, catchy Every Day Is A Monday/ and the irresistible, girly I Do To Be. Of course, no Foreign Diva album would be complete without some seriously strong and emotive power-ballads. Pausini raises the bar with her chosen anthems: the already tried &amp; tested Italian hit It's Not Goodbye/ the elegant Every Little Thing You Do/ and the Cline-like You Are. At 46 minutes, it's a modest debut that you'll want to play again straight away. And that's how it grows on you! Ok Cline did it first with her break-through Power Of Love album, and Lara Fabian did it with her gorgeous self-titled set in 2000, but what's wrong with another hit-laden, well-produced, big voice, Foreign Diva CD?! Nothing at all! Bring it on!
B00005JKZT|2.0|I loved the first movie, adored the extended version, and waited eagerly for the second installment. However, my partner and I left the theatre feeling betrayed. <br />The Two Towers is not the film that I expected to see. It's obvious why changes were made to the story, but *So Many* changes were made that the story seemed warped. My main issues were with the following things (spoilers minimised):<BR>* the Ents are \\"tree-herders.\\" They care for the trees, and are, effectively, the Forest. They Know what happens in the forest.<BR>* For Aragorn to be injured once is a misfortune. For him to be injured so many times seems daft, and takes away the tension. (Esp. when *every* incident was added to the story.)<BR>* Bits were added for light relief that go against the basic personality of characters, as seen in the books. An army is added for coolness only.<BR>* Faramir is a noble guy. While adding tension heightens the drama, it really goes too far. Much, much, too far.<BR>(Some of the other changes also annoyed me, but not as much.)<br />Admittedly, I'm hypersensitive about this because I loved the original story so much. I didn't expect a direct transfer, but I certainly didn't assume that it would be a complete rewrite either. I'm sure I'm in the minority, but all of my friends who have seen it so far have been at least annoyed by some of the changes.
0380789035|5.0|I read good things and I read bad things about this book and I've read it twice myself.  I read indictments such as &quot;weak writing&quot; and &quot;meanders&quot; regarding American Gods and I just don't get it.  Almost every word and every line in this tale is just as it needs to be; this is truly a marvelous piece of storytelling, one that has held me a willing captive on two occasions now, and I have no doubt that the same will happen once again somewhere down the road.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel was a great book about a young girl who happens to be a necromancer. Necromancers are people that use magic involved with the dead, and they are usually evil. However, Sabriel is a good necromancer, who instead of bringing people out of the dead to follow her commands, puts them back into the dead, so that they can't do any more evil. Sabriel goes through an exciting adventure, after a certain undead creature in the book, and grows during the book as well. The book was very well written, and kept me turning pages well into the night.
0060934700|4.0|No, not every piece in this collection is a gem, but \\"Chivalry,\\" \\"Murder Mysteries (one of Gaiman's finest stories ever, no matter the length),\\" \\"Snow, Glass, Apples,\\" and \\"The White Road\\" are among the very best of a mostly solid set of short stories, poems and miniatures that I'm quite happy to have in my book case.
B00006L83N|5.0|This disc is an amazing mix of hard-driving progressive metal from the New Jersey masters. A new record label has clearly served them well, as their music is not only more focused, but the recording quality is much better. Every song on this disc is a winner, but the shining star is the monster title track, a re-telling of Homer's The Odyssey.<br />If you like progressive rock and you don't know anything about these guys, you owe it to yourself to discover them. If you're a fan of Dream Theater or Rush, then this is the band you've been waiting to discover, and this is the perfect disc for the task.

B000059MEK|4.0|&quot;One More Time&quot; &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; &quot;Digital Love&quot; &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.&quot; One could hardly ask for a better opening set of tunes. We have all heard the opening track, and we all think it is marvelous, but &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; brings us the same dancefloor action that &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; does, and &quot;Digital Love&quot; is wonderful. From that point on, the cd is still good. &quot;Superheroes&quot; and &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; are standouts. Daft Punk has yet again given us an album that is retro-electro of the highest quality. There are a few weak songs and the entire album doesn't hold together towards the end or else I would have given five stars.
0316666343|5.0|On TV, things are solved in an hour.  In real life, they have consequences and effects that go on long after the original event has happened.  This story is how a child's death affects her family, her friends, her neighbors, and her murderer long after the event has happened.  Because it is told from the murdered child's viewpoint, we are able to see things about all of the characters in the book as time moves on.  She is omnipresent and at times omniscient, something a regular narrator cannot be.  A truly amazing work.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Now THIS is what DVDs are all about.  This disc looks and sounds beautiful.  I'd give the audio 4 out of 5, and the visual maybe 3.5.  However, the most important part of this DVD is the concert itself.  This one evening's performance could be the definitive statement of Yes's music.  Forget that Steve Howe's guitar tone isn't very good, and just concentrate on the sound of these musicians as a whole, creating magic in your living room.  Words can not describe how amazing this concert is.  I really regret that I didn't make the trip to Toronto to see them when they come around with the symphony.<br />Now, for criticism(which is what people really want in these rewiews).  The orchestra sadly is not loud enough in the mix (in my opinion)  there are times when you see horn players blasting away, but can barely strain to hear the notes they are playing.  I have to admit, Steve Howe is one of the great guitarists of the past century, but I don't like the way his guitars sound on this recording (with the exception of the acoustics).  Overall, he's got the treble too high, and while he really stands out in the mix (which was probably his intention),  high notes are piercing at loud volumes.  That being said, the DTS track sounds great (obviously superior to the dolby).  Nice low end on this disc, and the bass solo in Starship Trooper will knock your socks off!  <br />Which brings me to another point of complaint:  the layer switch on this DVD is right in the middle of Starship Trooper!!!  Why this happened is beyond me.  They could have easilly put it at the start of the track.   This song may be one of the strongest of the night, but the layer switch gets really annoying.  However, the point of the song where it occurs if probably the best place for it.<br />oh well.  Other low points on this disc are \\"And You and I\\" and the same 3 encores that they've played at every show for the past 40 years or so.  I've seen all good people, Owner of a lonely heart, and roundabout (while all great songs) fail to impress. Perhaps because the orchestra is not encluded on thse songs. Personally I was looking forward to hearing roundabout with a nice string arangement, but no such luck.<br />I've been HIGHLY critical of this disc.  Keep in mind that I've outlined probably the ONLY negative features of this amazing performance.  The vocals are AMAZING, all the harmonies are bang on.  It's incredible to see these old men singing so prcisely.  In response to a review that I just read of this disc, I actually really enjoy the keyboardist's jumping around and rocking out.  He (and the orchestra) added a very youthfull energy to the show.  Jon Anderson gives me chills during Close to the Edge.  Chris Squire rocks out as usuall.. vocal harmonies amazing, but bass playing less precise than in the past.  It's ok though, you can tell that he's having the time of his life (and maybe getting into the drink a little much...  watch the Dreamtime documentary on the 2nd disc, then watch what chris is doing in between songs, and let me know what you think)  but we all know he's maybe the best bass player perhpas ever. <br />I think the guy that wins my \\"coolest dude\\" award has got to be Alan White.  Sure he's wearing spandex, but sometimes you gotta be who you gotta be.  His playing is so emotionally powerfull, it's like he's putting his heart and soul into every beat.  Just look at the expression on his face and you'll understand.<br />all in all, this disc could be the highlight of your music collection, even if you don't consider yourself a Yes fan.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I watched the episode,&quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; and loved it. Now that I have the cd,I keep listening to it over &amp; over. As soon as I got home I put it on my computer so I could listen to it over &amp; over. One of my favorite tracks is track 22,but they are all extremely well done. It's too bad that I have to wait for the box set to be released in order to watch it.Or maybe it will be shown again in reruns.<BR>It is a travesity that Joss Whedon,the cast &amp; the show has not received the awards &amp; recognition from their peers that is so richly deserves.
B00007E8V4|5.0|S.O.A.D does it again with Steal This Album. The cd is a must buy every song on the cd is good from start to finish. If you thisnk this cd ... you should be hung by your feet and beat with sticks
B00006LSM3|4.0|George Harrison's final musical gift, the posthumously released \\"Brainwashed\\" is full of meditations on life, from a man who had accepted his fate and faced it with dignity.<br />The songs here have a strong Jeff Lynne production influence, albeit restrained, reminiscent of 1987's \\"Cloud Nine\\" and The Traveling Wilburys disks.  The usual strummy acoustic guitars are in place, but there is soaring beauty in Harrison's slide guitar and ukulele.<br />The instrumental, \\"Marwa Blues\\" is one of the most spiritually moving non-vocal pieces I have ever heard, full of beautifully arranged strings.<br />These are not songs of resignation, but songs of hope and inspiration, full of George's wry humor.  P2 Vatican Blues features the couplet \\"I wish somebody would tell me...puff of white smoke knocked me out.\\"<br />\\"Any Road,\\" \\"Pisces Fish,\\" \\"Looking for my Life\\" are all excellent pieces, and while the disk might lack the commercial/radio-friendly appeal of \\"Cloud Nine\\" it is overall a better disk.  Even the strident preachiness of \\"Brainwashed\\" is saved by the Namah Parvarti, featuring double-tracked vocals by George's son Dhani.<br />This is timeless, beautifully moving music by a great artist.
B00005JLRR|5.0|Don't miss this one!  We almost didn't go because the promos didn't make it sound worth seeing -- seemed too much like a video game for teenage boys.  But who could miss a chance to spend a couple of hours with Warf, Jean Luc and the gang?  When our most faithful Trekkie friend decided to go, we all piled in the car and off we went.  I am so glad we joined her!  We all agreed -- it is by far the best of all the Star Trek films.  It's fast-paced, exciting, moving, gripping; it will have you clinging to the edge of your seat, whether you're a teenage boy or...a little older...<br />Do take along the big box of tissues, though.  You'll need it bigtime at the utterly astonishing end.<br />Great movie!!!!
068484267X|5.0|Mr. McCourt's style of writing is unique; it's not traditional, but honest.  He describes the characters in the book briefly, because their dialogues, moreso than their appearances, say a lot about their personalities.  I learned about what life was like for the middle-lower class people of Ireland, about their struggles, ways of adapting, and beliefs.  This book truly is a gem.  I'd like to thank Frank for sharing his adventures.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is wonderful. She is mezmorizing. No matter what kind of day you have had Norah Jones brings you home. Romantic and relaxing. I listen to it every evening, especially the &quot;Calgon take me away&quot; ones.

B00006LI4S|5.0|I have always held David Gilmour in the highest regard as a singer and a guitarist, and this DVD shows me why.He can say more with 2 notes of his guitar than Vai or Satriani say in 100!!! His singing remains strong on the old Floyd tunes (you almost wish he had sung the original Shine On You Crazy Diamond instead of Roger!). The two Syd Barret songs are worth the price of the disc alone....superb interpretations!Great musicianship from everyone. Thanks David!!!!!! Shine On!!!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Finally evidence that the NYC music scene is looking up.  We had The Strokes, but now we have something from the other end of the spectrum and definitely as accessable by the masses. I had a difficult time believing these guys were from NYC and not from across the pond in Manchester when I first listened to Turn on the Bright Lights. It becomes easy to compare them to groups listed by others such as the Furs or Echo or yes, Joy Division.... but in my opinion, they have created something that transcends these comparisons with this album. And the term post-punk does not do this group justice. Post-punk should be reserved for those who are. Not for these guys. <br />Vocals are statemental and sang with articulation matching that of a choir boy, and are delivered with epileptic about-to-implode urgentness.  There are several rocky songs on the album, but these are balanced equally with melodic heart-wrenching chruning guitar ballads. This balance is extremely important to the album's integrity when listened to front-to-back...and the fact that this collection of tracks makes for a complete cohesive album without reaching for the skip button is an amazing feat for a first record by any band.<br />You will never need a lyric sheet to be able to decipher/sing these songs in your car on the way to work. And to spite other reviewers here, the lyrics are absolutely not minimalistic.  They are highly detailed and stream-of-consciousness prose to the point of being humorous. My example: &quot;my friend is from Poland, and um, he has a beard.&quot; This sort of lyric is present throughout the album, however, there is an equal helping of sophisticated metaphor as well so don't despair.  The music is beautiful, listenable, and the songs are very well written.<br />If you enjoy bands like Echo, and the Furs, and Joy Division you will probably fall over backwards in rapture upon hearing this album. But if you don't like the aforementioned bands, pick up this album anyways, because you will still like it. Put on your earphones as to not hear the usual suspects saying &quot;they're not worth the hype, they copy past artists, blah blah blah.&quot; Enjoy this album because Interpol are very talented, and make your own decision. I don't think it will leave the vincinity of your stereo for a couple of months.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think Christina Aguilera's new album \\"Stripped\\" is a very strong album showing more of a personal side of her.  Christina has made it very clear that she needed to step back from the public eye and not be \\"miss america's sweetheart\\" and i think she did just that.<br />The song that touched me the most would have to be \\"I'm Okay\\" which is basically the only song on the record that really involves her family.  I think that song moved me the most.<br />However the one song that just makes you want to get up and dance would have to be \\"Dirrty\\". That song is definetly and upbeat song that will stick in your head for a really long time and its also very catchy.<br />I would definetly recomend this album to any Christina Aguilera fans is they hadn't already gotten it or to any young 17 year old male who just happpens to discover themselves and need to come out of the closet.  Becuase I know for a fact that it definetly inspired me to do the same thing.
1586212567|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews, I just want to say this is not 'How to Retire Rich for Dummies'.  This book was my first in the Rich Dad series, so I cannot compare it to the others.  Personally, I found this book enlightening and inspiring.  The author is writing to intelligent individuals to spark desire and motivation, not teach step by step instructions.  I am planning to read other books by this author.  For those who say the author is trying to sell more products -- might I suggest going to your library and borrowing them instead.
B00001OH7U|3.0|The songs on this CD are much too long.  They aren't too bad, it's just that you get sick of them before the song ends.  Another problem I have is the lack of songs.  With only 6, it makes you feel like you paid full price for half a CD.
0060516070|5.0|The content of this book is very timely and applicable to anyone who is considered to be a 'knowledge worker'.  Regardless of title, the knowledge worker really is an executive.  Several pages in the first chapter are dedicated to setting up this argument and scoping out the audience.<br />Drucker is very methodical in laying out his 5 principles of effectiveness.  These are the basis for his two arguments in the book - executives must be effective and effectiveness must be learned.  In each chapter that supports his principles, he lays the foundation for the principle, builds walls around it with countless real-life examples, and then drives them home with even more real-life examples.<br />Perhaps the greatest asset within this book is the rich examples that Drucker has provided.  He is the oracle of management that has real experience as a strategist and theorist. He has no qualms with hitting common textbook theory head on in his books and has countless examples to back him up.<br />One drawback is that it can become tiresome to read some parts.  Drucker really drives home some points and if you've already got it, you lose appreciation for the extra examples.<br />Ok, so it's not like reading a Grisham novel, but I promise you will take some valuable nuggets away from this book that can help you in building your career.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is one of the best CD's ever created.  Falls somewhere between the Beatles, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Pink Floyd the Wall.  Bowie's 80's era has always scared me away from purchasing his music.  After listening to this CD, I have bought almost all the rest of his collection.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I love this film and think it's a solid adaptation of the book, especially the fantastic art direction. The DVD, however, is a bit of a disappointment because there are no audio tracks for commentary, and the deleted scenes are nearly impossible to find. Instead of allowing the viewer to select the deleted scenes, they turn it into a game, and the game is very confusing. I gave up, rented the video, and watched the scenes on that. All of the special features are on a second disk. So far it's seemed like to much work to get through it. I'm glad I got the DVD since the art direction and cinematography deserve the clearest medium, but I think the project manager was a bit over-ambitious and knew nothing about human-DVD interaction. Pushing buttons in the hopes that something will happen certainly isn't my idea of a good time, and that's exactly what you have to do because there are no buttons on screen, just arrows as in &quot;go here&quot; or &quot;go there&quot; through corridors kind of like a DOOM game.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This CD shows that the music relates to all ages and Elvis has certainly shown that nearly 25 years after his death.  Regardless of the changes in the musical structure and the instrumental structure of the new millenium, he still shows that he appeals to all ages.  I have a large number of his recordings, and I should know!  I understand that there is a lot of comparison among different styles of music, but Elvis still outshines them all!  Great work!!
B000070IXT|5.0|I have to say I was expecting a blood bath out of this movie esspecially with movies that are out today, but the blood is not as big of a factor as I thought it would be, considering the games and previous Zombie movies. This would be easy to be thrown away as another Tomb Raider or Mario Bros.. But this acttually has story and can still satisfy die hard fans of the video game series. This is a must have if you are a fan of video games or for that matter Milla Jovoich getting wet in a red mini skirt.
B000003TA4|4.0|I've heard numerous reports on how good this Album was and now I understand.  Just purchased it the other day and it's all that's been played on my CD player.  Next to come will be their Greatest Hits.  So many records following on have tried to copy the 'Nevermind' way but alas it isn't possible.  The albumis truely unique and we may not see one of it's kind ever again.  It's a refreshing change from the constant pop banter that we hear these days.  To bad that I was only 6 years old when this Album was released, I might have understood why it had such an effect on so many people.  The brilliant tunes of 'Smells like Teen Spirit' 'Come as you are' &amp; 'Lithium' are pieces that could be played over and over again without a problem.  But it's some of the songs that dont receive as much promotion such as 'Breed' 'On a Plain' and Stay Away' that make this Album an absolute Killer.  The subsequent suicide of Cobain and the persistent legal Battle for the control of what was to be released next has done nothing to erase the popularity of this Album.  They may never sing again but the Nirvana legacy will remain alive forever.
B000069AUI|4.0|I remember when I first heard &quot;clocks&quot; my brother and I argued over who it was. I said it sounded like coldplay, he said U2. The new disc is not quite as smooth as Parachutes, but it is a wonderful follow-up. &quot;Clocks&quot; gets huge air play in Washington, D.C. and I believe this will be Coldplay's signature song! The piano/guitar is breathtaking, you can close your eyes and this musical masterpiece will take you anywhere!
B00003CXRM|5.0|The George Clooney you loved in &quot;Three Kings&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; is back and better than ever, playing the role of Ulysses Everett McGill.  John Turturro, who you may remember from &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and &quot;Quiz Show&quot; adds humor as the character of Pete, and even John Goodman (who recently did the voice of Sully in &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;) made a small appearance in this film.  Playing the man who is engaged to marry Everett's ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) is none other than Ray McKinnon, who, in 2002, won an Academy Award for his short fim &quot;The Accountant&quot;<br />This is a truly great fill with a star-studded cast that will keep you laughing until you are in stiches.
B000000P11|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that no matter how much my musical tastes change, I still enjoy. It's a shame that The Chameleons didn't get the attention they deserved back when this was released. I believe Strange Times might be the best Chameleons LP for a neophyte, though there's really so much out there you'll have to try around to find what suits you - but it's all very much worth it.
B000002KBH|1.0|This is an incredibly mediocre album.  It's one-dimensional, Jerry has a weak voice, and it's all together one of the most overrated bands in America.  Just because they went more commercial and have more merchandise than any other band, that doesnt make then the best.  A true rock 'n' roll fan would recommend ANY album by &quot;The Band&quot; as opposed to this... I suggest &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; or &quot;Cahoots&quot;
B00004RF9I|5.0|For reasons I struggle daily to understand, this movie has been all but forgotten. I never hear it mentioned by my peers -- even huge film buffs I frequently speak with have told me they haven't seen it. Why?<br />Every great movie begins with a great script, and that's what screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky had when he penned this dialogue-heavy satire of network television in the late 70's. But the script alone would not have sealed the deal, for it would take a truly talented cast to bring to life a script of this caliber.<br />And, boy, did they land a superb one. William Holden (\\"The Wild Bunch\\", Best Actor: \\"Stalag 17\\") plays a network head ready to hit retirement when he is told he must fire network news anchor and long-time friend Howard Beale (Oscar winner for this role, Peter Finch). Beale's nationally-televised response is hilarious and gives rise to a series of televised rants, including one of the most famous moments in movie history, the \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\". It isn't long after that Beale has become a national TV sensation.<br />As great as this moment is, the rest of the film is hardly ever mentioned (though it did secure a spot in AFI's Top 100 Films of all time) despite sizzling performances by Faye Dunaway (in an Oscar-winning role) as the television-obsessed Diana Christensen, Robert Duvall as the \\"take no prisoners\\" Frank Hackett, Ned Beatty as Arthur Jensen (in THE smallest part to ever garner a Best Supporting Actor nomination), Beatrice Straight (who also won an Oscar) as Holden's wife, and Marlene Warfield as the \\"[.....] Commie ______\\" Laureen Hobbs!<br />I urge you to rent first, then buy one of the greatest American satires ever made and winner of 4 Oscars (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay) and nominee for 6 more (including Best Picture, Director and Cinematography)... \\"Network\\".
B000023VR6|5.0|Truly a fantastic album.  There is really nothing in the world that can really match chillin' in your room listening to &quot;Let's Get High&quot; while you're doing that very thing.  No fan of hip-hop should be without this album.

B00005OAIE|4.0|you cannot define great music based on the complexity of the words it contains in its lyrics. it is possible for a simple phrase that tries to be no more than it is, or that has a hidden beauty or meaning, to affect a listener emotionally when it is interwoven successfully with a beautifully harmonized melody. the lyrics of this album may not connect with many listeners who unfortunately do not comprehend the simple beauty of words that, in their plainness, enhance the beauty of the music and leave emotional room for the music to work and develop. i personally found john mayer's lyrics genuine, meaning that they effectively conveyed the emotions he was trying to share with his audience. isn't that the purpose of all music? i believed the majority of his songs were both harmonically compelling and well-structured, the manifestation of a creative talent that, if not full-blown genius, is still an all too rare find within the limited popular music environment that the majority of this country seems to appreciate.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Simply an incredible album.  With the drinking/smoking anthem &quot;Gin and Juice&quot;, &quot;What's My Name&quot;, and tons of other, this CD is essential to any hip-hop collection.  Snoop was clearly in his prime here, and although he has put out quality track since, none come close to Doggystyle.  This album features Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Warren G, and many others.  You won't regret purchasing this one.
0151006903|5.0|We write the year 1204, and the Fourth Crusade is about to hit Constantinople. And there is Baudolino, youth of simple peasant stock, who is a stellar liar and linguist. This aptitude at languages brings him to the attention of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa who will keep him nearby. Barbarossa later sends him to Paris to study, and Baudolino takes up with some strange characters. But soon he has a new goal to pursue: Finding the Holy Grail and to bring it as a present to Prester John, the fabled Christian ruler over the Orient. And so our hero goes traveling from West to East, finally returning to his native village. Barbarossa has drowned in the meantime, and Baudolino tells most of his story to the Greek historian Niketas Choniates.<br />As usual, Mr. Eco will have his fun, and that in various languages. He guides us through long philosophical discourses and tries to pull the reader's leg now and then. One has to get joy out of this in order to call this a wonderful, intelligent book that is so very worthwhile reading.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|WOW! Thats what i gotta say. These two girls are not only controversial but extremly talented. There electro/techno beats will be sure to beat the crud outta britany in the US. There alreayd being played on the radio like crazy in nyc.... the only problem is they might be a little to contreversial for the us.... in the 30 min video one of the girls has a bomb in her back pack in school. and put it in the bathroom window..... but i haven't seen the res tof it maybe she stops it...... EHH WHO KNOWS! but i gotta say there music is great!!
B000001FN3|5.0|1976's &quot;Tales Of Mystery &amp; Imagination,&quot; a concept album based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe, is the album that started it all for the great studio group known as The Alan Parsons Project, and it arguably remains their best work (even Alan Parsons himself names it as his personal favorite Project album). &quot;Tales&quot; is a spellbinding prog-rock classic, filled to the brim with outstanding drama, moods, sounds &amp; atmospheres, as well as tremendous musicianship, singing, songwriting, &amp; production. Who'd expect anything less from a group led by the man who engineered the Pink Floyd classic, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;?The opening instrumental, &quot;A Dream Within A Dream,&quot; is an astonishing slice of dramatic progressive rock that instantly grabs you, and it sets up the rest of the album perfectly. &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; (featuring wonderfully insane vocals by Arthur Brown), &quot;The Cask Of Amontillado,&quot; &amp; the Project's first hit, &quot;(The System Of) Doctor Tarr &amp; Professor Fether,&quot; are all Project classics. Then comes the album's centerpiece, the sprawling, adventurous instrumental take on &quot;The Fall Of The House Of Usher,&quot; complete with orchestra &amp; sound effects. It's simply a mindblower. Finally, the album concludes with &quot;To One In Paradise,&quot; a truly gorgeous song that leaves you breathless. This CD version of &quot;Tales&quot; is the 1987 remix version, in which Alan Parsons added some extra keyboard &amp; guitar parts, as well as a pair of marvelous narration pieces by Orson Welles, in order to strengthen the album for it's 1987 CD release (not too unlike what George Lucas did to his &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies for their 1997 re-release). Although I have tremendous affection for the original mix of the album (only released on the Mobile Fidelity Gold CD version of &quot;Tales&quot;---good luck trying to find one), this 1987 remixed version has beendone with a lot of great care, and Alan Parsons has definitely kept the beauty &amp; integrity of the original album intact.The Alan Parsons Project have released so many terrific albums over the years: &quot;I Robot,&quot; &quot;Pyramid,&quot; &quot;Eve,&quot; &quot;The Turn Of A Friendly Card,&quot; &quot;Eye In The Sky,&quot; just to name a few. They're ALL worth adding to your CD collection. But if I had to pick the Project's masterpiece, I'd have to go with this one. &quot;Tales Of Mystery &amp; Imagination&quot; is a truly groundbreaking prog-rock classic. :-)
B00005YXZH|5.0|You do need to listen to this album a couple of times before really appreciating how good it is.  This album is definately different from what you hear on the radio, because the songs are actually good and there is substance to the songs.  It's definately hard to state what exactly is great about the album, because it is different for everyone.  It's one of those CDs that you can listen to a year from now and still think it's great.  I don't think everyone will like this album or this band, so I do suggest listening to the songs a couple of times before purchasing the CD.  But if you do buy this CD, I think you'll find it to be one of the best CDs you've bought in a long time.
B0000640VO|5.0|An absolutely super film, slightly abstract and surealistic.
0316776963|2.0|I would have given his book \\"Naked\\" four stars, because the stories were well written and funny.  This collection, however, left a lot to be desired.  Attempts to attain a level of profundity fell far short, and I think the author realized this because he threw in a fart joke (or something of the like) every time in a shameless attempt to distract the reader from the mediocrity.  It is a tragedy that many good writers have to self publish their work and struggle to get it read by a handful of people while works like this win awards.  I give it two stars because of the story of the American in France who listens to a group of people talk about him in French while he sits and understands every word.  That scene was handled with grace...then came the fart joke.
0345440803|2.0|I am an avid reader of baby/toddler rearing books and this one is the worst so far.  This seemed to be the gist, &quot;This is what I did with my children and I am right, so you should do it this way too.&quot;  Okay, this is not to say that there weren't a few tidbits of good information.  You just have to weed/read through a lot of junk to get to it.  Not enough fact/scientific facts to back up opinions and suggestions.  Sorry, but overall, THUMBS DOWN.
B000002P2V|3.0|With the exception of the title track, the original material on Who Are You is just not compelling.  In fact it's just not very good.<br />I find the extra material more interesting (No Road Romance for example) but it's not really worth the price of admission.  Borrow a copy first and see if you agree.
1402532903|3.0|If given the chance to come back to Earth after death, what would you choose to do? Sleep? Can the dead influence the death of others? These questions haunted me along with Susie, the main character who narrates from Heaven. <br />The thought of the dead among us is intriguing, along with the thought of Heaven being what you want it to be. I wanted to know more about Susie's Heaven, though, and it was woefully abandoned for most of the story. What happened to her \\"guide\\" through Heaven? <br />I guess I'm neutral on this story.
B000002OX7|5.0|I have heard virtually every song on this album a dozen times or more from FM radio play in the 70s, but I took it with me on a cross-country trip recently ... I don't know how many times I listened to 'My Wife' imagining it redone as a moderately heavy dub tune.<br />A classic, transcends its time.  Roger Daltrey was at the peak of his vocal form.  He really *worked* at his singing here, unlike many later efforts where some are good and some are not so good and some are just bad.  (Maybe he was just too deaf by then.) The bonus tracks are interesting but not always compelling.  The &quot;original&quot; album is plenty good enough.
B000068TSI|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" seems to me to be the best attempt yet to look at the war in Vietnam from the view of both the American and the enemy combatants and the families who inevitably paid the full price in the long term. Then Colonel Moore's pledge to God, his men and their families that \\"I will leave no man behind ... dead or alive. We will all come home together. So help me God.\\" is the true highlight of this movie. Why did the United States government and its people settle for less than Lieutenant General Harold G. Moore when it came time to select an officer to command our decades-delayed efforts to bring home the missing men abandoned on the battlefields of Southeast Asia?
B00005JKZT|3.0|The Fellowship of the Ring was one of the best films of 2001 (maybe the best) and one of the most engaging adventures I've ever seen (lagging behind only the Indiana Jones series in this respect).  It's unfortunate The Two Towers fails to follow in the suspense, thrills, and emotional sweep of the first installment.  Overall, it's a decent movie (thanks mostly to its ties with the first film) but this is definitely a terribly disappointing continuation.<br />As I stated before in my review for Fellowship, I have never read the classic Tolkein novel, thus my complaints have nothing to do with comparative discrepancies.  What I see wrong here is my belief of what are some poor filmmaking decisions.  Much of the appeal of Fellowship was that it was about a small group of a quest that ventured into the unknown, an odyssey full of suspense, thrills and chills.  A surprise lay at every corner, whether it was a riddle, monster, or barrier hindering the journey.  Virtually all of this is lacking from The Two Towers.  It's simply a \\"gather as many people together and deliver a big battle\\" affair that fails to hold interest.  Some of the slower moments are harder to slog through than my typical day of chemistry class. <br />As just an average moviegoer, what else did I find wrong with the film?  First, characters pop up on an infrequent basis and then disappear almost as quickly.  Sure, the lead cast is still interesting (particularly Legolas and Aragorn) and the additions of Gollum and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) aid the film during its slower moments.  But most everyone else is a nobody to me, their names uttered too quickly for me to remember and killed off too quickly for me to even bother caring (the king's son, who was he and why did the director think we'd care about his death, given we never even saw him alive in the first place?).<br />Director Peter Jackson films at least two dozen scenes in slow motion, obviously meant to be dramatic, but most of these moments once againinvolve characters we don't even know (particularly the slow-mo death of one elf during the battle of Helm's Deep).  Such scenes weigh the film down and give it an agonizingly slow pace.  As for the battle of Helm's Deep, that was perhaps the biggest disappointment of all.  Waiting nearly two-and-a-half hours for the climactic battle, it's unfortunate to see Jackson mars this lengthy sequence with quick-cut editing that turns the sword clashes into a blur.  Intercutting the battle with two other subplots only destroys whatever momentum the spectacle had been building up.  <br />Yet, with all my complaining, there is still much I admired.  The performances are still first-rate, the special effects are mostly excellent, and Howard Shore's score is the most rousing since Vangelis' Conquest of Paradise piece.  The Two Towers lacks in action/adventure and rarely engaged on an emotional level, but it's a movie that's nice to look at, often fairly easy to appreciate, and there's enough breathtaking cinematography to keep things afloat for awhile.  But it's three hours long, hardly energetic enough, and an anti-climax when it should be revving up on the suspense.  I sincerely hope The Return of the King atones for The Two Towers, but I have my doubts.
B00005QIPH|5.0|But everyone has to admit that its a great cd and the lyrics are good too. I listen to the cd like 2 or 3 times a day. I still havent gotten tired of it. People are like &quot;no, I'm not gonna listen to this because there all a bunch of posers!&quot; its not like that at all. Just because someones parent is famous doesnt mean they got help from them at all.But I dont know. All I know is that I love the cd and I enjoy spreading the word about The Strokes. I cant wait until there next cd comes out.
B00005NTJM|5.0|As Ian Anderson intended to convey by the title of this album, \\"this was\\" the sort of music Tull were making in 1968.<br />Having reshuffled a few times (and changed names a few times, too) from the \\"John Evan Band,\\" Tull at this time consisted of Ian Anderson, guitarist Mick Abrahams (later of Blodwyn Pig), bassist Glenn Cornick (who remained with the band through _Stand Up_ and _Benefit_), and drummer/percussionist Clive Bunker (who stuck around through _Aqualung_). Anderson, who to this day describes himself as a frustrated guitarist, had recently switched to the flute, an instrument on which he figured (correctly) Clapton wasn't likely to outclass him anytime soon. (He had also invented a wee beastie called the \\"claghorn,\\" a flutelike instrument with a mouthpiece like a saxophone. Jeffrey Hammond made it, and Anderson plays it on \\"Dharma for One\\".)<br />People who know only the later Tull may be surprised by this album. It's mostly blues; Anderson swaps off on harmonica and shares both vocals and cowriting credits with Abrahams (a fine blues guitarist who wrote \\"Move On Alone\\" by himself and is credited with the arrangement of the traditional \\"Cat's Squirrel\\"). There's also a cover of Roland Kirk's \\"Serenade to a Cuckoo\\" (which Anderson says is the first song he ever learned to play on the flute) and the aforementioned \\"Dharma for One\\" (a live version of which appeared on _Living in the Past_ a few years later). Most famous, perhaps, is \\"A Song for Jeffrey,\\" since a song involving Jeffrey Hammond appeared on each of the first three Tull LPs. (Hammond wasn't yet a member of the band; he replaced Cornick as of _Aqualung_.)<br />Good stuff, at any rate, and this recent remastering is well done. The bonus tracks are good too -- a short \\"tribute\\" piece (by Abrahams) to John Gee (manager of the Marquee Club), plus two songs that longtime Tull listeners will recognize from _Living in the Past_. The sound quality is excellent throughout.<br />As of _Stand Up_, Anderson started moving away from blues-based material and toward the stuff we now know as classic Tull. After this album was released, Abrahams departed and was replaced (briefly) by Tony Iommi (later of Black Sabbath), then (permanently, thank God) by Martin Barre. As of _Benefit_, Anderson's writing had taken a darker and somewhat more cynical turn, John Evan had (re)joined them, and Barre had begun to establish his own guitar style. After that, of course, were _Aqualung_ and history.<br />But _This Was_ isn't just a glimpse at the beginnings of a great band; it's also in its own right a successful album of British blues. Add it to your Tull collection if it's not there already.started moving away from blues-based material and toward the stuff we now know as classic Tull.

B000021Y74|5.0|This is a great german movie. The main character, Lola, has to get 100,000.oo marks in 20 minutes for her boyfriend, Manni. She will do it one way and there will be a different endding. Three times she does it. Each time it starts over and she makes different choices. All the time she is running. It shows just one little choice you make will change the out come.
B00006JKOM|5.0|This old Tull release was written during a transitional period for the band; among other things, Jeffrey Hammond had left and been replaced by John Glascock (who died tragically a few years later).<br />For Ian Anderson too, these tunes were something of a departure. Having already tried his hand at a surreal-parody \\"concept album\\" (_Thick As A Brick_) and a more serious one (_A Passion Play_, plus the previously unreleased tracks on _Nightcap_), here he attempted a stage musical. The musical itself was never performed or even completed, but this album was released.<br />It's always been something of an oddity in the Tull catalog and fans' attitudes toward it have been deeply divided. I'm surely not going to settle any arguments here; all I'm going to say is that I like it just fine myself. (I also enjoy the guest appearances, especially the backing vocals by Steeleye Span's Maddy Prior on the title track. And I hope someday someone writes a complete history of the cross-fertilization among Tull, Steeleye, and Fairport Convention.)<br />The main reason I'm reviewing it now, in fact, is to comment on the high quality of this recent remastering. It's terrific; the recording is clearer and crisper than the original release, and the two extra tracks are a hoot. (\\"A Small Cigar\\" is also on _Nightcap_, but I'd never before heard \\"Strip Cartoon\\". It's on the twenty-year anniversary collection, but I haven't got that one.)<br />If you're new to Tull, you probably don't want to start here. Personally, I'd recommend beginning with _Songs from the Wood_ and _Heavy Horses_, which I think are their two greatest albums. But don't let all the bad things you've heard about this one put you off; Anderson's/Tull's worst is better than most bands' best. Give it a listen and make up your own mind. Anderson & Co. have always demanded a lot from their listeners, including a willingness to pay extra close attention when Anderson steps outside of his own cliches.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I have watched all three of the series, and I do believe this one held my interest better than any of them. It was more realistic and believeable.  The series had a continous stroy plot from beginning to end.  It had the best final episode of the three.  It left me with a feeling of loss that it was over. I was hoping that That it would go on with episodes that let people know where all the players eventually went and what they were doing.  I think that the last part of the last episode left a feeling of some kind of later re-invilvement.
B00005JKCH|5.0|\\"Spider-Man\\" is the best movie based on a comic book hero since 1978's \\"Superman - the Movie.\\"  That's not to knock the first two \\"Batman\\" flicks, but Sam Raimi's film based on the school geek turned crimefighter packs a greater punch of thrills and magic unlike anything I've seen in a while.  Also, like \\"Superman,\\" \\"Spider-Man\\" has a charming innocence that can make even grown adults believe in superheroes.  Tobey Maguire has a reputation for bringing to life offbeat nerds, whether the films are \\"Wonder Boys\\" or \\"Cider House Rules.\\"  But here, Maguire hits the bullseye as Peter Parker, the brainy student who has the hots for the girl next door (Kirsten Dunst).  When Parker gets accidentally bitten by a spider, his body changes and he learns of his true calling.  But every hero has his nemesis, and in this film, Spider-Man's sworn enemy is the nasty Green Goblin, played to the hilt by Willem Defoe.  Raimi does what many other directors fail to do: make a compelling summer movie that doesn't reek of corporate stench.  The special effects are cool, but they take a backseat to the storyline and the cast which make up \\"Spider-Man's\\" greatest strengths.  On its own merits, this film really earns four stars, but the loaded quality features force me to give it an extra star.  However, the picture quality for a movie this recent is fairly disappointing.  Many of the images look a bit pale and washed out, though the surround sound is sure to rock your system.  I had long avoided \\"Spider-Man\\" because it looked less like a movie than a shameless money making machine.  But it's far better than it appears.  Give it a try and get yourself caught in the web.
B000002ORU|2.0|I agree with \\"D\\" in the spotlight section, the Who blew it. This has added to my growing disintrest in the band. Following the disturbing news about Pete Townshend, I re-evaluated my like of the Who and thought, what a bunch of crooks! All the super groups have released several hits collections, but at least Hendrix and the Stones were decent enough to make the old ones go out of print, to make them at least worth having if you bought the old one. The Who don't, there are currently 4 (including this one) greatest hits sets avaliable by the Who. <br />That's just what this set is, a glorified greatest hits set.<br />But what I found really irksome was the terrible editing/enginiring/linear notes/\\"Who diary\\"/intro by Pete Townshend which is pumped way to much. The spacing is terrible, one song starts while the previous one is still fading out, and some of these songs aren't songs i.e. \\"Bag O'Nails\\" is just the band saying \\"look at the bag of nails\\" then it fades out. They include \\"single edits\\" aka horribly edited versions of \\"Who Are You\\", \\"5.15\\", and \\"The Seeker\\" <br />This set isn't all it says it is. At first I thought it was wonderful but upon my recent re-evaluation I can see for miles.<br />So if you want some advice, don't buy it. It isn't that Townshend has totally turned me off to the Who and now I hate them and just rail on their stuff, but I am no longer an avid fan. <br />This set might be worth it if it was only $30 or $40 dollars, but it's not. So don't get fooled again!
0618154043|5.0|Anyone who knows and loves the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, knows that he died leaving most of his work unfinished and unpublished. He was constantly rewriting and rethinking different parts of Middle-earth's history, and has left us with many different questions that will never be answered.<br />After reading The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion, many readers are amazed and stop here announcing that Tolkien is a true genius (if they even reach this point), but there are some of us who have grown to love Tolkien's work, and embrace every aspect of it with such a lust for knowledge, that we delve deeper into the works of this intricate man. His son, Christopher Tolkien, has made this possible by piecing together and editing his father's massive amounts of work and sorting it out and explaining it all to us, the readers.<br />Before diving into the twelve book series &quot;The History of Middle-earth,&quot; which Christopher has so delicately and perfectly presented, I highly suggest reading this piece of literature, which explains more in depth, smaller aspects of the published writings of Tolkien.<br />Read Tolkien's last effort at the story of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin, a story which tragically was not finished, and can only be glimpsed at in its rough stages in Volume II of The History of Middle-earth (The Book of Lost Tales 2), and then diverge into the complete &quot;Narn I Hín Húrin,&quot; the story of the children of Húrin: Túrin Turambar and Nienor Niniel, two of the most tragic characters in existence in the first section of Unfinished Tales which deals with the first age of the sun of Middle-earth.<br />The second section of Unfinished Tales is very important for it contains many accounts of events that occured in the second age of the sun, a time that is hardly written about, that is filled with much history and tragedy. Read about the Isle of Gift: Númenor, which the ancestors of Elendil were given and which they lost towards the end of the Second Age, and about it's sixth king: Tar-Aldarion, and his strong wife, Erendis, who wages a battle with the Lady of the Sea for her husband's love in one of the most awesome love stories ever written. Read also about the fate of the Elves who remained in Middle-earth and defied the might of the Dark Lord Sauron until the Last Alliance, in which a tangled history of Celeborn and Galadriel is woven with the story of Amroth and Nimrodel, and the Sindarin princes who ruled the Silvan Elves of the forests of Middle-earth after Beleriand's fall.<br />In section three read about aspects of the Third Age yet to be covered, like the fate of Isildur who cut the One Ring, to the history of the Riders of Rohan who befriended the failing kingdom of Gondor in their need to the meeting of Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield in an inn within the walls of Bree, a chance meeting which would be vital in the destruction of a dragon which could have ended The Lord of the Rings very differently, while reading about the fate of Theodred, son of Theoden King of Rohan.<br />Finally, read rare appendices on the stunted Drúedain, the only technical and historical writings on the Palantiri (the seven seeing stones from the West), and one of the most talked about features of Tolkien's writings: the Istari, a race of the Maiar who were sent as emmisaries into Middle-earth (who also became known as &quot;wizards&quot;) to drive Men and Elves to good deeds during the Third Age of Middle-earth.<br />This book is a necessary part of any Tolkien Reader's library and will most likely be read and studied again and again by readers young and old of any profession.

It has pictures, and quotes (from interviews) from Paul,George, and Ringo, and... which makes this really out-of-sight, someone went and looked up quotes of John Lennon, and included them, in context to the subject, as if he were there, being interviewed with the other three Beatles. <BR>Another great thing about this book is that it is in complete chronological order and is accompanied by more pictures than you'd think ever existed of the Beatles.<BR>There is also an index to subjects and songs/albums mentioned in the book. Also included with John,Paul,George,and Ringo's input are quotes from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Neal Aspinall, George Martin, Derek Taylor, Mal Evans, Stuart Stutcliffe, and Brian Epstine.

0783240236|4.0|\\"The Birds\\" has been a favorite film of mine since the 1960s (it was released in 1963---40 years ago), and DVD is the best way to see it.  Not only does the film look great in widescreen, but it also comes with a lengthy featurette that includes filming details that are informative and interesting.<br />Tippi Hedren, who plays Melanie Daniels, does a superb job in her first feature film.  <br />Unlike some reviewers, I think the movie's final scene is perfect.  It's quite ominous (better than a resolution), and visually haunting.<br />I particularly like the clever dialogue between Mitch and Melanie (Rod and Tippi)---e.g., the pretentious one at the bird shop in San Francisco, and the quarrelsome one wherein Melanie explains what really happened at the fountain in Rome.<br />The best visual shot in the film is a \\"God's POV\\" (Hitchcock's term) scene in which sea gulls descend upon Bodega Bay, where a number of cars have just exploded into flame.  How this incredibly powerful scene was filmed is explained in the featurette. <br />I have seen a good many Hitchcock films, and \\"The Birds\\" remains my favorite.<br />A reviewer asked: \\"What does it all mean?\\"  <br />That's what Hitchcock wanted viewers to ask themselves.  Hitchcock provides some clues to possible interpretations.  One interpretation to which some film students subscribe is that the birds are a metaphor for the psychological conflict of Mitch's mother, who must cope with the idea of abandonment that would inevitably result from the relationship her son might forge with a woman.<br />\\"The Birds\\" is one of those expertly made films that can be viewed time and again. It's essential to any serious DVD collection.<br />I give the DVD four stars because the bedroom attack scene (which has been heavily pscycho-analyzed) has thin black lines in the film which should have been cleaned up. Still, the film looks very good overall.  As for Hitch's work, there are maybe two minor flaws in the bird attack scenes, in termsof how convincing the birds look. But all thinsg considered, this is a true masterpiece.
B00000JMQE|5.0|Many people verbaly attack this wonderful story & claim to be \\"Wizard of Oz\\" fans, but I being a true fan of everthing \\"Oz\\" I love this story as much as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". This movie much truer to L. Frank Baum & John R. Neill's vision of \\"Oz\\". Many people expected \\"The Wizard of Oz 2\\" which is impossible, this film helped bring a teen-following to the \\"Oz\\" stories. This is an adaption of \\"The Marvelous Land of Oz\\" & \\"Ozma of Oz\\" not \\"The Wizard of Oz 2\\". The story features in my opinion only one mistake which is putting Dorothy in shock-treatment. After escaping the hospital Dorothy floats to \\"Oz\\" in a chicken coop, her & her talking chicken, Billiana follow a broken Yellow Brick Road to the ruins of the Emerald City, where the evil Mombi is in charge with 31 changeble heads. Dorothy meets Tik-Tok & Jack Pumpkinhead who helps her build a flying \\"Gump\\" to flee to the Nome King's mountain, there they rescue the Scarecrow & restore Oz with the return of The Ruby Slippers. The end is a great Parade scene featuring many charecters from the \\"Oz\\" books. Over all it's a great film, which deserves a chance. Recomended for children 7+
B00005JKJA|2.0|Ok, so I read a review here that explained most of the things in the movie. I appreciate the effort. But my question here is how is the ordinary movie goer, someone with an average intellect, supposed figure all of this out on his own? Please, give me a break. This is an artsy, film noir, Cannes-like picture from start to finish. I can gurantee you that 95% of those watching this movie in a theatre were saying to their partner \\"what the hell is going on\\"? There must have been more sssshhh's in movie theaters around the country when this was released then at any other time since that The Cell was released. I give it 2 stars only because the film is beautiful to look at. If it werent for that brief lesbian love scene and a quickie masturbation bit Lynch threw in I probably would have been asleep on the couch by the time she opened that damn blue box. A blue box by the way that we have no idea where she gets. You can keep movies like this. If I want intrigue and puzzles to solve I'll rent The Game.

I want to become a soloist singer in the near future and he has helped me get closer, given me confidence to sing out in the open. The first time i listened to his song DON'T TURN OFF THE LIGHTS, it really hit me.The message i got was to follow your heart and your dreams, no matter how big they are. IF you want them to come true you have to believe in yourself, they will come true if you want them bad enough. Thankyou for giving me the inspiration Enrique and i hope you follow your futre goals and dreams, you certainly did to get where you are now.<br />Good luck Enrique, keep up the good work.
0312305060|4.0|Cunningham's book reminds us that we should take the time to appreciate the time that we have.  Life is a beautiful thing and should be cherished.<br />His story is well written and is framed within Virginia Woolf's book \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"  Within this book, three women's lives are being discussed in parallel.  The writing is engaging, so the book can be understood on its own.  However, character names and events parallel the life of Virginia Woolf and the heroine of her book.  By reading this first, like a companion text, characters, situations, and ideas become more apparent and lasting.<br />Even if the story was not interesting, watching the way Cunningham weaves his book with Woolf's is worth the reading.  I would recommend reading this book.
0151008116|4.0|i don't agree that this book 'makes one believe in god'.  if anything, it makes me NOT believe in god since, of the two versions of the story, the one without the animals is far more believable.  on the other hand, if the author had claimed that his book would 'make one WANT TO believe in god', then i would agree wholeheartedly.  we WANT to believe the animal story is the true one, not just because it's a better story, but because, unlike the other story, it doesn't shatter our illusions about human beings.<br />martel is right: if we have a choice, it's better to believe in god since the alternative is so utterly bleak.  but i'm not sure we have a choice.  it's hard to ignore the evidence of your own eyes.  one has to work hard to believe.  as pi patel says, faith is hard work.<br />a good book.  it reminded me of how much fun i had as a child reading about animals.

B00000F3KL|4.0|Unlike other modern war films, this movie did not seem to focus exclusively on the individual.  Although we recognize some actors whenever they appear, like Tom Sizemore or Josh Hartnett, the focus is on the situation.  That situation, here, is the battle in Mogadishu rather than the entire police action, or war in general.<br />Within the streets, small accidents happen and some communications are clear.  Regardless, the American troops continue to move through the battle with one, personal, directive: Leave no one behind.  As a result, more soldiers are injured or die, and more assets are expended.  For what cause?  The main objective was accomplished, so why all the waste?<br />This is where the movie, to me, parallels Tennyson's tale of the Light Brigade.  Even though the troops were being gunned down, they maintained the principle of obeying orders.  With the events of this movie, the same idea is here.  The film seems to serve as homage to an incident that seemed like a mistake.<br />I would recommend seeing the movie.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Sometimes you need to listen to other people's advice and try new things...  p>Beyond my motives to buy this album, there's a sublime yet exciting tone that covers every song. Emphasis is put on musical progression instead of the formulaic verse/chorus that's been nailed in our head for years. And while rap and R&B have advanced the linguistics of lyrics, they've left behind any sincerity or meaning in their songs. It's fun listening to Dr. Dre and other pop music once in a while, but when you let your mood flow with music, as I do, you keep yearning for something more important yet just as fun to listen to.<br />This is what Wilco's new album does. Behind all the other intangible reasons to love this album (It's more artistic, poetic, and its a spit in the face of corporate greediness), it's just a great album to listen to, though it does require a few listens all the way through to really appreciate every track. Instead of just the more upbeat (I won't say catchy as I feel there's a negative connotation there) Kamera, War on War, Heavy Metal Drummer and I'm the One Who Loves you, you'll find yourself feeling more attached to 'I am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" \\"Jesus, Etc\\" and \\"Poor Places\\". I did...

B000002UDB|5.0|'Magical Mystery Tour' was The Beatles' third film, and it stunk. But the band made up for it with an astonishing soundtrack album. It was yet another number one hit for the band.<br />The album opens up with the blaring horns and the circus announcer voice of John Lennon of the title track, a trippy Lennon/McCartney composition that was truly a song of its time. 'The Fool On The Hill' is possibly their second best song (behind 'Hey Jude') and Paul's lyrics paint a truly vivid potrait of a lonely man who knows everything and watches the events of the world happen. 'Flying' is a groovy blues instrumental. 'Blue Jay Way' is a frightening George Harrison compositions with an eerie majesty to it. The dark and chugging melody blend in well with Harrison's mysterious voice. 'Your Mother Should Know' is a Paul tune, with a bouncy piano and a catchy rhythm to boot. 'I Am The Walrous' would usually be dismissed as rediculous by most people, but it's really a masterpice. A bouncy melody with John's esoteric and obscure lyrics making it endure. 'Hello Goodbye' is a great physcadellic rocker by Paul that was a number one hit in 1967. 'Strawberry Feilds Forever' is another classic, with groovy orchestrations by George Martin and trippy melodies and lyrics. 'Penny Lane' is yet another classic, a Paul composition that is possibly the strangest song he ever wrote.It has great lyrics and a very bouncy melody. John's 'Baby You're A Rich Man' opens with an Indian ragga-rock beat and it's one of the best songs here. The classic 'All You Need Is Love' closes the album. It still sounds fresh 36 years later, and the backround vocals of (get ready for this) Mick Jagger and Keith Richards belend in perfectly with John's beautifully performed vocals.<br />'Magical Mystery Tour' is a brilliant companion piece to such a lousy movie. Buy it today.<br />Anthony Nasti
B00005QIPH|5.0|An utterly incredible if not relevant album. The Strokes apparent sonic simplicity is a beautiful trick. All of their music is highly complex and layered within the \\"garage-rock\\" strata with precise guitar work, snapping drum work, and vocal work that creates a hazy yet hypnotic delivery. It's a complete mystery as to why this is not the band I hear about when I talk to my young-adult peers. This band has the potential to be as big as they want, so long as they keep producing their understated and \\"simple\\" style of music. They should be the next logical progression of rock music. I can die happily knowing that these guys are making music like this. Buy it now and enjoy it for years.
B000002UAX|5.0|'The White Album' is by far, the best Beatles album ever recorded. It was released in 1968. It wound up staying 9 nonconsecutive weeks at number one. It was recorded when band tensions were brewing, mostly between the creative minds behind the band, Lennon and McCartney. In spite of (or perhaps because of) these tensions, the band recorded what may be their masterpiece.<br />'The White Album' opens with carefree rock of Paul's 'Back In The USSR', and closes with Ringo's delicately orchestrated lullaby 'Goodnight'. George Harrison stretches some of his songwriting talents on several songs, most notably on 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', a toching ballad with an amazing guitar solo by Eric Clapton. Another song of Harrison caused controversy in the aftermath of the Manson murders. The darkly humorous 'Piggies' is meant to be rather funny, yet took on a terrifying new meaning. After comitiing a murder, Charles Manson, the infamous murderer, painted the words, 'Political Piggie' on the body of his victim. Paul's classic 'Helter Skelter' also took on a horrifying new meaning after the Mansons murdered another victim, painting on it the words, 'Helter Skelter'. Both songs remain chilling and horrifying to this day. However, there's an abundance of lighter, happier songs. My favorite is Paul's 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da', a cheery calypso number about two people who fall in love and get married. John's 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' starts off on a dark path, but ends up as a tender ballad with the band's angelic harmonies. Paul's 'Martha, My Dear' is so good and loving, it's hard to believe he wrote it about his dog. Paul also gets risque on 'Why Don't We Do It In The Road', a song with sexual undertones about having sex in the middle of the road. But Paul redeems himself on the sincere and touching ballad 'I Will'. And Lennon's heartfelt 'Julia', a tribute to his late mother, is one of his best compositions. Even Ringo's 'Don't Pass Me By', as rediculous as it is, works well. Paul's 'Blackbird' adresses the racial issues going on at time, and it' a great song. 'Rocky Raccoon', 'Glass Onion' and 'Mother Nature's Son' are rather esoteric and obscure pieces that work well. 'Onion' is John's lamenting insult to Paul, and includes the famous line, 'The Walrous Was Paul'.<br />'The White Album' is the band's greatest studio output, and it just goes to show their music still endures today. It is an excellent album of its time, as well as a signpost for the future. It is a simple album, yet powerful. It is an astoundingly brilliant piece.'Blackbird' adresses the racial issues going on at time, and it' a great song.

B00005OCMR|4.0|This DVD special edition is packed with extas, interviews, a few deleted scenes and a short history of computer animation, but then you really want to know about the film don't you?<br />Basically a guy gets sucked into a computer and is forced to play computer games to survive - yeah, my review ...! This is actually quite a good film.<br />Are you paranoid about computers taking over the world? If so, don't watch this as you'll get too many goofy ideas.

B00005K3NR|4.0|I watched this movie back when I was young but, now when I watch these old movies on DVD it's like watching them for the first time. They are in their true form. Well, most of them. So, it was really like the first time watching this flick and it scared the [heck] out of me at the end. Some moments are very tender and uplifting like when Carrie is at the dance with her date and he really wants to be kind to her not cruel. But then, everybody dies and it is basically just horror and it is very sad for Carrie. I love all the new restored DVD's out there like this one and I highly recommend it. The clear sharp picture and great soundtrack in hi-fi stereo sent chills up my spine.
0064407667|4.0|This is a story about three very brave children who face some of life's biggest challenges. After losing their parents to a terrible fire, they spend the rest of their lives running from selfish and mean relative who's trying to take advantage of them and their fortune. If you are looking for something to read, think about getting this book. It is a great read, and I think you'll enjoy it.
6305252521|5.0|For me, to really like a movie, a book, or anything like that I have to relate to a character and his experiences.  Well, I perfectly related to Truman, even though I do not live my life on a television show.  Do I?  Anyway, Truman Burbank could be any of us.  He's just the average Joe on the street, but he feels mysteriously isolated, so he goes off, on what could be considered a mid-life crisis, and searches for the truth of his existence.  I mean, if we can't relate to isolation and curiosity about existence then maybe we could related his daily goings, or we could go out more.  I know that Truman's world is made up of cameras and lights, unbeknownst to Truman, but even though he is living on a man made TV set, his life is just that common journey of trying to find out who we really are on the inside.  Like I said, I completely related, I'm on my own personal soul search, and due to that connection I loved it.  Oh and did I mention that it just really is a great movie.
052594527X|5.0|This book is excellent. Well writen and described, and yeah, so what, this book might not have been exactly historically accurate... why? ITS FICTION! Give Tracy a break, she slaved over this book, so you could rip it apart. No so she could be praised and paid like the rest of you! I find some of the reviews i've read to be offensive, and rude. This book is great, it kept me intrigued and entertained, by the little quirks that happend to Griet throughout the novel. It was a very quaint read, and I thoughally enjoyed it. Read it, I know you'll love it!

0790729385|3.0|I've been a long-time fan of Omen, and Shining is one of my favorite films. So when several of my coworkers looked at me in surprise, when I told them that I had never seen The Exorcist, and when they kept insisting that it was the scariest and among the best horror movies they had seen, I knew I had to see it. I don't know if it's the overhyping of the film that was a downer, or whether I was expecting too much, but the film didn't really impress me.<br />The Exorcist didn't impress me as a scary movie not because it's old and the effects are obviously dated, but because it just didn't create a \\"scary enough\\" atmosphere. By this I don't mean multiple heads or hideous creatures - many movies, like Shining manage to bury under one's skin without so much as special makeup. The environment of the film just wasn't all that scary - between the girl throwing up green goo and the movement of the bed, there really wasn't anything implied. Fear created by this film was mostly in its attempt to rely on special effects, more than necessary, in my opinion. And while this may work for some films, it doesn't work in this one.<br />Also, given that this was not a B-movie (I also have a great interest in those), I expected a bit more of a background on what was going on. The Omen did a great job at describing the background of the devil, I feel that this is where the Exorcist falls short.<br />Overall, it's not a bad movie. But I simply can't compare The Exorcist to either Shining or Omen - it just wasn't as good as either of the two.
B000001DTM|5.0|I own alot of music and this is one I ALWAYS go back to.  One of the best albums ever recorded.  It seems to contain the best of all of the U-2 style that came both before and after this album.  I once lost this CD in a move and &quot;fretted&quot; until I added it back to my collection.  When it doubt of what to listen to, this one always comes out.  U-2 Rocks - they prove it time and time again.  The fact that they have sustained is no coincidence.
0152023984|5.0|I had to read this book in high school, and loved it.  My teacher recommended to the class that everyone read this book over again in a few years.  Well, after about 14 years, I did read it again, and loved it even more.<br />There is so much to take away from reading the story of this young boy going from planet to planet meeting adults of various sorts with various proclivities.<br />A strong recommendation for any and all age groups.

I love the CD, and often listen to it at other times, however the reason it's stayed one of my favorites is that it can send me peacefully to sleap within 4 tracks no matter where I am or what troubles I have.<br />The ultimate relaxing CD... great white noise for studying, reading, writing or just thinking about the world.
B000069CWE|4.0|I thought this CD was pretty good. If you like the 1st one you would prolly like this one. It is the same but with a lot more kool beats. I am glad i spend my money on this CD.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is a really good movie, even if you weren't a Spider-Man fan when you were a little child. The movie itself has a really good plot line and really good actors, and the special effects at least seem real. The extras are packed, and they really enhance the film. Overall, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone!
B000000W3G|5.0|This is absolutely a UNBELIEVABLY good album! This album is a collection of B-sides from one the biggest albums in history - Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. B-sides are songs that were considered not worthy enough to be included on normal releases. However, the recording sessions for Mellon Collie were the best the Pumpkins ever did - making this CD one of the best releases from the Pumpkins. I think its safe to say each and every one of the songs in this box set were not only worhty enough to be on Mellon Collie, but some of them were even worthy as Extended Play singles! There's no doubt about it - this album is a must have!<P
B00005JL2O|3.0|Personally, I feel kind of bad for that person who wrote about their DVD not being able to stop and pause and scan and such. Maybe it's their DVD player problem. But this movie is okay, and the gags tend to linger sometimes. Mike Myers doesn't need to play multi-roles in order for his movies to be funny, though. He really doesn't need Goldmember and Fat B. But there's a lot of extras, and the movie itself, well, rent it or borrow it first, and then, if you like it, buy it.

0953104907|5.0|From constructing the neck to designing and gluing the body together, Hiscock leads you through the whole process. If you've been playing with the though of making your own guitar but need a push, this book will give you the courage and the inspiration you need. Mind you that constructing your own guitar will not be a simple task. Even with the book in hand you still need to put your own brains to work because this book will not give you a blueprint. Instead you are encouraged to make you own design though if you really want to, you can make the guitar look similar as the one the author makes.<br />What I really like about this book is that it does not describe the making of just one electric guitar. The author will lead you through 3 guitar designs, a Gibson style guitar and a Fender style guitar. The big difference between the two is how the neck is attached to the body, glued versus bold on. Also Hiscock explains the making of a through-neck 8 string bass guitar. This will give you the knowledge of starting to experiment on your own and you will be able to truly make a guitar to your own likings.<br />This is in my opinion the best book if you would like to make your own electric guitar. However the &quot;relaxed&quot; style of writing can be a little annoying sometimes. For those of you who never seen the TV series Catweasel (broadcasted in Great Britain in the 70ties), and few have in the US, a title like Electrickery will not be understood. If you know that you can not buy elephant tusk in the USA unless it was imported before (I believe) 1970, then a picture of a elephant to show that tusk looks better on a elephant than on a guitar is just plain weird. But let's blame it on the famous British humor. And if I may nitpick, the font used for the paragraphs is ill chosen. <br />I give this book 5 stars because of it's detail and Hiscock explains things very clear. Still if you don't know your chisel from your bandsaw, constructing a guitar may not be the best choice for your first project. But combine some basic woodworking skills and a little common sense and this book will enable you to make a guitar that is structurally sound and a joy to play.
B00007BH5C|1.0|I'm sorry but when I was sitting in the theatre and the trailer for Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers came on and they played a digitized version of Clint Mansell's Summer Overture found on the 1999 movie Requiem for a Dream. I look at this soundtrack to see if he was the one that had conducted this one as well but sadly the credit was given to another. So i am very disgruntled and bitter toward anyone who had any part or supports this way of ripping off true artists. Thank you and to make my review credible listen to Summer Overture by Clint Mansell. I'm a very big fan of his work on this movie so thats why i'm writing this.
B00007BHOE|5.0|I've been waiting for quite some time for a new Slipknot DVD to come out, and I was hoping it would be one that would show one of their live performances.  Well, that day has come.  Slipknot's &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; is for anybody who is a fan of Slipknot.<br />This live performance is more than satisfactory.  The video and sound quality is really superb.  It's almost like you're there live.  The concert took place at the London Arena, which shows us just how crazy a London crowd can be at one of these shows.  Along with seeing them perform their songs, you get to see the band prepare for the show as well.  They play a lot of songs from the second album, as well as with the first one.  Some of them you can count on seeing are &quot;disasterpiece,&quot; &quot;wait and bleed,&quot; &quot;(sic),&quot; &quot;purity,&quot; &quot;left behind,&quot; &quot;my plague,&quot; and many, many more.<br />This 2 disk collection also features all of the band's videos, including a rare animated version of &quot;wait and bleed,&quot; the bonus audio track &quot;purity,&quot; and more.<br />They're a group either people love or hate, which is fine.  They're not for everyone.  They take their music to the extreme, always willing to take it to the limit.  Some may consider their lyrics brutal and violent, but that's not Slipknot's message.  Yes, believe it or not, they do have a message.  And it's not &quot;f- the world&quot; or &quot;everyone is garbage.&quot;  Their message is that it's okay to have negative thoughts, just as long as you deal with them the right way.  They deal with their demons through music.  Slipknot's &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; is a must-have for any Slipknot fan.
B000005JA8|1.0|Sure, there were a lot of epileptics that have done good work (Dostoevsky among them), but I can't think of a single one who did their good work DURING their seizures...

B00005JKJA|4.0|What's happening?  What's it all about(Alfie)?  Who's that?  Who's she?  Why is she now her?  What did that guy have to do with anything?  Just a few of the many questions asked about this film.  Personally, I don't think you're supposed to give yourself a headache trying to figure everything out.  I really don't think there is much to figure out.  I guess I cop out a little and just assume that this movie was all a dream coz it seems to follow dream logic(as well as Lost Highway).  It entertained me though.  Though the big complaint from people is that this movie makes no sense(and to skeptical rebellious intellectuals, it's just show-off artsy fartsy crud trying to pass as art), but almost everyone who watches it, no matter how confused, has watched it all the way to the end.  That says to me that everyone has found some entertainment value in this film.  Positive or negative, it was compelling and bizarre enough to sit through.  It's certainly never boring.  My advice is not trying to be so logical when you watch it.  Why try to figure it out?  You're probably not going to get anywhere.  I think Lynch sometimes throws random weirdness  in to send you on a wild goose chase.  When I asked him about a confusing plot point in one of his films, he gave me a joke answer.  So, I know he's got a sense of humor about his stuff, and it wouldn't surprise me if he was mixing alot of red herrings in with his story.  Then again, if he had actually made this into a series, we might have more answers.  Might, that is.  But, if you're one of those people who just can't stand viewing a film without any kind of solid closure at the end, check out the review below mine.  That's probably one of the best explanations you're likely to find.  Otherwise, just sit back, relax and watch the friggin' movie for goodness sake, and say to yourself, &quot;the hell with logic.&quot;
0780020685|5.0|A work of art. That's all one can say<br />Akira Kurosawa, perhaps the finest filmmaker the world has ever seen, crafted with this stunning epic, a work of art that stands impressively next to the world's finest literature.<br />Certainly influenced by other film masters like John Ford, Orson Welles, Howard Hawkes, Jean Renoir as well as the great authors (especially the Russian novelists among others (reading his autobiography says so much), Kurosawa found a way to take their impressive visual and narrative styles and craft something all his own. <br />He also perhaps became the one director who managed to make visual novels. \\"Seven Samurai\\" is but only one example of what he was able to do not only visually, but narratively as well. <br />Many authors set out to make art and fail because they overlook the absolute necessity that novels, films and plays require: a captivating linear narrative that contains interesting and realistic characters placed in exaggerated and urgent circumstances. \\"The Seven Samurai\\" does it. It not only contains breathtaking action, three dimensional characters and phenomenal performances (Toshiro Mifune creates arguably the finest physical and presentational performance ever caught on film) but speaks poignantly about what it means to be a human being. <br />Like all great works of art, it transcends language and culture. Its scenes function as chapters in an epic. This ranks on the level with \\"The Odyssey\\", The works of Shakespeare and the paintings of Van Gogh (another influence of Kurosawa's). <br />But please don't think \\"The Seven Samurai\\", a dry polemic. It is a fast paced, ultra accessible masterpiece of action, wit and romance. It manages to be both universal and personal at the same time. <br />The criterion transfer, which some viewers have derided here at Amazon, is a glorious improvement over the scratchy video tape I first purchased almost twenty years ago, that. Obviously the DVD does not even scratch the wonder of seeing apristine 35mm print on the big screen, but for a home library, it will do just fine.<br />\\"The Seven Samurai\\" is a proud chapter in the history of human artistic achievement. This is not to be missed. A 10 out of 5!

B000002UAR|5.0|Listen to any indie-rock album from the '70s to the present day, and you'll hear elements of 'Revolver' within them. This album mixes up The Beatles progressive style beautifully and never gets dull. It's experimental, rocky, poppy, original, with a fine mix of straighforward and unusual songs that keep the listener's attention.<br />If I only got to keep one Beatles album on a desert island, this would be the one. It's like the blueprint to all the modern indie-rock I listen to and enjoy these days... and it's no bad thing that many modern bands take their influences from 'Revolver'.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|Some sequels shouldn't be made.  This is one of them.  The first film was good in a quickie B-movie sense, with it's cool special effects and wry humor.  This flick is just plain dumb.  It seems like they filmed it in a week and through all of the special effects in to cover what a plotless mess they had.  What happened to Johnny Knoxville?  His character just dissapeared!  The only reason I give this turkey any stars is that my pug Mog found the character Frank to be outrageously humerous.

B00004BZ0V|5.0|I hadn't planned on reviewing this CD until I saw all of the negative reviews here.  I agree with many of the points, but wanted to add my humble opinion.  If you're a big fan of the Clash (as I am), then you have all of these songs already.  Likewise, fans of the Clash probably don't even like the concept of a 'greatest hits' CD...why bother when they released such great albums??!!!<br />However, even though the Clash are 'the only band that matter' to their fans, there are many music fans (some with good taste!) who likely are not hard-core Clash collectors.  For people who want a taste of The Clash and their punk, this CD is pretty good.  It covers their biggest US hits (Train in Vain, Rock the Casbah, Should I Stay?) and their biggest UK hits (London Calling, Bankrobber, & Tommy Gun - all hit the UK Top 20).  Part of the appeal of the Clash is that they kept trying to expand themselves, which can clearly be seen in this CD.<br />With the sad and recent passing of Joe Strummer, fans of the Clash should do all they can to make sure that their music can reach as many people as possible...that's the purpose of a 'greatest hits' CD.  In those terms, I think that this CD suceeds, and it will appeal to casual fans.<br />Of course, with their upcoming induction into the R&R Hall of Fame, many people will like be paying attention to the Clash's back catalogue.  If you're curious, start with their 1977 debut or \\"London Calling,\\" both are pretty brilliant.
0312305060|5.0|I had to choose a book to read for a book report for my high school english class.  I went to Borders and started to look around.  The Hours soon caught my eye, and I decided that it seemed like a good choice.  I first heard about this story the first time anything was said about the upcoming movie in Entertainment Weekly, me being an entertainment fan and all.  I was familiar with the story, so I had a slight idea of what it was about.  At first it was just something to get through, to finish for my book report.  A few pages into it, I realized what an outstanding book it was and actually wanted to read it.  It is an amazingly descriptive book filled with beautiful writing, and I soon found it impossible to put down.  I kept imagining Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman as the main characters, being that they play them in the movie.  They connect so well with these characters that you can't really help but admire their characters in a way.  When I did my book report for the class, people seemed interested in what I had to say, and I got a lot of questions afterwards.  The movie just opened, and I plan to go see it.  It looks just as amazing as the book was.  I can honestly say that this was probably the best book I have ever read.  If anybody asked me what a good book to read was, I would immediately tell them to read The Hours.
0060920084|5.0|This book was mean-spirited, misanthropic, and cruel--I loved it. I think most of the negative reviewers of this book would benefit by lightening up a little and getting a sense of humor. If you're a blind, gung-ho, flag-waving, patriotic America-booster then this book will deflate your bubble. I think America is the greatest country the world has ever seen and I love it, but if you sincerely love your country then you will be able to criticize it and laugh at it sometimes. Bryson's hilariously sharp eye catches all of middle America's absurdities, but what saves the book's harshness is that he doesn't forget to target the biggest absurdity here--himself (yes, the [sad man] who whines about how boring everybody is around him but spends most of his time alone in a motel room drinking beer and eating candy). For me the main joke of the book is that Bryson spends most of his time trying to escape from somewhere rather than looking forward to his next stop. Yes, perhaps some of his targets are a little too easy, but still hilarious.  As a travel book: 1 star.  As a comedy: 5 stars
B000069HK2|4.0|This CD is pretty dam good if your a punk/rock person like me. The only thing wrong with the CD is guys voice is a little off what ever his name is. If he toned his voice down to something I would give it five stars. Other than that the songs are pretty good. ...
0679736646|5.0|I think I have to say that the only people who can truly read a P.K.D. book from start to finish without becoming disheartened are people who enjoy and take pleasure out of intellectual activities and exercising the brain that his books always present. This means, I think, that only certain people will truly enjoy his books. It's just like how someone who does not take pleasure out of reading sports novels or detective fiction will simply not be able to read those kinds of books. The characters are usually pretty flat in his books, although I would definitely have to say that sometimes I wish they were better. Then again, adding 10-20 pages of character development in the beginning of his books might simply confuse the reader and bore the intellectuals who love reading his books. All told, I think he executes his style perfectly.<br />Ubik is a perfect example of a classic P.K.D. book. Having read some of his other books, I found some of the characters and plotlines to be similar but nonetheless still a love to read.<br />If you like reading because of the exercise it gives your brain or like good ideas or brilliant prose you'll certainly find Ubik very fun to read.

B00005JKED|3.0|Only one deserved hers.<br />I think even Denzel was shocked by the face-slappingly obvious statement made by the Academy via this token gesture (ie. \\"\\"Racism?\\" Hahaha! That's a funny word. But we don't know what it means! Nuh-uh! Not us!\\"), since I think even he knew that he never slipped out of 1st gear in a role he could have sleepwalked through. So... you're implying that he was better in this than he was in \\"The Hurricane\\"? Don't make me laugh. Oh well, slap another zero on the end of his salary.<br />The frustrating thing is, the movie itself isn't that bad. In a bloated genre, Training Day plays out like an above-average episode of NYPD Blue, until the eye-rollingly cheesy ending where the crooked cop gets his comeuppance (a combination of a bad spaghetti-western and a ripoff of the Sonny Corleone death scene), completely undermines any credibility the film desperately tried to establish and proceeds to urinate on the ashes. Ho hum. Next on the \\"Corruption is Naughty\\" Hollywood conveyer belt, please.
B0000640VN|5.0|Yes, you must see this movie if you're a fan of romantic, timetravel or funny movies. I, fortunately, love all of those, as long as they are made well. This one IS, and that goes for all elements mentioned.<BR>Of course, it is MY opinion. That's why you should see it. Chances are that you'll agree with me after seeing it. It would be terrible not seeing it after reading one of the one-star ratings. Well, indeed, Meg Ryan gets older. We all do. This makes this movie absolutely not less good!<br />Up to now 'Time after Time' 'Somewhere in Time' and 'Heaven can Wait' were my TOP movies. Now, finally, I'm happy to add 'Kate &amp; Leopold' to my list :)<br />Sander Kiesel - NL
0316666343|2.0|I got this book because I thought it had an interesting premise. In fact, it did keep me entertained and quite interested through about the first half. After the halfway point, I found myself asking \\"when is this going to get good again?\\" After the two-thirds mark, I was asking \\"should I even finish this thing?\\"<br />First of all, if you're going to set a book partially in Heaven, you've got to go somewhere with it. You just do. I know that Sebold's main goal was to explore the reactions of the narrator's family after the narrator's death. Fine. But Sebold promises Heaven, and all we get is a washed-out, teenaged WASP version of Heaven, with Sebold ...on this point by mentioning that every person's Heaven is different, tailor-made to the individual. So WASPy teenaged girls go to WASPy teenaged heaven. Moreover, Sebolod's Heaven really seems like what a living person might see as Heaven -- a place where things are very pleasant, but where most of the time is spent watching the endlessly fascinating family and friends that the dead have left behind left behind. Which seems just a little ridiculous. I mean, even if I had died when I was fourteen, I could have thought of more interesting things to do in Heaven than watch the neighborhood where I grew up every day (i.e, look down on people in other countries... talk to Einstein's ghost... get a pet dolphin... anything...)<br />Moreover, after the first half of the book, the narrator's family gets boring. The family essentially reacts in exactly the way you expect it might -- turmoil followed by growth and (slightly hokey) spiritual enlightenment. After some interesting adolescent reactions, the older sister just becomes stalwart, responsible, and dull.  What could have become a very interesting evolution for the mother becomes a pointless journey with a bland \\"there's no place like home\\" destination. <br />Additionally, the attempts that Sebold makes at attempting to elucidate the killer's psyche are pretty anemic. There's plenty of good research out there about the psychology of criminals... why didn't she use it?<br />That said, it's not all bad. The events closely connected in time with the murder are psychologically real and very interesting. And Sebold isn't a bad writer. I'm going to check her out again in ten years. I'll hope that she has developed the experience and confidence to really plumb the depths of the material she chooses.
0385508417|4.0|The one thing that amazed me about this book is how fast I was able to read it.  I only read Skipping Christmas on my bus rides back and forth from work which are only 20 minutes a day and I had this book finished in less than I week.  I found the story enjoyable and very funny.<br />Luther and Nora Krank's daughter Blair leaves home to join the Peace Corps on Thanksgiving weekend.  Luther spends a sleepless night figuring out how much money they spent on Christmas last year, $6, 100 dollars.  He decides to talk his wife Nora into taking a cruise instead of spending all that money on Christmas and Nora agrees due to the fact that her daughter will not be around.  What happens next is the hilarious and sometimes rude reactions from the neighbors and friends due to the fact that the Kranks are not decorating, sending cards or buying presents.  On Christmas Eve the Kranks do get a surprise which changes their plans at the last minute and this is when the book get even more hilarious.<br />I found this book to be one of the most enjoyable Christmas stories that I have read in a very long time and Luther is definitely a modern day Scrooge.  I highly recommend reading this one especially if you are looking for a fast and enjoyable read.
0393039765|4.0|Palahniuk's style is like nothing I've ever read before. Paragraphs longer than 3 sentences just don't appear in Fight Club. By all rights, Palahniuk should be a horrible writer. But somehow, he pulls it off! It's one of the most unique books I've ever read.<br />Is it worth reading? Well, watch the movie. You'll have more or less the same opinion of the book. Which is not to say that the book isn't worth reading after having seen the movie; the themes and tone is slightly different, and the ending is *really* different. But Fight Club the movie is just as good a movie as Fight Club the book is a book. If that makes any sense to you.
0002558122|5.0|5 Stars- Depressing but excellent<br />Frank Mc Court's memoirs \\"Angela's Ashes\\" takes us back to the 1940s where he tells us of his childhood and the poverty that his family lived though.  This book can be very depressing at times which brought me to tears, but this is an excellent memoirs worthy of a 5 star rating.<br />The book starts out in New York, the Mc Court family lives in one of the most impoverished areas of Brooklyn and father, Malachy Mc Court has a hard time keeping a job and a drinking problem.  After the death of baby Margaret, the family moves back to Ireland where times are harder and life is poorer.  The family relies on help from Saint Vincent, DE Paul Society and they are forced to go on relief.  The father drinks whatever money he makes and has a hard time finding or keeping a job.  Frank has a dream of returning to America, where he feels that he can make life better for himself.  <br />I watched the movie right after reading the book and was amazed at how many part were left out.  I advise everyone to read the book to get the true story of the Mc Court Family and I look forward to reading the second part, Tis.
0316666343|4.0|I just received both Fight Club and The Lovely Bones for Christmas. How's that for a paring? <br />I only write that to give you some indication that I'm not some soppy sentimental sap who simply fell for a cheesey story. The Lovely Bones is truly one of the best books of 2002.<br />I don't remember the last time I read such a gentle, honest story. The characters are among the most engaging I've ever read. The story carried along at a wonderfully measured pace. It was at turns sad, funny and enraging.<br />Don't listen to the philistines here that give it 1 star. Pick it up, and enjoy it.
B00005Y228|5.0|totally blew me away. i expected it to be good. but not this way. i listened to all tracks and she got me. i was totally captivated. its new and fresh just like her even if shes been here forever. and i bet shell be here for a couple forevers more. wow!!!!!!!!!!!!
6304712936|5.0|&quot;Amadeus&quot; is one of the greatest movies ever made and it is one of my favorites. Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham, Oscar-winner) tells about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, Oscar-nominated), who was the genius of the young musician who died mysteriously at the age of 35 in 1791. &quot;Amadeus&quot; is the winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director (Milos Forman). I am so glad to own it on the DVD for my ultimate video collection. A wonderful movie.
B00005JKJA|5.0|...this is the film for you. It's typical Lynch, with bizarre characters, no straight order of events, very surreal. Still, it's much more focused than Lost Highway... dare I say, much more \\"understandable\\". Reminds me of Twin Peaks, for you die to know what the hell is going on. It's really fun to try to figure out what is it all about, come up with all the weirdest theories to try to explain the movie. C'mon, don't you hate movies that give you ALL the information? It's like \\"you're dumb, I'll tell you everything, bit by bit.\\" Fortunately, people like David Lynch gives our brains a litlle credit.
B000063JDE|1.0|After seeing Mulholland Drive, I figured Blue Velvet and Lost Highway might be interesting as well.  Boy was I wrong.  Those two movies were horrible wastes of time and money.  The acting was extremely poor, and the Angelo Badalamenti music is not only terrible, but plays at all the wrong times.  David Lynch doesn't have a clue.  <br />Buy something else if you want a good movie.
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie ranks up there, along with 'seven', 'fight club' and 'the shawhank redemption', as one of the best i have seen in a long time.  Denzel washington plays a startling role as the 'bad guy' and plays it extremely well, very deserving of an oscar.  The thought of him having a bad guy role intrigued me so much that i saw it in the theater and then bought it the first day it was on sale.  Ethan Hawke also gives a strong performance in what i feel was a title character role stolen by the awesome presence of Washington.  This dvd spends the most time in my player than any of my other movies.  I strongly recomend this movie to any person whether you like cop drama movies or not.
6305972591|3.0|Everyone babbled to me about how scary it is, I must see it! Being a person who likes the genre, I saw it for 9.99 on DVD so I bought it. It is scary, but it is so different, the movie is clouded...that feeling you get like in Texas chain saw massacre...like, what the hell just happened? I liked it, however, but it was a tadd ahead of my memory. I like that the ending was 'happier' then the book's everyone dies ending. See it if you like scifi and low budget horror/cult movies. Not for everyone, but to me, it was fairly enjoyable. Classic? Maybe to some, but to me it was just a movie that uses religion and satin and weird stuff to make a scary ...movie...not classic, just pretty good.
B00005LMBK|4.0|I am a big fan of such metal bands as SYSTEM OF A DOWN <BR>and SLAYER so I still don't know why i got into Gorillaz. I got this cd after hearing CLint Eastwood on mtv.

0805062971|4.0|A gripping book about male power issues and society. I'm 30 year old male I sympathize and the sense of 'mid-life crisis' this book creates. Somewhat diffrent than the movie, which I truely love.

630463949X|5.0|Fleetwood Mac: The Dance<BR> <BR>Recorded at Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank in 1997, this is a reunion concert  for Fleetwood Mac (with a golden &quot;Rumours&quot; line-up of 1977) , who had been in hibernation for a while at the time of recording The Dance album. The fact that they had not played live together for a while did not seem to be a problem for these great musicians as they jumped straight into one of the best renditions of &quot;The Chain&quot; I have heard from them. And the concert just went off from there. A collection of some of their best known hits interspersed with new tracks from &quot;The Dance&quot; album plus some solo works from Lindsey Buckingham, this is a very enjoyable concert indeed. 106 minutes and 22 tracks of real good rocking. The finale (&quot;Tusk&quot; and &quot;Don't Stop&quot;) with additional eighty piece brass marching band is really something!<BR>This is really great live music from one of the genuine legendary bands of the rock era and it is a fine way to get to know this great band (except for those who remember Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, of course). <br /> <BR>Try it anyway, and you won't be disappointed!
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie was great. I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan and although more was changed than I thought would be and some of the changes were alittle unnecessary, but it was a good movie altogether. Peter Jackson did a brilliant job directing. The music by Howard Shore was incredible and the acting was extrodinary. I highly recommend this movie and The Fellowship of the Ring.
B00005OM5L|5.0|Blues lovers, don't miss this!<BR> <BR>14 classics from blues maestro played good and rough, his solos are lengthy and inventive and the supporting band is just amazing (though it won't be amazing anymore when you look at the names of the musicians). Except &quot;Layla&quot; (the first track where the soundman was sleeping and we could not hear J. Portnoy's harmonica and whole horn section), all tracks sound powerful. The picture quality is rather good (not excellent, but considering the age of the record (the gig was in 1996), it is OK), and the sound is recorded in stereo, 5.1 Dolby surround and 5.1 DTS.<BR> <BR>Great concert and simply a must-have for all music lovers!<BR> <BR>Well, EC definitely was wonderful that night!
B00005JKZT|5.0|The story in and of itself is glorious: I became a LOTR addict after starting to read \\"The Hobbit\\" a couple of years ago, and now I begin to see where the central theme of Tolkien's work seems to converge (someone please correct me, if I am wrong): there is good even when you don't think there is... there is such a thing as a tomorrow, as a sunrise and a ray of light after the rain.<br />As for \\"Two Towers\\" I won't add too much but this: the epic with Celtic music by Howard Shore in the background, simply stupendous, magnificent, grandieuse. As for Computer Animation, praise for the work behind Gollum: seamless, melds in with the Hobbits in a way that more than makes believe. Finally, the battle for Helm's Deep is simply breathtaking. Not going to waste more of your time: go see it and pick up a copy when it is available on DVD!

0671027387|4.0|I found Deception Point quite by accident, never having read any of Dan Brown's work before.  I was intrigued by the premise, and decided to give it a go.  Don't be mislead by the synopsis on the back cover of the  book. It suggests that the book consists largely of a \\"bug hunt\\" across the arctic ice, but this is not the case. There is a lot of military hardware, political intrigue and scientific discovery.  Top it off with a female protagonist who takes no bull... from anybody, and I'm sold!<br />I gave the book four stars because in my mind a five star rating only applies to the greatest of all novels, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Those are few and far between and that takes nothing away from Brown's work. Deception Point was a lot of fun to read, and I'd recommend it to anyone!
B00006879E|5.0|I really love this CD.  I was watching a student dance show which featured an amazing solo dance to \\"This Love\\" and couldn't get the song out of my head (in a good way).  Afterwards I bought their CD, which hasn't left my CD player since.  Their songs have some cool lyrics like \\"the sex she slipped into my coffee, they way she felt when she first saw me,\\" and \\"I twist to fit the mold that you are in\\"... etc., but the instrumental music behind the words is what really makes the album for me.  Sometimes it sounds like it comes straight out of a Stevie Wonder album (Sunday Morning) other times it is hard rock (not coming home), but no matter what it has a really rich quality.  If these guys don't become famous and get on the top 100, all my faith in the music industry will be lost.  They are so much better than so many bands on the list.
B00005YU1O|1.0|I'm sorry, I don't see the art in rotoscoping (drawing over filmed images), so calling this thing &quot;animated&quot; is giving it way too much credit. OK, there's nothing worth looking at, is there any salvation in the dialog? Only if you consider the typical Usenet exchange, or Internet chatroom conversation, to be the height of wit and wisdom. This film is a complete waste: no-talent slackers trying to masquerade as art. (Now, watch everyone say this review wasn't helpful--I'm trying to save you folks from wasting your time and money here!)
B00006F7S4|4.0|Apparently Beck seems to be listening to a lot of Joy Division these days. The sheer and utter hopelessness of this record seems only matched by Ian Curtis's seminal post-punk gloom band. There is not an ounce of sun in this record's 50 minute durration. Its basically like being trapped in a pitch black closet that's locked from the outside and no one around to open it for you. But maybe that was Beck's aim.<br />Though sometimes seemingly self-consciencely mopy, the funny thing is that it works. He seems genuinely depressed and it certainly shows in music. His vocal tone reflects a completely destroyed and heart broken man while he and his band wrap him up in a blanket of sorrow. I mean this stuff is just utterly depressing.<br />But how does the music itself fare? Is it worth listening? Well, yeah. The music well crafted and most certainly listenible. There is plenty of conviciton and feeling in Beck's words and music that almost anyone can relate to even in the smallest way. The only question I send back to you is: do you really want to depress yourself? I'm hard pressed to find the &quot;right time&quot; to listen to this album because I'm never sure what's the right mood to listen to this album in. Now it may sound selfish, but since the album can't accomidate my every mood(or almost any mood for that matter, I can't whole heartedly recomend it. Its a great album with no shortage of great songs on it, but if you're anything like me, you'll never know when's the right time to listen to it. Buy it for yourself and see what you think.<br />P.S. If ultra-depressing music of this ilk is your thing, check out Manchester's answer to Joy Division, Elbow. Its sure to make want to reach for the knife.
B000069AUI|5.0|With a sound that many compare to Radiohead, Travis, Doves, The Verve and even the Pink Floyd, this UK band came back in 2002 with an album more mature and accomplished than their debut smash hit album, &quot;Parachute,&quot; which earned them a Grammy for best alternative act, among many other accolades in 2000 and 2001. The truth is that Coldplay has an unmistakable &quot;sound&quot; largely due to Chris Martin's voice sitting in the middle of a pool of sounds that are able to soothe the listener while simultaneously provoking audatious thoughts about things such as fair trade (&quot;Politik&quot;), life (&quot;Daylight&quot;) and the afterlife (&quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;), along with images of love (&quot;Green Eyes&quot;) and breakups (&quot;The Scientist&quot;). So many powerful bits here and there make this album a true jewel.<br />The album opens up with a lot of strength: a guitar riff that breaks the silence of two years; and closes with a melancholic theme that is close to the point of genius, with Martin at the piano. My favorite songs... well, it's really hard to tell, since the entire album is a great piece of work, but if you point a gun at me and make me choose, I'd pick &quot;The Scientist&quot; (reminds me of the time when our team broke up at my previous job -we were one darn good IT Team back there!), the heavenly sounds from &quot;Clocks&quot; and the title track. These guys have only just &quot;begun&quot; -if Chris Martin is not another rock star-to-go-astray, we will have a lot more great music to expect from these guys in the years to come.
B000059POY|2.0|I actually saw this movie in a theater when I was young enough to be considered fit for active duty in the U.S. Army.  In fact, I was in active duty in the U.S. Army.  Most of my weekends were spent at Fort Knox, Kentucky, for my first several months of basic training, but I finally had the opportunity to go into Louisville on a Saturday night.  I was old enough to buy hard liquor, and I was old enough to see this movie, and I did both in the same weekend.  This was before I heard the \\"Thinks he's Audie Murphy\\" joke which made my experiences in the army so enjoyable, now that I have survived.  The thing about Audie Murphy that was funny was that he got to play his own part in a movie, \\"To Hell and Back,\\" after World War II, an event that was considered worthy of inclusion in history books in the 20th century, when most things didn't make any more sense than the movie, \\"Candy.\\"  Honestly, if you tried to tell the world that the United States hardly did anything in the big one until it had secretly built a couple atom bombs, and wouldn't even declare war officially on anyone until it was sure it would have a chance to incinerate a few cities before the ceasefire would end the opportunity to blow people away, hardly anyone would know that you were leaving anything out.<BR>    Back to Audi Murphy:  the stars in this movie (would you believe that one is named Ringo Starr?) were given the opportunity to play themselves as somebody else, but there is something about the roles these people play that hyperbolically exceeds what anyone else could say about them.  Like, who could imagine Richard Burton as a drunk lush, acting the part of stuporous impotence in the presence of young willingness?  James Coburn overstating everything with exuberant pride might be expected, but how could such a clown, Walter Matthau, be the perfect caricature of what everyone thinks in the U.S. Army?  Maybe it was such a shock to me because Walter Matthau seemed to be thinking what I was thinking,back in that theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was really in the U.S. Army, in training for a mission to hell.<BR>   Audie Murphy is not in this movie, but that might be because everybody said that after he went to Hollywood, he was nibbled to death by a bunch of ducks.  I'm glad that DVD is the technology that finally made this movie available to historically minded people like myself, who need opportunities like this to see what everybody was thinking when we should have been growing up.
B000002HEP|5.0|kyuss came out around the time of Seattle bands and was overlooked. I dont know how but they were. Its like bands that are actually talented and creative dont get to the mainstream. This album has everything great drums, bass solos a excellent guitarist{josh homme} most if not all of the album was written by josh ,As are all of his projects .This man is quite gifted in my opinion. But it would't come together with out john garcia's amazing vocals ....
B000002GH1|5.0|I own a lot of simple minds albums, but this is simply the best one of them all. It would have been perfect if it included Don't you(Forget about me). Still is one of the best albums I own.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Although John Mayer has been unfairly labeled by critics as a \\"Dave Matthews wannabe,\\" that certainly won't distract you from enjoying his debut album. Mayer offers a mature, original style that's all his own.
6304806442|5.0|Maybe I'm just some egotistical hothead who thinks that only his oppinion matters but it seems like most people are missing the big picture with Trainspotting. Sure its got heroin in it. Yes heroin destroys lives. But Trainspotting is the flipside to Arfonosky's powerful yet bleak Requiem For A Dream. Where there once was darkness there is now light. Trainspotting is movie about moving on, making changes for the better and never looking back. Heroin, like in real life, is just an inhibitor.<br />The movie culls lots of elements into the movie. One minute you're laughing at the antics of Sick Boy and Renton as they're shooting people in the park with air-rifle, the next your cringing as Renton shudders painfully from his lapses of heroin. Its obvious that Trainspotting wants to try and do so much, and in its 90 minute ride, it manages to pull off everything it aims for with high sucess. Its funny, powerful, uplifting and for me inspiring. Not only that, but it's also got a kick [rear] soundtrack. Every part of the movie just screams character and gives it an even more compelling edge with the help of exciting pacing and orignal direcion(well for its time. Sadly MTV directors have managed to deteriate what was left of an effective direction style). Its an exceptional movie and recommend it to anyone who feels like their stuck in rut. It may just be the boost you need.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|The first time we ever saw STRICTLY BALLROOM, my husband and I were at the video store looking at the used videos for sale.  The cover looked so racy that we just passed it by wanting to see it first, before wasting our money on another sleazy canned dancing movie. (Had we seen Romeo and Juliet or Moulin Rouge first, we probably would never have looked twice at it).<br />After renting a copy and seeing it, we were so thrilled that we raced down to the store to grab the copy for sale, but it was gone.<br />The very beginning of this movie is fresh, new, and brilliantly put together.  The humor in the movie has the zaniness of British humor with the hard edged Aussie flair.  From the very first few minutes, we found ourselves laughing, clapping, and feeling overall wonderful about the beautifully done story that many can relate to.<br />A struggling &quot;invisible girl&quot; rather ignored and looked down upon takes a risk and ends up with the self-confident hero.  The costuming is gorgeous, the dance scenes beautiful, and the characters are PERFECTLY done - very different and lots of fun.<br />This movie is certainly a family movie-despite the racy cover.  What we particularly loved about this movie was that FRAN, the lead character ended up on top, but did not have to become a sleaze to do it.  She keeps her modesty and class and still comes out ahead.  The movie is pretty wholesomely done (be warned that there are a few swear words and one implied scene with a few characters-however very tame).<br />Dance scenes are not like so many other dance movies which are rather annoying.  On the contrary, they make you feel like you are involved.  All kinds of people, with all kinds of abilities dance in the movie- not just the stars.<br />I watch this movie several times a year, as does my mom who hesitated to buy a copy when I told her about it.  It is reminiscent of quirky Hyacinth Bucket character types (from BBC'c KEEPING UP APPEARANCES) with many new originals added.<br />This Aussie film is not only a delight, but the characters are believable, and many who we know find themselves watching it over and over again- greatly brightens one's mood.  I'm purchasing the DVD soon to replace the video, now worn.<br />SIDE NOTE:  I find it rather interesting that Paul Mercurio, who is a definite delight as the male lead and extremely appealing, does not like this film and wants to distance himself from the whole dancing thing (although he danced for some time before his role in the movie).  It is too bad, because this movie is one of the best movies of all time.

0790731002|1.0|In his stinktastic reimagining of the Batman franchise, Joel Schumacher manages not only to fill his story with ridiculous plot elements but also to drain the backstory of all drama and emotion.  The worst performance by Val Kilmer ever.  He plays Bruce Wayne as if he's uninterested in how the movie turns out. Jim Carrey makes a terrible, non-intellectual riddler who is more concerned with physical contortions than mental puzzles.  Instead of showing the tragic backstory of Jones's \\"Harvey Two-Face,\\" Schumacher bizarrely opts to have it coldly related in a newscast so that more time can be spent on the brain-sucking (both literally and figuratively) plot.  Finally, Scumacher commits the ultimate sin, with a ridiculous, near-instant \\"cure\\" for the emotional scarring that provides Bruce Wayne with his reason for being Batman.  Apparently ruining this movie wasn't enough, so Schumacher had to ensure that all future Batman movies that followed in this continuity would be crap as well.  The only highlight of the movie was Robin, who is well played and whose origin is relatively faithful.  The only way to enjoy this movie is to watch \\"Batman and Robin\\" first, because then this one at least looks good by comparison.
B000000JO3|5.0|This is one of my Favorite alblums in my collection and also one of my most guarded (Along with my Fugazi collection).  I rarely play this in the presence of people who dont listen to this type of music because they often dont understand it or they dont like it.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a love for excellent yet often misunderstood music.
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek II, III, IV are the strongest in the series of original cast movies. VI is a finely done ending, but these three \\"treks\\" support each other. Since the day of Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\", there hasn't been a classic, simple, and enganging story of revenge and hatred. Nick Meyer's directorial takeover from Robert Wise (ST:TMP), was a good choice since Meyer likes to lay back on his classic-story roots. He portrays the characters, for the first time, as human...not forever youthful heroes. The Kirk-Khan rivalry take the vengeance scenario to new heights as past and present come together. ST II is about the acceptance of loss, the past that comes full circle, and the bystanding people who get caught in the middle. The Wrath of Khan remains, by far, the best in the series...and a chilling awakening of a realistic storyline. It may be sci-fi, but you can be assured the tale hits home...<br />Robert Eldridge (...)
B000069AUI|5.0|Based on sheer musical content, if this were any other band, I'd probably only give it 3 stars. Coldplay's Rush Of Blood To The Head brings nothing new from their first album. The main differences between A Rush... and Parachutes is the level of conviction and emotion that Chris brings to the table this time around. For this very reason is why Coldplay's new album is worthy of 5 stars.<br />While nothing truly groundbreaking, Coldplay really fleshes out their sound on this album. Part production, part instrumentation, the emotional urgency is far more potent on the new album then the old(take the feeling Trouble and put it on a 50+ minute scale). The result makes it far more compelling and far more emotionally tearing their previous effort. To put it best, Rush takes all of the old Coldplay elements, and cranks them up and generally just makes them feel more honest and effective. The musicianship seems tighter. Martin's voice is far stronger. Everything just seems to be in its right place to pull your heartstrings.<br />But this is not to downplay the importants of Parachutes. Parachutes essentially laid the groundwork for what A Rush... would sound like because like I said, its not that much of a departure from their previous work. Sadly, Rush is far from seminal, but as far as releases go in 2002, it definately ranks among the best. Best when accompanied by the two equally emotional The Last Broadcast and Sea Change.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Ok folks I was lucky enough to score sneak preview tickets and I got two things to say: 1. if you think that this movie will be just like Moulin Rouge, you're in for a surprise. and 2. if you think that it'll be like what the trailer depicts it will be, (as I did) then you're wrong. (as I was.) This movie is loads more fun. It didn't pick up where \\"Rouge\\" left off, but it was fun at the same time.<BR>   Perfect casting really helped. I feel I could go on for hours about Renee Zelwegger. She deserves the Oscar and after all they still owe her one for Jerry McGuire. She so fit the part of her character.<BR>   Heck, they did such a good job with this movie, I even like Richard Gere in it. And Im a notorious Gere basher. I mean lets face it, he ruined \\"mothman\\", he ruined \\"Unfaithful\\". But this was so well written he seemed to add to it. I mean its not everyday that you see him  dancing around in his underwear singing. (just see the movie and take my word for it: it's stunning)<br />   I cant say enought about the casting. Every one of the leads played their part to perfection and was perfect for the part. And some I didn't think could sing and dance that well. I was thoroughly entertained. I felt the way they filmed some of the song and dance scenes really made you feel as though they were playing it up as though all of life was like vaudville. Which, i don't know if it was true, but was fun to see none the less.<BR>   The only down fall; the songs almost come at you too fast and furious. It somewhat took away from the story a bit. But other than that if you like musicals your in for a treat. C'mon its a movie about the greatest city in the world, it couldn't be that bad. A possible top ten pick!!!
6305081751|5.0|I first saw this movie in the movie theater when it came out in 1985.<br /><br />This is a must-see movie for anyone who is dealing with a congenital facial anomaly.  The movie is about a teenager born with a rare facial anomaly.  The movie shows how he and his mom and the people in their lives deal with his facial anomaly.  This movie will stir all kinds of emotions in you.<br /><br />Both Cher and Eric Stolz do outstanding jobs in this movie.  Cher should have got an Oscar nomination for her role in this movie!
B000001Y79|5.0|I remember the first time I heard &quot;Don't Speak&quot; on MTV. I was up late at night when I should have been in bed and I fell in LOVE with the song. I fell so much so that I stayed up late the next night to catch the video again on MTV.<br />I originally bought Tragic Kingdom as a cassette because it would be awhile before I upgraded to a CD player.  I would rewind my favorite songs over and over again.  This particular album is their best, although I love their others.<br />The reason is because it seems to be a combination of sounds that they experimented with on their two albums prior to it and a stepping stone to their two albums following its release.  Normally, this kind of album would come later in artists' careers, but this one landed right at the beginning of their break-through.<br />You can still feel the hint of ska and reggae on the tracks.  Stefani's voice may not be the equivalent of a &quot;diva,&quot; but it certainly is unique and well-suited for this kind of music.  The only songs that I really don't listen to are &quot;Happy Now&quot;, &quot;The Climb&quot;, and &quot;Sixteen.&quot;  Occasionally, I'll even listen to them.<br />This is just a great album that will keep you hooked on No Doubt.  It influenced me to buy their first two albums and then their most recent ones when they were released.
B000069HK2|4.0|Okay, so I listened to The Used over the summer (ya know, before they sold out) when they hardly had any fans. Now they just [make me mad]. But I must admit the CD is good, or what the radio stations and tv stations haven't torn apart. I lost all my respect for The Used and although it's a good CD do not support them! They are...sellouts who couldn't handle having the little yet loyal fans they had earned...please send me hate mail.
B000002HEP|5.0|O.K, so your looking for a hard rock album, one thats filled with groove-induced sonic rumblings, multi-layered textures and soaring melodys? well, you've just purchased the right record. From the intense opener of &quot;Gardenia&quot; right down to the none-less majestic conclusion of &quot;Whitewater&quot;, this is an album that will be played for years to come. While the first tune is delivered with ferocious intensity, the ante is considerably upped with track number two &quot;Asteroid&quot;. And boy oh boy, it just keeps getting better. Imagine yourself floating in space, admiring the view when WHAM!...your head explodes. Yep, thats &quot;Asteroid&quot; alright. And to think... the best is yet to come. Don't let the insane titling of &quot;Supa scoopa and Mighty scoop&quot; put you off, this is rock with an edge. Getting used to the fast paced desert groove? Well don't, as its about to transform into a brutal blues jam, taking no mercy. And this vein is very much continued throughout. 100 degrees is classic Kyuss, while the epic &quot;Cosmic Rider&quot; is Sergeant Pepper with a modern twist. &quot;Demon cleaner&quot; takes us all on a journey, and the albums classic track &quot;Odyssey&quot; packs a heavy punch. The hilariously dubbed &quot;Conan Troutman&quot; will rock you to your foundations,until you reach &quot;N.O&quot;, A riff-tastic retro romp. &quot;Whitewater&quot; finally brings us full circle, and lets us all have a well deserved rest. Sound impressive? Sure is. You need this album. 'Nuff said.
B00005JLS0|2.0|I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw \\"the ring\\" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable. Maybe its because I've seen this before. yes it was in \\"you've got mail.\\" Two rich and professional people who in the begining dispise each other while one of them is in a relationship with another. About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character.  But they save it all for the end with the big \\"oh i've always felt this way kiss\\"<BR>   Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse. Sadly, Sandra's 'girl next door good looks' and Hugh's quick oneliners weren't enough to rescue this movie from its date with ...[removed store name].
B00006CXXU|5.0|I seriously did not think that Christina Aguilera could make a successful comeback, but she proved me wrong.  This album surpasses her debut.  She writes all the songs on this album except \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Impossible\\". I also like how the album doesn't sound manufactured and it sounds like her, it's very personalized. The album is also very diverse in musical styles..it has r&b, rock, and pop. Some of the songs here have very powerful, positive messages also. Here's my ratings:<br />1. Can't Hold Us Down: 4/5 It has a strong message. One of those femenist songs. I'm not into Lil Kim's part though. Upbeat song.<br />2. Walk Away: 5/5 This is one of my favorites.  She pours so much emotion into this song that you can feel it.  Truly amazing song.<br />3. Fighter: 5/5 This song has a very positive message.  She shows off her voice in this song. Rock like song.<br />4. Infatuation: 4/5 Pop song with a latin beat. Nothing special<br />5. Loving For Me: 3/5 She sounds like Mariah Carey (straight out of Butterfly) here.  One of those kick back, relax songs.  <br />6. Impossible: 5/5 I like this song.  It's very showful and shows off Christina's voice. Very jazzy, bluesy.<br />7. Underappreciated: 3/5 I'm not really feeling this song.<br />8. Beautiful:  5/5 I love this song. I love the lyrics.Its very inspiring and her voice sounds pretty as always<br />6. Make Over: 5/5 This song has a Gwen Stefani rock edge to it.  I didn't know she could sound like that.<br />7. Cruz: 3/5 This song sounds really retro. The beginning sounds really bad...but then it gets better.  <br />8. Soar: 5/5: This song is very inspiring. Its about doing what you want and following your dreams.  Her voice is very powerful here and there's a choir in the background.  Sounds like Mariah.<br />9. Get Mine, Get Yours: 5/5 The lyrics are heartless but the song is very catchy.  Upbeat song.<br />10. Dirrty: 4/5 It has good beat to dance to. You've all heard this...need to say no more.<br />11. A Voice Within: 5/5 Another inspiring song with positive lyrics saying that anything is possible.  <br />12. I'm O.K.: 5/5 Very heartfelt song. YOu can feel her pain and it lets you see more of her.<br />13. Keep Singing My Song: 3/5 A song about keep on going no matter what. Very boring unitl she holds this really long amazing note at the end.<br />Overall Stripped proves that Christina is a very talented artist who I can write songs and produce songs successfully.  She puts so much emotion in the songs and you can tell she puts a lot of effort into her music. Her voice sounds wonderful on all the songs and is very consistant.  She doesn't hold back. Christina has definately grown and I recommend this album to anyone because it is truly amazing.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Although I love this CD, this is my least favorite No Doubt album. The singles that they've released from it seem to have that familiar ska/reggae ring to it. In fact, it seems more alive on this album than the others.  However, I think that this album was a &quot;distraction&quot; in some ways.  Songs like Hella Good, Underneath It All, Detective, and a couple others are quite awesome.  Yet, some of the tracks are quite &quot;unsteady.&quot;  I may like them as songs in themselves, but not necessarily as No Doubt songs.  It is still a must-have for a fan.  The tracks are not completely blanketed under No Doubt's partially experimental sound.  I think that you'll enjoy it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I'm a little new to the Harry Potter fandom.  After seeing this movie on cable for the 900th time, I decided to buy the DVD. I was not sorry for the purchase! I purchased the widescreen edition and found it much more enjoyable than the pan and scan. There are parts that you miss with the pan and scan version like what is happening off to the side of the action.<br />I can't compare this movie to the book...yet...because I haven't in fact read the books but am working on it now.  :)  I did notice in the first two chapters of the book already that it is in fact different from the movie. The reader sees a bit more into the Dursleys's life than we do in the film. The film picks up when Harry is delivered to his Aunt and Uncle instead of before that when we learn of the fate of Lily and James Potter and baby Harry.<br />What I did find annoying was that the deleted scenes are so well hidden that without help from an instruction manual online, you can't find them.  For those of you who need help, as I did, this is how you get to the deleted scenes (I'm sure there are different ways, but this is how I was told to find them.) Insert the second disc and using your remote, you must do all of the following:<br />Hit &quot;Diagon Alley&quot; and enter on your remote.<br />Next is finding the correct bricks.<br />hit:<br />left, up, up, enter<br />up, enter<br />up, enter<br />down, down, enter<br />down, enter<br />Next you need to go to the bank.<br />Highlight the sign &quot;Gringotts&quot; and hit the down arrow key on the remote to highlight the key.

B00005KAQP|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was around 7 years old, and even back then I loved it. I have been watching the movie continuously since then, and it gets better and better every time I watch it. Whoopie Goldberg is hilarious as a Reno lounge singer hiding out from her murderous boyfriend as a nun. Maggie Smith plays the Mother Superior, who is less than happy with Whoopie staying in her convent. Whoopie transforms the dull, blase church into a jumping, flashy hip place to be! She takes over the choir, and turns them into gold. It is impossible not to love this movie. It's got something for everyone.. and I think I can safely say that I learned more about the Catholic Religion from watching this movie than I ever did from sitting in church every Sunday.

B00006RCNW|5.0|The Shield is the only thing worth watching on TV these days.  Action, drama, mystery, it just rocks.  It keeps me on the edge of the my seat every time I watch it.  I'm buying the first season the day it comes out.
B000075BFK|4.0|I bought this CD because I love 2Pac. Hes a great rapper, and so I was sure this album would be great as well. I got it, popped in the 1st CD, listened to the whole thing, and i thought that it wasnt really that good. On the 1st CD i only liked the last song Thugz Mansion with Nas. The 2nd CD was much better. I liked alot of the songs on the 2nd one. After having it over a month, i only listen to the 2nd CD when i do listen to it. I think at its price of just a bit over 1 CD cost, it was pretty good. But now, I wish i had rather downloaded the songs and saved 20 bucks. There are only a few songs that stand out to me and that I want to listen over and over again.<br />Id download:<BR>My Block Remix<BR>Thugz Mansion with Nas<BR>Thugz Mansion<BR>Better Dayz<br />There are a few others that are ok, and worth hearing. But those were my favorite.
B00006RCPM|5.0|After A.I,I feared that Mr.Spielberg had lost his touch,but now I can rest easy again.Minority Report is am absolutely brilliant film,filled with complex characters and an intruiging storyline.<BR>It may not be as lavish or colorful as his previous movies,but the style suits the story perfectly.And the story is actually the best part of the movie,so much so that you can watch the film over and over again and find something new every time.I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates good quality films,as well as science-fiction buffs.
B00005U18E|5.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged that a film is rarely as good as the novel upon which it is based.  For one thing, it simply is not possible in 90 to 120 minutes (or in this case 98 minutes) to dramatise every incident exactly as and when it occurs in the book, nor is it ever possible to get all the humorous internal dialogue and cute thoughts that run through a character's mind.  But with a screenplay co-written by Helen Fielding (the author herself), Andrew Davies (who wrote the screenplay to Pride and Prejudice--the adaptation with Colin Firth), and Richard Curtis (The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mr. Bean, Blackadder, Notting Hill) and then topped off with a terrific cast featuring Hugh Grant, who is absolutely wonderful here in the role of Bridget's bad-boy boss; and Colin Firth, in a modern-day reprisal of his signature role as Mr. Darcy--well, the stage is set for a production that just has to be good, regardless of its faithfulness (or lack thereof) to the original text.  <br />In fact, for those familiar with the novel, the film does deviate quite a bit.  Certainly, it captures the essence of the novel, and it follows its basic structure insofar as the bulk of the events that occur in the book occur also in the film.  But what occurs or what is said at these events is for the most part very different from the novel, with the character of Bridget's mom's (Gemma Jones (Duchess of Duke Street)) toy boy and thus the entire ending being completely different from the novel.  <br />I watched this film right after reading the novel, and I would definitely recommend against doing so.  If you've read the novel, let some time pass before watching the film, and then enjoy it on its own merits without expecting something that is too faithful to the text, for in spite of the deviations, this really is an cute film that is thoroughly enjoyable in its own right.  Just for the record, I've enjoyed this film much, much more upon subsequent viewings than I did initially!    <br />Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the story, it's about a 32-year-old single British woman (played surprisingly very well by American Renee Zellweger--the only non-Brit of the lot) who is looking for love but always seems to end up with commitment-phobic, game-playing losers--like her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  To make matters worse, she's surrounded by \\"smug married\\" friends intent on making her feel inadequate, and a mother who is intent upon fixing her up.  It is during one of those fixing-up occasions that Bridget meets the seemingly arrogant and rude Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), a highly successful lawyer and the son of her parents' friends.  From then on, Bridget seems to bump into Darcy everywhere she goes, much to her chagrin and often to her embarassment.  And that is all I shall say, for I don't wish to give things away for those unfamiliar with the story.<br />In conclusion, I recommend this film very highly to anyone looking for a fun, light, and thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy.  Familiarity with Pride and Prejudice is not necessary in order to enjoy this film--though one's enjoyment is bound to be greatly enhanced if one is familiar with and enjoyed the Pride and Prejudice dramatisation (which I recommend extremely highly).  After all, Colin Firth's original portrayal of Mr. Darcy was the inspiration for Fielding's Marc Darcy!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Sounds odd doesnt it? It makes you wonder how this could be a good movie, if you dont know what the hell happens in the end.  well my answer to that, is the same answer for every question that arises about this masterpiece....that answer is, i dont know.  Its labeled a thriller, and at that ir excells. Its a thriller, suspsenful and the biggest  mystery movie ever to grace this earth.  If you like lynch films youll love this, if you never saw a lynch film, its a aquired taste of sorts.  Some will like it, some will loath it.  Its abstract to say the lest.  But what really sends chills down your spine is the fact that by the time the closeing credits role around, you still cant figure it out, yet your drawn ever so further into for that same reason.  Theres something about the movie that doesnt sit well, its dsiturbting but for reasons unkown...and all this will lead you to watching the movie over and over.
630460291X|4.0|This movie, Robin hood is personally one of my favorites. I'm a big Kevin Costner fan so it came on to me natuarlly. I also am very interested in the day of Robin Hood. I give it four stars out of 5 because of action and well supported acting. I thought the sheriff was played well
B00005RFAI|5.0|I was reading all these reviews and I think its funny what the single star rater-haters had to say. When P!nk first made her appearance she already had me with her first single, so yes, I am a fan. I think that for someone to have the balls to post an \\" i hate this artist \\" and blah blah boo-hoo mini statement about how much \\"she ... and she needs to stop whining;poser this wah wah\\" needs to be speared in the head. I believe that a TRUE artist (such as pink) is willing to do what she loves best; whether its punk one moment, r&b the next. Sky's the limit. It's her cake, let her bake it how she wants! Love her or hate her...you're going to take a slice anyway!! She's good!
B000002U82|5.0|I bought this album used from my friend last year, and I think ive listened to it atleast once a week ever since, this is truely mind-blowing music.  I have never listened to anything that rivals DarkSide.  This is the only album that leaves me breathless everytime I listen to it, its the only album that has Phychedelic instrumentals, Deeply Introspective ballads, and snide political commentary all in about 40 minutes of continuous music.  I would reccomend this album to ANYBODY, no matter what kind of music they like, this is the kind of album that crosses all boundries.  Long live Dark side of the moon.
6303407188|5.0|&quot;Ed Wood&quot; is the very interesting story of the, considered by most, Worst Director Of All Time. And guess what? IT'S directed by one of the BEST directors of all time: Tim Burton. In the 50's, the direcor/producer/actor/writer named Ed Wood made numerous B-movies that starred Bela Lugosi, a swedish wrestler named Tor, his girlfriend, and other friends of his. Maybe it was the lack of funds. Maybe it was the lack of experience. But Ed's movies just weren't good! &quot;Ed Wood&quot; is his story. It tells of how Ed (played by Johnny Depp) meets his hero, Bela Lugosi, and is his friend until he dies. It also tells of his struggles to get his movies made. And when they finally are, he ignores the terrible reviews and gets started on the next film. This guy was driven and is really entertaining to watch. If you enjoy this movie, then you should rent some of Ed Wood's real movies! It's interesting to see how accurate the crew of &quot;Ed Wood&quot; was at re-creating the badly acted scenes from such movies as &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; or &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;. <BR>Final Grade for &quot;Ed Wood&quot;: B+

Her repression at the hands of her mother (another great performance) is very well done but I didn't buy the tenor of her relationship with the young &quot;genius&quot;. And the ending is a rather strained copout. Nevertheless, very interesting movie with some excellent acting. Unfortunately, the interview with Isabelle throws absolutely no light on her character - she must be a brilliant instinctive actress.
B000002J1S|5.0|I've been a music fan since the mid 60's. In the late 60's my musical taste developed towards the art/progressive rock genre. Before Genesis I listened to King Crimson, The Moody Blues, and ELP. In late 1973, early 74 a review I read led me to Genesis, who at the time had 5 studio albums. I bought &quot;From Genesis to Revelation first, liked it but waited a while then read a review of the newly released at the time, &quot;The Lamb lies down on Broadway&quot; I rushed out, had to go 60 miles to the nearst music store in Memphis to get this album. For over 5 yrs I listen to this album everyday, sometimes more than once a day, I could not get enough, bought every other Genesis album, but still &quot;The Lamb&quot; prevailed when I got home and It was the album I prefered to hear. Now 30 yrs later thru 3 worn out albums and 1 still often played CD of the &quot;Lamb&quot;. I would have to say this is my number 1 musical album/CD of all time. It's timeless appeal, and lyrical message, seem to never go away. I have only one son, I named him Rael. The positive influnce this album has had on my life I can not describe with words. This is a must have album, a classic/masterpiece. I have over a thousand albums, or CD's This one is Number 1, the only other work of music which has come close to getting as much play time by my desire to hear, would be Tori Amos's &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; yet it's only 7 yrs old, Only time will tell. The Lamb has stood the test of time I'd say. It should be in everyones collection. And I bet it would end up on everyone's best list if it was.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Now, let's see how to describe it without giving it away, hm. I won't even go into what people who read these things look for. For parents: There is plenty of suggestive dancing as befits the time and the place,.... People get shot a few times, but they make it as nice as possible...nothing close to the goriness of \\"Road to Perdition\\". There's also a little bit of street language, but nothing a pre-teenager hasn't already heard. It has much in common with the wonderful \\"Moulin Rouge\\" in that there's a strong visual attack (I think \\"razzle-dazzle\\" is an accurate description!) and in that there's considerable artistic license with the time period (what comes to my mind: could black performers be onstage with white performers, let alone touch them the way they do here?!). So, once again historians may nitpick. Ignore them.<br />I hate that, at 42, I'm too young to have seen the original Chicago that Bob Fosse produced, nor have I seen the theatre production. However, this may be an advantage. I don't have that \\"this was/was not as good as\\" monkey on my back, and can enjoy the movie on its face value alone.<br />I'm also glad that I'm not familiar with either one of the lead actors (except Latifah) to be able to pre-judge them as actors and singers. Suffice it to say that I thought the dance numbers were fantastic, and regardless, anybody who can dance as well as Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Zeta-Jones in heels that high has my respect. Look out for one number very reminiscent of Elvis' Jailhouse Rock. The supporting cast is equally top-notch...you'll catch a glimpse or two of Christine Baranski, Taye Diggs, Mya, and Chita Rivera, who just received a Kennedy Center Honor.<br />The story was great. I had a character I could care about, and surprisingly, it wasn't any of the leads. I'll bet, after seeing it yourself, you can guess which one earned my sympathy. Roxie, around whom it should be no surprise the story revolves, is a character I started out feeling a little sorry for, but she became [weaker] as the story progressed. The ending surprised me a tad, but I won't spoil that for those who haven't seen it. Aren't I nice?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had cool songs, great performances, I didn't cringe but a couple places in the movie, and was able to laugh a little as well. If this is any indication of what movies will be like in 2003, there may actually be something worth looking forward to on the Oscars next year!<br />Chicago opened in Oklahoma City on January 3rd.but she became [weaker] as the story progressed.

6305350205|2.0|Because Trek fans I know will go to any lengths to dis this trek flick w/o doing much to explain what went wrong, they inevitably allow some hardcore trekkies to claim that this was a series' jewel in the rough - a flawed flick that could do with some minor alterations (possible w/today's CGI).  Actually, even a bare view of this movie confirms that, among Trek movies, this is the flick that-gods-destroy.<br />The plot concerns Sybok (Lawrence Luckinbill), a renegade Vulcan (he smiles, he laughs, he brings hope to the hopeless) who gathers followers from the denizens of the bleak planet Nimbus-III (the so-called \\"planet of peace\\", Nimbus-III has been shared by the Romulans, Federation and the Klingons, all of whom quickly realized its worthlessness and assigned their least important diplomats to safeguard it.) Sybok's cause is vague, though it requires a starship - although just about everybody on Nimbus-III could use a ticket off. Sybok engineers a hostage crisis, knowing that Starfleet will send a ship to deal with it. Starfleet sends in the crew of Enterprise, cutting short a much-needed vacation for the crew - and the ship (Enterprise-A, unveiled at the very end of the last film, is now revealed to be less-than-shipshape). Giving a bold effort, the crew plunge in, learning too late that the crisis was a trap meant to snare them. When Sybok is on the verge of failure, a last-minute betrayal by Spock (also revealed as Sybok's half-brother - another instance in which the vastness of the Trek-universe is abridged by relatives - no matter wherever the Enterprise goes, it's going to run across somebody's parents, lover or misc. relative), gives the Enterprise over to the hijackers. Though he has numbers on his side, Sybok really relies on a strange power to control people - the power to end whatever long-lived pain assails them. For Spock, it was being a half-breed; for McCoy, it was his mercy-killing his terminally ill father (adding insult to injury, a cure came outjust a few months later). Kirk has barely enough time to spring out of the ship's brig and send a distress call before he confronts Sybok and learns the laughing Vulcan's mater plan: break through the energy barrier at galaxy's edge (seen in episodes of the old show) and find the planet of the all-powerful Shaka-Ree, or god. Complicating things are the crew of a renegade Klingon ship which intercepts the distress call and decide to hunt the Enterprise down for their own glory-hungry captain.<br />So what went wrong? Poor special effects were a convenient excuse. Let's start with the story - the search for god? Forget the \\"Klingon Glasnost\\" idea that became \\"Trek VI\\" - none of the trek flicks are more dated than this ode to yuppie-angst. There's little else to the story which has the Enterprise traveling through the energy barrier untouched (this is a blatant break of continuity - the barrier is supposed to affect both ship and crew, and Sybok is never shown mind-melding with the Enterprise).  Once past the barrier, the crew searches for the planet of Shaka-Ree, making this film look lighter than an episode of one of the shows. What about the characters? Forgetting how the flick makes Kirk the center of attention, the characters are simply too weak and at ease with each other. That's dangerous - instead of the great repartee that underlined Treks II through IV, we get low-comic relief (Uhura's fan dance; Scotty's walking into a bulkhead; even Luckinbill, a distinguished stage actor, crafts his \\"laughing Vulcan like a cross between a Hollywood agent, new-age Guru and Vegas stand-up). Then there's Kirk - even \\"Search for Spock\\" allowed itself to focus (if briefly) on McCoy, Uhura and Hikaru \\"don't call me Tiny\\" Sulu. There's no way to explain how shamelessly the script hurls Kirk as superman in your face (and Kirk was always one of my faves - though McCoy always stole the show IMNSHO). Starfleet calls Kirk in because only he can defuse the hostage crisis. The rogue Klingon hunts Kirk down because only the death of the Enterprise's captain will prove what a great Klingon he is. (When a photon torpedo narrowly misses the Enterprise, the Klingon growls of Kirk \\"He's gooood\\"). Then there are the lamentable special effects - ILM was too busy filming other films, but that doesn't explain how the spaceships look like AMT models, lumbering across space or zipping through it cartoonishly. Even the energy barrier looks less spectacular than it did when it appeared on the original show. Was ILM the only decent FX firm in 1988. Still, FX can't really save a movie (consider that the blockbusters of '88-89 that did enjoy ILM's attention were \\"Ghostbusters 2\\" and the last \\"Indiana Jones\\" movie) and Trek came of age without decent special effects at all (easily outlasting \\"Space 1999\\" with its gorgeous effects and nonexistent drama or characters). I love Trek as much as the next Trekker, and prefer the classic brand to DS9, Voyager or even NexGen, yet this entry was an embarassment.  Instead, take out Trek IV and watch our heroes dish out more dignified fun.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|Here we have an hyperrealistic portrait of what ruthless and amoral media moguls in pursuit of audience can commit, exploiting the  mental deterioration of the unfortunate Howard Beale, save disposing of him quite pitylessly when he proves no more useful to them. That's the story in a nutshell,but it's the climaxes and the turning points of the narration, and the utterly unscrupolous charachter interpreted by Faye Dunaway that make this movie a masterpiece. My favourite moment is when we see the UBS moguls gloating in their ill-gotten success, only to be crushed by  Howard Beale's appeal against the CCE takeover by the Arabs. The following scenes are less convincing, but the scene of the crazy Howard whit the Great Boss is impressive, and the finale is pure melodrama. A very good movie, worthy companion to &quot;A voice in the crowd&quot;
B00005OAIE|5.0|well lets start where everyone else has... the comparisons to jack johnson &amp; dave matthews are definately warranted, however, liking these two artists by no means gaurantees that you will like john.<BR>this album is the first album in a long time (probably since dmb's crash) that requires me to listen to it on a daily basis.  the lyrics, the crafty guitarwork and the vocal drawl that is john mayer should have you sitting there and smiling.  Songs such as 'no such thing' (although greatly overplayed on todays radio), 'hey georgia', 'neon' and my personal favourite '83' will then promise the fact that you will not only be smiling but also tapping you feet and nodding in agreement.<BR>as stated before this is a great album and if you have any doubts about the talent of john mayer, check him out live in concert in all of his glory.... your views will be sure to change!!
B00006JDVV|2.0|I will say that the film had a pretty cool concept. What if Dragons were real...and they were brought back to life? <br />But the film didn't really deliver this. \\"Reign of Fire\\" is pretty much about people trying to survive in a post-holocaust world - they could've picked Dragons, nuclear war, you name it - it wasn't really about the dragons, which was disappointing. <br />Having watched the film, there really isn't any good reason I can think of to tell you to watch it. The CGI effects are okay, but I'm assuming you've seen Jurassic Park and aren't low-brained enough to want to see a movie for the effects only. The story is pretty trite and the characters and dialogue are jaded to the nth degree. Christian Bale is the reluctant hero who never quite gets it together, and Matthew McConaughey is the unbelievable nut-job-wild-eyed army guy, complete with the stubby cigar cliché. The problem with the characters is that we never really know who the protagonist is supposed to be. Bale is a wussy, McConaughey is a psycho - right up until the end. You can't really latch on to a hero in this one. Part of that problem is the plot, which suffers greatly from the short length of the movie. When you're trying to convey the discovery of dragons, the destruction of the world, the establishment of a new society, and the final victory over the dragons, you need more than an hour and half to do it with any kind of depth. The story felt rushed and overall I felt as though I had just watched a part of a movie, rather than an entire film.<br />While better than say, The Mummy, this film suffers from the recent Hollywood notion that special effects and fire are enough to draw people in to see a film. So they get a concept - dragons in this case - crap out a screenplay and spend 2 years on the props, believing that people will pay 8 bucks to see a flying dragon. If they want to know why the movie industry is failing, look no further.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I got this CD 4 christmas and i have had it in my car since then.  its a great CD, christina really put her heart in2 it and it shows a lot.  the whole CD is mostly her personal experiences.  The song &quot;im OK&quot; is great, it shows that she is a real person with real feelings!  i love it and think that even if u dont like christina, u should listen 2 it, im sure u will enjoy it!
B000006JQ5|5.0|Iron Maiden, for those who don't know, are the best British metal band ever! Steve Harris, the bass player and songwriter, is one of the most unbelievable musicians I have ever heard. The driving bass that plays as fast as the guitars (there are three now, Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, and Janick Gers), and the ripping guitar solos, along with the amazing voice of Bruce Dickinson, combined with Nicko McBrain's crazy drumming style make one hell of a memorable compilation. While lifelong Maiden fans may say that some of the songs should not have been put on this cd, I think it shows the different things the band has tried. While 34 tracks may be a bit much for the part-time metal head, songs like \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" (which they do as well live as the recording) show why Maiden has lasted this long. If you own all of Maiden's other cds, WHY DON'T YOU OWN THIS ONE? It has tracks that don't appear anywhere else. For those of you who own no Maiden albums, this is one hell of a good start. Maiden is the best metal band still in existance, and it is my humble opinion that they could kick Metallica's [behind] (in music AND soccer) any day.
6304712936|4.0|The classic \\"battle of the bands\\" movie, in which our hero (The Kid) overcomes adversity and defeats the entrenched musical establishment by kicking butt in a triumphant orchestral finale.<br />Oh wait, that's Purple Rain.<br />Um, this movie is basically a Purple Rain [imitation].
B00005OAIE|5.0|the songs that you know are great songs and get stuck in your head easily. the songs that you never heard before are easy to follow along with and memorize. they have good beats and great rhythem. songs 1-12 deserve 5 stars. great cd...can't wait for his next one..but i don't think he will be able to top this cd
B000005RFQ|3.0|Not bad, but it's just not Sabbath. In the early 80's, a strange thing happened. Black Sabbath lost their second vocalist, R. J. Dio, and replaced him with none other than former Deep Purple wailer Ian Gillan. Ian didn't really fit in with the band. He didn't dress in black and wouldn't wear a big silver cross around his neck. His high falsetto vocals sound strange for Sabbath and are a bit awkward at times... as if the music was written before he got a chance to develop his parts. Overall, it's a pretty good early 80's Heavy Metal album, but the sound is quite removed from Black Sabbath's traditional sound, save for two tracks. Disturbing The Priest is one of my favorite songs ever, and the title track has a bit of a gloom &amp; doom vibe. This album gets 3 stars just for those tracks. However gone was most of the apocalyptic dinosaur riffs, in favor of a more mainstream, commercial sound... with the exception of the previously mentioned tracks. Yet Tony Iommi still had the heaviest guitar tone and style of playing ever. Trashed and Zero The Hero are pretty good rockers, but like I said before, it's just not Sabbath. They would have done better to change the name of the band after Dio left.
0151008116|5.0|I read this book in a day!  Not only was it an easy read, but a beautiful one at that.  Yann Martel is truly one of our time's greatest storytellers.  I felt myself getting totally immersed in this gorgeous story about a boy and his adventures at sea.<br />I was extremely disappointed when it was over.  Truly..one of the best books I've ever read!  I can't wait to hand it over for some of my friends to read.  Buy this book!!!!
0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story.  When I first decided to read it I had no idea that it would be such a good book.  The love conflicts between the characters really make you think about how important getting to know someone is before you marry them.  It also makes you realize how much your views on someone can change when you are forced to become close to them.  After reading Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, I realize why it is considered to be a classic.  You can imagine that you are Elizabeth, or you can imagine you are watching as Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley fall in love.  I recomend this book to people who would like to read a wonderful and emotionally stimulating novel.
B0000024K1|5.0|This album was groundbreaking when it first came out, and its powerful message still resonates today.  Every single track on this CD was played on the radio during the early 1990s, and all of them are powerful and provocative.<br />It's a given that a Public Enemy album will be entertaining.  While this CD has a great deal of entertainment value, the real value is in the message of the lyrics.  Chuck D does an incredible job by intelligently providing a mouthpiece for disenfranchised and disheartened people of all kinds, not just African Americans.  At times, these lyrics can evoke a sense of anger and sadness as well as a great deal of joy.<br />This is a great album for playing in the car on a long drive.  The great beats and profound lyrics are sure to keep you entertained.  I highly recommend It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back by Public Enemy.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used's self titled album is a very very good album. Unlike many of the artists out there today, The Used's c.d. has a lot of variety. There aren't just all hard core songs, they also have a couple of slow songs. I promise you will always be in the mood to listen to this c.d., it has been in my c.d. player since the day I got it and it has not been taken out. It is not only the fact that these guys are super hot, they make awesome... music that everyone should listen to and enjoy!!!!
B000075BFK|4.0|well now i've seen other reviewers knockin' this cd hard and i've also seen people ride Pac's jock without giving too much reason for example \\"oh 2Pac was this________\\" whatever the blank they don't describe how this cd is great. While i'll admit the ppl that are hatin give some valid points. So with all that inmind this is my review.<br />See every1 including the official reviewer of this album on this site have mentioned \\"these are studio leftovers\\" blah blah blah that is just plain wrong because if you know anything about 2pac's recording time & official people that knew him that stood nothing to gain by lying have said he intended perfectly for the songs to be released whether or not in this form for after he died so with that in mind i'll focus on some tracks that need light on them<br />> Still Ballin' - because of the revamped beat it becomes a very high energy track something Until The End Of Time was lacking abit so in my mind it is very fresh along with the unlikely pairing of Trick Daddy who surprisingly sounds very very good trading rhymes off with the late great Mr. Shakur<br />> Mama's Just A Little Girl - great track it was also called Dear Mama Part. 2 by 2pac him self and it shows 2Pac's touching side well with some nice slowed down RnB Production<br />> When We Ride on Our Enemies - the unreleased versions original production was way way better it had more of Hit Em Up type feel to which gave this track a little more than a diss but unfortunately through the updated beat it loses most of it's shimmer but 2pac's words are lyrical fire none the less and he sounds really good because you can really feel the anger in his voice like he is high on sumthin' like the track All Out on Until The End Of Time<br />> Ghetto Star - ppl who enjoyed the ooriginal Pac tracks will love thsi simply because it is basically an untouched track with Nutt-So making one of the few good guestings on the album<br />> Thugz Mansion (Accoustic Remix) - again the site revieweris wrong. Tha Outlawz Pac's best homies (who aren't the best with Suge Knight who you state gets Nas on this)have stated the beef was pretty much officially squashed except for acctually going in an recording a track together and the track is a real smooth laid back feel with Nas one of the best rappers alive sharing the Mic with 2Pac one of the best rappers ever<br />> My Block Remix - GREAT TRACK it has the whole teacher but not preacher vibe that alot of good Tupac songs had like Changes, White Man's World, Krazy, Until The End Of Time with a way way better beat than the original, the original just had no life<br />> Fame - this track is a true gem it was also 100% with out a doubt supposed to be released because in an interview right before 2Pac died he talks about this song and \\"sing's\\" the chorus for the interviewer and he talks about how syked he is about it and 2pac spits off another very teachy type song and he writes a very catchy chorus which one might not expect & Kadafi (R.I.P) of Tha Outlawz makes the best guesting on the album<br />these are my pics for the most interesting tracks on the album but there are many many more great tracks on the album that will have you thinking and wanting to bump in your ride or at a party, pic it up it's great i only wish he were here
B00006J9OT|5.0|This live concert CD has nothing but good things to recommend it and I would say to anyone who likes standards done right as well as terrific bossa nova arrangements done by the masterful Claus Ogerman - that you can simply do no wrong in buying this audio CD.  Not to mention that Diana Krall is quite an accomplished musician and her jazz piano skills really impressed me in this concert.<br />The only thing that has me puzzled, however, is why a non-live (studio recorded) Billy Joel track was subsituted for the wonderful Nat King Cole-inspired &quot;Love Letters&quot; (also arranged and conducted by Ogerman).  I do not see a reason for this subsitution on the audio CD.<br />If you are driving around in your car or want to listen to good music while you are traveling, the audio CD is definitely the way to go.  However, if you are home or have access to a DVD player in your location, nothing beats the DVD of this concert - where you can see as well as hear these first-rate musicians play, almost as if you were attending the concert yourself (with some considerable advantage to the DVD viewer with the excellent camera angles provided).<br />--bj<br />January 2003
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is the winner album all the way. Ever since chris cornell signed in along with RATM, it was destined o be a winner. I Didnt understand why the former grunge merchants soundgarden disbanded in the first place but this album can be heralded as the return of grunge.<BR>Right from the beginning of the first track cochise this album rocks hard, except the slow I am the Highway. Tom morello is in fine form making maximum use of dropped D tuning on his guitar( as was typical of all the Seattle bands during they golden era of mid 90s, to sample dropped D I recommend to take a  listen to the album \\"Strap it on \\" by Helmet).However the drummer sounded a bit weak (no comparison to Matt Cameron).Overall the album is worth a buy and the tracks get better after listening couple of times.
B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" was a disappointment at the box office - and among many critics - when it was first released in 1980. But, like Carpenter's remake of \\"The Thing\\" (1982), \\"The Fog\\" has gained an ever-growing cult following over the last two decades, and many critics have given the film a second look and now regard it as a classic, \\"old-fashioned\\" ghost story. Along with \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Halloween\\", this film in my opinion represents Carpenter's best work. Almost everything in this film is perfectly done - the acting, the plot, the musical score, and the eerie, moody feel of the entire film.<br /><br />The film is set in the beautiful little seaside town of Antonio Bay, California, which is preparing to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding. On the night before the celebration, several bizarre and unnatural events take place between midnight and one AM - cars turn on by themselves and honk their horns, glass windows crack and shatter for no reason, phones ring all over town despite no one placing calls,  and a glowing, creepy fog is seen offshore by Stevie Wayne, the owner and deejay of the local radio station (Adrianne Barbeau, in one of her most memorable roles). Father Malone, the Episcopalian priest at the local church (Hal Holbrook, in an appropriately gloom-and-doom performance) finds a journal written by his grandfather, one of Antonio Bay's founding fathers. In it he learns that his grandfather and the town's five other founding members (their memories are being honored at the 100th anniversary celebration the next day) are actually murderers and thieves. It seems that a wealthy man named Blake developed leprosy and moved to a leper colony on an offshore island. He wanted to move the colony to the shore a few miles from the town, but the six founders of Antonio Bay were horrified at the prospect of a next-door leper colony, so they set a campfire on the beach to lure Blake's ship - the \\"Elizabeth Dane\\" - to its' doom on the jagged rocks offshore. A glowing, eerie fog covered the ship, it hit the rocks and sank, and all of the poor lepers on board - including Blake - were drowned. Blake's fortune in gold coins was used to build the church and a huge gold cross where Father Malone now holds worship services.<br /><br />From there the film rapidly picks up speed, as the creepy fog rolls in from the ocean, causing havoc with power and telephone lines, and horrifying \\"shapes\\" (the long-dead corpses of the lepers) appear out of the fog to claim their revenge. This film doesn't have much blood and gore, but like all classic films of the genre it has plenty of suspense, tension, and chills. Just as \\"Psycho\\" made many people scared of showers and \\"Jaws\\" left others wondering whether their beaches were safe, after watching \\"The Fog\\" you'll never see another fogbank the same way again. Highly Recommended!
6302994063|5.0|As with any Baz Luhrman film, if you can survive the first dizzying ten minutes then you're good to go.  the movie is about a noncomformist ballroom dancer named Scott who trains beginner Fran, who is in desperate need of a makeover.  the two continue to dance, despite Scott's overbearing mother (who hopes to relive her dream through her son), and judges who hate Scott for not following the rules.  the memorable cast also includes Scott's father (a once-famous ballroom dancer himself), Fran's grandmother who teaches her and Scott about rhythm, and Scott's kid sister, who brings a fresh outlook to the dance floor.  some parts of the movie can be unbearable because they are overemotional, and the end is quite predictable, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I'm glad I stuck out the first 10 minutes of the movie.  even if you don't know anything about ballroom dancing, you will find yourself wanting to start lessons as soon as you finish the movie.
B00005M91K|1.0|When I popped this DVD into my player, I was expecting a serene, uplifting experience that was, as the case says, 'beyond words to describe. At the very least, I expected a nice diversion of peaceful scenery and calming music. Well sir, that is not what I got. This video meanders from the mildly boring to downright depressing. If you've ever felt that this world is over-populated with people who struggle through a pitiful meaningless existence or that life is a hopeless torment then you have some idea what waiting in this 104 minutes of footage. Now this might be exactly what the filmmaker meant to do and if so, Bravo! But if you're looking for an enlightening experience of hope, wonder and serenity I suggest you keep looking.

6305014140|5.0|This movie is not your average ninja movie.  Here in the US we think of ninjas as &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; or that stupid Chris Farley movie.  But this is an amazing movie that combines the action, gore, and heartbreak of being a ninja.  Jubei (the protagonist) faces some cool enemies too.  One guy has a bee hive in his back and another had his head chopped off and came back to life.  Jubei is to ninja anime what Spike Speigal (Cowboy Bebop) was to the anime bounty hunting genre.  This movie is soooooooo sweet.  Check it out if you haven't already.  If you don't, you're missin out.  P.S.:I almost cried at the end, and I usually don't cry while watching movies.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first heard of T.A.T.U, I was not sure if they would be as big a hit in the United States as in their homeland of Russia. However, after hearing their first English album, I have no doubts that they are surely on their way to winning the hearts of many of American listeners. Their songs are quite different from many American groups, and is a much needed refreshment from the same sounds heard on the radio. Their music ranges from pop to slow, heartfelt love songs. They even have a superior cover of How Soon Is Now? by 80's group The Smiths. After thorough review of this album, I mast say that I would recommend it to anyone, because it has something for everyone.
0553103547|2.0|I've read all three.  I am waiting for the fourth, if only because the story never ends, and I guess I need to find out what happens.  It's a great story poorly told, interesting, with many plot twists and turns that are so unique and unexpected that they eventually become predictable--what is the worst, most depressing, shocking turn of events that could occur?  And it usually does.<br />It's the writing I can't stand.  It's terrible, juvenile, wretched prose, with phrases like, \\"walking like he had a dagger up his ...\\".  I've read the story once, and never again.  It's a pity that a great story was delivered so poorly, when the author had at his disposal the same language of Tolkien!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first heard of T.A.T.U, I was not sure if they would be as big a hit in the United States as in their homeland of Russia. However, after hearing their first English album, I have no doubts that they are surely on their way to winning the hearts of many of American listeners. Their songs are quite different from many American groups, and is a much needed refreshment from the same sounds heard on the radio. Their music ranges from pop to slow, heartfelt love songs. They even have a superior cover of How Soon Is Now? by 80's group The Smiths. After thorough review of this album, I mast say that I would recommend it to anyone, because it has something for everyone.
B000002NJS|5.0|This album is wonderful! This is her opus. I say that fully realizing that she will top herself again in the future. The album gently pulls you in with \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\" telling the listener where the singer is currently at in her life. Ultimately, you are drowning only to be saved by track 2 with \\"Swim\\" which offers hope and redemption regardless of the state of the world. Upon arriving at the other shore of \\"Swim\\" the listener sees (and hears) a \\"Ray of Light.\\" The song rushes and speeds the listener through a life illustrating how fleeting the moment of life is. Then through \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" Madonna takes us to a moment of enjoying and embracing sensuality only to get to a point where this become an obession in the track \\"Skin.\\" Then she is redeemed and finds that importance lies within by presenting the track \\"Nothing Really Matters.\\" Her she comes to terms with the world and tries to explain that she is NOT a \\"material girl.\\" Her grasp of the the spiritual is exhibited in \\"Sky Fits Heaven.\\" Do what feels natural and what is the natural order of life. She further gets into the spiritual with \\"Shanti/Ashanti.\\" Now that she has comes to term with her path in life she can see others and what they may be missing in their life. She is telling others to clear themselves and not to waste their time with \\"hate and regret.\\" Realizing that a person can not change a person, the greatest good to do for oneself is to let go, therefore \\"The Power of Goodbye\\" is realized. Rely on yourself for happiness. Then the realization that something can be contained within yet never be touched. Again happiness comes from inside not from what or who you may think you \\"have.\\" Then she tells how a child (Little Star) can be taught what she has learned, understanding this is love in the purest form. The album ends with \\"Mer-Girl\\" an obvious reaction to the entire album in that she can't change the world to fit herself (whether it is the water or shore) therefore by adapting to both worlds in a form of a mer girl she can obtain the meaning of it all. \\"Mer Girl\\" is haunting and deeply personal, it takes courage to exhibit these basest of human feelings. The track is not easy to listen to due to the disturbing facts and images. The only redemption here is that life is much like a \\"Ray of Light\\" and is menacingly short. We need to make the most of every moment, embracing our experiences we have survived, learn from these and transform ourselves. The album is NOT a mere pop album, but an epihany regarding life.<br />Buy this opus and enjoy it!ting to both worlds in a form of a mer girl she can obtain the meaning of it all. \\"Mer Girl\\" is haunting and deeply personal, it takes courage to exhibit these basest of human feelings.

B00006LLJ4|5.0|My sweet brother Mike got me this DVD for my birthday. I have seen the movie three times and appreciate its brilliance more after each viewing, Steven Spielberg challenges his audience to think while he tells this story as only he can. The premise a very scary one seems that one day it will be real. Samantha Morton whose beauty was so evident in Sweet and Lowdown is incredible as Agatha. I must admit the reason I went to see it the first time was for Colin Farrell..just so incredible an actor and so handsome on film that I forgot Tom Cruise was in the picture at all for awhile, but Tom is terrific and of course that scene stealer Max Von Sydow does a great job as well. Get the Popcorn and the Milk Duds and hang on for a great ride!!! Candace Serviss
0066214122|5.0|I just finished Prey and let me tell you, it was amazing. From the very beginning of the book it is interested and fun reading. Michael wrote the book in a way that was similar to jurassic park and the andromeda strain. Once i started it, i couldnt put it down. It only took me about 3 days to finish it because it was so cool i couldnt wait to find out what was going to happen next. If you havent bought this book yet, BUY IT! It was definetly worth the buy.
B00005JLS0|4.0|This is a well-written, well acted film that has a cute, somewhat predictable story, but makes you feel good anyway.<br />Never asked to act beyond her talents, Sandra Bullock (Lucy Kelson)is perfectly cast as a dedicated activist/lawyer, hired by rich, good-looking, Hugh Grant (George Wade).  Not a employee/employer relationship made in heaven, but one based on a deal and a promise.<br />The chemistry is good, the script well written, no one else I can think of could have filled the role of George Wade like Hugh Grant.  The smart and perfectly timed one-liners seemed to have been written for his delivery.<br />Great date film.  Moves right along at an enjoyable pace.  Nothing complicated.  Just love, fun, and great casting.<br />Worth the price of the ticket for the pleasure and the laughs (which come often).
B00003CXI1|4.0|I have literally watched this movie over and over again.  Wonderful acting, drama, adventure, etc.  Each time you watch it, you notice things you haven't before.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.  I do believe that both movies are a little scary for children...that is why I gave it 4 stars. I would wait to show this movie to children until they are at least 13.  Otherwise...enjoy!
0385335482|1.0|I didn't want to keep this book around.<br /><br />I have read both of the Bridget Jones books, and this one appears to be somewhat of a ripoff (not knockoff) of Bridget.  The main character, Rebecca, is a liar and a compulsive shopper who feigns a relative's death to cover another lie.  How repulsive.  The lies this woman tells are so selfish, childish, and awkward that I was embarrassed for both the character and the author.  I didn't find much humor in it at all and I loved both Bridgets.<br /><br />(I'm not concerned with those who don't find my review \\"helpful.\\"  It is truthful as I see it, and I am not seeking their approval anyway.  I considered this book a waste of time and money. You may disagree with my opinion, but I obviously disagree with yours as well.)
B00005JKZT|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  Sure, when I saw it at midnight, my brain was half dead, but then I saw it a couple more times when I was fully awake and it was great.  Attention Tolkien purists: You will not like this movie if you can't stand any changes made from the book.<br />If you're not a big Tolkien BOOK fan and you just want to see a good movie, here are some basic guidelines to whether you'd like it or not:<br />If you really don't like violence, don't see this film.  None of the violence is graphic, but it's rated PG-13 for \\"Epic battle sequences and scary images\\".  If you liked Fellowship of the Ring for the beautiful Shire and Rivendell and cute hobbit-children, you'll be surprised at how much darker The Two Towers (TTT) is.<br />If you're a parent and you have kids under 13 who are absolutely begging to see this movie, screen it first.  Especially if your kids are sensitive to creepy ghosts and people getting killed and disgusting monsters called orcs, this is not a good film for them to see.  I've heard that most parents see the PG part of the PG-13 rating and not the 13.<br />If you like comedies and not dramatic epics, this is not a good movie for you.<br />If you LOVE fantasy action/adventures, you'll love this movie.<br />If you can't stand creatures that don't exist in real life, this is not a film you'd like.<br />If you're a person in the category that I call Tolkien purist, where you can't stand anyone changing Tolkien's glorious epic, then you'll be horrified at some of the changes.  I'm a super-ringer (Tolkien FAN, not purist), and I was a little miffed with Faramir's changes, but it's still a great movie.<br />If you loved FOTR (Fellowship of the Ring), love the books, but don't mind changes made, GO SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW!!<br />And also if you've read The Silmarillion, you'll adore some references to the Undying Lands, Valinor, the Valar, and the elves passing over the sea.<br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen FOTR.  That would just be crazy, because you wouldn't understand a thing.<br />If you're a little out of the Tolkien loop, and you're wondering what happens in this movie, a bare bones summary is \\"The quest continues to destroy a ring with the power to enslave the world\\".  A little more thorough description is that Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are chasing orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin.  Frodo and Sam continue towards Mordor, and are joined by Gollum.  A, L, and G meet up with the people of Rohan and join them in fighting a huge battle at a place called Helm's Deep.  The rest I won't spoil.<br />Please go see this movie!  It's a breath of fresh air after some of the junk that Hollywood comes out with.....

B000002LCX|3.0|I'm a huge Smiths fan, I listened to them non-stop in college and saw them in concert in the Washington DC and London. I like everything Morrisey and Marr produced except this album. It's terribly uneven with some good tracks surrounded by really weak collborations. (You can tell the band had run it's course). Despite this there are four great songs, A Rush and a push, Girlfriend in a coma, Last Night I dreamt somebody Loved me (fantastic) and the incredibly beautiful  I won't share you. Marr's arrangements and musicianship are extraordinary but it's not enough to make up for poor material.<br />This is  worth buying handful of good songs but if you are a first timer I would recommend The Queen is Dead or Hatful of Hollow, a collection of BBC recordings.
0020442203|2.0|... but only if you like so called 'timeless classics' that don't have any action! I tried to read this book once, and I kept pushing myself to finish it, but I could not! It was just so boring and strange. Edmond's a jerk - I mean, if you saw a strange person riding about on a carrige pulled by reindeer, would you stop and ask them if you could have turkish delight? Gosh.<BR>Now I am being forced to read this book in Lit Lab. I want to protest, but I like the teacher too much.
B00007B6RW|5.0|...you really won't. The dance floor anthem, &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; in no way prepares you for the power and breadth of this album. Don't mistake this effusiveness for fan worship. This is genuinely a terrific album. You get the feeling you're watching an artist stretch, take a few risks, and just hit one out of the park. It's easy to see teen pop fans liking a few tunes on this record, but I think the modern rock, &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;-type fan would be surprised at how much they would enjoy this record. Many of these songs seriously rock, and her lyrics often have an Eminem-like immediacy and veracity to them.<BR>The extra DVD is pure gravy, with similarly impressive videos. You should buy this for the album, and consider the DVD as dessert.
B000006045|1.0|The first song, \\"Angel\\", is great, but the rest [is not].  Save your money.
B000002BBY|4.0|A beautifully paced album, with four tunes to be thankful for. The gorgeous &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, the elegiac &quot;Dont Look Back In Anger&quot;, the driving &quot;(What's The Story) Morning Glory&quot; all lead up to &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;. I don't know and I don't care what the heck that song is about, but it is an epic nonetheless. It's a great single, sounding awesome on headphones AND in the car with the top down, if you know what I mean.<BR>These guys could have been one of our great ones, if they wouldn't have let all that internal strife derail them...<BR>This is an easy album to like for the rock/pop music fan with any sense of history.
B00000064F|4.0|This is a great album, and really got me into Nick Drake.  Wake up on a Sunday morning, throw it in the CD player and enjoy.
B000002TYK|4.0|I was surprised on how awesome Dave Grohl was as a songwriter when the Foo Fighters first arrived in 1995. He already proved himself as an amazing drummer in Nirvana, but little did I know he was working on songs both during his time in Nirvana, and after Kurt Cobain's death. It's rare that a person can be so successful in one band, then switch instruments and form another amazing band with almost just as much success, and Grohl certainly did that. <BR><BR>Like his departed friend, Grohl also writes emotional, and melodic hooks, and still rocks hard as well. With a few exceptions, the Foo Fighters' debut is a solid one, and has some of their greatest songs: I'll Stick Around, Alone & Easy Target, Floaty, X-Static, and Exhausted. Though they would outdo themselves with subsequent releases (including the most recent One By One), this debut was the sign of the second coming of Dave Grohl, and the sign of another great band bursting onto the music scene.
B000065K6N|5.0|I loved it! The story of it all just pulls you in! The art it great and the story wounderful! Through out the whole movie their are no real bad guy. The main character is just out the stop the wars befor his time ends, and that the same time going after the girl. One of the most stunning anime movies out there.<BR>Worth your money and time!<BR>I watched my friends then got one for myself!!lol
B00005JKZT|5.0|Having seen The Two Towers three times it has become one of my all time favorite movies.  It is up there with the Star Wars trilogy.  See this film on the big screen while you can.  I've never read the books, but usually the movie version of a book takes many liberties as does this one.  Don't compare it to the book, but see it for the action and adventure.  This movie is destined to be one of the all-time great classic fantasy films.  The visuals are stunning, but don't smother the story as do more recent special effect movies.  I can't wait to see the next Lord of the Rings movie.  Why can't more movies be made like this one?
1583762027|5.0|Eat that Frog is an excellent motivational book. The complaints I see by most here are along the lines that there's nothing new in this book. To me, there's nothing new in MOST self help books. After all, we each know that the way to stop procrastinating is to just do what we dread, the way to lose weight is to burn off more calories than we consume, the way to keep house is to clean and organize on a regular basis, and so on. What we seek is some motivation and some reasoning for doing what we dislike doing.<br />Brian Tracy gives this motivation and reasoning. This is a short, fast read. As the author says, it doesn't go into all the psychology of procrastination; rather, it gets right to the action. Brian Tracy covers such things as determining priorities, delegating and eliminating some tasks, knowing what's okay to procrastinate about, and whether to tackle your &quot;frog&quot; (your big task that will lend the greatest results) first or a lesser priority task.<br />The result is a clear, concise book that is helpful and shows that by regularly eating your frogs first, you develop a habit that makes it easier to accomplish more than the average person and do it with increasingly less effort. An excellent, worthwhile book that you will likely refer to time and time again.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What more can I say - this is absolutely fantastic!  The story is great for kids and the humor and references to old walt-disney type stories will really get a laugh out of adults watching :)<BR>Get this!
B00005JKNF|4.0|Five stars for the cast and director, three for the screenwriter, producer, or whoever decided to cram so much fine plot and talent into so little time.<br />The authors of the really dismal reviews of this movie should stick to light Hollywood R-rated tripe with DiCaprio, Costner, Masden, Griffith, Nolte et al.  <br />This is a different ballpark.<br />Gosford Park is an excellent period portrayal of British stratified society in which the murder is a minor detail. <BR>If you don't like British period material such as Jane Austen, avoid this movie.<br />In partial defense of several of the reviewers, this seriously compressed while intriguing script fails to develop characters in sufficient detail, renders the mini-plots incompletely explored and frustratingly shortened. <BR>It will leave you wishing for the other two hours that should have been used to produce a blockbuster resulting from the superb acting by the excellently chosen cast. <br />You get the impression you have watched a chubby trailer for a great movie that may be presented sometime next year.<BR> <BR>Most of the many major, first line actors and actresses, particularly Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Cristen Scott Thomas, and an almost unrecognizably tragic Helen Mirren, brilliantly portray their characters  as best they could with such brief opportunities to display their skills. <BR>It takes great acting and direction to capture such superb portrayals in 'takes' and snapshot scenes, measured many times in seconds. Altman and his cast have done it.<br />It's a pity there is no novel on which the movie was based so one could read the book and get the rest of the varied and interesting stories and character development.  <br />Perhaps the screenwriter will favor us with a complete expansion of the compressed movie script as a complete novel.<br />The acting, external and internal sets, photography and music are stunning.<BR>Buy it and watch it all the way through again and again, finding more beautifully executed detail each time. This is a winner.<br />I taped it from  STARZ presentation, watched it repeatedly, and then purchased the DVD to own a copy of the visually stunning effects and sound.
B000002UB6|5.0|I love this album. I keep listening to the track Let It Be. Everyday....every single day i hear this album some how. Awesome.
6305428425|5.0|This movie TOTALLY ROCKS! It's funny and quirky, and gives you an important messege: BE WHO YOU ARE. It's totally worth your [money]! This is not all I have to say, but there are not enough words to tell you how great this movie is!
B00004KD1L|2.0|A couple of great tracks in Inside My Mind (spooky, trippy good), and At The River.  Good to have/get - but under produced and overrated.
B00004Z400|4.0|The Deftones follow up to Around The Fur is one of great progression.  I love the deftones but their previous sound was getting a little old and tired.  White Pony was the perfect step for them.  Still keeping the haunting and raw edged sound that makes The Deftones who they are, this time adding some more mellow material.  This album is brilliant and definately their best work to date.  \\"change (in the house of flies)\\" is an unbelievable powerful song, but becomes runner up to the best track on the album \\"Passenger\\" where chino and the lead singer from Tool create a chilling, unforgettable track.  \\"Back To School\\" the extra track, they take a shot at rap/metal.... but luckily it worked!  Overall White Pony is a must for any Deftones fan.
B00006AG5N|5.0|As you listen to these blockbuster hits, remember that the greatest Elvis tunes are found off the beaten path. Yes these are all tremendous hits, but it is only the threshhold to the Kingdom. Get the album ELVIS IS BACK recorded after he got out of the Army and hear songs like &quot;Reconsider Baby&quot;; &quot;Like a Baby,&quot; &quot;How can It be Wrong?&quot;; &quot;Mess of Blues&quot;; &quot;Fever.&quot; If you get the '60s box set, you'll hear some real masterpieces like &quot;Edge of Reality,&quot;; &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot;; &quot;Almost In Love&quot;; Stranger In My Hometown&quot;; &quot;Little Friend&quot;; &quot;Long Black Limousine.&quot; On the 70s Box set you'll hear &quot;Sound of Your Cry&quot;; &quot;Faded Love&quot;; &quot;My Boy&quot;; &quot;Sylvia&quot;; &quot;Life.&quot; There are all sorts of tremendous out takes, like one of Elvis singing &quot;12th Of Never&quot; in a rich Irish tenor, or &quot;Killing Me Softly.&quot; Great bootlegs of Elvis concert moments are out there that are just hysterical and even sad, like where he goes on a scatalogical rant against a reporter that wrote that he was strung out. <br />E L V 1 S is ELVIS FOR DUMMIES; it gets you online, but it is only the beginning of a journey that doesn't end.
0321146530|2.0|I bought this book with high expectations. I'm a true believer in testing early and often. Basically, I think the techniques have merit, but the presentation was lacking.<br />I was disappointed with the writing -- all of the little asides that were attempts at humor fell flat and were distracting. The biggest disappointment was that a chapter on how to integrate these techniques into the processes of a project, especially a large project, was ommitted. <br />At one point, the book states rather flippantly something to the effect that &quot;You'll have to come up with your own argument to convince your boss to let you spend the time writing all these tests.&quot; I think that since he's the one promoting these techniques, he should be able to come up with those arguments. Personally, I think the argument is something like this:<BR>- helps produce clean, modular code by forcing the designer to think about interfaces of the objects first. Coming up with good interfaces is half the battle.<BR>- reduces defects tremendously because automated tests are available from the beginning and are used constantly.<BR>- combines aspects of design and testing into the construction phase. So, the argument is that the &quot;added&quot; time spent writing tests saves time in the design and testing phases.<br />I would have also liked to have seen a section on the dangers of stubbed out code. Since the technique causes you to stub out a lot of methods, as you go through the process and people are fallable, it warrants discussion. Sometimes they forget that some of the code is stubbed. I've seen situations where stubbed out code (ie, return true) provided the correct answer for a surprisingly long time. It wasn't until it got into system testing that some of the less frequently encountered data caused mysterious problems to come up in supposedly working code.
0066214122|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I picked it up and could not put it down. the technological aspect reminds me a lot of the andromeda strain, but in the new millenium
0064471837|5.0|and i havent even read the third one yet! this book kept me reading and i loved it.. i was so excited when i saw the second one...till i started read that one! i hated the new charactar. Sabriel was much better. i kept hoping he would go back to her, but i never found that part in the second book(of course i didnt finish it so) but dont miss out on reading sabriel. its really good.

0780624890|5.0|This is one of the best vamp-action movies of all times, (the only better one is Blade2), lots of blood, hot, sexy lady vamps, with a martial arts twist, the soundtrack is also amazing, love to see a new DTS release
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I had high expectations when I heard that Nick Hornby's wonderful novel \\"High Fidelity\\" was being made into a film.  However, I was very disappointed that the film removed the protagonist out of London and into Chicago.  The London setting was part of the charm of the book, and turned a wonderful novel with a wonderful story into a mediocre film.  So it was with trepidation that I greeted the news of yet another Hornby novel, \\"About a Boy,\\" being adapted for film.  I was pleasantly surprised when the film turned out to be every bit as good as the book.  If you are a Hornby fan who was dissapointed with the Americanization of \\"High Fidelity\\" rest assured that this film retains it's English charm and self deprecating humour.  Highly recommended!
B00005J6SZ|5.0|There I was, a shy, geeky spendthrifty 14-year-old.  Then along came Madonna and Like a Virgin.  Suddenly, I was a total Madonna addict, listening to this album religiously every day, buying every silly teen mag that even mentioned her, and--to the horror of my parents--covering all of my walls with Madonna posters.  No other album has ever had such a influence on me.  I was still shy and geeky, of course, but I was a changed person.  Over the years, my Madonna worship waned but never disappeared.  Going back and listening to this CD now, I am amazed at how great it sounds, and I enjoy the memories it stirs inside of me.<br />No one can deny how huge this album was.  It made Madonna a superstar, and it sunk its anchors into both the album and single bestseller charts.  The title track was of course a huge hit and represents to me a cultural phenomenon.  Material Girl had an even larger impact, and many would argue the song basically defined the decade of the 80s; it certainly helped shape the decade.  Dress You Up was just a fun song with a great beat; as things turned out, it was to a certain extent prophetic because Madonna basically did dress up great multitudes of young admirers copying the Madonna look.  Angel was another big hit, largely because it was so easy to relate to.  Anyone who has ever had a crush on someone knows exactly what Madonna is singing about here.  Over and Over also charted, I believe; it lacks the substance of the other songs on the album, but both the words and the energizing music do encourage you to keep going in the face of setbacks.  Love Don't Live Here Anymore is the true gem on here, though.  I kept expecting it to be released as a single because I really believed it would be a huge hit.  Some parts of the album are a little sugary, but this song proved that Madonna did have substance and a talented voice.  She packed real emotion and power into her lyrics, and I have always found the song to be well nigh heartbreaking.  As for the remaining songs, Shoo-Be-Doo and Pretender are somewhat formulaic and lack pizzazz, but Stay is a song I have always liked quite a bit.  It has an emotional quality that I find compelling; I could do without the &quot;scoop scoop&quot; choruses, but overall I find it a song of significant merit.<br />Not everyone will associate this album with a personal paradigm shift of great personal importance (which is how I view it), but when you get down to brass tacks, the album has more than its fair share of great songs which remain fun and vibrant all these years later.  These songs still energize and inspire me, and Love Don't Live Here Anymore still captivates me.  For those who discovered Madonna in the 90s or more recently, these songs may sound simplistic or perhaps immature, but I believe that the eternal spirit, magic, and unparalleled success of Madonna can be traced back to its very source in Like A Virgin.remaining songs, Shoo-Be-Doo and Pretender are somewhat formulaic and lack pizzazz, but Stay is a song I have always liked quite a bit.

B000005JA8|1.0|I don't really need to justify my response, I don't think.  My reaction is/was a visceral one, and even if I'd never heard music before in my life, I wouldn't like this album.  The experience is kind of like putting your tongue on a 9-volt battery - you don't need any fancy explanation for why it is unpleasant - and nobody could ever persuade you otherwise.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is amazing.  The lyrics are a bit humorous, and there are little inside stories about his relationships with women.  Unlike other albums, you will fall in love with every single song in this one.  I think its degrading to call him \\"another Dave Matthews Band\\", because it really isn't.  I'm not much of a Dave Matthews fan, nor I favor the lyrics... I mean, if you listen to the lyrics carefully, they're kind of perverted.  John Mayer is an amazing artist that uses a string of metaphors, and puts real life monologues into song.  I don't think many artists can pull that off.  Don't you think?
B000008COG|4.0|In the Mid 80's, AC/DC was losing it big time. After a couple of failed albums (Flick of the Switch, Fly On The Wall), AC/DC was going nowhere. Alot of their albums started to sound the same. What they needed was another breakthrough release to get them back into the spotlight. This wasn't exactly it, but it got them back into the top 10 (The first to do so since 'For Those About To Rock'). It was eventually one of the best rock albums released at that time. My favorite songs from this album are &quot;Heatseeker&quot; and &quot;Ruff Stuff.&quot; A good AC/DC Album for your AC/DC collection....
B00005MAM2|1.0|I just rented the DTS version just to see the difference and I would have to say that the DTS version is much much better soundwise. But if you don't really care about surround sound, then pick up this Special Edition has great features and the movie sounds ALRIGHT on the DD version. But for all home theater folks who like this movie, get the DTS version. It is like the single disc DD version except with Japanese DTS 5.1 audio, English Dolby Digital 5.1 audio and the movie. But seriously I recommend the DTS version if you want to truly enjoy the movie!
B000002H97|5.0|While this isn't the Metallica I knew from Kill 'em all and Ride The Lightning. I like the flow of the album and the music keeps you humming and singing. This is the album that launched them into the mainstream. This is also the last good album they had. The music they put out now is as different as between ..and Justice for all & The Black Album.
B00006LPEY|5.0|Everyone reading this review who has a DVD player that came with a Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1, 6.1 whatever Receiver built in that came with speakers, get this version and listen to the DTS Version and compare it to the Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation on the other releases. You will definitely like the DTS Version, I did very much. Now I have to go spend 20 more dollars on a new surround soundtrack so I can enjoy the movie more. I wish Pioneer would have done this in the first place and put both DTS and DD on one disc so we could enjoy the movie this way, oh well. Get this version!
B000066NW0|4.0|Hey, it's catchy and fun to listen to while driving or surfing the web.  There are only a couple throw-away tracks.  If you like good Pop music ear candy, you'll like this CD.
6302150930|2.0|The main problem I had with this dated film was motion.  Overall, it was quite dull, and even plot elements from the book that kept my attention left me tired of the 3 hour film.  I will admit that the movie followed the storyline of the book faithfully, however some key portions were left out.  It could be said that reading Hardy's original novel is a prerequisite for viewing the film, because some of the movie could be quite confusing without knowledge of the book.  One major redeeming quality that I noted was this:  There was one important element that was retained between the book and the film, and that was how out-of-touch Victorian people seem to have been with their emotions.  Many characters, Tess especially, seem quite passive, which, while it IS a period characteristic, works to dull the movie.  In summation, this film is an accurate, but uninspiring rendition of a historically important piece of literature.
0316666343|4.0|This book is worth the read.  I agree with some of the other reviewers about the skeptical ending; there are certainly elements that test your limits and moments that transgress the otherwise graceful poetry and become somewhat saccharine.  If you can overlook the imperfections in order to appreciate the overall beauty of the story, though, you won't be sorry.  It is not a gruesome, depressing tale of murder.  Susie Salmon's death is a fact that is confronted bluntly in the very first paragraph, never dwelled upon as more than a framework and the catalyst for events to follow. Susie's story is not about herself; it is an eloquent and wistful observation and a poignant portrait of the life she leaves behind.  Her own personal growth, albeit in heaven and not in life, is secondary and almost incidental.  Through the unique perspective of a girl clinging desperately to her existence by living vicariously through those who cannot let her go, it is ironically a story of life more so than death.  The Salmon family and those who are drawn to them through tragedy tread through their grief in separate ways, and struggle to relocate and redefine their identities in the shadow of insufferable circumstances.  As it tears them apart and yet binds them together, what emerges is a very human story of maturation and an almost painful scrutiny of the complexities of family relationships.  It's what you would least expect of such an unpleasant premise:  funny, touching, and inspiring as much as it is beautifully heartbreaking. I found it to be very compelling and couldn't put it down.  While I can't claim it's a perfect literary masterpiece, it certainly has a lot to offer if only as a unique reading experience, and it is worth taking a chance.
B00005B5L4|5.0|This was one of the first DVD-Audio titles I purchased after I got my dvd-audio player, and I was not disappointed.  The sound is nothing short of incredible.  I've heard the CD version, but the dvd-audio blows it away.  It also includes the track &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, which was intended for the original album release but was left off due to time constraints.  <br />The bonus material is also a plus and includes commentary from the band members on the making of each track.  <br />Truly a must have for any Fleetwood Mac fan.

B000003S0P|5.0|honestly i think is the best crimson album, its beautifull, hard, hypnotic, virtuoso. its a good album to start your collection. red is a terrific instrumental song, but the best song in my opinion is starless, good vocals, exelent music. bruford shows his magnificent skills in one more red nightmare, but fripp is the true genious. kill the one who doesnt own it
B00001OH7U|5.0|I discovered David Bowie before Station to Station came along but after Ziggy Stardust was released.  I think I discovered Bowie first via PINUPS.  The true hook was Diamond Dogs with the Guy Peelhart strange cover and the whole 1984 thing.  This was the early seventies and I was a teenager.  I lived in the midwestern states and you rarely heard anything of his played on the radio except Space Oddity or the occasional Changes.  After I discovered Bowie, I had a wealth of albums to choose from:  Man Who Sold the World; Hunky Dory; Ziggy (of course); Aladin Sane; as well as the earlier recordings.  By 1974, I owned every album he released.  Then Young Americans came out and I felt abandoned.  There were only a couple of songs on the album I could enjoy at the time (title track; Across the Universe) and even though I was a big John Lennon fan as well, I thought Bowie had just jumped on disco bandwagon -- before it had wheels.  Thankfully, he jumped off just as quick.  I grew to love the album in the years that followed.  What interested me was they way he did not stick with a single sound, he ch-ch-changed with the times.  Like most of Bowie's work, it takes a listen and relisten until you really GET IT.  Then you can really enjoy the intricacies of his music -- when he is on target.  He has missed a few times, but he dusts himself off and goes back at it.  I think that accounts for his longevity.<BR>  When STATION TO STATION was released, I was sold on the first listen.  It was another life soundtrack for me.  I was in the Army and very few of my friends liked the album.  But I listened and relistened.  It was a neat package, mixing solid rock tunes with Bowies new sound.  I saw a Bowie interview where he mentioned that he found his voice with Wild as the Wind.  I think my favorite song was STAY -- what a great guitar lick and solid vocals. I played STATION for some friends recently and I was amazed how they just didn't GET IT.  They would have prefered a Garth BrooksCD, I could tell.<BR>  Bowies work since STATION has had its high and lows, but still I find some of his albums a soundtrack to remind me of milestones in my own life.  Space Oddity + Diamond Dogs = my youth; Scary Monsters = College + Losing John Lennon; Lets Dance = meeting my wife of nearly 20 yrs; Tonight = birth of my son; Never Let Me Down = going to my first Bowie Concert; Outside &amp; Earthling = beginning my CD collection.<BR>  I recently adopted HEATHEN as my favorite Bowie album.  It has a wealth of songs and reflects the maturity and incredible talent of my favorite rock perfomer for 30 years.  And hopefully you have not missed his TV or concert appearances.  His band is an incredible ensemble including Mike Garson who has played piano for Bowie since the early seventies (check out Garson's work on Aladin Sane's title track and Lady of Another Grinning Soul)  Also Bowie's Drummer is tops, along with the rest of this downright stupendous group of musicians.  For old and new Bowie Fans -- Heathen is worth every penny paid.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This was my first Blind Guradians album. What a luck.!<BR>Im trying not to listen it everyday. I simply cant.

0375414053|3.0|Great inside scoop on the life of a high powered working mom.  Liked it so much, couldn't take the paltry ending.  A couple of other problems:<BR>1)  If Kate is so conflicted about having it all, why didn't she figure it out after the first kid, and go on to have a second.<BR>1a)  Its a shame Kate gave up when she did, because in a year or two things would have gotten easier with the children.  At least the vomiting would decrease.<BR>2)  Kate obviously shouldn't have married that architect.  He doesn't support her expensive lifestyle.  Even so, she's so much better off than her sister.  Kate is a spoiled brat.<BR>3)  Why can't Kate think of any other reasons to not stay at home other than \\"would go mad\\".  Kate secretly wants to stay at home, I guess.  Otherwise she would be articulating the debate in her own mind a more equitably.<BR>4)  Kate doesn't know the real secret to having it all:  gypping everybody a bit including the office.<BR>5)  An international travel job doesn't even work for a father.<BR>6)  If she's so high powered why is the nanny running all over her? Even if nannies are so scarce, with all the money she supposedly has, she could pay one well enough to lick her toes.  More money to the nanny, less money on the shoes.<BR>7)  I suspect that the feelings come from the author who should have examined her own feelings a little more closely, and figured that she would be insulting the very women who are her target audience. <BR>8)  I have a pretty good job, one child, a nanny, time for sports (a couple hours a week). My family eats out of boxes, & has homecooked meals made by both parents sometimes.  Both parents do laundry. I worked my way through college, while other kids had more fun time.  I worked my way through graduate school.  I am working my way through motherhood.  In the ideal world I would live at the beach with my family and none of us would work.  We'd windsurf all day.  But in the real world, I have to work.  And, I am fortunate to likemy job, and I am fortunate to have a beautiful baby girl who is on my lap right now and has fallen asleep on my desk as I write this review.  I, unlike Kate Reddy, know how very blessed I am.
B00005RFAI|1.0|can you say that alot of people really have bad taste? cos they really do. the first time and only time i heard this cd i wanted to die! like i give major credit to pink for the great lyrics and like the only good song (get the party started) for which i gave it one star. the rest of this crappy cd is way underproduced or just not good because it shouldn't be on this cd. ok and this too (it bothers me) she was really good at hip-hop/r&b and she said that was really her. then why did she go and change again and say that that was her too? cos she is only a little \\"made\\" artist. ...
0064430227|3.0|Although this is a well known, classic children's book, my girls (3&6) are not not very interested. The drawings are simple and not very colorful. The idea that Harold draws things that become real is cool, but the story is not dynamically expressed.  This book is a bit too sublime for my kids.
B0000797IO|4.0|Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is trapped in a miserable rut as a result of an uninteresting marriage and unsatisfying job.  One day at work Justine comes to a crossroad in her life where she decides to have an immoral affair with a young cynical writer with the pen name Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) from Catcher in the Rye.  During the affair she recognizes the daily melancholy that she is experiencing and she understands that she needs to get away from it, but moral issues prevent her from doing so.  This is a dilemma that she struggles with in order to get out her self-destructive path.  Good Girl is a film for those who do not mind introspective laughs and melancholy on the silver screen.

B000002UA0|5.0|Im a young Pink Floyd listener who has recently become obsessed with there genius music they have spilled out over the years. I just picked up this album not to long ago. I have declared it a landmark for pink floyd. The foundation of there psychadelic creativity that had been sported from there early days as a band.Very creative and a must have for floyd listeners.<br />Highlights-<br />Astronomy Domine-One of the most creative songs i've ever heard in my life. It is so lyrically and musically.It pictures a rotation of planets, and a cold blue water flowing below the ground.<br />Lucifer Sam-A song referring to a &quot;hip cat&quot;. Its just a good tune to sing to, and the music fits the mood perfect.<br />Pow R. Toc H.-A weird instrumental like song. The words you here are strange noises that are made by barret and waters.<br />Bike-of course a instant classic. This is barret at his best, you know weird lyrics/weird noises.
B00006G8LB|5.0|Of course there are going to be similarities inasmuch as both are based on the origins and exploits of beloved comic book heroes. However, there are so many that one could assume that the same individual did them both.<br /><br />Both feature a hero that becomes an obsessed vigilante against crime upon the death of a loved one. Both have a character that is eons removed from his mild-mannered \\"alter ego\\". The two films feature over-the-top performances from the \\"villain\\" (Nicholson as Batman's \\"Joker\\" and Dafoe as \\"The Green Goblin\\"). Both have an elderly \\"sage\\" in the form of \\"Alfred\\" and \\"Uncle Ben\\", respectively. A mammoth citywide celebration with music provided by contemporary stars is one of the commonalities in both (\\"Batman\\" had Prince and \\"Spiderman\\" has Macy Gray). The pair features state-of-the-art special effects and a very similar score penned by Danny Elfman.<br />But the main \\"bond\\" between the movies is in the casting of the least likely of performers in the title roles. Much was said about Michael Keaton's selection as the Dark Knight. But, he pulled it off superbly.<br />Thus, Tobey Maguire, surprisingly buffed and confident, dons the tights nicely and believably as \\"the web spinner\\". His should be a long run as the very popular comic book icon.<br />The movie is entertaining and is reverential to the spirit of the magazine on which it is based. It's no wonder that it ruled the 2002 box office.
6304806442|5.0|Health classes would do better to show this film instead of give lectures. 'Trainspotting' puts the viewer right inside the minds and lives of heroin addicted people, and it's not pretty. When we first meet our main character and narrator Renton (played with sheer brilliance by Ewan McGregor), he gets hit by a car, gets up, and laughs. Next thing we know, he's passed out on the ground in a hellhole known as Mother Superior's, a needle sticking in his arm. He introduces his other friends - most of them also drug users. There's Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), obsessed with James Bond, Spud (Ewen Bremmer), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the violently tempered Begbie (manically portrayed by Robert Carlyle). All of them have their obsessions and for Renton it's heroin. For me, this film has two parts. The first one is darkly funny (this part includes the infamous 'worst toliet in Scotland' scene, viewers with weak stomachs beware). The second (which begins around the time the baby dies) is intense, especially the detox scene. The film never flinches away from showing the viewer what these peoples lives are like. The apartments are rotting away, the people have no jobs, all they have is heroin and each other. There is nonstop language, stong sexual content including nudity, not to mention graphic herion use. The film is not for everyone, in fact I've found it's for very little. I happen to find every manic, funny, intense moment of this film entertaining. Others have found it depressing, weird, or just plain sick. So tread carefully. However, it's an important film and one that deserves to be seen. The performances are fantastic, the music great, and the direction innovative. That's what I have to say about it. Choose life.

B00006879E|5.0|its rare today to find musicians with true vocal talent, who know their instruments, and write the perfect words to accompany their perfect notes.  but maroon5 does so, flawlessly and seemingly effortlessly.  <BR>formerly kara's flowers, a more pop-punk sounding band, maroon5 has become a band that revels in sensual music.  the more funk inspired maroon5 creates all around sexy music that doesnt come off tawdry or dirty.  its the type of music that you wouldnt be embarassed if it came on your cd player in your car and your mom was sitting in the passenger seat.  trust me, this is amazing stuff.
0790749556|3.0|This Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedy starts out with great promise, as Astaire plays opposite the charmingly rugged and intensely charismatic Randolph Scott, who took a welcome break from his usual tough-guy roles in western oaters.  Unfortunately, it turns out that this movie was really a vehicle for Irene Dunne, who is fine as a comedic supporting character, but stops the film dead in its tracks when the directors make her the center of attention.  She particularly sucks the life out of the film when she sings not one, not two, not three, but a full &lt;i>four&lt;/i> songs (the last with a reprise!) in her horrid, overly mannered operatic soprano... It's a prissy style which does not wear well over the years, and her songbird vocals -- along with a prolonged fashion show sequence, featuring a parade of unusually garish gowns -- bring this film to a grinding, painful halt. Rogers and Astaire are of course quite beautiful together, but they only have a little time onscreen, with Astaire's \\"I Won't Dance\\" the highlight of the show.  Scott is absolutely magnetic as Astaire's good-natured, no-nonsense he-man pal (and actually upstages Fred in some of the early scenes!), but his role dwindles to insignificance in the second half of the film, when Dunne is elevated to center stage.  Fabulous start, but it soon fizzles out.
B00006WUWN|5.0|You either hate it or love it, Mike Myers fans will laugh from start to finish of this movie.  I was personally disappointed with the second installment of the Austin Powers Saga, however this video made up for it and then some.  Definetly not a family movie however, more for the older crowd of viewers.  <br />I recommend this movie whole-heartedly.
B00006ADG8|5.0|Let's get this out of the way....yes, it should have been released on DVD.  Regardless, it's a masterpiece - one that does not get the recognition it deserves.  Shown on TV infrequently and never (as far as I know) screened at revival houses, this film works on all levels.  Acting, directing, plot, dialogue, suspense, drama and even comedy.  The ending is absolutely incredible.  You'll be thinking about it for days. <br />For those who have read the book (I have not), apparently Peter Ustinov does not play Capt. Veere as Melville might have intended.  Still, compare his sytle, his delivery, etc to other performances of the era...it stands apart.  It is, without question, a great acting job - and certainly does not bring down the film.
B00003CXAD|5.0|What a Great movie, one of the best. Authentic to the core! I was brought up knowing all about the depression and the okies. My parents as well as grandparents, aunts, uncles, to name a few. All came from Oklahoma to California during the depression. They lived this movie, in every sense of the word. My Mama loved watching this, even though she cried throughout it. The okies were tough, strong and proud folks. As Jane Darwell so aptly put it \\" were the people and the people keepa agoin\\" A true American classic!
B00007E8V4|4.0|This is a great cd.  Its stuff that SOAD thought just didt flow well into Toxicity, and they released it because they wanted there fans to hear all the stuff mixed so it didnt sound liek ...  Its good stuff, check it ot.
B00006SFLV|4.0|I never write reviews...ever...<BR>But after watching this show tonight, after 7, 8 years, I had to comment...<BR>The show is the most amazing thing I have ever seen on tv.  I was struck when I watched the show tonight simply because it is so realistic.  The reason there are legions of fans worldwide is because the show is sooooooooo real.  In high school, I felt like I WAS Angela Chase, only I never got the guy I wanted, even for a second.  Angela never said the exact right thing, and neither did I.  Angela always said just too much.  And her anxiety over sex was real.  When Jordan Catalano finally took Angela's hand in his, walking through the hallway, my heart lept.  I relived the same emotions from my high school experience in watching My So-Called Life tonight.  The writing was that good.  Maybe it's good that they took the show off the air.  The writing was so great that it could have only gone downhill if the show continued...Maybe I'm just trying to rationalize why I only have 19 hours of the Chase family...<BR>The DVD is a disappointment with special features.  There aren't any.  Oh well, the show is good enough to buy without any special features, and a complete disgrace in the menu design...That's why there are only 4 stars, because the show is terrific!!!
B00005JJX8|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock brings the beautiful and talented Grace Kelly back for a third time in a starring role in his great movie run of the 1950's. (\\"Dial M for Murder\\" and \\"Rear Window\\" were her first 2)  Hitch also persuades Cary Grant out of semi-retirement to co-star with Kelly. (Later Grant stars in another Hitchcock thriller - \\"North by North West\\" (voted into the American Film Institutes top 100 American Films of the last 100 years -1998)). <br />This proved to be a very wise choice because their(Grant's as \\"The Cat\\" burgular & Kelly's as a rich socialite)chemistry are electrifying.  Having Jessie Royce Landis as Kelly's heiress mother was also a perfect choice.  John Williams, the moustachio Englishman Insurance agent closes out this outstanding cast.<br />Summary: Wealthy retired cat burgular (Grant) is accused of again stealing precious jewels from all the rich French Riveria millionairess'.  The police and jewelery Insurance agent (Williams) pursue and try to catch \\"The Cat\\" in the act.  Grant befriends Williams, the rich Kelly and her heiress mother Royce.  Together we try to unravel who is the real \\"Cat\\".  Along this winding road of mystery Grant and Kelly light up the silver screen with a steamy (for the 50's) romance.<br />This Paramount WideScreen Collection DVD has been meticulously remastered both in picture(Enhanced for 16x9 HDTV's) & sound (Dolby Digital).  What a delightful TECHNOCOLOR movie.  Grace Kelly's beauty and her colorful gowns are vibrant & elegeant.<br />Lots of Extra Features; 3 Featurettes - Writing & Casting, To Catch A Thief, The Making of To Catch A Thief & Alfred Hitchcock and To Catch A Thief.  An Edith Head - The Paramount Years Featurette (see really knows how to compliment the stars!). A theatrical trailer and finally Photos & Poster Gallery.<br />This is a very enjoyable mystery and the ending presents a nice surprise.  This was one of Hitchcocks favorite movies & sadly his last with the beautiful Grace Kelly. (Hitchcock had a great 4th movie for her (MARNIE) which see wanted to do but because of her future family obligation reluctantly refused Hitch. (she was to marry Prince Ranier of Monaco - ironically where \\"TO CATCH A THIEF was filmed and more sadly died in an automobile accident on the mountain road in the same film many years later as Princess Grace).   Her death then was as sad as Princess Diana's was recently.  <br />Grace Kelly and Cary Grant are gone now but they are immortalized through their great films forever.  \\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\" is a great addition to your Hitchcock & DVD library.  Enjoy.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I loved the movie because you couldn't predict how it was going to end.  I especially loved his love interest.  No she did not look like one of the \\"Bond Girls\\".  She looked like a girl an average guy in the real world would fall in love with.  A great ending to a suspenseful movie.
B000002J1S|5.0|Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is an incredible achievement of artistic ambition and serious musicianship led on the heals of five very talented head strong men all thinking that they knew what direction the band should go in.  The end result is something so confusing to follow yet strangely exciting that people will be listening to it for many years to come wondering about it's mystery just as one wonders about the Mona Lisa's smile.  Of course the musicians involved have no answers themselves.  The new blend of musical ideas such as Eno-esque soundscapes (Brian Eno actually worked on this album), incredibly inventive drumming by Phil Collins; Peter Gabriel pushing his voice to new arenas of sound (he never sounded better before or since) making each character and emotion have it's own voice; Tony Banks creating amazing keyboard passages that rank with anything that Keith Emerson had ever done; Steve Hackett, always under used but always finding just the right phrase to add to put a song to the top; and Mike Rutherford played great bass throughout the album (check out: In the Cage).  The theme of Lamb Lies Down on Broadway itself seems to be too much of an enigma but the bottom line is that it is about the inner turmoil of a young NY punk trying to get it together.  There are liner notes in the CD further explaining the story, but you need a magnifying glass to read them and even if you do have good eye sight you still may not see what the hell is going on.  But since when in art are you supposed to figure it all out at once.  The music is more the focal point anyway- the songs work well individually and as well as collectively baring (at times)the theme.  For me the first disc has always captured my attention a bit more than the second.  We start out with a manic piano diddle that swirls around until it comes down at hits you \\"and the lamb... lies down... on broa-wo-adway..\\" Guitar riffs tripping down Rael's voice is heard- he's a kid that hears all the sounds sees all the sights and is working towards sensory overload.  The song works almost like a Bob Dylan type observational song.  You get that through this he becomes alienated from his surrounding.  As the songs continue the alienation and confusion take more of a hold and they are expressed with such eloquence both in the clarity of the phrasing and the utter babble of the lyrics.  The irony is that as degenerately abstract as the first disc gets the second disc is complete madness.  The music is all over the place (the chamber was most definitely in confusion), yet there is a sense of cohesion here as well as passage.  The songs lend to each other a complementary feeling making the music feel like a '67 Coltrane solo without sounding like one.  Which all leads to what Coltrane was trying to talk about, \\"what is \\"it\\"?\\".  In summation Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is better than anything that has been done in the last 30 years (of course that's my opinion), the album is all about alienation and they didn't have to say the word once (take note radiohead).  The music is still extremely vibrant and vivid sounding like it was created today- and explains the turmoil of dealing with modern times very well.  Genesis never made an album like this before or after.  Peter Gabriel left the band after this and made some terrific solo albums but never captured what made Lamb Lies Down on Broadway so alluring and ambitious.  Genesis moved on to make some very beautiful albums (that made it sound like L.L.D.o.B. never happened) basically Trick of the Tail sounds like a follow up to Selling England by the Pound.

6305311463|1.0|My Goodfellas dvd has to be flipped over after an hour.  The Virgin Spring is still only available on vhs. Armageddon gets a Criterion release.  Makes sense.
B00003CXI1|1.0|The movie's questionable adaptation of the book aside this dvd is appalling. The menus are slow, cumbersome with too many [weak] graphics and pointless extras. The really annoying aspect of this DVD is the deleted scenes which are either too important to the plot line to have been left out or not worth watching at all- to open them you have to unlock them in no less than 18 Steps! I am very serious about this their are FAQ's on how to see them! It takes about half an hour and you would never figure it out without online help because it comes with no instructions. There is no charm, no nostalgia for the film experienced, it is purely infuriating. Just buy the VHS if you really want to see them.
B00005U2JL|5.0|I got the DvD as a gift because i have recently become one of his biggest fans. i watched the live performances and thought, wow, he's really tallented. I enjoyed all the songs and loved the way he was so creative. Then i watched the 'Death Parade' It will give any fan an idea what it's like being around America's most famous Shock-rocker. He's really a neat person and any fan would enjoy seeing him on and off the stage.

0688170528|5.0|This book is impossible to put down. It is well written and never drags. I just cannot stop raving about it and will definetly buy other books by this author. The cover of my book stated that this is now a Lifetime movie and I think it would be great in the theater. I am dying to see it!!
B00005JLS0|5.0|This is a great movie. I strongly suggest that you take the 2 hours to go and see this movie. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant work really well together to make this movie hillarious.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I bought this cd thinking it would be an easy listener, with a lot of good songs. I ended up selling it the next day for ten less than i bought it for. Only two songs are even worth the two and a half minutes of my amazingly lazy and boring life (Someday, Last Nite). The Strokes couldn't carry a tune with a truck. Do not buy this cd!
B00006BIO0|5.0|I have both the Revenant box set _Screaming and Hollerin the Blues: The Worlds of Charley Patton_ (an incredible package worthy of all the praise it has been given) and these JSP discs and I can tell you that the remasters seem to be the same.  The three big differences between this set and the first five discs of the Revenant box set are 1) the very different prices  2) the JSP third disc does not require the listener to go backward ('rewind' if you will) behind track one to listen to two alternate pressings, and 3) the JSP fifth disc lacks the two tracks where H.C. Speir reads headlines of the day.  In addition, with this set you don't get the sixth disc (&quot;Charley's Orbit--Songs&quot;) or the historically interesting seventh disc (&quot;Charley's Orbit--Interviews).  Nor do you get the excellent liner notes and lyric transcriptions or the reprint of John Fahey's book on Patton.  Moreover, you won't get those nifty 78 label stickers either but I doubt many people who have bought the Revenant box are using those anyway though they are a wonderful eccentric touch.  The Revenant box set with its loving extras (the CDs are housed on little cardbord holders that are the size of 78s in Paramount record sleeves!) certainly gives the listener a feel for the period, but might hurt in the pocketbook.  The JSP box gives all the music of the first five discs of the Revenant set with some sparse but good liner notes of its own.  What is most interesting is how there seems to be a conscious effort to rewrite the canon of the country blues and put Charley Patton in that canon's center (read the back of the first CD tray card to see what I mean).  This goal of rewriting the canon seemed to be precisely the same goal that the Revenant box set had.  Hence, these two sets seem to be 'sister sets', if you will, one giving a feel for the period, the other offering the music at a reduced price.  One other thing I must say, the JSP set is much more functional though less lavish.  The CDs are easier to get at and to put back.  For this reason especially, I'm glad I have both sets.  The set I have reviewed is the less lavish, cheaper one, but by no means a low quality set.  Highly recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Im just facinated with WWII.  I have seen almost all the movies made including the early black and white films such as &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and up to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; I never thought anything as good as &quot;Private Ryan&quot; would ever be created untill Spielberg got back to his wounderful doing, and created this. Band of Brothers is the best film, mini series, whatever you want to call it, to ever be created. Its a whole look at the major campaigns in the European war. You feel the soldiers, and the war, and it makes you ahh yet truely proud.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I purchased this CD expecting the usual one or two hit wonder, (All the things she said is a very good and strong song!) but was happily surprised to find that the majority of the album is great, I do not know if it is the trance/pop arrangements on the dance songs such as Not gonna get us, Malchik gay or the armonious combination of the girls voices on the slow ones: 30 minutes and how soon is know( a little bet reminising of early Ace of Base), that makes it so good for me. No doubt the producer did a good job on the arrangements of all the songs, but neverthless without the singers voices a good CD of this kind would not be achieved. Let just hope this is not the last of T.A.T.U and we keep hearing from them in the future, maybe without so much of the Lesbian Sales/Marketing Pitch and just for their music wich is very good.
0767802659|5.0|Starship Troopers is nothing short of a Science Fiction classic!  I have not read Heinlein's book yet, this review is  based solely on the movie.  In its campy format you will find humor and entertainment in what can only be described as a dismal futuristic setting!  Dazzling performances by Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and the alluringly gorgeous Dina Meyer!  Starship Troopers is a big movie that I have watched and enjoyed over and over again.  The director and producers did an outstanding job in making this film and its \\"bugs\\" exceptionally realistic.  Keep in mind that due to its brutal realism, this film is not for the faint of heart or the extremely young viewers.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILER<br />Picture a futuristic setting where the \\"problems\\" of democracy have been erased and one world government has been established, in effect, removing all of the borders and citizenship is earned through federal service.  We're introduced to the main characters that are in their last days of high school and preparing to enter federal service to earn their citizenship.  Among those main characters we have Johnny Rico, Carmen Ibanez and Dizzy Flores.  In short, Johnny loves Carmen, Carmen loves herself and her future and Dizzy loves Johnny, whew!  We're taken from there to Johnny and Dizzy being in boot camp for the Mobile Infantry and Carmen in flight training.<br />Klendathu, the home world of the bugs has been making attempts to destroy Earth by flogging asteroids at it.  Unfortunately, one makes it through the defenses and destroys the love triangles home town!  Earth immediately mobilizes its forces for an attack on the Klendathu home planet, where they are subsequently massacred by a much larger force of \\"bugs\\" than they collectively expected.<br />What follows from here can be described in no other terms than outstanding science fiction, action and drama rolled into one of the best Science Fiction flicks to ever grace the Silver Screen.  If you're even a minor Sci-Fi fan this DVD is a must for your collection!<br />On side B, we're treated to some wonderful test screenings between Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards, deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, a documentary and some very enthusiastic behind the scenes footage.  {ssintrepid}
B00005J9U1|3.0|I'm 15 years old and I've been listening to Bob Marley since I was 5. I have posters of him in my room, I listen to him most of the time. I believe I can be one of his biggest fans. The songs on this album are good but they are very played out since most of them were in LEGEND(that CD [isn't very good]!) Bob Marley has much better songs than the songs this CD gives you like for example: Burnin'& Lootin', Bad Card, Rat Race, Soul Rebel, Rebel Music, Concrete Jungle, Sun is shining, Survival, Ambushed in the night... etc. The best album I believe would be Survival if you care about politics and whats going around the world, the injustice against colored and poor people. If you barely started listening to Bob Marley this is a good CD. Until you know what Bob marley is all about then you can listen to Survival, Uprising, Catch a fire and all his other albums. I'm telling you this and I dont even smoke the herb.
B00005JLRR|5.0|Three years of anticipation and expectations have finally given way to Star Trek Nemesis.  For months now, we've had some truly wonderful trailers setting us up for this story, which by all accounts, the trailers looked extremely exciting.  Along with some great trailers, fans have been reading and hearing about some of the more interesting aspects of the plot.  Along with these and other factors, the producers have been raving about the fact that the author of \\"Gladiator,\\" a huge Star Trek Fan, is writing Nemesis and the usual excitement about the even numbered movies.  Put all of these ingredients in the pot and you have Star Trek Nemesis.  Included is a wonderful guest star appearance by the ever beautiful Dina Meyer of \\"Starship Troopers\\" fame.  This movie has some very wonderful moments in it, to include the long awaited marital union between Will Riker and Deanna Troi; some very humorous gibes between the crew and some stunning visual effects during the \\"titanic\\" battles between the Enterprise and the huge Reman and Romulan ships.  Credit to the designers of the new Romulan Warbirds, the Scimitar and the upgrades made to the Enterprise-E.  After seeing Nemesis a second time, I would have to say that, like Star Trek V, it takes a couple of viewings to fully appreciate this movie in its subtle and intricate details.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS<br />  Shinzon of Remus is a clone created somehow by Captain Jean Luc Picard's DNA.  Apparently sometime during Captain Picard's time on the USS Stargazer a Romulan agent pilfered his DNA in some form.  This, in and of itself, would make a great story in Michael Jan Friedman's Stargazer series!  <br />Remus is the second planet in the Romulan Star Empire.  Apparently, due to its lack of rotation as it revolves around the Romulan Star, one side of Remus is continuously bathed in sunlight and high radiation.  Its inhabitants only live on the dark side.  They have also become subservient to Romulus.  Shinzon, a human clone, originally part of a Romulan plan to replace Captain Picard has been abandoned by the Romulans and left to the mines on Remus.  He is taken in by the Remans and as he grew up, he inspires a revolution by the Remans.  This revolution has culminated in his taking over the Romulan senate.  Now in charge of the Senate, he desperately needs something from Captain Picard, so he invites Picard and the Enterprise, under the flag of peace, to Romulus.  Once Captain Picard gets over the initial shock of meeting his clone, he must decide whether Shinzon is being truthful or preparing to do war!  {ssintrepid}

B00005ASOC|5.0|In \\"Finding Forrester\\" you can find no better story!  Finding Forrester is just a wonderful, melodramatic tale that is told from the heart and is quite uplifting.  Sean Connery gives a stunning performance as an agoraphobic man devastated by personal loss.   Newcomer Rob Brown's performance as an extremely intelligent, but held back by his surroundings youth is nothing less than outstanding and Anna Paquin whose performance is right on with her usual high standards.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILER<br />The main character played by Rob Brown is an extraordinarily intelligent sixteen year old living in the South Bronx.  As a dare, he is challenged to sneak into \\"the man in the window's\\" home and bring something out.  Connery scares him out of his home, causing him to leave behind his book bag with all of his stories in it.  After critiquing all of his work, Connery drops his book bag down on the street for him to recover.  What follows from this point is the development of an unlikely relationship between two people from entirely different worlds.  As Connery's character mentors Brown's character in his writing and during the young mans transition from an inner city school to a private school and Brown's character helps to bring Forrester out of his agoraphobic shell.  {ssintrepid}
0792846303|4.0|THE FOG is a suspense/horror film about what happens in the coastal town of Antonio Bay on the eve of its 100th anniversary. Legend tells about a mysterious, glowing fog that has taken lives and swallowed ships over the years, but no one believes those tales until the eve of Antonio Bay's centennial. Car alarms, bells, whistles, and sirens go off for no apparent reason. A ship disappears. Windows break and strange knocks are heard at people's doors. When the missing ship is found, looking like it had been lost for centuries at sea and one of the dead crew members on board comes to life on an examination table, people know something strange is about to happen. As it turns out, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) knows why the funning going-ons are happening. Antonio Bay was founded by six men who murdered a ship full of lepers after having taken their money. The lepers are back and want revenge and the Fog is how they will do it.<br /><br />The film has a great cast, including Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis; a decent script; and some simple, yet effective effects. John Carpenter (as he did with HALLOWEEN) relied upon suspense more than graphic horror to send thrills done spines. A very good suspenseful horror flick that's especially delightful to watch on an evening alone in the fog.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth has quickly become one of my favorite bands. They are one of the very few who can mix many styles of music and make it sound good, which is why I was a little discouraged from the rumors I heard about this release and Damnation (which is supposed to come out in march). They said that they would make a heavy album and a light album. The reason this disappointed me was because Opeth was never the band to split things up. They earned their reputation by combining the two. But, when I finally heard this, I was very relieved. Sure this is heavier than their other albums, but there are still many mellow passages and clean vocals. Trust me, no one is going to hear this and think it's not Opeth. This is still in classic Opeth style, there is just more emphesis on the heaviness this time around, which I actually like. They seem to do something new on each album, which is one of my favorite things about this band. They don't sit there and record the same album over and over. You can always expect something new from these guys. Anyway, I won't go on forever comparing it to their old stuff, i'll just talk about this album alone (so those of you who are new to the band know what ot expect). Opeth once again have created a masterpiece of an album by taking mellow acoustic passages and combining them with death metal. The band still has the best growl/clean vocal combination I've ever heard. Mikes growls are inhuman, some of the most demonic I've ever heard, and he has one of the best clean voices out there, and both types fit the music perfectly. Most of the clean voals are used during acoustic parts, but there are also some parts where there is clean singing over electric guitar. What I also like is that even at their most brutal, Opeth still remains pretty melodic. They write riffs that usually contain a perfect balance of brutality, melody, and catchiness, making every song memorable. Plus, for those of you who are musicians looking for instrumental talent, you'll find plenty of that in here too. The guitar work is amazing, especially how they take complex riffs and layer them. There are also plenty of cool guitar solos here. They play some fast typical metal solos, but normally at softer parts play slower jazzy solos. The drummer also shines on this album, displaying one of his best performances so far, and the bass is also good, as always. All the songs except the instrumental are over ten minutes long, but they somehow manage to keep your interest throughout the whole song. I can also easily say that every song on the album is great. Wreath is a great opener, definetly one of the heaviest on the album. It is basically all growling, but there is a very small amount of clean vocals at the end. The title track is basically in classic Opeth style, alternating between growls and cleans, and electrics and acoustics. A fair judgement was something I wasn't expecting since this is supposed to be their heaviest album. It is an all clean vocal ballad-like song. I really like the jazzy guitar solos on this song. For absent friends is a peaceful little instrumental that gives you a break before returning to the heaviness with Master's apprentices, wich is about as heavy as wreath but with more clean vocals. By the pain I see in others is a very experimental song. It's not bad, it's just kind of a weird song. It's cool how they put the death vocals over the acoustic guitars. The only thing I don't really like is how at the end of most songs they just repeat the same riff over and over for a few minutes straight until the song fades out. To sum it all up, Opeth is one of the best bands around, and I think anyone who likes metal needs to give them a listen. They are one of those bands you just need to listen to yourself. Trying to explain them probably made them sound bad because there is so much going on, but trust me, they are one of the best and most unique bands out there. I highly recommend this album, and all of Opeth's other albums to anyone who likes talented, creative metal. Can't wait for damnation!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Peter Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS begins almost precisely where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING left off. Jackson's overall goal of having the three films seamless fit together and someday be shown as a marathon at a cinema is bound to happen as the transition from FELLOWSHIP to TWO TOWERS is flawless.<br />In many ways, THE TWO TOWERS is a better film than FELLOWSHIP. The action is bigger, the cast is larger, the battles are more magnificient. The central cast of the film is split over three different parts of Middle Earth  and the magnitude of the undertaking filming of Tolkien's beloved masterpiece can truly be recognized in this film.<br />However, many will be upset over the many changes that have been made in the story. It must be granted that there are many more changes in TWO TOWERS than there were in FELLOWSHIP. Nevertheless, many of the changes bring the text more to life, while others speed up the plot and make the film more interesting (a movie and a novel are not the same thing!) which is something of a necessity in a three-hour film.<br />I won't say much about the plot of the film other than to comment that the movie ends on even more of a cliff hanger than FELLOWSHIP. Whereas, the FELLOWSHIP movie ended at the beginning of THE TWO TOWERS book, THE TWO TOWERS movie ends far short of where the book ends.<br />Great, rousing cinema with something for everyone. A wonderful way to spend an afternoon or evening.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Let me begin by telling you that this is a bad movie.  So this review is not about the movie itself but about what I liked about the DVD.  The sound is just great, especially in the explosion and car chasing scenes.  Also, Halle Berry is beautiful and this movie shows her like never before.  So, if you like action movies, can enjoy good audio and think that Halle Berry is a gorgeous lady you should see this movie.
B00005B36H|5.0|this music is really wierd and I warn you that if you can't listen to more than 4 minutes when its the same song than stay away. It's really not that bad but I just can't listen to songs that are like 10 minutes long. thers just to much other good stuff to listen to to waste all your time on one song that lasts the length of about 3 songs. I gave this a  5 star rating because I don't want to drop the average. any way the songs are o.k. they have some wierd [stuff] going on in them, I'm no stranger to wierd sounds(I'm a big system of a down fan)I'm totally ok with them but these songs are just to damn long. If you like wierd sounds but don't like longass songs than get some system of a down cds.
031286504X|5.0|Actually I just read I am Legend, and couple of the stories afterwards.  But this book is well worth it for I am Legend alone.  Fantastic--- I couldn't put it down.  That hasn't happened to me in quite a while.  Recommend strongly.
015601386X|5.0|Although I  am only in my second semester of German, this book has been fairly easy to read.  For English speakers learning German, this book will give you a better understanding of imperative sentences ---the little prince commands the pilot to do things.   z.B:  Draw me a sheep!  <br />I have read the book several times in English, which of course, helps me to understand the story in German.  <br />It is a wonderful story.  I have searched the Internet, and the Amazon price on this book is very fair.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I already own this, because it is out in the uk to buy already<BR>This is a great film with a great cast , the best bit about this film is the dead duck scene,because i saw this film at the cinema<BR>and i came out satified that i wanted to buy this film, Hugh Grant is brilliant as Will Freeman, and nicholas hoult is good as marcus as he is picked on as school as he is a hippy and a mummys boy and makes the film so funny, the soundtrack is brillant which makes this a great film.
B000002OZY|1.0|Pinball Wizard is not the same mix as on the original vinyl or any other of the original CD's100 compiliations that have this song.  One of the guitar chords was mixed out of the section after the bridge.   Shame on the Who/MCA.  Good sound otherwise but messing with Pinball Wizard is unforgivable.

0380730367|3.0|Prayers for Rain is the last in the Kenzie, Gennarro detective series, and it starts to show that Lehane made a good choice in changing characters for his most recent novel, Mystic River (a great book).<br />This is the 5th in the series, and some of the dialogue between Patrick, Angie and Bubba gets old and I just skip over it because it really adds nothing to the story.  Like in Darkness Take My Hand (the best in the series) Lehane does a great job of plotting and shifts the focus of the plot halfway through the book from why a woman killed herself, to who perhaps made her kill herself.<br />Lehane is a good author and I recommend everyone of his books.
B00005AQE8|5.0|me gusta toda la musica rap
B00005JLS0|3.0|This isn't the worst movie I've seen in a while, but then again, there's not really anything spectacular about it either.<br />Sandra Bullock portrays a young attorney out to save the world from corporate giants.  In the midst of one of her protests, she runs into Hugh Grant, second in command to one of the great developers who is paving over Coney Island.  In her efforts to save her beloved community center, Bullock joins Grant as Chief Counsel.  <br />After enduring his never-ending demands, Bullock finally throws in the towel, but not before an interesting rivalry begins to develop with her successor.  Grant renigs on his promise to save the community center and all appears doomed.<br />In the end, good prevails, and Bullock and Grant re-unite.<br />One of the better scenes in the movie is a party scene where the viewer is treated to the music of Norah Jones.<br />Not the best, but certainly not the worst they've ever done.
B00004SQQX|5.0|Ive just recently obtained this album and its a must have album for anybody that wants authentic rap. U.S rap is often guilty of dropping lame beats but Shurik'n's beats accompanied with a touch of martial arts is the bomb. Fortunately i understand french after living there, however non-french speakers dont worry because the beats on this album will surely make you play the tracks over and over. Especially 'Lettre', 'Reves',and 'ou je vis'.
B0000683DH|2.0|I just bought the Director's Edition DVD and watched this film for the first time in quite a few years--and I'm startled by how much I disliked it.  It's never been one of my favorites, way too blood-soaked for my tastes, but it was far more flawed than I remembered.  The script is melodramatic and often laughably corny.  Khan is a scenery-chewing madman with none of the nobility and nuance of the original \\"Space Seed\\" character.  The pacing is sluggish, with long gaps between lines of dialogue and spaceships crawling along at a snail's pace (and this is the opinion of a viewer who likes ST:TMP).<br />And continuity and logic errors abound.  Why have so many senior officers in a cadet simulation?  Why use live explosives in a simulator?  Why can't the Reliant crew tell the Ceti Alpha system is missing a planet?  Why didn't Starfleet declare the system off-limits because Khan was there?  How did Khan recognize Chekov, who wasn't in \\"Space Seed?\\"  How did the multi-ethnic supermen of \\"Space Seed\\" turn into a bunch of blond Aryans, and if they've been there 15 years how come they all look under 25?  How can the refugees' paraphernalia include a Starfleet belt buckle and sickbay console of movie-era design?  When Spock told Saavik to pilot the ship out of spacedock, why did she take the command chair instead of the helm?  How could Carol's transmission to Kirk be \\"jammed at the source\\" when the Reliant was three days away?  When the Reliant raised its shields, why did Kirk wait so darn long before raising his?  When Spock used the prefix code to drop Reliant's shields, why did Kirk wait even longer before firing?  Why did Scotty bring his wounded nephew to the bridge instead of sickbay?  (And did we really need to have Peter's horribly corny lines restored for this edition?)  Why did the Ceti eel leave Chekov instead of killing him?  Why didn't a man of Khan's intellect see through Spock's obvious \\"hours will seem like days\\" code?  Doesn't Starfleet have any better codes than that?  Why do the communicators look bulkier and cruder than they did decades earlier in \\"The Cage?\\"  How can Saavik talk while she's rematerializing?  Why didn't Kirk notice that Spock had left the bridge?  How could Genesis work on a nebula when it was programmed to work on a planet?  (Never mind how ludicrous the concept is to begin with.)  When exactly did David find out Kirk was his father?  And how can Kirk say he's \\"never faced death\\" after Tarsus IV, the Farragut, Gary Mitchell, Edith Keeler and Miramanee?  Honestly, I don't understand why this is considered the best Trek movie ever.  Only THE FINAL FRONTIER was lamer than this.<br />The DVD features I've watched so far are decent, but I don't like the editing on the novelist segment--they should let the material stand on its own without all the clips and intercuts.  The animated menus annoy me, but all DVDs have those.  Come on, stop wasting my time and just show me my options already!  The Commentaries menu should have an option for No Commentary--I started out with the text commentary and found it too distracting, but I couldn't stop it short of turning my DVD player off and on again.  Come to think of it, I should've left it on--I might've found it more entertaining than the film.
0767830555|5.0|I cant help but compair this film to COMBAT SHOCK. they both have the same vibe and same look to it. i love the Travis Bickle character. he wants to do good, he hates all the scum in new your and wants to clean it up. all though he isnt the model citizan either.  there is some really good gore in this film when travis goes nuts, but its still not as graphic as COMBAT SHOCK. if you like this movie (like i do) you will love COMBAT SHOCK (which you can order from [...] ). all in all this is one great film.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Tatu is a controversial band thats slowly finding its way to the United States. Their first english CD is amazing. Although, i feel that their songs are more meant to be in Russian. Either way, both the Russian and the English sound great. It blows my mind how i'm enjoying the Russian tunes but surprisingly I am. Great Music can not be denied
B000002KFJ|5.0|Yes, this is definitely Sabbath's best album. The lyrics really speak to you like none before. Ozzy really put his heart and soul into this album, and in his lyrics you get to experience what he really felt during those crazy years of the 70's, when he was tripping every day. This album could provide a whole Ph.D. thesis for a psychology student. It's neurosis at its best.
0440237688|5.0|You start the book watching an eleven year old boy, Jonas, who is excited about a coming of age celebration and getting to know his family.  After the celebration a stunned and nervous Jonas starts his training for the future and begins to learn that life isn't quite as perfect in his town as people would have you believe.  Lois Lowry paints the picture of this world, and its characters, so vividly that you lose yourself and find it almost impossible to put the book down!
B0000640VO|5.0|There are not enough good things to say about this movie. &quot;Amelie&quot; is a fairy tale that never gets boring and always succeeds in making me smile. I bought the DVD on a complete whim without knowing anything about the story, and I am so glad that I did. It's a movie set in reality, in Paris, but it is made to look magical with a rich and oftentimes surreal undercurrent. The cinematography is unlike anything I've seen for a romantic movie; the rich reds, greens and occasional blues paint such a vivid and vibrant picture that fits the whole atmosphere perfectly. More than just the elements of the movie though, there are the two main characters of Amelie and Nino, whose connection is quite tangible even though they rarely share the screen at all. This is a movie that makes me happy, that makes me think that good does exist and that anything is possible. I could watch &quot;Amelie&quot; over and over again; it's one of the few movies that never gets old and leaves me feeling good.
0553801511|5.0|What to say of FitzChivalry Farseer?  An epic character, who's, thanks to Robin Hobb, life unfolds before us.  So many different things happen within \\"Golden Fool\\" that it feels like real life.  You know you had something for dinner a couple nights before but you just can't remember what.<br />This is fantasy at its best.  It doesn't get bogged down with side plots but revels in them, the characters don't develop but live as we do, and most of all you really care what happens to any single person, whether it be Queen or cook.  One of the most amazing parts is Hobb's ability to make you recall a character, even if they seem so small in the plot you still know them as a close cousin.  They may pop up for but a page but you remember and enjoy every part of their character and the life they share with our hero.<br />You live the life of FitzChivalry as you read the Tawny Man Trilogy.  You don't see the history of the Six Duchies, but embrace it through his eyes.  In the first novel, \\"Fool's Errand\\" you felt just like Fitz.  Reading the first half you felt like you were always catching up, as if time was flying by, trying to remember everything of old.  You always were playing catch up through out the whole novel.  But \\"Golden Fool\\" is different.  In this novel you feel the weight of duty, each day in Fitz's life seems like a month as he dives back into the court of Buckkeep.  And just so every page seems like a chapter to you, the book expands beyond its page numbers.  You will sit down for hours unmoving only to stop and realize you've only read through a chapter or two in awe.  You'll wonder if you will ever get through this novel just as Fitz wonders if he will ever go back to his quiet life in the country.<br />It is amazing work, beyond words, though I have tried.  The only problem is that you must wait another year for the last piece of the trilogy.  That you begin this story in the middle and you end it there too.  Until a novel is written in which Fitz's soul crosses over to join those that have left before him it will never end for you, you'll always want more of him, and perhaps even after that you will cry for more of the Farseers from this extraordinary author.<br />Final Thought: Robin Hobb's Farseer novels are not read, they are experienced.osses over to join those that have left before him it will never end for you, you'll always want more of him, and perhaps even after that you will cry for more of the Farseers from this extraordinary author.<br />Final Thought: Robin Hobb's Farseer novels are not read, they are experienced.
B00006L83N|5.0|This is a great follow-up to their epic V! What a difficult album to follow up V is-but they have done it. This work has one of their best songs ever-King Of Terrors. It has so many great little riffs and parts that they are too numerous to mention.Odyssey is a fantastic tune which showcases their style with great melodies. This is simply one of the best bands ever to make music. I recently traveled to Chicago to hear them and they are just as good live-worth the trip. I talked to Michael Romeo -a genuinely humble and very nice guy and one of the best guitarists ever to live. Buy this CD-you will not regret it.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is one of my favorite Beatle disks, an excellent bridge that links Rubber Soul with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Take a look at the cover and you'll see that in 1966, things were changing for the Beatles yet again.  They had quit live performance, retreated into the studio, and began doing some of their best studio work ever, full of experimentation but without the pretension of some later work.<br />The fourteen songs on Revolver include all kinds of pop nuggets.  Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, Yellow Submarine, etc.<br />George Harrison is represented by three tracks here, including the leadoff \\"Taxman\\" with its cool bass/drum groove, biting guitar chords, backwards guitar solo, and some of George's best lyrics to date.  \\"My advice to those who die, declare the pennies on your eyes.\\"  \\"Love You To\\" is the first of George's sitar/raga/tabla pieces to appear on record, and his sitar playing had definitely improved from \\"Norwegian Wood.\\"  He also has the laid-back love tune, \\"I Want to Tell You.\\"<br />Ringo takes lead vocals on \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" a classic singalong.<br />Paul McCartney sings lead on \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" one of his most poignant pieces ever.  Beautiful harmonies and haunting strings.  Authorship has been disputed between Paul and John, but this is one brilliant song.  \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" is a syrupy ballad with a nice melody and light vocals.  \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is one of those songs you here in the spring that makes you smile.  \\"For No One\\" is a sad lament of lost love, a waltz rhythm, nice bassline and piano, and simple but effective lyrics.  \\"Got to Get You into my Life\\" is powered by energetic horns and Paul's exuberant vocals.<br />The person that benefited the most from the studio time was John Lennon, who turned out a series of outstanding tunes.  \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is a dreamy song for slackers everywhere.  \\"She Said She Said\\" is full of electric guitars, double-track vocals, and lyrics open to multiple interpretations.  \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" has an awesome guitar part, lush harmonies and a very cool bassline by Paul.  \\"Doctor Robert\\" is a trippy little tune about a man with a magic cup.  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is probably the most experimental song by the Beatles to this point, with exotic backbeat drums, sitar strains, and bizarre sound effects.  The lyrics show John developing his own inner mysticism.  \\"Listen to the color of your dreams...\\"Your Bird Can Sing\\" has an awesome guitar part, lush harmonies and a very cool bassline by Paul.  \\"Doctor Robert\\" is a trippy little tune about a man with a magic cup.  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is probably the most experimental song by the Beatles to this point, with exotic backbeat drums, sitar strains, and bizarre sound effects.

B000002G23|5.0|The Police Box Set is one of the few definitive collections that includes nearly everything put out by a recording artist.  The listener gets to enjoy the transition from would-be punks evolving to seminal New Wave bleached blonds, and then to arena rockers.  I still enjoy their distinctive &quot;white reggae&quot; sound as well as fine instrumental performance.<br />The disks include Outlandos d'Amour, with great cuts &quot;Roxanne,&quot; &quot;Can't Stand Losing You,&quot; &quot;So Lonely&quot; and other early nuggets.  Regatta de Blance includes &quot;Message in a Bottle,&quot; &quot;Walking on the Moon,&quot; and sleeper gems such as &quot;Bring on the Night,&quot; &quot;The Bed's too Big Without You,&quot; and &quot;Does Everyone Stare.&quot;  These three guys could really rock.  Stewart Copeland is one of the finest drummers of his generation.  Andy Summers has always been an underrated guitarist.  Before going adult contemporary, Sting could really churn some grooves on the bass.<br />Halfway through disk 2 we get Zenyatta Mondatta, with &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me,&quot; &quot;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da,&quot; &quot;Driven to Tears,&quot; and some great instrumental jams.<br />Disk 3 features the excellent Spirits in the Material World, with the title song, &quot;Every Little Thing She Does is Magic,&quot; &quot;Demolition Man,&quot; and a personal favorite by Stewart Copeland called &quot;Darkness.&quot;<br />Disk 4 covers the Synchronity period, with their biggest hits and the swansong of this great band.  It was sad to see the ego battles dissolve the group, but at least these guys went out on top.  Well, not counting &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me '86.&quot;<br />Interspersed are some live cuts and b-side studio outtakes.<br />My only regret is that the disks do not preserve the original song sequences of the individually released disks, but I can understand from an economic point of view.  Still, this is a great set.
0066214122|2.0|Michael Crichton has done it again! Yet another shallow novel based on a dubious premise filled with interesting scientific detail and characters as flat as matzoh bread. If readers find the plot eerily familiar to Jurassic Park, that's because it is -- secret lab loses control of its invention, which turns on them. Give me a break! And just like Jurassic Park, an \\"evil\\" scientist sabotages any effort to rein in those wacky new life forms. Captain Underpants dispatches his enemies in 70 illustrated pages -- why does Crichton require over 300. There is no suspense, no character development, and no attempt to create a credible antagonist, i.e. the nanobots. As Lincoln once said, \\"People who like this kind of book will like this\\". Otherwise, wait for the movie.
B000075BFK|3.0|Yeah the the lyrics are still brilliant but where have the beats gone? i don't think that the producers should have tried to modernise the music by taking out the hard beats he used to have and put in little tapping sounds in some songs. they should have made it more like the rap from before 96 with a mixture of beats and music as this album seems to be 80% music and 20% proper beats. if you are a fan though you should buy the album but it could have been better.

Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have great on screen chemistry. The movie is very entertaining and makes you fall in love with both characters. I urge everyone to give this movie a chance. Its something both men and women would like. I know I did!
B000063V8U|5.0|Usually most television series are on their last legs by their next to last season. This wasn't the case with TNG. In fact, the writing/producing/directing/performing team seemed to have caught their second wind by season six--certainly one of their finest offerings.<br />I've read lots of complains about Time's Arrow (part 2). I found it to be a refreshing episode of the series--it did recall the flavor of Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever (more than the Roddenberry-Coon-Fontana rewrite). Adding Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain) to the mix was inspired.<br />While True Q didn't have the bite of most episodes involving Q, it still gave John De Lancie a chance to shine. It really wasn't about Q per se anyway. He was just a bystander in this case witnessing someone else's use of their Q power.<br />The real stand out episodes was the two part Chain of Command. The interaction between Patrick Stewart as Picard and David Warner as his torturer was riveting. One of Stewart's finest performances is featured in this great episode. In reality, it would actually have been a better season cliff hanger than Descent. I'd also like to praise Ronnie Cox and Jonathan Frakes for their performances as well; the two stories were well tailored and paralleled the changes within each character.<br />Quality of Life, Aquiel, Face of the Enemy, Ship in a Bottle (which resurrects Dr. Morarity from season 2), Tapestry and The Chase are all stand out episodes.  Aquiel is a brilliant character study as well as a look at the effects of loss on the individual. It's a stunning episode that reaches to the heart of humanity--even in a powerful alien spieces. The Chase is particularly interesting as it looks at the road not chosen by Picard as well as providing an interesting explaination as to why there are so many humanoid species populating the universe.<br />The extras are very nice. There's a profile of Data as well as a preview trailer for Deep Space Nine (which is finally coming to DVD!). Deep Space Nine was the only series spin off from TNG that expanded on the storytelling arcs and scope of the original series. It's one of the finest written of the Trek series and Avery Brooks is very under rated in his role as Sisko.<br />The picture quality is very good to excellent on most of the discs. There are no analog artifacts although there are a few digital ones from the compression technology of DVD; for example there's one scene where the background behind Riker appears to be a projection simply because the pixels don't change at a very high rate.<br />The sound quality is stunning. The remix to 5.1 brings a new depth (and appreciation) to the sound effects layered on the soundtrack. It's obvious someone was thinking ahead when they added all the background sounds. The music sounds quite good--not quite to SACD or even DVD-Audio standards--but very good nonetheless. There's a bit of compression but it's hardly noticable.<br />The extras have been improving with each additional year of the series (likewise the picture and sound quality). The only area for improvement is in the booklet. It's less than informative with a couple of paragraphs about the season and highlighting one or two episodes. It would be helpful to have a brief synopsis of each episode as well as guest stars (if any) and writer/director credits. All we get is the episode name, when it originally aired and what disc it's featured on (and this is alphabetical vs. airdate).<br />The other area that could use improvement is commentary from a key cast member, director or writer for a handful of pivotal episodes. The Babylon 5 box set Signs and Portents offers three episodes with interesting and enlightening commentaries by writer/creator/producer/director J. Michael Straczinski. It would have served Paramount well to do the same thing while the actors were shooting Nemesis. It's unlikely Paramount will be able to get the cast together again for a commentary given that Nemesis is likely the last TNG feature to be produced.<br />On the whole, Paramount has finally done well by Star Trek. The original series never received this much TLC (and since the market is smaller for it, their probably unlikely to do so).likely the last TNG feature to be produced.<br />On the whole, Paramount has finally done well by Star Trek.

B000069AUI|4.0|Well the U2 via Radiohead comparisons have finally quieted down. While Coldplay owe origin of their sound to both bands (much more so the former than the latter as Chris Martin could be a dead ringer for Bono around The Unforgettable Fire album). You can certainly here the other influences there as well--from Jeff Buckley, to Pink Floyd and, yes, the relaxed (or stoned depending on how you want to look at it) sound of The Beatles' Strawberry Fields Forever and I Am The Walrus.<br />Parachutes displayed a band still finding their voice. While the songs were very strong, a distinctive identity eluded them; it was a game of spot the influence. With A Rush of Blood to the Head, the band has demonstrated a remarkable ability to grow. They've also cornered a niche sound for themselves. As to whether or not they'll be able to grow beyond that sound and transcend its limitations, that remains to be seen.<br />Regardless of these facts, the music is heartfelt and A Rush of Blood to the Head is certainly one of the best albums from last year. I'd also recommend The Soft Boys' Nextdoorland and Kimberly Rew's Grand Central Revisited. Both albums are as unique and powerful in their own way as Coldplay's sophmore effort.

1878424319|2.0|Quite simply, The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz just doesn't concur.  Though written to achieve a genuine (yet impractical) cause, its expression that the book will \\"rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love\\" is quite far fetched.    Using dramatic, underlying imagery, Ruiz takes the reader through a journey of tales, traveling to picturesque scenes that attempt to transform the reader into a very own student of the Mexican Toltec beliefs.  However, in order to achieve true happiness through this lyrical expedition, the reader must apply various themes into his or her life that would take constant dedication and a reversal of many modern beliefs.  Frankly, it would take a universal commitment to change the negative, global aura this book attempts to dispel.    On the contrary, the book creates a fresh entry into the world of self-help books. Another similar work written two years after The Four Agreements was first published, The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment, was said to have been confusing and falls short of any success.  Ruiz is more clear in language and friendly in tone.  Very unique in the genre of self-help books, The Four Agreements uses the practices of the Toltecs to attempt life transformation.    If everyone in this world practiced the beliefs in the book, humankind would be beyond a system of peace and harmony.  It is very evident, though, that not everyone will read the book and, clearly, Ruiz's vision of pure contentment will not exist past the pages of The Four Agreements.
0345413377|5.0|This book is most definatly the best in the series, though I do have to admit that some parts do lag. (Namely for me, Mary and the mulefa) But the plot twists more then make up for the these rare occasions, you will be floored when the truth comes out about each character, and you'll come back begging for more. In my opinion, only Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy surpasses the scope of this novel. Fit for someone of adult age as well as for children (I'm 20 years old and only stumbled across the series when the Golden Compass was presented to me as a gift. Right afterwards I went out and bought the last two installments, and words cannot describe how unbelievably good the finale is) A perfect gift for the reader in your family!!

B0000025T6|5.0|Effectively demos for a recording session that ended up released because Bruce didn't like the way the band did it! And that straight after The River.<br />This album is about as low key as any artist has a right to go and from its folky Nebraska beginning, through its asleep at the wheel State Trooper to insomniac chugs like Johnny 99 and Reason To Believe, this album creeps in from the Mid West unwelcome.<br />While the nearest thing to a hit on the album is the roaring Atlantic City it is in the claustraphobia of User Cars and the melancholy of Highway Patrolman that Springsteen shows us something that has been coming upon us a long time and is still coming.<br />Yet, perversely, the madcap Open All Night somehow always drags me back.  Almost gives you a reason to believe.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|I originally didn't want to see this movie in when it was in the theater;  I thought I was too &quot;grown up&quot; for it (I was 18 when it came out), and waited for it to come to video to see it.  I saw it at a friend's house and from the first frame, I had a tear in my eye, so I knew I was in for something good.  Boy, did I underestimate this movie.  I loved it!  It did a wonderful job of explaining what the story was all about--a prince turned into a hideous beast by an enchantress &quot;who had seen that there was no love in his heart&quot;.  The bottom line in this movie is to learn not to be tricked by appearances.  True beauty lies within.  <br />The DVD release was a real treat for me as I had worn out 2 copies of this tape!  Not only are both versions (theatrical version and the IMAX version) on the disc, but it was really cool to see it as a &quot;work-in-progress&quot;.  I also loved seeing the Celine Dion/Peabo Bryson video in the end.  Even though I am not a fan of either of them, I really love this song.  <br />If you have never seen a Disney movie (and I don't think that there's anyone young or old who hasn't!), don't just rent this one, BUY IT!  You'll be glad you did!
B000001GQ1|5.0|From his youth in Imperial Berlin and Vienna until his retirement in his late 80's, Wilhelm Kempff's interpretations of Beethoven's Piano works have never been anything other than controversial, polarising the opinions of music lovers for almost a century to an even greater extent than Kemperer did with the symphonies.  That alone is no small achievement!<br /><br />This however leaves us with something of a problem with this CD.  Many who hear these recordings of some of the best known of Beethoven's Piano sonatas, The Pathetique (no 8), The Moonlight (no 14), The Waldstein (no 21) and The Appassionata (no 23), regard them as something of a &quot;cop out&quot;, polite and civilised performances of music which at it's core it anything but polite and civilised, cynically calculated to appeal to the drawing room sensibilities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  I must confess that the first time I heard this CD, I was inclined to agree.  But as I listened again and again, I found myself being drawn ever deeper in to Kempff's view.  These readings are deeply introspective; they have all the passion of more bombastic readings, but expressed in a more subtle way and prove that there is a romantic depth to Beethoven's music, which modern interpretations tend to gloss over.  Perhaps this is how Liszt, Chopin and Clara Schumann played these works, or perhaps not, we'll never know.  Either way the listener's reaction to this recording will be more subjective than with almost any other.<br />For me, even considering the mono recordings made my Kempff 10 years earlier than these which some consider to be better, this is the finest performance of the Beethoven sonata's available.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

B000003CMB|5.0|the truth be told, tom dowd had as much to do with the legacy surrounding this spectacular album as the band did. of course, we all know he was the producer of &quot;live at fillmore east&quot;. however could anyone else have captured every little nuance, knook and groove that the allman brothers laid down over those few nights? or been able to transfer the communal feeling and nurturing vibe evident in the music to wax?<BR>the man probably had the biggest undertaking as far as editing was concerned. we're talking 3 hour shows, 2 of them each day over a sporadic 3 day period. just imagine the countless hours that were reduced to floor scrap because it wouldnt fit on a double album. <BR>the pace the band were performing at in those days was nothing short of manical. each performance landed them a bigger audience than the previous show. you may not have liked the style of music but you did have to appreciate the stellar musicianship shared between the six members. they communicated as if they all bounced off the same brain waves or perhaps it was some sort of synergistic telepathy. the music created could only have rivaled the improvisational theme underlying the &quot;kind of blue&quot; sessions.<BR>close to twenty years later, dowd was given the chance to better his initial offering through the magic of modern technology. he was able to piece together odds and ends of various performances and make them even more sonically palatable (as if they werent to begin with!). the result is what we have featured on the double disc set. the bare songs (with even a few extra songs)as they were presented back in 1971 but augmented and so much more accentuated by these spare parts.<BR>the sound is acoustically balanced and crystal clear which makes for an absolutely blissful listening experience. <BR>many of us who listen to a.b.b. probably werent alive when duane or berry left us but you would have to be oblivious not to know the long lasting impact their work had and will havefor some time to come. they were revered by many blues journeymen for their ability to channel the energy and essence of the blues and transmit a sound very much their own. they brought innovation to the word &quot;jam&quot; and its because of this album (which we are blessed to own) that thousands of bands have an element of a.b.b in their sound. you need only ask a few of the great guitar virtuosos who they felt was the greatest blues player ever. they'll tell you. this is the body of work that confirms that belief.<BR>if you must own one a.b.b. album i would suggest the double disc set released in 1992. i would also encourage any and/or all a.b.b. fans to beg polydor to release a box set focusing on every last note played at the fillmore over those three nights.<BR>incidentally, the musical genius i spoke of at the top of this review passed away late last year. he was a visionary and trailblazer in the world of rhythym and blues and will be missed. he played a hand in the production of such acts (just to name a few) as aretha franklin, eric clapton, bonnie and delaney and wilson pickett. yes, a.b.b. are in the same company as these folks<BR>BRING BACK DICKEY!
B00006RU5B|5.0|When word came out about a supergroup called Audioslave all I could think out is wow.  There was no way the talents of four great people who make such great music good make a bad cd. Songs like &quot;Show me how to live&quot;, &quot;Like a stone&quot; and &quot;Set it off&quot; just put me into schock.

B00004W221|5.0|I received this DVD for Christmas, and although I had previously rented it, it's still a great movie to own. Sean Astin delievers an exceptional performance as Rudy, the &quot;underdog&quot; who aspires to play football for Notre Dame. Football and non-football fans alike will enjoy this true story through it's well-acted performaces. <br />Astin (as Rudy) portrays this young man with true emotion, and allows to viewer to really tap into the character. He is one of my favorite actors, and is in my opinion far under-rated, though he has of course moved onto bigger and better projects (The Lord of the Rings, he also directs), this is still where he shines. Ned Beatty and Charles S. Dutton deliever fine performances as well.<br />I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a happy-ever-after story. 'Rudy' has charm, heart, and of course...football. Rent it and give it a try if you've never seen it.
B00005JLRR|2.0|Star Trek: Nemesis is a better movie than Star Trek: Insurrection and Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (or so memory serves, I haven't seen V in years).  Of course, that's hardly saying much, but at least it isn't as gag-inducing as the former and as laughable as the latter.  Rather, what we have here is the perfect opportunity for a rip-roaring actioner set in deep space, full of phaser combat and fight scenes, but all we get is a mostly dull thriller.<br />The reason is simple: the premise simply isn't that interesting, and this is a problem that has marred the films featuring The Next Generation crew.  No fresh or intriguing concepts are introduced or expanded.  All we get is the typical nature vs. nurture debate that's clumsily inserted into the dialogue on an occasional basis.  In case you have no idea what the story is, it's basically The Wrath of Khan with a Picard clone instead.<br />But such a premise could still set-up exciting action sequences, right?  In theory, yes, but director Stuart Baird doesn't really pull it off.  There are a few big action setpieces, including a pretty cool car chase on a desert planet (visually inspired by Pitch Black, given the sepia-tones and all), a firefight inside the warship Scimitar, and the all-out climactic space battle, which isn't as exciting as it may sound.   <br />It's definitely the space battle that gets the most attention, and it runs for a little over twenty minutes, but how exciting can such a sequence be?  Watching two gargantuan starships taking shots at one another is pretty stagnant, it lacks the sense of mobility and speed an all-out aerial dogfight would have (a la Return of the Jedi).  That's not to say those twenty minutes don't have their moments.  There's another brief firefight on board the Enterprise (there should have been a lot more of these, as they prove to be the most exciting segments of the film) and an absolutely spectacular scene where the Enterprise rams into the Scimitar.  But for the most part, it's a long action sequence that's too talky (we're apparently supposed to be in suspense when ensigns shout that the shields are collapsing) and marred by a psychic link subplot that really slows the battle down.  If they plan to make a sequel and make it an action-oriented one, my advice: more firefights (or suspenseful situations a la First Contact), less starship stand-offs.<br />But complain as I might, there are still a few things I enjoyed.  Patrick Stewart is easily the best actor of any of the Star Trek series and it's always a pleasure to see the man reprise his role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  Brent Spiner is always reliable and convincing as Data, and once again, the film focuses primarily on these two characters.  The rest of the crew is left short-handed, given little to do other than perform what's required of them (Worf and Riker shoot down a few badguys, Geordi works on the engines, Dr. Crusher makes a few analyses, and Troi establishes a psychic link).  Tom Hardy makes for a really good villain, despite the fact that he sounds nothing like Stewart.  <br />In the end, though, this is a mediocre film, with a few highlights here and there.  Even a major character's death is clumsily executed; the fact this one person happened to be my second favorite of the crew still didn't change the fact that I was quite unmoved by his passing.  It goes to show how a stilted delivery can really mute the emotional impact.<BR>** 1/2 out of *****
0140189378|4.0|Suffering...we've all had it...or it's coming...is Bellow's theme of this work.  I've never read an author who described heartbreak and tears so well as Saul Bellow.  My face was red and hot and strained by the time I finished the book--he moved me! Suffering--admitting and recognizing that anguish might be your temporary lot in life--has never been so beautifully penned and honestly told.  The more I think of the book, the less I like it for the story, but the more I appreciate its truthfulness in describing how problems can stack higher and higher and higher and nobody will help you.<br />I think you'll find what the main characters &quot;seizes&quot; after a few days of thinking and observing life on your own.<br />Read it!  It's only 120 pages packed with a lot of insight.
0066214122|3.0|I am a Crichton fan from way back.  I was disappointed in this book, though.  I am an Engineer and I enjoy the technical aspects of his research that comes through in his books.  I also like his linear fashion of writing.....not a lot of subplots.<br />I was disappointed in this book because of the characters that were too dumb to get to safety, the ineptitude of a building full of Engineers/Technicians and the unbelievable plot.<br />The ending was very disappointing as well.  In my mind, he couldn't come up with a good one, so he just made up something semi-real and stretched the heck out of it.<br />If you are a Crichton fan, find another book.  This one is best left on the shelf.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The person below is not the first I've heard of the band being less than amazing live, but that does not affect my opinion of THE MUSIC in the least. I was absolutely blown away by the new sound. Nobody else has this sound. It is very catchy, and Jared sings amazingly well, he's got a strong voice.<br />Playing live, contrary to popular belief, is very difficult. Not only does *every* singer go offkey (some due to poor feedback monitors) but when has Jared had time to devote his energy solely towards music? He's acting in films. He's exploring his creativity. <br />We're in a digital age, and there are so many creative effects you can put on sound, that are overly expensive and ridiculously hard to capture live.<br />There is nothing wrong with being a studio musician if that's what you want to be. But Jared probably knows their band struggled live - he can read his own message board. The question is, what's the next album going to sound like? It's a learning process, and I bet he's going to strip away a lot of the effects for a better live sound, if he likes playing live.<br />If Jared were not a serious musician, he would have quit by now in the face of such cruel, ignorant and under-educated reviews.<br />If you don't have this CD, listen to samples. Someone said he brought back 80's mixed with 90's ambient sound - absolutely true. I think the repetition in some songs is meditative (sometimes annoying, but it does not detract from the other songs I love ferociously and probably could not live without). My favorite songs are \\"Mission,\\" \\"Echeleon,\\" \\"Capricorn,\\" and \\"Revolution.\\"<br />Please do me a favor and don't believe every capitalized or punctuated opinion you read...it's just a guideline. Even my opinions. Just listen for yourself. It's your brain.
B000008H1U|5.0|Just kidding.<br />Back in 1987, a lot of people whined because this Tull album beat out Metallica for a Grammy award in the \\"heavy metal\\" category. Even some longtime Tull fans thought there was a problem here. But let's think this through.<br />The Grammy award for heavy metal was a _new_ category that year. And maybe the category wasn't (and isn't) quite as well-defined as Metallica fans would have liked us to believe. (You'd probably call Led Zeppelin a heavy metal band, wouldn't you? Did you ever listen to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"? What's that instrument you hear? Could it be -- gasp! -- a _fl*te_?)<br />Besides, Tull had been around for _twenty years_ at that point and had never won a Grammy of _any_ kind. Considering how much the heavy-metal category owed, and still owes, to Tull's music (especially Martin Barre's searing guitar and Ian Anderson's manic on-stage presence), doesn't it make sense that the Grammy judges would think it appropriate to launch the new category with a bit of well-deserved homage to its so-far-unrecognized roots?<br />Then, too, this album was, and is, one of Tull's finest. Anderson was recovering from some severe throat problems and had recorded most of this album at home, with Martin Barre, Doane Perry, Gerry Conway, David Pegg, and some electronic instruments (notably a keyboard and a drum machine). But even so, it was a _lot_ closer to Tull's earlier rock than it was to the electronic-synth stuff they'd been releasing during the 1980s to that point.<br />Still not convinced this is \\"heavy metal\\"? Okay, maybe it isn't quite. But what category _does_ Tull belong in? If you wanted to give them a well-deserved Grammy, can you think of a better one?<br />The CD version includes a couple of tracks that weren't on the original vinyl LP (\\"Dogs in the Midwinter\\" and \\"The Waking Edge\\"). They're not exactly \\"extra\\" tracks, because they've always been available on the CD, but I still think of them as \\"extra\\" because I didn't have them in 1987. They're good.<br />My favorites from this album, though, are always going to be \\"Farm on the Freeway,\\" \\"Said She Was a Dancer,\\" and \\"Budapest\\". The latter two are especially funny if you're aware of Tull's reputation as the diametrical opposite of \\"party animals\\" and not a lot of fun for groupies to hang around with. Ian and the boys tend to read books and go to bed early, and none of them do d-r-*-g-s or anything. So it's kind of fun to hear Ian singing about a couple of times (one fictional, one not) in which he completely struck out with a member of the fair sex.<br />The word \\"singing\\" is sometimes a bit of a stretch, though; Anderson was taking it easy here, still recovering from those nasty throat problems, and he was keeping the melodies within a range that he could \\"speak\\" rather than roar. As a result his sound on this album has been compared to Mark Knopfler (aided, no doubt, by Barre's delightful guitar work on \\"Said She Was a Dancer\\"). That's okay -- the man was entitled to a rest and we were all glad he was in a condition to release albums at all.ey're good.<br />My favorites from this album, though, are always going to be \\"Farm on the Freeway,\\" \\"Said She Was a Dancer,\\" and \\"Budapest\\".

0743424425|3.0|This book was interesting but i liked the movie better. the only part i didn't like was the end when Jack dies in the hotel and some parts were real boring. but other then that it was a good book.
B00005JKZT|5.0|There is no question that this is the middle movie of a trilogy. As the opening of this movie does not give a recap of The Fellowship of the Ring , director Peter Jackson expects that you have seen the first movie. The Two Towers will not likely make sense as a movie without FOTR, nor is it meant to. This is also one of the weaknesses of the film. It cannot stand alone. The story is a continuation of the first film and is a transition into the third (and final) film.<br />With that said, it is a very fine transition. Frodo and Samwise are headed to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are pursuing the captured Meriadoc and Pippin. Gandalf the Grey is missing, having fallen off a bridge in the Mines of Moria. The Fellowship of the Ring did such a good job introducing the characters and the world they inhabit that no further introduction is needed. That's a good thing, because we don't get an introduction, we are tossed right into the action.<br />It has been several years since i've last read The Lord of the Rings (with my single volume edition), so i can't comment on changes made to the movie.<br />All three films of The Lord of the Rings were filmed at the same time, so there is nothing lost in tone or acting or the sets when looking at the three films (or two films, as the third is not yet released). The performances are the same and they continue to ring true for the characters. While the story ultimately centers around Frodo and the Ring, Aragorn is the strongest of all the characters. It is his strength the guides the broken fellowship and it is his strength that is ultimately relied upon. Viggo Mortensen is believable as Aragorn and is actually credible as a warrior. Is Frodo is central to the story, Aragorn is truly the heart of the Fellowship.<br />There is no true beginning and no true ending to this movie. We know that we are simply passing through to get to the finale in The Return of the King . Even so, this film had to get so many things right to make the series believable and to keep the audience's interest for one more year. There is a computer generated creature named Gollum that we meet in the shadows of the first movie. Gollum is the most important character in the book and in a way, is the most important character in the series. This is for several reasons. He drives the action forward at times, it was Gollum that led the Nazgul to the Shire, Gollum that first discovered the ring, Gollum that helps Frodo to Mordor, Gollum that will lead Frodo and Sam into something new in the next movie. Gollum is tied to the ring and that lends him import. Gollum is also a sad creature that was twisted by the power of the One Ring. He was twisted so much that while he still resembles his old self, it is a warped version of Smeagol. He is so twisted that the creature had to be computer generated. And this is where the movie gets it right. While Jar Jar Binks was a minor, though annoying characters, The Phantom Menace did not depend on Jar Jar. Gollum is of vital importance to The Two Towers and had Peter Jackson and Co. failed to deliver a credible Gollum, the movie may very well have failed. Gollum is a major character with quite a bit of dialogue and interaction with Frodo and Sam. Gollum is nearly perfect and while you realize at times that he isn't real...you quickly forget about that and believe Gollum for what he is.<br />I must admit that i have been long a fan of the books, so i am already disposed to like the movies. But these are so easy to get wrong. The animated versions from the 70's are horrible. I wanted so much to like these movies and my expectations have been surpassed in both films. The epic battle at Helm's Deep, the Orcs, dwarf (\\"toss me....but don't tell the elf\\"), hobbits, and everything else magical about this series is perfectly realized.<br />This movie is long, around 3 hours. If you dislike fantasy or slightly overlong epics....skip this. If you haven't seen the first movie...rent it. If you like it, go see this. I believe that you will be missing out on a good movie if you do not see this, but everyone has different tastes and this is not one i will put on the list of movies to push to everyone (Memento, Almost Famous). Suspend your disbelief and sit back to enjoy a well told epic story.ovie...rent it. If you like it, go see this.
