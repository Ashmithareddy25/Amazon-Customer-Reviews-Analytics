B001QWBM62|3.0|Others here have lavished praise--and largely justifiably so--on this portable recorder. Yes it is nicely laid-out, versatile and easy to use, but these benefits have been covered by previous reviews. The thing that perplexes me--A LOT--is the lack of any way to make a line-level recording on the H4n. Seriously: this thing has NO WAY to make a line-level recording. It has a metronome. A FLIPPIN' METRONOME, but no way to do the most basic thing in the recording world: make a line-level recording. So, if you are doing any kind of sound work which uses a mixing console, and you simply want to run the console outputs to the inputs of your H4n to make a reference recording, you cannot do it: the inputs will be overloaded by the console output. Even if you run the recording level at \\"1\\", the signal will be too hot and distorted. I love the unit for microphone-level recording: it's great. But the lack of such an incredibly basic function is bizarre. To design a portable recorder with a metronome but no line-level capability is like making an electric guitar with a built-in cup holder but no volume knob. Most users do what I did: bought a pair of in-line signal attenuating adaptors so your line input signal won't be over-modulated, but this is really a clunky and inelegant solution. So please, Zoom: if you re-vamp this unit, give us line input capability!

B007MNV5WU|5.0|The fact that this is another angry birds it is not the same old angry birds it is awesome the graphics are amazing on my fire i love the everything about this game my whole family loves to play this ;-)
0385523912|5.0|With each page, I read more about the horrific lives that are endured in North Korea.  I must say, I've learned so much and wish to learn more, if I can bear it.  An amazing read & education.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|For a free app, this one has it all. Many translations of the Bible, many, reading plans, and many useful tools to enhance your reading experience.
B006TLFIAQ|3.0|The story went by a little slower than I would have liked. The movie has bullets, explosions, car chase, and boobs. So it fulfills the action movie requirements well, but takes a while for the story to come together. Its worth watching it, but just not certain about buying it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A friend recommended this book, and the others in the trilogy.  After just 100 pages, I can't believe how trashy it is.  I reminds me of the books I used to read as a teenager and hide from my mother.  Not only is it boring, it's a big waste of the reader's time.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I hope at some point somebody really makes a biopic of Margaret Thatcher and her amazing accomplishments.  She is portrayed in this movie as a misguided woman who rose through the ranks by neglecting her family.  Her accomplishments, especially helping end the cold war, are mentioned briefly in passing.  The movie spends most of the time in her old age, where she is conversing with the ghost (or memory) of her dead husband and saying incredibly mean things to her daughter.  REALLY?  That's what the movie makers came up with?  They were so afraid to praise anything Margaret Thatcher did that they made her look like an abusive, neglectful, slightly crazy and out of touch woman instead of the strong woman she was and is.  How awful is this to do to somebody just to further your political agenda?  She is also the longest serving and only female British prime minister of the 20th century.  Total personal wealth rose by 80% under Thatcher.  The Labour Party Leader in 2011 finally admitted that Thatcher's policies in the 80's were correct.  However, you won't see much about her great accomplishments in this movie.<br /><br />Yes, Meryl Streep can act.  But the fact that she accepted a role to diminish this great woman actually diminishes Meryl Streep in my eyes.

B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I am family man, Cloney's age, and a few folks say I even might even resemble George, but even I could not identify with him in this movie.  I was hoping for something funny and quirky (Brother Where Art Thou?).  Not even close, like watching paint dry.  Everything funny is in the trailer.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is very entertaining! I enjoy planning out my own city! The challenges are fun too. I would recommend this to my friends.
B007549W62|5.0|The content of this movie was totally unexpected. The reaction of human beings when faced with a slow, agonizing death is set forth in hypothetical and depraved detail. Fascinating but certainly NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH. Watched it via rental and then purchased it for viewing when I'm up to the desk. An unusual must-have.
0345529057|5.0|I loved the series of Game of Thrones so much, I almost expected to be disappointed by the book because I had been told that the series was so close to the book - basically I expected no surprises. I was pleasantly surprised, the book had more to offer than the TV series, and the second book has literally had me on the edge of my seat at times. I haven't got to the the third and fourth books yet, but can't wait to start reading them!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is way better than smurf village it has all the originally characters and is a lot of fun to play
B005GK6QSO|5.0|Well... this is a studio record, keyboard fills, lots of romantic love songs, chicks would love this...It's wishy washy as HELL but, it's the hooks ! Almost every song has a great hook as all the players come in. I love this, just don't tell OLGA please. However, It is exceptionally excellent. This album sorta has an 80's metal feel don't let that scare you though, I find myself going back to it over and over. The singer definitely knows what he's doing great control, not getting into any range that is musically incorrect (rare these days) the mix is top notch (high fidelity aficionados take heed) production, engineering the whole nine, man these cats are smoking ! These songs are well written and, for a nice clean crisp change the progressions are not run of the mill standard. Nice job guys my hat goes off to you. I have always said I don't care what veneer you chose to drape your band in, as long as you can back it up. thing sounds F-ing great man.
0802130208|5.0|When my sister bought me A Confederacy of Dunces, she told me, `people who are really smart think this book is funny.  So if you don't like it, it's not my fault.'  I will reserve comment on what my decision to join no confederacy of dunces against John Kennedy Toole means.<br /><br />A Confederacy of Dunces takes place in New Orleans.  And it doesn't just take place in New Orleans.  It revels in New Orleans, rolls around in it, drinks in the cologne of the French Quarter.  It paints a tapestry of a particular place and paints it beautifully.<br /><br />A Confederacy of Dunces follows one of the truly great comic figures in American fiction, Ignatius J. Reilly, an obese momma's boy obsessed with the Middle Ages (I reserve comment as to whether I identify with Mr. Reilly).  He's a bit prone to grandiose statements and philosophical musings of questionable merit.  He is not prone to actual work of any sort.  His preferred dress is a hunting cap, flannel shirt, baggy pants, and scarf.<br /><br />An event as innocuous as a minor car accident leads to the incredible but credulous string of events that comprise the plot.  Toole is here a masterful choreographer, spinning the various plot threads back and forth, apart and together with seeming effortlessness.  At no point does it ever cease to be hilarious.<br /><br />As an aside, I must say that no one will truly be free until hot dog vendor persecution ends.
0345455681|4.0|Three books into Edward Rutherfurd's (so far) seven epic historical novels, I can see similar patterns between the books and see where the strengths and weaknesses lie.  What he really does best is bring history and the real people from it to life, which is especially true of this novel.  Unlike his previous England novel, Sarum, he includes more historical people here and more events familiar to those familiar with English history.  The kings and queens from the Plantagenets to King George, novelists like Chaucer and Shakespeare, events such as the Great Fire and the Blitz, all make their appearances in this novel.  It's amazing to watch the story unfold and see London evolve from a small Roman settlement to an urban city.<br /><br />The biggest weaknessses of the novel are a few.  I can sympathize with the reader complaining about the treatment of women in the novel, but then again we get to see how women are treated differently as the centuries go by.  I'm more disturbed by the anti-Catholic sentiment in the novel, as a Catholic myself.  It makes me anxious about the two Ireland novels I'll read later.  I also didn't like the return of characters and their descendants sharing characteristics from generation to generation, which was annoying in Sarum and was thankfully toned down in Russka, but at least it comes in handy for identifying the three or four branches of the Duckett and Doggett familes.<br /><br />Overall, though, this was an excellent novel.
0307959856|2.0|Although I couldn't wait to read Death Comes to Pemberley,I could not have been more disappointed once I finally finished the book. First off, Death doesn't really come to Pemberley it comes to Pemberley's back acreage and the alleged mystery centers on Darcy's servants and the rascally George Wickham, rendered a tad too sympathetic when you consider how Jane Austen skewered him in Pride and Prejudice. I was expecting a real mystery and I was expecting it to be about the gentry. What I wasn't expecting was Darcy as wooden as a tin soldier and Elizabeth a mere shadow of her former self.<br /><br />Instead of an intriguing mystery focusing on the genteel folk we've grown to love in Pride and Prejudice,  what we get here is half-baked story  centering on Wickham sans Lydia for the most part. Furthermore, I can not begin to tell you how boring this book was and how long and thick some of the paragraphs were; they went on for a page or more, but were of so little consequence that they might have been written by Mr. Collins, who for the most part is MIA along with Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine. Even PD James must have had some idea she'd written a turkey because she practically admits it in her Authors Note.<br /><br />My advise to any possible reader is not to pay a nickel for this book, instead buy some of the Jane Austen series of mysteries, where the author herself appears as a plucky sluth. Trust me Death Comes to Pemberley is not the book you want to escape into. One good thing, I think I am cured from ever wanting to buy a sequel to any great novel, instead I will just reread the original.

B007MNV5WU|2.0|I love angry birds and I'm only giving two stars because there is only two levels. I'm sorry but that's all you'll get from me on this one. Granted it doesn't deserve one star but I know you can do better. Riggs now angry birds space is a ripoff and It's a shame. I never thought I'd ever delete and an angry birds game. Update it with ALOT more levels and I will possibly download it again.

B0076NKNLA|5.0|Having admired Marilyn since my boyhood (my Dad took me to see Bus Stop in a movie theater,) I'll confess, as I think most men of a certain age will, to having held a small soft spot in my heart for this gifted and wounded young woman... for my entire adult life.<br /><br />I'm a fairly serious student of film. I work in the theatre business. In that light I can only say that I have never seen an actress so completely transform herself into another human being as Ms. Williams does in this film.<br /><br />Whether one is a fan of Marilyn or not, she is in our collective DNA, an incomparable and central icon of our national culture to this day. We know her every expression, every intonation, every eyelash. For an actress to take on such a role must have been a daunting task.<br /><br />Many actresses have played Marilyn over the years. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn. In this deeply moving film it's as though Marilyn has come back and inhabited Ms. Williams, and I choose that word very carefully.<br /><br />You'll perhaps go into this film expecting a light hearted romp. You'll get much more than you bargained for.<br /><br />One of the most astonishing performances by an actress that I've ever had the pleasure and the fully absorbed and riveted experience of watching.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Cool free game!<br />Really enjoyed it.  Of course...killing zombies is always fun...I might have to start playing this on Sundays nights until the new season of walking dead starts up!  haha

0307352145|5.0|The book I ordered was \\"Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking.\\"  The book was in excellent condition.  I feel that Amazon told precisely what I was buying.  I would buy books from Amazon again, and actually I have bought 3 more books since this book.<br />It was an excellent choice for me because I was told I was an introvert trying to be an extrovert, and that was what was causing a great deal of stress and fatigue.<br />Thank you.
B007IK44CK|4.0|I've watched this twice now, and enjoyed it both times (though I was surprised that I'd forgotten quite a bit from the first viewing).  Long runs of solid Action/thrill, good acting, a few cool effects.  Typical MI film.
B002WCLG3O|5.0|This is a truly stupendous set of short films. Being a fan of the Halo universe, these are essential viewing. I won't give any spoilers away, but I'll give a run down and my opinion on each short.<br /><br />Origins I and II - This two part opener is absolutely amazing. The depiction of the flood destroying the universe is truly amazing. The music in this one really drives it home too. Great short on the creation of the Halo universe and what led to Halo 1.<br />The Duel - If you are a fan of Japanese Cinema or the films of Masaki Kobayashi, this is a must watch. It feels like \\"Harakiri\\" or \\"Samurai Rebellion\\" has been put into the world of the elites. Great tale of honor, action, and interesting animation style.<br />Homecoming - This is an okay short. Probably the weakest in that there isn't much too it. Probably the most drab and boring of the animation styles.<br />Odd One Out - This is a rather goofy and silly short. Can't say much about it.<br />The Prototype - This is easily the best of the shorts. Oh my goodness. Amazing animation style, tons of great animation, and a powerful story too. Tons of robot mech action in this.<br />The Babysitter - A rather interesting short of a sniper mission. Good story, nothing special though.<br />The Package - This is basically action from beginning to end. This one basically looks like an extended cut scene from the games. Good action, and some very cool moves (in one scene Chief reloads his SMG's with ammo coming out of his legs and does a rotating flip over a bunch of enemies, great stuff).<br /><br />So overall, this is worth the purchase. There are some very good supplements on here as well explaining the creative process behind each short. So, Origins I and II and The Prototype are my favorite of the shorts. Than, The Duel and The Package. While Homecoming, Odd One Out, and The Babysitter, while not horrible, are just fair viewing.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Alabama Shakes has had something of a meteoric rise and the buzz is not without good reason.  This band is very, very good and they exude saavy musical sensitivity.  They are adept at producing catchy hooks and they know when to hold back and when to unleash a torrent of sound. I first heard this band via YouTubve videos and was blown away by the performances particularly You Ain't Alone at the SxSW Festival and a performance of Rise To the Sun on a Seattle radio program.  I do not think this studio album is as exciting as their live performances but that is not a knock on this cd - merely an acknowledgement of how good this band is live.  The band is pretty tight but Brittny Howard's vocals take this band over the top especially on songs like  You Ain't Alone.  This cd is excellent with only two negatives in my view.  The first has already been mentioned by another reviewer and that is what was described as a \\"distortion\\" toward the ending of Hold On.  I fully agree.  The addition of this distorted fuzzy buzz in the last stanza of the song I think was wholly unnecessary and is intrusive.  It sounds horrible nearly ruining an otherwise outstanding song.  The other negative is the song Goin' To the Party.  One of the most annoying songs I have ever heard and I simply cannot listen to it.  However, all other offerings are excellent and I cannot recommend this cd highly enough.  This band is destined for great things.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an erotic novel so be prepared, but this book truly is for anyone! It is very well written and has a plot that moves the story along really well. This book is intoxicating, you won't be able to put it down. Read this book!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great if you just want something to kill a little time with. Fun and kid friendly, this game gets 5 stars.
B0076NAWWA|3.0|Mike Portnoy is a genius.  We all know that.  Therefore, I was tremendously happy to see that the CD was a terrific success for him (and the other guys), especially after leaving DT.  That, plus what I think is a really awesome cover that I could stare at for hours, made me feel like I wanted to spend the $12 on it (or whatever it was), just to show solidarity with anything Mike Portnoy does.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I guess I'm one of these progressive music nerds, and I guess I'm just not happy if Portnoy isn't hammering out things in weird and/or fractional, ever-changing, time signatures.  This CD just seems like straight up, somewhat-more-thoughtful-than-usual and somewhat-more-intellectually-conceived-than-usual musical arrangements of standard rock, but still within one standard deviation of humdrum.  And for that, I don't need Portnoy, or these other grandmasters.  I'd rather that grandmasters do grandmaster stuff.  Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />There are moments in some of the songs (e.g., Kayla) where I am really digging it.  But, and I've given the CD a few good solid listens, there is not a single track on here that I find satisfying throughout.  I will continue to listen.  I know many times in the past I've had to listen to some CD's about 10 or 20 times before I was with it (e.g., \\"Octavarium\\" by Dream Theater).  But, somehow, I don't feel it's going to help in this case.  At the end of the day, I'm going to feel like this is just a slightly above average collection of songs done by performers whose talents are wasted on this kind of material.<br /><br />Like, having Dom Perignon with a really good hamburger.
B004N8CP8K|5.0|First app I ever wanted to pay for even though this free version does everything I need it to. I use this app everyday at work to connect to terminal servers for access to windows applications. The only gripe I have is the built in keyboard keys are too small on my galaxy tab 8.9, which severly limits my typing speed; however, the mouse function more than makes up for this shortcoming. Highly recommended app for folks who need to access remote systems while on the go...

B0059XTV4Y|3.0|Parts of this story are quite good, especially the parts focusing on Wallis and David/Edward in the 1930s.  The modern parts do not work nearly as well.  Also, the anachronistic music used during the benzedrine-laced drink scene is ridiculous and unnecessary.<br /><br />The actors do pretty well under the circumstances though.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. These puzzles remind me of some of the puzzles that are used in the Zelda games for Nintendo. It's only a puzzle game but it still looks good and the music is wonderful...quite soothing.  No problems with controls either.  More games need to have this kind of quality.

B0059XTTW8|3.0|The recent remaking of Le Carre's Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy unfortunately proved to be a unnecessary enterprise, resulting in a hard to understand, to follow and unenjoyable production. The BBC's mini  TV series was incomparably better than this- and not only because faithfully and in great detail was able to put on scene the novel.A few good actotrs struggled with the unenviable task to put life into the characters, and Alec Guinnness remains the only true George Smiley.
0439023513|1.0|I have to say the first two books were amazing however, the last book was just a big mess, the first two books I read very quickly but this one it tooked me like 2 months because there was really nothing exciting going on. I think Suzanne Collins could have done better or even make a 4th book if that was case to make it more exciting. This book was just like the movie soo much expectations and what a huge disappointment.......

055338466X|2.0|I didn't like it.  For one thing, they spent a lot of time just talking about the history of scientific method.  Then a lot of time explaining the basics of physics--OK, so I'm sure some first timers are reading it.<br /><br />But my biggest problem is that they go to such lengths to say that they're atheists and that God isn't needed to create the universe, and then they finally get to their explanation, and it's so vague, and theoretical that they may as well have said ...but on the other hand maybe it's God.<br /><br />I liked the explanation of multiple universes, and how it's nothing like sci fi with similar but varying Earths, but akin to other galaxies in one universe that have different physical laws.  But other than that, I could have done without it.

030746363X|5.0|First and foremost, I have tried out a few different diets that produce some results but nothing that has ever resulted in me keeping the weight off.<br /><br />This is a diet that is not only viable but doable. You dont have to try that hard to do this diet.<br /><br />I bought this book because I was eager to hear what the 4-hour workweek guru had to say about the human body.<br /><br />I was 205lbs with a 38\\" waist and a huge belly when I started the slow-carb diet.<br />By the end of it I was 185 with a 35\\" waist.<br /><br />Now its been a year later and I'm 175lbs with a 34\\"inch waist and a near flat belly.<br /><br />I think the most valuable piece of advice he gives is his concept on the value of self-experimentation.<br /><br />Also there are loads of information in this book.  This is a book that you can keep refering back to your whole life time.  As time goes by and your goals about your body changes, this book will have the answers.<br /><br />Good luck.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Most people think that if you have a flashy car and big house you must be rich. Surprising the opposite is true and millionaires are great at spending less than they earn. This book has tons of traits of millionaires which gives you good insight on heading in that direction.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this on my 'pad, having bought the Kindle edition I guess because it was cheap and someone had mentioned it in passing, and then I forgot about it.  Started to read it and was instantly engrossed, and only now looking at the Amazon page again do I realize / remember that it's one of those self-published eBooks.  It's polished and professional, and well worth a whole lot more (especially for the Omnibus!).<br /><br />This is really good writing.  It's more psychological than hard SF; the science is certainly nothing amazing (come to think of it, the main high-tech gadget is the radio), but it's also not one of those mushy slow-moving self-indulgent psychological things.  The writing is crisp, and the plot flows at a sometimes breathtaking clip.  (Do be warned that the author does not hesitate to kill off main characters!  There are always more, equally memorable, waiting in the wings to smoothly take over.)<br /><br />Very, very good use of SF techniques to explore (without hitting you over the head with it) love and fear and hatred and group dynamics and the necessity of necessary evil, and all SORTS of stuff.  And just like life, at the end we haven't quite found out what's going on; but it's still eminently satisfying.

B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was amazing! This book had everything a book needs. There was some romance and drama. Once i picked it up i could not put it down! I was instantly hooked and finished with all three books in 3 weeks!<br /><br />There was a veiw between 2 points of veiw, Grace and Sam. Maggie Stiefvater trasitions between the characters so that you get 2 to points of veiw. The way she transitions them where flawless. I've never read any other books with transitions so flawless. Her words where more like a poem than a book.<br /><br />Sam is a werwolf during the winter and during the summer he's a human. Sam and Grace's romance is cute and tasteful. There where some points where it was more PG-13 but it wasn't to descriptive, which was good. The ending couldnt have been any better!<br /><br />It's a perfect book for teens. After i read it i NEEDED to read the second one right away. It was just a perfect book!

B006TX276C|4.0|A beautiful compilation highlighting 30 years of work of perhaps one of the most underrated artists of our time. Mesmerizing, flawless beauty... an escape from mundane day-to-day existence. Sylvian's ability to paint a palette of escapism and atmosphere in his music is unparalleled with any artist I have heard in my lifetime. The first half of the compilation is a bit redundant following 2000's &#34;Everything a Nothing&#34;, and the 2nd half kind of loses steam with his shift to a more minimalist style, but it is still a great introduction to those unfamiliar with his work. The final unreleased track, &#34;Where's Your Gravity,&#34; however, shows Sylvian back in fine form and a in a new fresh musical direction. David if you ever read these reviews..thank you for all that you have done over the years, it really means a lot to me personally and I am sure many other.
B003KUSUG8|3.0|As a typical Eminem fan this album was just OK. The production is kind of alternative hip hop pop. There are several real good songs- \\"Goin Thru Changes\\", Not Afraid, No Love and Untitled song produced by Havoc are my favs.

0062119044|5.0|WNTTAK is written in the form of letters from Eva to her estranged husband, Franklin, as she tries to figure out why her son, Kevin, went on a killing spree in his high school.  Kevin slaughtered seven students, a teacher, and a cafeteria worker and as the two year anniversary approaches, Eva is trying to work out why Kevin did this and who is to blame as she recounts Kevin's life from conception to incarceration.<br /><br />Ultimately I felt this book boiled down to one theme - nature vs. nurture.  I've always believed it's a combination of the two (let's be honest, nothing in life is black and white) but WNTTAK really made me think about it even more.  For the first third of the novel I tended to side with nurture; Kevin's mother doesn't come off as very likable and she has obvious disdain for her baby.  I thought no matter what Kevin does, you have to at least in part blame his mother.  When I see school shootings on the television, I think the same thing.  These parents that cry into the camera and say they had no idea their son was capable of killing, how can I believe that?  How can you give birth to someone and not know?<br /><br />But as the book continued on, I felt my opinions shifting.  Eva was trying, she really was, to get through to Kevin.  And yet all those things he did, how can that be mostly nurture?  It surely seemed a lot more like nature at that point, and that was even before the killings happened.<br /><br />This was a serious, hardcore book.  It takes time to read because you have to digest every single word Eva writes to Franklin; how could you not?  In my desperate attempt to understand why Kevin was how he was, I had to read and re-read to try to understand.  It's a fictional account, but that's how well Lionel Shriver wrote it.  I was drawn in and as invested as if it were real.<br /><br />Five stars!  I loved this book and even though the twist is so predictable I had it all figured out by page 138, I still thought it was perfectly written.
B004SUDQ72|1.0|Are you kidding me?! Viewing the Indian Head test pattern is infinitely preferable to watching this so-called thriller. Oh well.....there went $10 I could have thrown out the window of a fast-moving car.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|An interesting science fiction story with a plot that keeps moving and has many surprises along the way.  Hard to put down at times.  Thought provoking.  The characters are portrayed with some care.  This is not a great work of literature, but certainly an entertaining read and would make an exciting series on HBO. . . I initially purchased a \\"sample\\" and it was the opening of the book.  I was hooked and immediately wanted to read on. . .

B000ICLRIE|4.0|Its a decent story line, rushed in parts, yet dreadfully slow at times. The scenery is beautiful and has moments where it is better than the movie.  However, at times this movies leaves something to desire.  If you like epic or long films this one is worthy to be in your collection.  If you are looking for history accuracy, you probably will need to watch something else.
B003XNTTYY|4.0|Am about a third of the way through and this is proving as good as the first book - enthralling. looking forward to reading Books 3 & 4
B000NU2CY4|4.0|I find this movie to have such delightful acting.  The lines are delivered in such a way that it leaves you feeling the person's joys and sorrows.  I find the visuals to be absolutely stunning and actually wished some moments were covered more.  The movie is an epic and is a definite requirement if you enjoy the Braveheart type of movie.  The writing in this movie I found to be very memorable and quotable.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Got this watch in the mail about a week ago and here are some of my first impressions. First and foremost the watch has nice weight to it, the materials seem like they are very good quality (even the fabric watchband). I will say that this is a small watch! I was taken back by how small it was upon first glance, but after wearing it for a while it is actually a very nice size. The back is clear which allows you to see the beautiful automatic movement within the watch.One note about the movement though, on Amazons website it states that the movement is Japanese, when in actuality on the back of the watch it clearly states that it is a Malaysian movement. The movement is accurate, and nice to look at and based on the other reviews on this website I wouldn't be too worried about the movements quality/durability. So what are you waiting for? A high quality Seiko automatic watch for under $100 bucks? BUY IT!

B0034JKZ86|3.0|Disney movies have a long and well-understood history.  They began with serious, epic stories of fairy tales to enchant young children, degenerated to less-than-epic fare after a while, then came roaring back with awesome animation, mixed up with a little believable character-comedy in the Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.  After that, the intended secular message of certain films ruined them, and in others, the comedy kind of took center stage, and the quality of Disney films in general declined.  I was more than a bit skeptical of those who said I should give this film a chance, but I wasn't going to reject the possibility of another Disney revival, if they could pull it off.<br /><br />I've heard people say this film was great, but complicated in its plotline.  I've heard people say it took its characters seriously once again, but had plenty of side-comedy as well.  I've heard people say the only thing they really disliked about it was all the magic thrown around by the bad guy.  Well, I -loved- Sleeping Beauty, and the bad guy in that movie threw a lot of magic around as well, so I was at least interested in what this film had to offer.<br /><br />Now for the bad news.  For all that this movie sometimes attempts to be yet another masterpiece, and does make an effort to treat the central relationship seriously, it's also very much a product of its times.  By this time, 20th Century Fox and Dreamworks had saturated the movie market with unfunny, immature, toilet-minded films, laughably marketed as \\"kids movies.\\"  You know the kind of rambling, aimless, hyperactive trash I'm talking about.<br /><br />The Princess and the Frog had a lot of potential, and much of it was used.  Its main characters are actually interesting and believable people for the most part, and each changes for the better over the course of the film.  It could actually be a charming relationship, if you can ignore the fact that they're both frogs.  In addition, the main villain, while notas physically-threatening as someone like Maleficent, is still a serious and tangible threat to the main characters, and has big plans to do horrible things to them.  He's not a goof; he's a serious, believable villain, and to be honest, of everything in this movie, all the evil voodoo and demons he throws around are probably the things I take the least issue with.  Disney has rarely sugar-coated the reality of evil in their movies, and it's one thing I like most about the majority of their productions.<br /><br />I also disagree with those who say the plot was too complex.  It did have a lot of weird twists, and you didn't know exactly what the plot was going to be from the start of the film, but that's good.  Kids will benefit if you ask them to think a little bit about what's being fed into their brains, and adults certainly won't be confused by it.  It made perfect sense to me.<br /><br />However, I do have two problems with it, and they're big ones.  The side-characters, and the treatment of man-woman relations.<br /><br />First, the second one.  The prince begins his journey as an impenitent philanderer, and never really seriously repents of this later on.  He learns to care about someone, and to work harder, but not to treat women in general with greater respect because they're people too.  That's a moral message that's missing from this movie, and it would really have benefitted from it.<br /><br />However, I'm more concerned with the \\"marriage,\\" because last time I checked, blind voodoo ladies weren't priests.  They don't have the authority to wed two people in holy matrimony, and therefore, the ending really is something of a head-scratcher when you think about it.  The treatment of mere human institutions as though they can substitute for legitimate marraige is a pervasive sin in our current society, but endorsing that sin is by no means cool, especially when it's subtle and unobtrusive like this.<br /><br />With regard to the side-characters, as I said,this film is very much a product of its times, and although many of them get serious moments, for the most part, they exist to be goofy and ridiculous, and to have no real relationships or motives beyond a single desire each, which, this being Disney, they'll need to have granted by the time the film ends.  Louis, Ray, the baiyou hunters, and especially Mama Odie are all goofiness-personified, and this just makes adults feel uncomfortable, because the characters seem to be having a good time, but are impossible to sympathise with.  It doesn't help that some of them (Ray, for example,) get a bit of toilet-humor added to the mix, which no mature adult can appreciate.<br /><br />Now, when I say \\"the side-characters,\\" I don't mean -all- the side characters.  Charlotte is goofy too, but she actually demonstrates legitimate love and caring for the main character, and her father isn't the goofiness-engine that some of the others are.  He's a weak human being, but not in an over-the-top way.  In fact, I found him somewhat likable.  I don't remember any of the other characters really standing out in particular.<br /><br />I guess I could say that what strength the film has comes from its relationship between the two main characters, but actually... there isn't much of anything there.  Oh, don't get me wrong, it's nice to see Disney taking a central relationship seriously again, and they do treat it with all the seriousness it deserves, but I never got the impression that the leads had much of anything in common; not even any real common interests.  They really don't have much reason to even like one another, and the scenes that they have together feel just a little forced as a result.<br /><br />Lastly, I can't be the only one who felt that the near-complete excision of the human element hurt this film's central relationship a little.  All the really meaningful scenes happen while both are frogs, and really... that's a tough bar to get past.  Likewise, the swamp that most of their development occurs in feels more like a mood-vacuum to stick goofiness into, rather than any actual location with its own flavor or features of consequence.  Then, too, I don't really see why \\"last two-hundred years New Orleans\\" was judged to be a better location for this story than medieval Europe, where it traditionally took place.<br /><br />I was expecting less from this movie, but hoping for more.  It hurt a little in certain points, but there's no real harm done, and despite the complaints that some others have had, I wouldn't worry about the evil magic and demons.  My main concern is with the treatment this film gives to romance, and the overall lack of strong character it contains.  For these reasons and others, I'll probably never bother watching it again.

B004LWZW88|5.0|Plot isn't complex or too deep. But it's a very fun children's movie that is enjoyable for adults as well. I remember being drug to this movie in theaters when my girlfriend wanted to see it. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was. Dreamworks definitely put more work into it then I thought they would have for a Shrek spinnoff. In fact it doesn't feel like a spinoff at all, but an entirely separate movie and that, I'm sure, is exactly how they wanted it to feel.<br /><br />The bonus movie, 'The Three Diablos\\" is interesting, but not as good as the main feature. It's just over 13 minutes and introduces three new characters, the Diablos who are basically the 3D animators attempt to make irresistibly cute cats. They're pretty cute visually, but the voice acting (just meows) for those three characters are pretty lackluster. Kind of makes them a bit annoying.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|Pretty disappointed with this one. The story lacked substance and was predictable.  The characters were typical. Just seemed like you were listening to someone tell a boring story about people you don't know and don't really care to know. :-/
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I just haven't found anything in the book to account for all the fuss to be honest. I don't find the author's style very believable-Christian Grey is so uptight I felt sure he was going to spring fangs and reveal himself as a vampire!And as for all the \\"Oh my\\"s and other verbal ticks of Anastasia- she became acutely irritating after a while.....<br />I wouldn't say it is a bad story, but I've read much better, more arousing stuff-I won't bother with the other 2 books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Interestingly enough, one of my middle school students recommended this set of books to me. I was concerned about the violence and grim lifestyle at first, but was soon caught up in a gripping tale. This is something I will read again and again.

B007DIQB50|2.0|I agree with most of the reviews that rate Nicki on the low. There are a few songs that catch my attention. However I find myself forwarding through to the singles. I'm glad torrenting didn't take long..not a total waste of time.<br /><br />The antics Nicki uses are getting in the way of her music.<br /><br />She needs to make a payment on her 'street credit'..maybe on the next one.

0439023491|5.0|This novel series is one of those that you cannot keep your eyes off of.  Catching Fire is the second book in the Hunger Games series, and after I read it, I wanted to move right on to the last book.  The novel takes place in the future and they are trying to make a utopian government system.  Katniss and Peeta were the two chosen to be in the hunger games in the previous book, but they outsmarted the capitol and both won.  President Snow, the leader of all the districts, now hates them both.  Katniss and Peeta are the star couple, and go through everything together.  After their life in the arena, they live in a nice home, with all the food they could possibly want, but no amount of nice clothes and a fancy life style can take away all the tragic memories that they got scarred with.  The two \\"lovers\\" have to go back into the arena, to fight for their lives once again, with all the crowned tributes from previous years.  Who will get crowned in the Games for the second time?  Will Peeta and Katniss' love for each other have to end?  Will Katniss ever see her family or her best friend Gale? Find out in Catching Fire.<br /><br />The ending of the first book made you want to keep reading the series with the suspenseful ending that it had.  Reading this book was one that kept me up into the night yet again.  Katniss and Peeta realize that all they want to do is fight for each other, to keep one of them alive.  With that said those two main characters were very likeable, from Katniss' loving human nature, and her thrill of bows and arrows in the woods, to Peeta and his incredible love for Katniss to risk his own life to keep her alive in the arena.  I think that the author touched on many different themes in the book but one that really stuck out to me was that if you really love someone you would sacrifice your life for them.  That showed in the book when Peeta was striving to keep Katniss alive, but at the same time Katniss would do anything as well to keep Peeta alive.  It went both ways.  Also another time was when Katniss was imaging live without Peeta, and she would never be the same again if she ever lost him.  At the same time Peeta doesn't even have a family that really loves and cares about him, so he was thinking about the fact that if he didn't have Katniss he would be nothing.  She means the world to him, and without her he wouldn't be able to go on in life.<br /><br />This personally is one of my favorite books, and has a really interesting concept that isn't like other books.  Although if you were not a fan of the first book, The Hunger Games, then I would not recommend this book to you.  It has the same sort of vibe as the first book in part III of the novel.  Also the main characters are still Katniss and Peeta.  I personally could not keep my eyes of the pages and wanted to keep reading forward.  I think that anyone who enjoyed the first book of the series, or likes the concept of it would enjoy this book very much and would without a doubt keep you engaged in it till the very end.It went both ways.

The music here is nothing special but if you like John Hiatt you'll be a happy camper.<br /><br />What keeps this from 4 stars is once again we have a case of mastering / engineering an album and turning it all up to 11! Crackly over amped and semi distorted in many places. So many really good albums these days are being ruined from this insane never ending loudness war.<br /><br />Hey audio engineers. How do you get your jobs in the first place? Can't you hear that you're totally F'ing it all up? Turn it down and let us use our own volume knobs!
0307949435|2.0|While this was suppose to be a scaled down version of the original I found it to be way to long and involved for the purpose of adapting to this diet.  The portion of the book that was actually applied was a matter of about 10 pages at the end.  There was no \\"new\\" information in this book.
B003E74B06|4.0|You won't be disappointed with this book, as it is written in one person view. As if someone is telling you the story, it is a very personable look behind the character of Belgarath. If you enjoyed the Pawn of Prophecy, you will enjoy this book as well. This book doesn't dawdle along as some books tend to, it keeps you entertained from start to end.
0345803485|1.0|...because if I'd bought this book, I would have been royally pissed off. 20/20 promoted this book and so did my fav radio station, so I was naturally intrigued. Can I just ask what everyone is smoking? Seriously? This is the book that everyone is going crazy over? How do I dislike thee...let me count the ways...<br />First of all, nobody (especially not a teenager) thinks like the female protagonist... I mean how many people think \\" have not\\" instead of \\"haven't\\" and \\"cannot\\" instead of \\"can't\\"? Yes, I'm picking about contractions, mainly because it made the writing sound akward.<br />Secondly, how does a person to school in Vancouver, and work part time in Portland? If the author is going to write about a geographical area she is unfamiliar with, she should respect her readers enough to do some basic research. And it really isn't that difficult to google a map of the US and look at the Washington/Oregan area. One glance would have shown her that Portland is further from Vancouver than Seattle...<br />Third, the other reviewers are right. All the blushing and eye rolling and incorrect slang are not only annoying, they are jarring and take you outside the story.<br />Those are my comments based only on the sample. I won't be wasting my time or money buying the book. I've been reading romances since I was 13 years old--everything from Harlequins to Jaid Black and Tracey St. John (I'm 32 now, so that's almost 20 years of experience with romances) so I'm just a bit familiar with them. If you really want to see what the book is about, I would suggest downloading the free sample before you spend your money on this so you can decide for yourself instead of listening to the hype. If you decide you like it after all, you can always buy it later. But you may be thankful, like I was, if you don't end up liking it.<br />So before I end the review, I would like to thank the other reviewers, who made me pause and ended up saving me both time and money. I only wrote this review in the hopes that I might have done the same for someone else.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|I'm a sixth grade teacher, and I read this book to preview it before putting it out in my classroom. I'm glad I did, and I will not be sharing this book with my students. There's a lot of kissing and physical activity in this book that is not appropriate for the pre-teen and younger teen set. I'm disappointed that the author felt it was necessary to have her characters jump into bed together when there are so many sexual themes thrust at kids and teens today. That was my main complaint with this book. If those elements had been absent, then this would have been an OK read for the younger teen set.<br /><br />Romance aside, the rest of the book was alright, but there wasn't anything in it that made me want to jump up and down. There wasn't a lot of action, and there were lots of holes in the plot. Details on certain plot aspects were missing or not very well explained. The minor characters weren't fleshed out well, which was disappointing because some of them had the potential to really be interesting. The main characters were hum drum...nothing exciting. Grace, one of the main characters, had parents who were uninvolved in her life to the point where it was ridiculously unbelievable. A lot of reviews have compared this book to Twilight. There are definitely some parallels that can be drawn, but Twilight was a much more solid and well-written story than this one.<br /><br />The reader could stop reading after this book. The story was wrapped up well enough. I will probably read on just out of curiosity and to see where the author goes next. However, my plan is to check the sequel out of the library instead of spending money on it. I read a lot of YA fiction so that I can keep up with my students' reading habits, and I have to say that this book didn't meet up to the hype for me. There are so many YA books out there that are spectacular, I don't quite understand why this one has risen to the top of the pack.
B006XIR9KM|2.0|I became addicted to this game. Yes, it's a match making memory game but very fun. I played last night when I got it but when I went back in this morning, it won't let me play again. I keep hitting the buttons but it won't start a game. I thought there was something wrong with my Kindle Fire but I saw others complain of the same issue. If they fixed this, it would be 5 stars.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a good game. would be better if energy would last longer but all in all awesome. fun to play and a good time waster lol
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Great overall cooler. Got about a 15 degree Celsius drop. Installation was straight forward and easy but had to remove mb. I was able to fit it inside a standard mid-tower case on a micro-atx mb with a second fan attached.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you're into eroticism then this book is for you!  However, something kept me reading besides the kinky sex.  There was a back story to these characters that I HAD to find out about!  I HIGHLY recommend the second book.  It's so much more in depth!
B00701897I|5.0|This is a fantastic action-packed movie. Beautiful art direction and film direction. The 3D is a lot more effective than I have seen in some other movies. For fans of the original comic books, the new more realistic characters take a bit of getting used to, but they quickly feel very natural.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|There were so many things that happened in this second book that I did not at all see coming!!  Loved it!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Well thought out and challenging!  Good way to work an important muscle. A few of the stages will eat your hints that you accumulate quickly!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Heard an interview with the lead singer, and decided the album was worth a listen. The whole album is amazing! They were described as having shades of Queen, Simon & Garfunkel, musical theater and more, and I can totally hear each of those in certain songs. Highly recommend this album.
038533558X|5.0|This is the second Harlan Coben book that I read and really enjoyed.  A real page turner with many twists and turns that keep you on edge, guessing, and reading on.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Excellent book! What a fun twist on such a well-know story. Loved the whole cyborg/human body and interaction between the haves and have nots. Keep an open mind while reading and you will be totally entertained.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|just not very good. my five year old was excited for this game but it was not very good. plus it was a pain in the butt to try and close.
B007RI56NY|1.0|No hook lines. no standout songs. sounds like the band hired a rap producer to produce the rythmn section. Songs sound twee and band seem to have lost their edge. Not a patch on MY PRIVATE NATION or even vocalists solo cd. which were both excellent cds. Lets hope train get it together on the next cd
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app makes it easy to do some reading in the best Book written, in a way thats easy to understand.
B001HN694K|2.0|No matter how I tried, I could NOT like this movie.  It was too weird!  Sorry but I prefer ORIGINAL movies!  Why can't Hollywood have a creative idea of their own instead of ruining other movies by remaking them?  Total waste of time!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|They tried hard, but there really is no comparison.  Don't wait for part two to be in theaters.  If you've watched the Hunger Games, go back and read these books.  You will be amazed.  If you're a parent  concerned about the subject and content, I would rate this book PG.  Teens and mature pre-teens should be able to enjoy these books and relate to the characters.  If in doubt, read it before you pass it on to your kids.  You'll enjoy it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like it!!! ive been playing this game for hours and my kids love it too need more games like it so cute
0439023513|5.0|I couldn't put this book down - just like the other Hunger Games books!!  She has a way of writing that keeps you gripping to the page, wanting to skip the next paragraph because you can't read fast enough!  I bought the set of three, and passed them on to friends who felt the same way - her writing is contagious...you start dreaming and thinking of the hunger games and how to fix the situations created.  They become real to you and anyone who reads them!

1582701709|2.0|I found the book to be in some cases inspiring, but in some cases it repeats the same mantras all the while being, a least for my taste, a bit too religious-like. The use of many opinion leaders (names that don't say anything to me) did not make the book any more credible. The 2 stars I gave are for the parts I found inspiring.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|its really fun. easy to play n u get points fast.love the movie. kinda sucks to read the small stuff but its still fun. good for kids
0446571415|1.0|The only ways to avoid putting this book down in total disappointment are if some one super glued it to your fingers or you were duct taped to a chair with your head locked in a fixed position with your eyes tooth picked open with the book in front of your face and an IV drip of methamphetamine. Slogging through the first 20% of this book was \\"giving birth\\" painful. Plot momentum, story and character development were apprentice level at best.This is what happens when author becomes authors and books are written by sub-committees based on formulas. I enjoyed the other CC books very much because of the CC. This is more appropriately caramel club.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|this movie was awesome, completely blew me away with its haunting atmosphere and tragic characters. this ones going right in my movie gallery on blu ray. this my secound favorite ghost movie right after INSIDEOUS.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Totally enjoyed this book.  It was very well written, interesting and enjoyable to read.  Even though it's aimed at the \\"younger\\" set, it's great for us \\"older\\" ones too.  I highly recommend it.  Be sure to read them in order though or you'll be lost.
1416550518|1.0|I really thought I would love this one.  The premise seemed really interesting and I was looking for an atmospheric haunting story like Rebbeca, which I have seen this novel compared to.  Sadly, this novel doesn't share much with that story other than the opening lines which are a clumsier worded version of Rebecca's.  The pace of this drawn out memoir of a elderly woman and the family and home she worked for resembles better a mix between The Remains Of the Day and the old lady from Titantic, who I kept seeing despite myself while I forced myself to continue hoping things would get interesting.<br /><br />One problem with this novel is that none of the characters seemed real to me.  The book is largely devoted to these characters and the plot hinges on their personalities and yet they all seemed like book characters instead of living breathing complex people.  They are just too easy to sum up.  There's Hannah, the adventurous one.  Or there's Emma, the coquette.  Here's the dutiful and restrained butler.  Here's the ruddy cheerful cook.<br /><br />Another issue, as my title alludes to, is that there was no suspense. Any reader can figure out what Grace somehow can't and I could see and predict most of the developments coming from a mile a way.  When the shorthand was first introduced I knew exactly where that was heading.  If Morton could have used her slow and elaborate pacing and lack of surprises to at least create a sense of ominous or heavy dread in the reader that may have saved this book but she doesn't do that either.  Instead most of the novel reads like a boring memoir of a family. Or like Little Women.<br /><br />The only scene that I found interesting, and which was actual vivid and seemed to live and breathe is the final scene at the party and by the lake. I read Morton first imagined this scene and it was her inspiration for the story.  It is the most inspired chapter in the book.  Unfortunately, one chapter at the end of the novel didn't make this book worth reading.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|The Chipmunks movies are \\"cute\\" and that is what I expected from this movie.  I bought it for my 3 young daughters but found it to be very entertaining for me as well.  In our opinion it is the best Chipmunks movie of all of them!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle and it was a very quick read.  I had been reading the reviews and was curious.  Now, I am hooked!  I am now half finished with \\"Catching Fire\\" and will download \\"Mockingjay\\" next.  Looking forward to seeing the movie and only hope I won't be disappointed!
0345803485|2.0|Okay, I'm going to write about this book and I have to use twenty words and with that said, excuse me, I have to go throw up and fervently wish I had all the hours back that I spent reading this horrible book!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my friend showed me this game and I love it. also to get out go to options and tap the bar.
1400052181|1.0|[Note:  I'm not sure why this isn't listed as a \\"verified purchase\\".  I bought it on Kindle.]<br /><br />You will be fascinated to learn the remarkable fate of Henrietta's diseased cells.  You will be interested to learn about Henrietta herself.  You will enjoy being reminded of the daily possibility of unexpected miracles. If only the book had been limited to those topics!<br /><br />But it wasn't.  Henrietta, dying young, left a large family, each member having his or her story to tell -- and tell -- and tell. The author, inexplicably, found all their stories (and opinions) compelling enough to share with the world. In consequence, the book became painful reading, indeed.  I an old enough to remember those old anthropological extracts in which a smug writer chortles over the simplemindedness of some primitive society in which he has managed, despite such comical backwardness, to survive a couple of months. This book was written in that tradition.<br /><br />The author faithfully records how the family of Henrietta Lacks, the indigent recipient of state-of-the-art cancer treatment, believes that its relative was horribly exploited by the physicians/scientists whose training and skill wrought value from her excised tumor. She succeeds in establishing that they are mightily aggrieved, but she fails to make sense of the grotesquely disproportionate degree of distress that they experience as a result of the scientists' having studied and used what otherwise would have been cast into the hospital incinerator.  The attempts to suggest parallels with recent documented circumstances of human experimentation are simply over the top, if not outright destructive to human relations.  The goal of Ms. Lacks' treatment was to save her life, not to harvest her cells for experimentation.  The author was careless in her treatment of that profound distinction.<br /><br />You'll notice plenty of exploitation in this book, however.  Sadly, the source is this single-minded and self-absorbed young author.  Having cast herself in the role of a Great White Deliverer, she has come charging in to rescue the hapless family from . . . what?  The only \\"problem\\" exists between the ears of the obviously disturbed Deborah, and some less than scrupulous men. Anyone with a heart must feel for Deborah, despite her determination to waste her energy wallowing in state of elective victimhood.  I abandoned this book still wondering why this author would encourage, even aggravate, this woman's helplessness and unhappiness.  Ms. Skloot, however self-impressed, is probably well-intentioned, but, with her meddling and condescension, she is Austen's Emma personified!<br /><br />You've got to admire Skloot's tenacity and dedication, but in the final analysis, there is simply not enough worthwhile material here.  Everything that merits our attention -- the scientific/medical information, and the little bit we learn about Henrietta herself -- could easily have been distilled into a magazine article.  Interest in the remaining material is probably limited to the audience of Jerry Springer. I felt smirched by my participation in this voyeuristic excursion into the lives of Henrietta's dysfunctional survivors.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it was okay! not bad! very long prosseces!  and okauly! you should download Nd give it a try! why not? !
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|the movie was very good, but I found the Swedish vergin to be even better. some things were left out of the English movie
B007V2UGPE|5.0|one of the better games out there. I recommend trying it, its fun and addictive. and I haven't had to use real money yet, Wichita is unusual for glu mobile games.
B006XIR9KM|2.0|The game is a lot of fun the 1st time you play it but if you quit and go back to it the game won't let you play again.  I downloaded this game on my kindle fire and it didn't let me play again!  So much for double taking!  It's more like single taking!
B00785P2QC|5.0|really great... great stress realiever....canny toleave work to play. cant wait for other updates glto hit the market. also this game was great price. I'm completely hooked.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Super Mario and while this game may not be as good as the Mario games it's still a lot of fun.  It is too easy though and a little too simple.  Other than that awesome game!
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Stieg Larssn is in my opinion a great writer.  I'm still reading and finding the book very hard to put down.  My only reservation is that I know that he unfortunately didn't get to finish the series and I know that is going to leave me looking for more.  I have heard that his son might finish the series but how that will turn out is anyone's guess.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great series.  Futuristic - but not too much.  Very believable characters.  Haven't seen the movie yet, but the books were terrific.  I hope the author writes another series!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki really created a masterpiece in Princess Mononoke. The amazing music composed by Joe Hisaishi might distract you from some scenes. The anime world will morn the day these two great men pass away.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game. fast and fun. re-deal same game if you catch a mistake and re play. i recommend this to anyone who likes to play a fast game w/o boredom.
B000022TSW|4.0|There are no special features on the dvd... which sucks, but the movie itself is awesome - the sound and picture quality are great.
1603420398|5.0|I love this book!  I used it to make the most amazing afghan EVER!  Gorgeous photos and the patterns are right on the mark!
B000JIHP88|5.0|Bought this for my 3rd child last fall. This is the best mobile I've ever had. This was one of the first things my infant's eyes focused on and it was the first thing that made him laugh. Even now as an 8 month old, I can calm him down with it. The music is soothing, there's volume control, a remote , and a nightlight. I'm so sad that I will have to take it down when he begins to pull himself up. Right now he's reaching for the buttons on it. LOVE IT!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have watched this several times and  shown it to family and friends.  THey truly loved it.  It is so romantic and beautiful.  You won't be disappointed...
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Initially I was shocked to find that I had inside the box, a copy of the actual movie.  I felt as though  I purchased a pirated copy of the movie, and I questioned whether that was legal.  Once I got over that surprise, I really enjoyed the movie.  I thought it followed the events of the book very closely.  In the book I had to imagine what Lizbeth Salander looked like; I loved the scenes in the movie of her riding her motorcycle.  It was just as I had imagined it in the book.  Although I enjoyed the DVD version, I believe I would choose to watch the nest ones on the big screen.  Sometimes it was difficult to make out what was happening in a scene because the images were dark.
0345803485|5.0|Let me just say that I read the other reviews on Amazon and totally disagree!  and so do the other 10 people that I know personally that have read this book.  This book is not DIRTY it is a little kinky at times and maybe that grabs me faster than a dull romance novel but set the Kinky aside and you have a story that works on the fantasy side of my brain and the need and desire that the two main characters have for each other is what most of us in real life crave!!  Don't let our reviews sway you one way or the other, buy the book and make your own decision. (you will NOT be sorry)
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Richard Dawkins did an outstanding job!  He is very thorough. I think this should be a mandatory read for the instructors and teachers of today.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|When I first found out about this book from my friend David I was hooked I read it in three days, and only put it down to do important things. I'm now reading &#34;The Death Cure&#34; they are all great books, butthe one book that set me on edge and I some times didn't want to keep reading was &#34;The Scorch Trials&#34;. It made me feel as if ot were happening around me I just couldn't handel certain parts. they are wonderful desciptive amazing books that I will never forget.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|The controls are simple enough to play with no tutorial, and the difficulty ramps up leisurely. Perfect for spur of the moment fun, especially on the Kindle Fire's screen.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades Of Grey was the best erotic novel by far. But the saga continues. The highs and lows. This book will leave you wanting more,needing more, expecting more. Men get ready to bring your A game to the bedroom.
B007IQX9ZW|3.0|I just recently tried out Amazon Instant Video and Amazon Prime Video through my Roku after I was notified by the B company that they were no longer going to support my bluray player for streaming.  I am thoroughly enjoying Amazon's offerings and quality of service.  Thank you B for making me look at an alternative!<br /><br />Young Adult wasn't a great movie, but it was entertaining and Charlize Theron was great as usual -- perfect for relaxing after a hard working day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a must have.  I could not put this book down. It took me back to my younger days. Oh how I miss them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|really nice game to spend a couple of minutes playing just thinking really help when I was trying to think of a topic for my paper
B007SYWFRM|2.0|While the game itself is 'alright'..... Trying to exit back to your Kindlefire's home screen is fairly well hidden. That is frustrating, and since it isn't quick (the way Kindle designers MEANT IT TO BE!!!!), the entire loses its appeal. Who the hell do these app-writers think they are, disabling Kindle's native 'back-out button'???<br /><br />Overall, this game is a D+&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; ('C' for entertainment value, but an 'F' for the arrogance required to mess with Kindlefire's native interface).<br /><br />This app's writers can suck it.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like the game....its cute and fun to play if you like to create your own worlds. Which I do. I'm giving it 3 stars only because you have to shut your kindle off to exit the game. When that's fixed ill give it 5 stars.
B001B6PBBK|5.0|This was absolutely brilliant. I'm having a hard time thinking about why it never hit the big screens as a big production. I personally am a very big fan of Brittany Murphy and I really am glad to have found this movie.<br />It has the perfect balance of romance and comedy which you really don't find anymore nowadays with the drama and mushy love coming in between everything. I definitely recommend this movie. It is extremely cute and at times just ridiculously hilarious.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't mind the adds the games make you think but well done simple games. Just started but already impressed.
B005F3XV62|5.0|I have seen better. It was great. The little ones liked it and that what counts. Amazon sent it at fast time.
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|Audio-I got this because I was looking for a finny book to exercise too. It was not funny, not to me. It had a sad feeling. Lexi lost her memory, the last 3 years gone. Her whole life has changed, she's married to a man she does not know. She has a job she can't remember. Her friends have all changed. She has changed into somebody she does not like or understand. She wakes up and thinks she has the dream life, she's rich, her husband is handsome, she's a big boss now...but it's not all that it seems.<br />I found it heartbreaking.
0763619612|5.0|Although probably viewed as a \\"children's book\\", this book is for all of us.  For all who've struggled with their creativity, who have been told they have no talent, who feared what others think, this book is a shout to come out and be your creative self.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app and use it daily. It has several translations to help me in my study of Gods Word to best understand the meaning in various passages. I suggest it to everyone I know.
B00009P1O2|5.0|The first DVD is great, amazing sound quality and great concert. Then the second nearly kicks its ass with amazing footage of Queen Rehearsal, for example. It is also great quality, if you love Queen, or even if you're a \\"new\\" fan, you'll love this and it WILL make you HAPPY! 9 stars!!
0890090572|5.0|It was much easier to read and understand the stories by seeing a picture or two of what was going on.  I really enjoyed this version of the illustrated Sherlcok Holmes with illustrations by Sidney Paget from the late 1890`s.  Great stories.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|i get non stop force closes and cannot invite/add friends so i don't have to pay for everything. run out of energy way too soon.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game to pass the time away. Comparable to Castleville on Facebook. Wish there was a way to rotate the buildings however.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I started playing this yesterday and I haven't stopt since!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!! its loads of fun for every one I would recamend this to everyone I know
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The writing style for this particular book was odd for me, more like reading a diary in places.  Sometimes I felt like I was in 3rd person, other times I felt like I was inside Katniss' head.  However, overall I really enjoyed the ups and downs this story took me through.  I felt connected to the characters the author wanted me to connect to, and distanced from the characters she didn't want me to.<br /><br />I originally purchased this book because of reading clique at work. People pass around \\"ohmygoshyouhavetoreadthis!\\" type tales, and after hearing more than a few people say they couldn't put this down, I found once I started, it was also hard to set down.  Sneaking away to read in between breaks, hoping not to get caught, looking for tracker-jacker nests.<br /><br />I give this book 4 stars, instead of 5, as I can only see the writing getting better.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|really good app, helpful for everything in your life no matter who you are. some things must be paid, like other people editing, which is a bit annoying it does allow my small org to work with it
B0071XO8RA|4.0|As a collection, the stories will drag you in.  I found the starting to be a little slow for my tastes, but with today's \\"action action action!\\" oriented media, it's hard to get passed it.  To  me, the turning point, that moment the story becomes an obsession, was soon after chapter 7.  The characters were well developed to me, and the imagery lent itself to enough imagination and enough skeleton.  Afterall, the best movie set is often in your own head, no?<br /><br />I was recommended this series by some friends, and after reading it, have also become the recommender.  I look forward to the next book in the series.
1400052181|4.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks<br />By Rebecca Skloot<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks has been in outer space and attached to an atom bomb but how is this possible when the woman died in 1951? This is a biography of the woman who changed the world after she died; it is a terrific blend of biography and science telling the story of He.La. the cells that were removed from Henrietta Lacks when she went into Johns Hopkins complaining of a lump in her abdomen, once they were studied it turned out that the cells continued to multiply and grow allowing researchers for years to make incredible breakthroughs in science.<br />Rebecca Skloot immerses us completely not just with the science of cell study but also the life of Henrietta and even her children in the years after her death. The things her family went through after Henrietta's death are horrible but, I cannot help but feel thankful for the woman whose death made the polio vaccine possible, helped with advances in in vitro fertilization, and even gene mapping. This is definitely worth the read to know how much was sacrificed in the process and to be able to fully appreciate He.La.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a Mario knockoff, but not as fun as Mario. great game fun for kids. I let my friends son play it and he couldn't put it down.
B00177BY3C|5.0|A haunting album that I listened to over and over.<br />Not sure why the two voices and unique sensibility creates such magic but it does.<br />Staats
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Cant back out to home screen once your in the game and it locks up a Fire and you're forced to do a hard reboot. I wouldn't give it a second try.
B003JTHESA|5.0|First off my history with the band:  first album I bought was Number of the Beast.  I stuck with them through \\"Seventh Son\\" and then kinda lost track about the time that Tool, Janes Addiction and Nirvana hit the hard rock scene.<br /><br />Still though... I have always had a special place in my heart for Iron Maiden.<br /><br />So, I was amazed when revisiting Iron Maiden for the first time in many years... this album is incredible.  It's everything I love about complex, let's call it \\"progressive\\", hard rock.  If you used to love Iron Maiden, and you love modern bands like Tool, then please give this CD several listens.  It won't hit you the first time through.  It takes at least five times through (as other reviewers have noted!).  Give it time, it's worth the effort.<br /><br />I am so happy Iron Maiden are making this kind of music.  They aren't trying to win a popularity contest, they are making substantial music that requires attention, and loud speakers  :)<br /><br />Thank you Iron Maiden, I'm a fan again.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It was a fun game before the energy bit. 3 minutes for 1 energy bar is ridiculous, you get nothing done at all when trying to achieve your goals.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm super addicted to this game! I plays it on my kindle at work and its fun and easy to use!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote every day. I store all of my notes from household chores and &quot;Do it yourself&quot; projects to my hobbies and auto restoration projects. Fantastic app and program.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This novel series is disgusting raunchy!!!!!  It dehumanizes making love and passion that is aligned<br />with extremism of abnormal relationship love.  What has our society became that we find this acceptable!<br /><br />You housewives who read this trash should look for the Lord in your lives!  Jesus still saves!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Finally, a nod back to the first movie in the series--Cruise got to be a bit arrogant here, which works for him.  This one didn't have quite the cast of the first, nor the surprising good-guy-turns-out-to-be-bad plot, but it did have some cool twists.  Why not give the mask to the bad guy, too?  And the opening scene with the female assassin reminded me quite a bit of The Sting.  Don't want to give away the rest, but the surprises continue, including brief nods to the first and third movies.  Perhaps a bit too silly in places, not as good as the first film or Brad Bird's other films, but still worth seeing.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|What more can you say about Stephen King and his latest work? Except that he continues to give his devoted fans excellent material that we've all enjoyed for so many years!! As a personal note, I am an African-American, and I simply loved how King portrayed with unblinking honesty on just how things really were for my people. Thank God, the Past isn't completely Obdurate!!!<br /><br />Back to my review: while I was a bit disappointed by The Dome, this is an awesome read that is also sentimental in a nice way with the love interest of the two main characters! This added depth to the book and made for a nice ending...Thank you Mr. King!! Well Done!! Well Done!!!
B0073U2F12|2.0|The Darkest Hour (Blu-ray 3D) was a disappointment. Even my husband, who was REALLY looking forward to this release, only rated it three out of five. I would definitely recommend you simply rent this one!
B003O86FMW|4.0|A friend loaned me the first book, and it was such an enjoyable read, I had to purchase the next two in the series.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Nice variation on the classic Alchemy type puzzle game. A little short, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. Definitely a good time waster requiring some thought.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this product and had a problem with it, but customer service got a hold of me and fixed it pretty quickly. They have a great product and outstanding customer service. Don't look any further if you want a great portable gaming system!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|lame I have never written a review about any games but this game made me so angry I had to please please please update... I used to love this game and I don't want to uninstall it
B0074EIQQU|4.0|I am on the fence here, and once again a little frustrated that Amazon does not allow half star ratings for individual reviews, yet does so when taking the overall average.  So, 4 stars seems a little high, but it's important to take this into perspective, coming from a very good band, one of the best in their genre.  In fact, TMV are responsible for almost creating their own sub-genre.  Consider that I rounded up from 3.5, because 3 just seems too low.  I consider 4 stars, in this case, to stand for a pretty good album, a B-.<br /><br />I see TMV's six albums thus far in three tiers, ordered from best to worst, items within each tier of approximately the same quality.<br /><br />Tier 1:  De-loused, Bedlam (4.5 to 5...Excellent albums all the way through, shining examples)<br />Tier 2:  Frances, Amputechture (4 to 4.5...mostly great, very little filler and mediocrity)<br />Tier 3:  Octahedron, Noctourniquet (3.5 to 4...good overall, with a fair amount of so-so material)<br /><br />The good news is that Noctourniquet is better than Octahedron.  It's more of a complete album and a stronger effort overall.  The bad news is that the band appears to be getting worse after The Bedlam in Goliath.  I hope they do better in the future, but their most recent two albums are nevertheless well worth listening to.  They just don't get me excited as much as the first four did.<br /><br />Noctourniquet has a dimmed quality, the same as Octahedron.  It's not so much that TMV are exploring new territory as that their style here is quieter and more spacious, and that the quality isn't quite as high.  Much of the sound here is recycled, and only a little new ground is covered.  What we have instead is solid material for fans who will especially appreciate slower tempi and electronic influences.  There are some great tracks here, and listeners will be missing out if they pass this up.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm sorry to admit that I bought this book without reading a sample or reviews.  I'm glad to know what the buzz is about.  I've learned new things about s & m that I  didn't need to know.  The juvenile writing style and simplistic story line make this an unromantic comedy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is addictive and a great game to unwind after a long day.  i may even purchase the companion game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|i feel a little silly for writing a review for a book that already has over four hundred five start reviews but i just finished it and i can't help but gush.<br /><br />it was great, just great, could not put it down, i even read it at work. there are books you read and you think that was a nice story and then there's books like this where i think about it even when not actively reading it. i think about it in the car on the drive home, in the shower, while walking the dogs. i think about whose side i would be on? would i be as brave? would i even want to live?<br /><br />engaging story, wonderful characters, i yearn for more!

034552554X|5.0|Diffenbaugh's wonderful novel tells the story of Victoria -- emotionally starved and abused for many years -- and moved from foster home to foster home with little tenderness or affection in her life.  This is not, however, a maudlin story of abuse.  The novel is about survival -- and what it costs -- and what it means to love.  When Victoria is finally old enough to emancipate herself from Child Protective services, she does.  She is bitter, angry and has flashes of violence against those who have mistreated her so badly and she wants nothing more than to be completely alone.  But, Victoria learns, to be human is to be in relationships with others.<br /><br />She has a gift of communication:  through flowers.  The novel teaches us about Victoria's complicated and sad past, her love of flowers and subsequent immersion in the Victorian language of flowers and as Victoria finds a job with a florist and begins to create her extraordinarily potent flower arrangements, she also begins to trust and even to love.<br /><br />This does not come easily.  Victoria fights hard to maintain her loneliness and there is a lovely irony in the fact that she is a splendid original in the language of flowers.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this lovely book.  Despite the fanciful title, the book successfully takes on a tough topic and stays grounded in what it really means to grown up emotionally abused and starved for love.  I highly recommend.
B0008237BO|5.0|Been a tupac fan for a while but never acually bought any of his stuff,after hearing about the live hologram I thought maybe now its time to get some albums of his.now im not one of those people who only started listening to him because of coachella,iv been thinking of getting his stuff for a long time and now I finally followed through.anyways now I really like this album.my favorites are life of an outlaw,just like daddy,krazy,white manz world and me and my girlfriend.this album has a darker feel at least to me.like he knew he was going to diee.so 5 out of 5 I plan on getting his whole cataloge

B001AQO400|4.0|This movie had so many different plots and things going on, especially for me after being a tourist 4-5 times in Japan.  The USA and Japanese cultures are so different, yet so much the same, with the daily chores, and requirements, and yet finding love and friendship in so many, and different quarters.  It can be summarized as the human condition anywhere, anytime. Bill pulls off the old washed-up actor to a Tee, and of course, his life and wife of 25 years has gone into neutral.  Bill's expressions on the movie set and in the hotel bar, are worth watching; and the young lady is so beautiful and intense beyond words.  I liked it and the scene at the end summarized what sometimes happens in life.  I'm glad that Bill went carnally for the cocktail bar singer, and didn't cheapen his fondness and friendship with the young lady, nor did she for him, the old actor.  A good flick.

B005FNGAD8|5.0|The second disc is from a studio concert performed at a Philadelphia radio station after the album \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" and before the album \\"Piano Man\\". Some of the songs performed here came from the former - and they're arguably better sounding than the original - while some others were yet to be recorded for the latter. The intros to each track are by the artist himself. The booklet features liner notes by a local writer who was also at the concert and gives a background of Joel's career up to that point as well as his personal experiences with the artist. There are also plenty of nice photos from that period in the booklet as well. The lyrics are not included as was the case with \\"The Stranger\\" but if you have the 1998 remaster, it probably doesn't matter.<br /><br />There's really nothing to say about the original album that hasn't been said already, so even if you have any of the previous versions, get this album anyway just for the extras. If you're a long time fan of the Piano Man, you'll definitely enjoy this album.<br /><br />TT Disc 1- 43:36<br /><br />Disc 2- 58:11

0385534639|5.0|How can anyone give this story less than 5 stars? This was a phenominal book about a magical circus that is really a venue for a competition. The writing is excellent, the characters are well defined. I felt I was there as I was reading this story. With almost 1000 reviews in such a short  time it's obvious the writer has struck a chord with her readers. I can't wait for the movie ( I heard in an interview on book radio that there will be a movie) and I am looking forward to this authors next book. She is working on it now.
B006XBSAP2|1.0|What a disappointment! I've never seen a popstar so hungry for success and yet represent her work with such generic music. Every of these songs was made for the charts, but that's it, the production sounds -as many of Dr. Luke's productions- just as any other successful song of the 2010. California Gurls is the low of the album and Firework is the high note, and that alone says too much, because if the best song on the album has lyrics like \\"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?\\" you know there's something wrong. There's no substance, and certainly,  there's no maturity behind her work. If you want a good pop album this is NOT what you are looking for...if you want generic songs, then this may work for you.

0060855924|4.0|As the series title states, this fancifully absurd world exists as a flat disc, which rests on top of four elephants who are in turn on top of a turtle, while the gods play dice to decide the occupants' fates. Scientists and philosophers strive to figure out the hows and whys of the world (for example, the all-important question of the sex of the giant turtle), and Rincewind the wizard and Twoflower the world's-very-first tourist are repeatedly caught in the middle.  They survive bar fights, dragon flights, magic spells, fires, and shipwrecks, and the action really never stops.  And the sapient luggage is their friend, is full of gold, and eats bad guys, so, there's that.    I really enjoyed this book.  The writing was very clever and made me giggle several times; but it was a little too far on the absurd side for me to love it.  I will say that the style grew on me though as the book progressed.  I have not read the rest of the series, but if I find out that it does not turn into the silliness that Hitchhiker's Guide (which this writing style very much reminds me of) turned into as its series progressed, I probably will. Another small complaint is the ever-present misogyny that the male, British, 20th-century authors whom I've read all seem to have, presented as a severe lack of female characters other than mainly as sex objects.  I believe that, among all of the multitude of characters the heroes encounter, there were three women in this book. One is a dangerous, unpredictable goddess (\\"Luck\\") who's rarely present but admittedly powerful; one a naked dryad; and the last a dragon-warrior princess who wears very little and whose sole goal is to find a husband.  However, it really only grated on me when these characters were present, and since they weren't present for very much of the book, I could ignore it and enjoy the rest of the story.    All in all, a good book and a talented author.    I also recommend the movie of the same name with Sean Astin and Tim Curry,which I believe combines this book and the next in the series (since the story goes a little bit beyond what I read in Color of Magic).  The movie captures the feel of the book very well.  It's a little long (something like 3 hours 20 minutes), but it's worth it.    Trailer: [...]
B003FXXNH6|5.0|This movie has awesome fighting scenes...all the fighters have different styles and are very good - love it!  I actually like the plot too and the characters as well...doesn't take itself too seriuosly and I find myself getting pumped from the fights and giggling a lot too =) yeah on my top favs list...i best not forget to say - eye candy too!!
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Incredible is the best word I can use to describe Florence Welch.  I was already a fan, but I have a whole new respect for her talent.  I believe the DVD is the best part of the deluxe edition. Watching her sing, I was amazed at her effortless control and ability to hold notes for what seemed like an eternity.  As for Audio quality, the DVD is superior to the CD. This was the first time I have owned a copy of the same performance on two different media and been able to compare them directly.  I ripped the audio from the DVD and CD and listened through an external DAC.  The CD sounds great but is compressed and sounds thin in comparison to the DVD audio track which sounded more realistic.  The DVD rip is 24/48 but the actual bitrate is about 950-1000kbps which is higher than that of the CD (about 850kbps).  I highly recommend this album and the Deluxe edition for those who are interested in the best possible recording quality.

0060594896|5.0|This is one of the simplest, yet best books for self-help life change. The chapters are short, readable and encouraging. You ONLY need to commit yourself to demand a better life and PUT action behind your commitment. If you find yourself getting behind, just pick up the book and begin again. NEVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF. Life offers the same benefits to all, it is our attitudes and perceptions that need adjusting.
B007UXSDYU|1.0|Don't even waste your time viewing the trailer. And the people who produced<br />this should be locked up for bad taste and horrible movie ideas.<br />The acting, the cast, everything with this movie was horrible.<br />I seriously want my money back for renting this trash.

B0008ENICU|5.0|Why tinker with a masterpiece? This original movie version of the stage play was remade twice for the screen and once for television and all of them are not just poor remakes, they are AWEFUL in comparison. The 1950's musical remake, \\"The Opposite Sex\\" fails in many ways. First, by turning it into a musical. Second, by casting June Allison in the lead. And third, by adding men to the cast. The latest remake from a few years ago fails by trying to modernize the storyline. The story works best when set in the 1930's pre-\\"women's lib\\". This 1939 version is much more biting and satiracal, the actresses give their all for director George Cukor. As superb as Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and Rosiland Russell are, for me, the stand-out performances were by the three older actresses, Mary Boland, Marjorie Main, and especially Lucile Watson.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I am an avid reader and I have to say this is one of my favorite books.  I could not put the book down and I am in the process of downloading the sequel.  I was thrilled to see when I finished it, that she wrote one.  Yeah!  It is not just a book about love in relationships, but love of life!! It seriously has made me want to do more with mine.  Please, if you love to read, do not pass up this sleeper!  You will not be sorry!!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the way the plot was laid out. The conflict was so intense, I found it hard to put the book down. The trilogy told one complete story. The writer structured the story so that it was easy to follow, but the Conclusion was still a mystery until the resolution. I was able to see through the herions eyes, and cried often. Read these books with a tissue.
B0079XNWQA|2.0|Making music is hard as HELL. I've got too much respect for the work that goes into to talk bad about what's made him deservingly rich, but i just didn't like this cd. The first song Freedom sounds like somebody saying \\"hey everyone let's love one another, you have to love love love.\\" Sorry for that but it's just corny as hell. Not the title but the lyrics and execution just sounds like he's trying to hard to be positive and it doesn't come off as genuine.  Many of the songs come off as country songs \\"living in the moment,the woman i love,\\"<br />he has a great voice but no song on here showcases it, no songs are catch with a chorus that sticks in my head and makes me want to repeat it. I won't give up is the only song that is worth hearing.  5/6 reminds of the old Jason and maybe if there were other good songs on this then I could give this song a pass but it seems like the song is supposed to take me somewhere it never does. In your hands/frankie come off as preachy songs as do many of the songs that try to tell you how to be happy. Overall, simply put this cd is not enjoyable. It is clear he is a musician by his singing on key ability to write songs, his lyrics and blah, blah,blah. This cd clearly ain't his last 2 in any way.
0345803485|2.0|You do know this started out as fan fiction with Bella and Edward as the main characters, right?  You really should know that going into this.  I just want to make sure we're clear on that.<br /><br />I have to agree with others about the complete lackluster experience of reading this book.  This is the first in a trilogy, and Anastasia is in turmoil over the mental problems of her dominant sex partner who can only use BDSM techniques on women to get off.  She labors over what dark demons from his past make him opposed to being touched or caressed or loved. There is angst aplenty, much like it's step-parent Twilight, and Ana wonders if she can continue in this type of relationship with a man she so passionately loves.  I did say this is a trilogy, so you know there must be break-ups and make-ups - will she be able to save him from himself?  Honestly, I can't make myself care.<br /><br />Admittedly, I don't know anything about BDSM, so I'm relying on the author to be the expert; however, do you really ask someone to sign a confidentiality contract and then happily meet parents or indulge in expensive gift giving?  Even for my naive notions of the BDSM world, this seemed unrealistic.  The dialogue is terrible; for a late-20's male in the modern world, Christian talks like someone from another time.  Maybe because he first sprang to life as centuries-old vampire? And the emails they send to each other just made me cringe.  I can see this originating as fan fiction from the Twilight series - an increasingly boring female somehow attracts the attention of a wealthy, hot male with a few personal problems.  In this case, sadism instead of vampirism.  I have read other erotica and found much better authors and plots; the people raving about this must not read much else in this genre or know that it's even available.  Maybe the subtle book cover makes it seem more acceptable?  I don't know.  If you start reading this without any expectations, you'll be fine.  If you listen to the hype, don't blame me when you are disappointed!

B0055PMJMW|3.0|Like \\"Angle of Investigation\\", \\"Suicide Run\\" is a Kindle-only \\"collection\\" of three short-stories about our long-time hero LAPD Detective Harry Bosch.  The upside is that these are fun to read and manage to feature a different partner in each story, including two tales in which Harry informally mentors a patrol officer with interests in becoming detectives.  The downside is that these stories are really short - few readers will need more than thirty minutes to get through the entire set of three, which based on the price and reader expectations, left many of us with somewhat of a ripped-off feeling.<br /><br />So buyers beware - though we have no doubt Bosch fans will enjoy these little yarns, the entertainment is short-lived.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game. Fun and addictive. Worth the download. Addictive enough to play when ur bored at work or ur girlfriend is mad at you for playing to many games but not addictive enough so that you loose her..lol

B007V693YK|4.0|I originally gave this app a 1 star review based on its performance on my Le Pan II running on Honeycomb. However, since upgrading to Ice Cream Sandwich the app seems to be working on par with my iPhone version. Songsterr must have released a new version since my initial installation, and I praise them (in stars) for their efforts, and thank them for what is one of the most useful products in my guitar learning.<br /><br />I also received an email by a Songsterr rep who told me they are still working on the app to further enhance it. Meanwhile, I will write back if I encounter any issues with the app, but I wanted to immediately change the star rating and review out of fairness to the company, and to accurate reflect its performance for potential customers. Very pleased this app is running now. I only gave the app a test run on 3 songs, but I didn't experience a single bug.

B007UXSDYU|1.0|The basic idea of this film is that if dozen strangers are trapped in a basement following a nuclear strike, they'll turn into raving sexual monsters.  This thing is as close to a snuff film as it gets, with Roseann Arquette submitting herself to one of the most degrading roles ever filmed.  I'm no prude, by a long shot, but if someone were to tell me they watched this movie twice, I'd take out a restraining order.

B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I liked this so much I downloaded half the songs and then purchased the physical CD, too. If you're just interested in the specific sound of Somebody That I Used to Know, there's a chance you'll be disappointed in this, as the rest of the CD has a pretty different sound.<br /><br />As someone who apparently can't get enough of the \\"alterna-falsetto\\" sound of bands like Foster the People, The Shins, and now Gotye, I love almost every song here. In fact, I've been skipping Somebody That I Used to Know to get to the \\"good stuff.\\"<br /><br />Easy Way Out, Eyes Wide Open and Save Me are current favorites. Coming up on the anniversary of my cat's death, I have to skip Bronte, because it makes me cry every time.<br /><br />The \\"making of\\" videos on the gotyemusic channel on youtube will help you appreciate Gotye's musicianship even more.

0374275637|5.0|Daniel Kahneman received a Nobel prize in economics despite being a psychologist because he has been fundamental in the development of behavioral economics - which has shattered the neo-classical concept of a rational actor. This book is fundamental reading for anyone in any discipline that has anything approaching a concept of rational behavior. Throughout this book Kahneman explodes our pre-conceptions that human make rational decisions. Humans are predominantly rationalizing beings - which is far different from being rational. Kahneman elaborates a life of researching how we make decisions and what influences the way we make decisions. Essentially, we are susceptible to framing and priming contextual influences and tend to be loss-averse more than we are gain seeking. This book should be read by anyone in the position to determine security policy - among many other concerns. Most highly recommended.

B004EBUXSA|1.0|I bought this at a certain price.  Then 3 days later it dropped by $30.  I contact Amazon support by chat and the person tells me oh you'll get a credit on your next purchase.  It won't show up but it will be automatically deducted from your next purchase.  This did not happen.  When I talk to them a 2nd time they tell me that they will not in fact match their own price change even days form the purchase after being told I would get a credit from a previous representative.  I have spent nearly $2,000 on Amazon during a 30 day period.  It really pisses me off getting lied to about something like that.  They dont seem to have the corporate backbone to understand thats a no go to keep a customer happy that drops thousands a month for their business on your site.<br /><br />As far as the CPU.  Its a mean screaming machine.  Overclocked out of the box to 4.8ghz with the H100 Liquid CPU cooler.

B000055XMF|4.0|The 1979 film cult classic was inspired by the anthemic qualities of The Who for the generation of Mods, the elegantly turned-out teenagers and young adults who formed one center of the British youth culture in the early 1960s. (The film was made with consulting work from the members of The Who, and was almost scuttled when the death of drummer Keith Moon disrupted its final production stages.) The film, the directing debut of Franc Roddam, is absolutely beautifully made: it repeats some of the familiar tropes of American youth-exploitation films (particularly REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, THE WILD ONE, and WILD IN THE STREETS) without falling into the traps of piousness or cheap teen martyrdom to which other earlier films of this genre have earlier fallen victim.<br /><br />The film is presented almost entirely from the perspective of its anti-hero, Jimmy Fenton (the remarkably appealing Phil Daniels). The adults in his world are either hatefully officious (like his boss), shrill and uncomprehending (like his mother) or both (the judge he has to face in Brighton); the women among his peers exist mostly to be used sexually (like the blonde Steph for whom he longs). But his male peers aren't much to him either: they are either Mods to rally around (identifiable by their skinny ties, sharkskin suits, porkpie hats and omnipresent duffel coats) or Rockers (in leather and denim) to fight against. The sense of mass identity (almost akin to that of being in a fascist youth movement) he gets from the Mods is about all that keeps Jimmy going, and the film artfully conveys the excitement of being in a rioting mob (in the famous mass scenes in Brighton) and to make love when spirited away into a cubbyhole during it. Jimmy's world is built on so little that when it all comes crashing down on him there's a kind of inevitability to it: the film's achievement is to recognize the potency of the glamor of Jimmy's world without assigning larger meanings to it. The Lambrettas and Vespas theMods drive, with their shiny lacquered surfaces and complex arrays of side-view mirrors, perfectly convey the way in which Jimmy's Mods prize surfaces above so much else: as Ace Face, the bleached-blond, leather coated Mod idol Jimmy worships, Sting seems the living equivalent of these scooters. (His iconic appearance in this film only enhanced his own rocker's aura in the early 80s.) The closing scenes of the film, at the Brighton Grand Hotel and then along Beachy Head, have lost little of their original potency due to how deftly they're photographed and edited, and the score (primarily by The Who, but with tracks by many other artists of the era) could not be bettered. The Rhino edition of the film comes with a very useful subtitling feature that helpfully explains the thick jargon used among Jimmy and his peers; unfortunately, it also provides annoying trivia (\\"Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876\\") when there's no slang to decipher.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|this game is truly terrible because all you do is run in a straight line and it practicaly does it all for you so it ruins the fun!!!!!!!!

Then I read It, and instantly I got hooked on Rick Riordan's books. The Lightning Thief is a really, really, good book. I command you to read it!

B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My son loves watching it over and over. Great action. There are a few scenes that I don't feel should be in a children's movie but it makes it more appealing for adult viewers. My son is 4 and I am choosy about what I let him see when it comes to violence and \\"bad\\" words but I feel fine about letting him see this movie as much as he wants.
B002GHHHPQ|2.0|Very disappointed with the product; video was grainy and audio was also poor. I had to crank up the volume all the way to hear. The English subtitles were annoying; perhaps this product is targeted for the hearing impaired. I shouldn't have been surprised, when I first opened the case after removing the sealed wrapper I noticed the CD media didn't have any kind of label in the center. Not sure what \\"keepcase\\" means, maybe a legal copy. To me it means the case is worth keeping but the DVD inside is not...
0439023521|4.0|I saw (and liked, much more than I expected to) the movie before reading this, and I like the book just as much. I don't think I have a preference--though the book has all of the extra time and space to say more about Panem society, to let Katniss and Peeta and the other characters talk to each other more, to go harsher, more disgusting, and more complicated places than the movie went. (And it has the characters as they should be, free of whitewashing.) I feel like the film did a better job of making it clear that the Games succeeded or fell on the basis of their having that narrative structure, the final push to the one victor--the theme was there through the entire film, but felt pushed a bit into that final scene in the Arena in the book. But the book was clearer in its condemnation of what the Games do to people watching it, in the Capitol, how they remove people's actual empathy and leave them watching only edited caricatures, easy to relate to story-people they can feel safely removed from but still 'care' about. The book was also clearer on how confused Katniss was at the end. And I like that very much, letting characters be very confused about what they feel and why! Attraction feelings are confusing even in real life, with no death games in sight. (Another point in the movie's favor was the use of different perspectives it introduced, with the scenes with President Snow and Seneca, the scenes in District 11, etc. I liked those, though they fit a film structure better than a book structure. Really, the film and the novel work as a very nice pair, one Katniss-centric, one showing other viewpoints.)<br /><br />Very, very, very easy to read. I'm a little irritated there's such a strong Dramatic Romantic Choice vibe (I'll be over here on Team Cinna, just to be contrary). The story and characters are strong enough I don't feel I need a DRC to interest me and carry me through to the third novel.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|when I first read about this app it sounded pretty cool. After playing it I gotta say it's so much cooler than I ever thought. You get to solve puzzles and play with lazers .Definitely worth the $.99.
B00004WGAK|3.0|I was about to purchase the Blu Ray version but was dissapointed in the review and one man wrote that this version was still the best.  It is widescreen and the image is sharpe and the colors are pretty good.  At 4 dollars I could not go wrong.  I dont know of any other western that has the ocean featured like this with the crashing waves etc.  Wonderful.  I dont have a 1080p tv yet but until Paramount gets off of their cheap ass and does a proper job of it this will have to do.  I love this movie and my dad did as well and the theme music that runs thru it is fantastic.  I am assuming that this was taken from the LaserDisc like some of the others but we need to get the full blown restoration.  This is well worth the price and is the TGG Direct version.<br />The main menu has a chapter list but I could not get it past 4 chapters on screen.  You can jump to more than those 4 but it only shows 4??  Not a big deal really.
006197806X|5.0|Lena chose love and feeling and pain over the simple bliss of surgically altered numbness, but it cost her. Not only did she cut herself off from every sense of normalcy and family she ever knew, but now she has lost Alex as well, the very reason she abandoned her life and took to the Wilds. But Lena has a lot more to learn about the world at large as well as herself in Pandemonium by Lauren Oliver.<br /><br />Then: Lena must survive, but survival isn't easy in the Wilds. They know they are constantly hunted by the officers of a government who wants to take away what they treasure most- their ability to feel emotions and care deeply. They depend on supplies from sympathizers inside what they jokingly refer to as \\"Zombieland\\". And the toughest part of all is life in the Wilds is flung into the dangerous world of centuries ago with no hospitals or even the simplest of medicines... and sometimes no food. But the people who find Lena want to help her. They know how hard it is to transition from Zombieland and that her loss is the greatest thing she has ever experienced. But in the Wilds, they can't afford \\"transition time\\". Lena must pull it together or she endangers everyone. But how can you pull it together when you have lost everything you ever cared about in one fell swoop?<br /><br />Now: Lena's job is to keep an eye on Julian, the poster boy for the Cured. He, to his father's particular delight, is getting the Cure even though countless doctors have told him it could very easily kill him. He is meant to speak at a rally for the Cure, but when protestors and rebels turn the rally into a coordinated attack, Lena follows Julian into the tunnels. What she gets for her efforts is being held prisoner right alongside him. While being a prisoner isn't exactly the best situation, it allows Lena to get to know Julian. Now she feels like she has to protect him. Unfortunately, that might be harder than Lena could have ever imagined.<br /><br />I love that this book flies between present time and flashbacks to tell both stories in the most efficient way possible. I thought at first that these flash-arounds would be difficult to keep track of, but Oliver does a great job of making it easy to follow. It also gives you a chance to see Lena in two ways- the raw and emotional Lena and the Lena she becomes: mature, determined, and not nearly as afraid. It was a brilliant way to tell of a personal journey without having to detract too much form the action to sink into character development!<br /><br />This book gives you more of the dystopia that you wanted to see in the first book. It also gets to the heart of the initiative for the Cure and just how far they will go to make the population dull and pliable. But most interesting was the fact that the rebels have moments where they cross a line in order to get what they want too. It makes them more real and fallible, blurring the lines between who is good and who is not so good. I think this series continues to be a great story for any young adult reader with decent skills. It remains interesting and you feel invested in the characters by the time you are done. But you can't wait for more! Oliver has a knack for leaving you hanging with the very last word to the point where you keep flipping the final page back and forth hoping there is more to the final chapter!een present time and flashbacks to tell both stories in the most efficient way possible.

B006OFN0SE|4.0|A tale about J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) which takes the stance he was a repressed homosexual. Historians and people who knew Hoover vary in their opinions so you can believe what you wish but sometimes there seems to be an agenda involved rather than an attempt to seek out the truth. Hollywood wanted something controversial for a character that is probably unknown to the standard male moviegoers under 30 so I suspect that might be one of the reasons they went in this direction.<br /><br />But that said this is a good tale about the man which starts with him working in the Department of Justice when some anarchists were quite extreme and tried to kill off important politicians and government workers, including the boss of Hoover, Attorney General Alexander Mitchell. Yes, it's true that an anarchist by the name Luigi Galleani tried to mail a bomb to him that would detonate upon being opened. Fortunately for Mitchell the bomb was discovered and defused. Anyway, I felt that setting down this disturbing incident gave an interesting perspective as to why Hoover was so mistrusting of any groups that deviated from the norm. Some anarchists in those days were basically like the terrorists today and the Palmer Raids (basically the deportation of said anarchists and other suspicious left wing types) may have very well been justified back in that period. Just do a bit of Wiki research on anarchists to see all the people they tried to kill in America.<br /><br />Said incident also explains in his later years why he was unwilling to see Martin Luther King as somebody peacefully trying to change the world better socially but it could also be that outright racism towards African Americans was perfectly acceptable. That said, the movie doesn't have issue with showing his flaws in violating the privacy of others (not so much of a legal right back then as it is today) and collecting dirt on Presidents and other powerful people so as to maintain control and his job position. The outcome of the Lindbergh kidnapping was accurate and back then it was named \\"The Crime of the Century\\". Hoover is shown to dramatize or outright lie about the truth if it made him look good (evidence for this is unknown to me per some online research). Overall, I would say this movie did a commendable job in showing the good and bad of J. Edgar Hoover who seemed demonized in his later years as an opponent to the popular President Kennedy Administration.<br /><br />Judi Dench plays Hoover's firm yet understanding mother who supports him in his rise to power as well as when he encounters the occasional hiccup. Look for the potential dance scene with Ginger Rogers and the fallout thereafter. This film was directed by Clint Eastwood. The budget was $35M and so far it's made a bit over $70M at the Box Office. DiCaprio was nominated for Best Actor by the Golden Globes and the American Film Institute put this in the Top Ten films to see for 2011.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; ACCURACY OF HOOVER HISTORICALLY: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.

0307592731|5.0|This book is for those that love authentic stories of transformation. The author writes with breathtaking honesty about the death of her mother, the pain of her childhood and relationships, but also about the slow path to finding peace and healing on the PCT. It is a much more unplugged, grittier, deeper version of Eat Pray Love. This book is one I will read more than once, and keep on my bookshelf. Awesome read!
006016848X|3.0|This books really covers some of the difficulties of generations where males and females did not try to become one another. In many cases the male is typified as being an ISTJ and the female as being the ENFP. This is not always the case, and a good portion, not all of it, is based upon these stereotypes.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|As some have said in other reviews, they weren't as free flowing and the wah pedal was missing but what you get in return is a cool clear disciplined sound.  It was very rehearst which I see as a good thing!  Clapton knew what his settings were going to be, Ginger Baker was great carrying the beat and spots were given to improvise, and the Jack Bruce's bass was fog cutting clear.  I think these songs sound better than the versions they recorded. At least clearer and more disciplined. Five stars.

B000JMKNJ2|4.0|I read that someone described this book as Ocean's 11 in a fantasy setting and I think that pretty well sums it up.  A fun and interesting take on a fantasy novel; this book read more like a crime novel that was incidentally set in a fantasy world.  I'll confess that I never really got into the world that much.  It was quite complicated and the descriptions were kind of hard to follow, but that did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the tale.<br /><br />This story was about the characters and there is no more fitting description than Gentleman Bastard.  Somewhere between a medieval rogue and a modern international conman/super thief, these characters were some of the more unique that I have read.  These characters had the benefit of more education than just about anyone else in their world and yet decided to use it to steal rather than make a living.  This story almost feels like the invention of the confidence job.  The dialogue between these characters alone made the book worth reading.  They truly were gentlemen and they truly were bastards.<br /><br />The writing in this book was just exquisite.  It took me a while to figure out what was going on as I acclimated to the author's style, but once I did I was richly rewarded.  Chapters and subchapters flowed through different time streams that would eventually converge upon a major plot point.  So many twists and turns and a couple I did not see coming.  While the dialogue was my favorite, there is still plenty of action, magic, backstabbing, and death (they are rogues after all).  Even though this is book one of a series it is a completely self-contained tale with no real cliffhanger.  I don't know if I plan to continue the series but this book is complete so I don't have to.  This book is definitely worth the read.

B00008XEOI|5.0|This is definitely the best version of this movie--it comes with professional-looking copies of character sketches, and a book with beautiful screenshots, as well as having both the original and added-scene versions of the movie.<br /><br />The person I bought it from, though, didn't understand that if you shrinkwrap a cardboard DVD box, it will be crushed. And it was. So, the collector's box was destroyed, but the product was great.
0345803507|5.0|In the last book of this series (as we know), a great deal changes.  Ana and Christian encounter a life of happiness together... and an extremely dangerous threat on multiple fronts.  Christian's backstory is finally fully formed and revealed in the process, Ana faces several shocks, and the ending truly shines.  It also comes complete with bonus material at the end from Christian's perspective of their first meeting and stalking, which makes the reader yearn for a full rewrite from his perspective.

0060558121|5.0|This book caught me by surprise.  I really had no idea what to expect going into it, except perhaps a ride in which I would need to hold on tight, as Mr. Gaiman's works never fail to impress me.<br />There are so many points of discussion one can walk away with from this book.  As a lover of religions, mythology, folklore, fairy tales, and everything else of the type under the sun, I was blown away.  The concept of what happened to the gods and creatures our great ancestors believed in, how they were created, and how they live and die is the main, underlying current in this book.<br />Nothing in this book surprised me, just as it didn't seem to surprise the main character, Shadow, either.  A corpse gets a job at a gas station?  Odin turns out to be one heck of a con man?  The digital age has spawned the gods of media, television, telephones, the internet, and electricity?<br />If you are looking for a book and have knowledge of the old gods and folklore, and would also contemplate what happens when the old is forgotten and the new is created with each new smartphone, mp3 player, and car and what it implies for all of these entities rolling around the U.S.; a country that has never been good for gods, than this is a book for you.

0345803485|5.0|This is how I wish Twilight was written. Plain and simple. This first wonderful book ups the ages on the characters, plays with their personalities (and actually fills in their personalities and backstories), puts them in a new setting, and introduces some BDSM and Kink to the romance, while nixing the paranormal aspect and the mindless damsel in distress.<br />Not for kids.<br />I know many men that will not touch this series with a 10 foot pole, because at the base, it is romance. It is a narrative. Early on in the book, you can detect the fanfiction origins, and the writing certainly improves as it goes. However, this book has charged the sex lives of more women than we will ever be able to know.<br />This is Ann Rice's Beauty series meets the movie Secretary. It is enough to remind women that sex is an enjoyable part of a relationship and a marriage, and even tasting plain vanilla, it can still have some spice in it.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|This album is perfectly balanced, It retains the edge, creativity, and imagination of earlier albums, while avoiding some of the excesses of the past.  These excesses were often in themselves quite enjoyable, but not always as engaging as this new album.  Every song is beautifully crafted.  I can't stop listening to it.
0345803493|5.0|This book, the second in the series, is where everything really starts to shine.  We get a great deal of character development, and it really delves away from the earlier writings of the first book where it was following the source material (Twilight) a bit, and is really standing on its own legs by this book.  The writing is a good deal more sophisticated, and it is probably my favorite in the series.
B007QRWFE4|3.0|This season has been very disappointing so far, this episode starts to pick up the pace, but frankly its still very shallow.  The day to day with these characters now feels only slightly more exciting than my own life, and my life is not very exciting.  The new char that is introduced in this episode does seem to hold some promise, so I am a little more exciting about this season, but I'm not expecting much given the horrible start.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is truly worth the five stars and I am greatly surprise that it has not been more widely read or mentioned. I felt rather guilty for reading such a quality story for such a low price. Anyway, here are my pros and, to be fair, my cons as well:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great character development specifically the main character's companions/brothers<br />- Great pacing in terms of plot development<br />- An intelligent story with realistic motives<br />- Great writing style and world building in terms of the different cultures represented in this story<br />- A nice, solid length<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Editing! Really need some editing done because there are quite a few typos<br />- The 'Magic' system is a bit too vague and convenient<br /><br />If this list is still uninformative try reading the sample - that was how I first got hooked! Enjoy!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the entire series in one go having been introduced to this much later. Throughout the first 2 books i kept wondering how the author was going to finish off this amaizing series. A fairytale ending would not have been beleivable and true to the book. How she ended it was hard and difficult but in actual fact was true to war. Thats what happens in war, people die and are not mourned. One breaks and needs to be put back together. People`s true nature is revealed. Coming from a country that experienced fighting and loss and having heard my parent's stories the way Ms Collins ended third book dignified and told the true story of the impact of war on people.

I had no idea of the quality of pictures that Hubble was giving us before seeing this.

There were 8 of us all just sitting there watching in stunned silence as the wonders of the universe were brought up close and personal. The quality of the pictures and the presentation in 3d just blew our minds.<br /><br />This is a definite must buy

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am a woman in my mid-thirties, and so when I first began to read this book, my initial reaction was that it was too \\"young\\" for me. The characters are college students. They are definitely immature and make horrible decisions, but once I got into the story I could not put the book down. The writer did a great job making the characters come to life, and I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened to them. Or more specifically, what would Travis do next? I'm sure if he were a real person, I would dislike Travis (way too impulsive and violent), but as a character in a book I adored him. Yes, he was screwed up but certainly never boring! The only thing that felt off to me about the book was the impromptu trip to Vegas and the reason behind it. For me, that part seemed out of the blue and disconnected from the rest of the story. Nevertheless, I have had this book on my Kindle for several months and have read it three times. So overall, I would say this is one of my favorite recent reads despite the fact that the characters are juvenile and their behavior is at times cringe-worthy. I guess for me it is sort of a guilty pleasure. And in answer to those who say this book glorifies dysfunctional relationships: It's a book, people. For entertainment purposes only. Get a grip.
1572814748|5.0|I love this deck unreservedly.<br />The reproduction of the images - their color and clarity - and the size of the cards suit my aesthetic preferences more than any other RWS deck (and I have most versions.) The box, too, I find pleasing. I keep one of these on my desk and one by my living room chair. When I give a deck as a gift, this is the one I choose to give.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|nothin more to say :) If ya want the Bible at your finger tips night and day... oh by the way try the &quot;read to me&quot; feature...its perfect. Have a blessed day!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent book packed with excitement and twists! Suzanne Collins took the idea of dystopia and brought it to life by using protagonists that we all can relate to and a storyline that does not disappoint. While some minor details were somewhat predictable, for the most part this book offers a very entertaining read and challenges readers to wrestle with the governmental and social ideals that run Panem. After finishing the Hunger Games, there really is no choice but to continue reading the trilogy to find out what happens next. One suggestion for those who want to see the movie: read the book beforehand as a prior understanding of the events and thoughts of the characters aids in one's interpretation of movie events.
0978053583|1.0|Its hard to believe Amazon would sell this rag.  The Format and font design is so bad, you can't read it. It looks like it was typed on an ancient typewriter. The font is extremely small and the entire book is in \\"bold type\\".  It all runs together, very difficult to read. Single spaced, the inside margin is less than 1/2 \\", so you'd have to pull-llll the book apart to read.  Horrible!<br />This is going back!!  I'd have to question all these 4+ ratings....
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is amazing. I am a very heavy sleeper and this alarm clock really helps me get up in the morning. I like how it allows you to use your own music and the volume goes up extremely loud. I would recommend this app to anyone who hates their current allarm clock and has the desire to throw it against the wall like I have done at least a dozen times. This thing is wonderful!
B007UXSDYU|5.0|This may rank as one of the best movies you've never heard of. I never had, and I pay attention to these things. As suggested by another reviewer, I did not watch the trailer. I only read a couple of positive reviews and the product description, wanting to come into it fresh. As it happens, I do appreciate an End Of The World movie. This delivers. The acting is excellent, the story is frightening and viewers need a strong stomach to stomach some of the action.<br /><br />But note, the violence isn't gratuitous as in some films. It's really just asking: who are we, who do we want to be, and what have we become. All good questions. Excellent!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|KINDLE FIRE USERS: SELECT STUFF BAR GO TO OPTIONS AND THE BOTTOM BAR SHOULD POP UP AND ALLOW YOU TO LEAVE THE GAME.  overall a very nice game with minigames , movies, and similar to tap zoo.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This app is simple and effective. Three items for the wish list to make it worthy of 5 stars; 1) Add password protection as an option; 2) allow display of billing totals by month or user-defined date parameters; 3) allow the date selected for upcoming reminders to be set to appear between 1 and 14 days (currently, it only allows 1 or 14 days, but doesn't allow you to select dates in between.) Still, a very solid app. The developers did a really nice job.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was somewhat interesting, but not enough that I wanted to see the movie [I usually do].  The fact that it is really geared for teens to read, the subject matter [children being forced to fight to the death] is disturbing, inappropriate and morbid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My Grandson Todd wanted to see the movie, I made a deal with him.  He had to read the book first.  He said its the first book that brought him to tears(a big thing for him to admit) He loved it and now he's reading book II.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Hunger Games hooked me from the first chapter.  It is an easy, but enthralling read.  It made me download the 2nd book of the series, Catching Fire, immediately upon finishing!  I recommend it for all ages, from teens to mine-granny.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great Game To play with your family no matter how old the little one love to feed the pets and feel responsible to take of the animals
B0069JBKHI|5.0|We have been very happy with this product. Great picture quality, sound quality, and the features like temp/humidity control are fantastic.  I honestly haven't used all the other bells and whistles yet (music, night light, etc.)- but it's nice to know they are there.  My husband travels a lot, so it's nice for him to be able to check in on our daughter remotely via his iPhone when he's out of town.<br />Thought it was very easy to set up, and it looks nice (very compact).
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Caution.....do not download this game. it is very addictive!!!!  it will put you in a trance and you will not be able to stop playing!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Written for melodramatic teen girls with a penchant for boring and unimaginative sex scenes. Or maybe BY one. What a waste of money!

B000002AZ8|4.0|Unlike Vs, Vitology Has fewer really loud songs. The only songs that are loud, are 'last exit', 'Spin the black circle', 'Tremor Christ', and 'The Whipping'.<br /><br />  There is a little more creativity, on this cd. Like the song, 'Bugs'.<br /><br />There is also, the song 'Nothingman', which sounda a lot like 'Nowhere man', by the Beatles.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|only downside is that you need to purchase gold coins. the mini game slot machine is an interesting side aspect of the game. very addictive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm so n luv wit this app very fun and it really passes the time when I take very long train rides and its entertaining for kids alike
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Love this app. Use it on my Fire and Inspire with zero issues. I'd recommend it to anyone who follows a lot of blocs or RSS feeds. Note to the devs -  I'll pay for an ad free version...
B007SYWFRM|1.0|when I would open the game it didn't allow me to go back on my kindle fire homescreen.  Please try to fix it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Super comfortable with brilliantly clear sound. Lows are nice and deep, crisp and juicy for some dubstep. I jam to the Beatles and other genres as well, and all the sounds coming out of those speakers makes me never want to go back to the cheap headphones I had before.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I don't like the advertisements (in a paid app) that pop up between games, but a nice app otherwise. No adds and I'd have given it 5 stars.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|I gave this two stars because it is hard to get ball where it needs to go. No new levels to play.Ball freezes up sometimes as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A good app that does what it is supposed to: provide a distraction during periodic down times!  The advertisements are minimal, seen only immediately after the deal.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire. Just did not need it. Built in reader on fire. So get this app if you need it awesome. Got nocomplaints.
B005UZ1IJC|5.0|My adoration of Steve Wilson brought me back to this album of my ill spent youth. It was always superb, I had just forgotten how good. This is a revelation of depth and talent and brought me back into the Ian Anderson fold. Also try TAAB2, his recent sequel to Thick As A Brick. It also features a Steve Wilson stereo mix and some superb song craftsmanship.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun to keep getting points and trying to unlock all the games :) its it also great to have all the variety of different games

I discovered now that tons of people have this problem.<br />In the way that it is presented, the product is an SCAM!!! They say  \\"Roomba 500 Series (models 535 and up\\" but you have to have the special model to use it. You will find it underneath the robot.<br />I feel disappointed, I really wish it had worked. DO NOT BUY IT!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I ordered this when my son was 2 1/2 months old. He loved it so much,  I ordered him two more. He is now almost 8 monts old and I don't know how I could have survived without them! To the people complaining you can't clean the pacifier or baby, just throw it in the washing machine, delicate cycle and tumble dry low. it comes out good as new. New parents,do not hesitate to get this, it is a lifesaver!

B00012QM8G|3.0|This movie was about a man named Oskar Schindler who capitalized on the Jews' misfortune during WWII. He used the Jews in captivity to run his factories so that he could get by without paying them and build a much higher profit. As he gains respect and clout in the community, he is able to keep the Jews that work for him from being sent off to concentration and death camps. The word spreads that working for Schindler is a way to keep from being sent away to these camps and from being killed, so many people try to come work for him by boasting their skills and abilities, whether they have them or not. His factories become a sort of \\"safe zone\\" for the Jewish people who work there. As the story progresses, we see Schindler start to soften towards the Jewish people's dire situation and he begins to sympathize with them. In one moving scene, tons of prisoners were crammed into train carts--shoulder to shoulder--in the middle of a hot summer day with no food or water and no way out. The Nazi soldiers were ignoring their cries of desperation as the heat and dehydration panicked them, but Schindler came around to them with a garden hose and sprayed it along the carts so that they could have some water. The Nazi soldiers looked on and laughed because they knew these people were being taken to the death camps anyway and didn't see a reason to make their last few days on earth any more comfortable. But at that moment, Schindler seemed to have a softened heart towards the Jews and we were able to see his transformation from a greedy, womanizing friend to the Nazis into a sympathetic man who felt for the victims of the war.<br />This movie, while it focuses mainly on the transformation of Oskar Schindler, shows the real way Jews were treated during the war. It doesn't really show the worst and most horrifying parts of the Holocaust, but it shows enough to let the viewer know what kind of fear the Jews were forced to live in. The film is one of many Holocaust-centered films, and like the others, it emphasizes the importance of this event in world history. Clearly, it is an event that will not soon be forgotten and is still studied in depth today and is remembered by Jews everywhere, especially ones who have family or ancestors that were involved in the tragedy. I think this film is just one of many that can give viewers (no matter their religious affiliation) insight into the horrors that can come from hatred towards another person for their beliefs.like the others, it emphasizes the importance of this event in world history.

B007V2UGPE|3.0|to me this game was too easy. i wish you could attack instead of it doing it. automattically. so I give this game 2 stars

B0034GK7DM|5.0|Easton Corbin was the featured Friday night performer at Vicksburg's 2012 Riverfest.  The rain held off, and the crowd was large for one of the south's larger block parties.  This 2010 CD represents some of his better music.  It is a must buy if you like the more modern country music.  It features some songs written by other songwriters, and some of his originals, e.g., \\"This Far From Memphis,\\" \\"That'll Make You Wanna Drink,\\" etc. There are 11 cuts with a total playing time of about 35 minutes.<br /><br />The CD is Easton Corbin vocal and guitar, backed up by drums, keyboard, piano, organ, fiddle and mandolin, and bass, acoustic, electric and steel guitars, with some background vocals.  A booklet in the CD jewel case includes song lyrics and credits.<br /><br />If you are lucky you can catch him on tour.  He charges more for the CDs on tour, but you get autographed copies.  Keep an eye open for his new CD coming out later in 2012.

0393080269|5.0|Mr. Sharma has written one of those gems that are far too rare in the investing and financial press. I came away not only with a much better understanding of the world's economies and what drives them but with an fresh insight into our own internal struggles.
1439156816|5.0|This book is a must read for every writer. I purchased On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft on the recommendation from several writers. Given that it is written by Stephen King, a prolific writer of long books, I expected this to be a large book. Surprisingly, the book is less than 300 pages, but it is packed with information useful to writers who want to become better at their craft.<br /><br />The first part of the book is autobiographical. There is minimal information about his personal life, but the anecdotes that are included in the book are pertinent to his writing and life as a writer. I believe this is the point; a writer does not have to give a lot of detail for a reader to understand the gist of what the writer wants to convey. Further, the writing seems honest: from the rejections, the doubts, and the disappointments to the euphoria of selling his first novel. This book makes you feel as if you are reading the real deal from someone who has been where you have been and who now is where you want to go.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, he gives the reader the tools that every writer needs in his or her toolbox and a clear explanation of how he approaches his craft.<br /><br />I do not say this often anymore; this is a book I will read again and again. It should be on every writer's bookshelf.

1594744769|5.0|What It's About<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's is the story of Jacob, a teenage boy living a normal life, until the mysterious and horrific death of his grandfather sends him across the ocean, to a tiny island off the coast of Wales, to discover the truth of his grandfather's past.<br /><br />What he finds on the island only seeks to arouse his curiosity further: An orphanage secluded from the rest of the world. A tragic bombing that wiped it off the face of the earth. A town that refuses to talk about it.<br /><br />As Jacob digs deeper into the tragic past of Miss Peregrine's orphanage, more and more questions arise, until finally he makes a shocking discovery. Soon Jacob is caught up in an incredible -- and peculiar -- adventure he never even dreamed of.<br /><br />What I Thought<br /><br />[I am going to have to get into mild spoiler territory here. I've been pondering how to avoid it, and I just can't. It's alluded to very early in the book though, and I don't think your enjoyment will be lessened knowing this in advance. Even so, my apologies.]<br /><br />First off, this book is nothing like what I expected (I should mention that I checked it out from the library as an e-book, so I didn't know that it's typically classified -- mis-classified, in my humble opinion -- in the horror genre). I thought it was going to be a bittersweet story of a young boy digging into his grandfather's tragic past, and learning a valuable lesson. I knew creepy vintage photos were incorporated, but I figured they'd be like a metaphor for the way his grandfather had tried to dress up what had happened to him, to make it all seem magical and mysterious instead of just sad and depressing.<br /><br />Because I was thinking that \\"tragic past\\" meant something like \\"Holocaust survivor.\\" I was pretty sure monsters = Nazis.<br /><br />But no. Monsters = freakin' monsters.<br /><br />This story is full of fantasy, magic, and unexpected twists and turns that totally blew my mind. I had no idea where it was going, and when I turned the last page, I found myself dumbly attempting to flip another non-existent page, and yelling, \\"that's it?!\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I sincerely hope Mr. Riggs goes forward with the sequel(s).<br /><br />What makes Miss Peregrine's even more interesting is the vintage photography that is incorporated into the story. Authentic (yes, they're real!) and decidedly creepy photos are woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding a level of realism and creepiness that both grounds the story and enhances its impact.<br /><br />It's not without its flaws. It is a little slow to get moving. Jacob spends a good chunk of time on the island before anything really happens. But once it took off, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Keep in mind, I definitely think it's mis-classified as horror. It's much closer to YA/mid-grade fantasy. I think the cover misleads people (bad font choice, publisher). I don't think the intent of the book is to scare the reader; I think it's to enthrall and amaze. So there are a lot of people out there who are kind of peeved that this book \\"wasn't scary enough.\\" I'm obviously not one of them. No, it's not scary. It's creepy (which can be attributed largely to the photos), but mostly it's just a fantastical adventure story.ere it was going, and when I turned the last page, I found myself dumbly attempting to flip another non-existent page, and yelling, \\"that's it?!\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I sincerely hope Mr. Riggs goes forward with the sequel(s).<br /><br />What makes Miss Peregrine's even more interesting is the vintage photography that is incorporated into the story.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best series of books I've read in a long time. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the Twilight series, this trilogy is much better. She really brings the characters to life in these books. You get totally immersed in the story and really care about what happens to them. I hated to see it end. Some people have stated that the 2nd and 3rd book weren't as good as the first. I totally disagree. Each one deserves it's own 5 star rating!

B0076D20E8|5.0|Did the Stratford Man, William Shakespeare, show up in Elizabethan London, fully formed, and begin writing some of the world's greatest plays? Or was it the 17th Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, one of the wealthiest and best educated men of the time?<br /><br />Mark Twain and George Bernard Shaw were self-made authors obsessed with that question. Twain even wrote a book about it, \\"Is Shakespeare Dead???\\" in 1905. His money was on Bacon. But his book raises all the questions that need to be answered.<br /><br />German director Roland Emmerich has put together a terrific movie that points to de Vere as \\"the soul of the age\\".<br /><br />It is a parlor game with no real solution. Seems that someone in Shakespeare's time made certain to wipe the slate clean of all but a few scraps of evidence. All arguments are two surmises removed from pure guessing.<br /><br />If Malcolm Gladwell is correct that geniuses must put in 10,000 hours of sweat to master the craft, it is difficult to make a case for either man. Where are the early plays too awful to produce?<br /><br />Emmerich has created a plausible and exciting film that attempts to put the puzzle together.<br /><br />At the end of the day, just sit back and enjoy Wm. Shakespeare's plays. The play's the thing after all.

0312576463|5.0|In Freedom, Jonathan Franzen has given the reader the quintessential Boomer novel. The novel tells the story of Patty and Walter Berglund. It picks up their story in college as they meet and fall in love. The reader learns about their backgrounds and how each person's experiences growing up in their specific families and their parental and sibling relationships made them the person they were as an adult. It then follows them over the next thirty or so years, through two children, several moves, and the cycles that make up a marriage.<br /><br />What is it about? It would be more accurate to ask, what isn't it about? Freedom is about love, envy, jealousy, betrayal, steadfastness. It is about the relationships between parents and children, between adult friends, the balance between work and home. It contrasts liberalism and conservatism, a focus on business vs. a focus on the environment, the value of old friendships vs. the power of letting new people into one's life. It is about how we wound each other and how we can heal these wounds. It talks of the dilemma of raising strong independent children who then as adults have little need for their parents. It talks of the difficulty of keeping love strong for decades, and how old hurts can rear up time and time again, sometimes destroying the love that still endures beneath the surface.<br /><br />Franzen is one of the country's strongest novelists, and this book enforces that accolade. The writing is dense and detailed, as one would need to reveal someone else's entire life, motivations and joys. The reader is unable to tear themselves away from this story of two people whose lives and struggles exemplify an entire generation. Franzen shows that no matter how much each generation hopes to be different from the one before it, members come to realize that human nature is fairly fixed, and the same big forces control all of our lives, no matter when we lived. This book is a masterpiece, and the reader will close the last page, satisfied, hopeful and feeling more accepting of their own struggles. This book is recommended for all readers interested in human nature and how we live our lives among other people.age, satisfied, hopeful and feeling more accepting of their own struggles. This book is recommended for all readers interested in human nature and how we live our lives among other people.

B006XIR9KM|4.0|If you are like me who likes puzzle games and got bored with the same design of bubbles and jewels you will definitely love this game.<br /><br />The Gaming interface has a nice futuristic design. I love the lightning strikes on finding objects of same pattern on the first try and love the bonus screen interface design. It makes the game play challenging with a nice twist from the regular old find same jewels.<br /><br />Works like a charm on my Kindle fire as well as Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1. It is surely a game which will keep you engaged for a long time. Worthy download.
0345803493|1.0|I downloaded it on my Kindle before it was released.  With all the hype I had to read it.  Very depressing.  this young girl had her whole life in front of  her and she gets involved with this controlling, sex maniac.], fruit cake.  It's violent (can't get into the S&M), trashy, just bottom line porn.  Book two and three will not be read by me.  And I CANNOT imagine a movie.

0545003636|4.0|As many others have done, I picked up this audiobook after watching the movie. I had such a great time listening to the audiobook, in ways, it felt like a dramatized production. The story is complemented with train station and mechanical sounds, the pacing of the narrator is just right. In terms of the story, the second part of the book does differ from that of the movie but it is interesting in it's own right. I would definitely buy this audio if I had children and have them listen to it before bed or something along the lines.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|This movie was good from the beginning through to the ending. Go ahead and watch the trailer, it won't ruin the movie. There's alot more to the story than what the trailer shows. Great acting. There's a little bit of romance, some action, and alot of mystery.

I dropped it down a stairwell in a parking garage, it fell 2 flights down and landed on its face on a concrete surface...AND IT SURVIVED WITHOUT A SINGLE SCRATCH! I was amazed. This case is worth the price and more.

1741798981|4.0|A bit disorganized but non elitist and good for those with limited time.<br /><br />I start with the worst: the maps are in the back of the book, with numbers on sites, not names, so you have to flip between the text part of the book and the map section to figure out where in relation to things you destination is.  I think they should just put the map of the neighborhood where the text describing the neighborhood is.<br /><br />I would say this guide was the most class neutral - not snooty, not super low budget, not old, not young, just enough for almost any person who has 2 or 3 days to spend in London.  Shoppers, clubbers, theater goers - something for everyone, and useful \\"top 16... top 5...\\" lists.

B000MGVCFY|4.0|I recently purchased the SACD of this classic by the Moody Blues. At first I was very impressed with the overall sonic improvements compared to the standard CD issue which I have been playing for years.. I then compared the SACD to songs on the digitally remastered Moody Blues Time Traveller 4 CD boxed set, and was still quite impressed with the improved overall sound.. Distinctly better spacial imaging and a certain crispness that seemed to be lacking in the stardard CD formats. So I decided to break out my original 33 1/3 rpm vinyl lp which i've had for over 35 years. I cleaned the record and gave it a spin and compared the SACD to the original recording. Well the SACD seemed to pretty much rival the vinyl in the mid range and hi frequency areas, but in the lower frenquency ranges the SACD seemed to be dull and lifeless compared to that old record.. Even with the occational clicks and pops, the vinyl had a warmth and richness that the SACD definately was lacking.. I could feel the impact of Gramme's kick on the bass drum and feel the the attack every time John plucked the stings on his bass on the old vinyl record but this didn't come through very well on the SACD. So I was a bit dissapointed when I compared it to the old vinyl, but overall the SACD is quite an improvement over earlier digital versions and if you don't have an old LP laying around you will be impressed with this recording in the SACD format..

0345803485|1.0|I am sorry that I wasted my time and money on this book.  Just wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. After reading about 100 pages I still don't know.  The story is laughable, very one dimensional and unbelievable. Not to mention as I said in my title - plain old trash.  In my opinion it is a sad commentary on the deterioration of society that the book is so popular.  Proof that sex will sell anything.

0439023521|5.0|Katniss has had to grow up very fast--she volunteered to take her sister's place in the Games, and then had to survive....<br /><br />Katniss is a strong lead character. The reader is privy to her thoughts, thereby allowing the reader to have a front seat view into the numerous twists, turns, and strategies that last even up the last moments of the Games.<br /><br />I know that some reviewers summarize the actions depicted in the books. In this case, while I'm tempted to revisit the story, I don't want to deprive the reader of the suspense, the action, and the surprises that I experienced while reading The Hunger Games.<br /><br />The bottom line: READ THIS BOOK!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I think its ok. the graphics are good. it fought me great responsibility and it gives me a chanse to take care of something.

0345803485|3.0|I've never written an Amazon review before... but I felt compelled given the surprising popularity of the books...<br /><br />First of all, I read all three books in a weekend.  I forgot to eat for a day and a half.  I couldn't put them down and they aren't short.  There IS something here that keeps you reading... I think that with some severe editing and some significant cuts, these could have been truly fantastic.  As is, while the series starts with promise, the story eventually becomes a train wreck that you just have to finish...<br /><br />That being said, all the criticisms of the books that I have read on Amazon are reasonable and well-founded, including the following observations:<br /><br />- The writing is not exceptional - it's repetitive, uninspired and honestly, the sex is not all that hot and also becomes extremely repetitive.  The build up to their first intimacy was perhaps the most exhilarating part of the story for me.  For anyone interested in erotica similar to 50 Shades (but way better), I highly recommend the Sleeping Beauty trilogy by Anne Rice and various books by Emma Holly, just to name a few.<br /><br />- Despite the fact that the characters are American and the story takes place in Seattle, I knew in the second chapter that the author must be British.  I shouldn't have known that...<br /><br />- Suspension of disbelief... yeah, you're going to need that to get through all three books.  Especially in the third book.<br /><br />- As we all know, this started out as a Twilight fan fic. I felt that the author may have tried too hard at times to stick to the Twilight formula.  There are characters and plot points that were totally unnecessary to the whole of the story.  Don't get me wrong, there are VAST differences in the two stories, but the similarities that are present seem forced and unnecessary.<br /><br />Perhaps the only criticism I've seen that I don't entirely agree with has to do with the emails peppered through the books... I didnot mind the emails or how they were presented in the story - given how people communicate this day in age via email, texts, etc, I'm hard pressed to see how else this could have been presented in the story and frankly, they were often hilarious - but my sense of humor is similar to the humor in the emails and they made me actually laugh out loud.<br /><br />So, in short...  I didn't have high expectations of these books and I wasn't too crushed that they didn't live up to the hype. But still - they kept me entertained for a whole weekend. It's my understanding that the author has been presented with some very attractive book deals for the trilogy from big publishers (this may be a little outdated as I haven't seen what the current status of this is) - good for her.  I hope that some editing is a part of the book deal...<br /><br />I have followed the media storm surrounding the series with interest and I have to admit, I'm intrigued by the possibility of a movie or perhaps a TV series (on HBO or Showtime).  And if the author were to re-write the books from Christian's POV, I would read them - while I did not find Ana to be a tremendously interesting character, Christian is rather captivating.

0446581356|5.0|Having grown up with little instruction in the skincare area, and in the middle of a dryness breakout (which I've never had before), I purchased this book with the hope of some insight because I already use Bobbi's makeup and it has not failed me yet. There are a lot of books about skincare and makeup out there, many with conflicting opinions. But I put my trust in Bobbi's straightforward and mostly practical approach to natural beauty.<br /><br />Bobbi Brown Makeup Manual is a beautiful, glossy, info packed book for anyone who needs to know or reference the basics. It's not gonna turn you into an esthetician or a makeup artist. But in it Bobbi explains how to find the best products for you - without pushing any skincare line (including her own) - by learning how to analyze your own skin and reading the ingredients on packaging that can often be confusing and/or misleading. Bobbi also covers how to care for your skin, including different ethnic types such as latin and asian, and even discusses things you should keep in your regular diet to promote healthy, dewy skin. With, best of all, specific reasons why.<br />She also covers all the basic makeup techniques for each product type (you apply a gel eyeliner much differently than a pencil, for example) and colors for each skin tone, with variations for taste and occasion purposes.<br /><br />Overall an extremely helpful book, it was instrumental in the much needed revamping of my beauty routine, but also fun in that I learned some new ways to do my makeup!

B005LAIGZU|5.0|Five star for the amazing things SEAL members have done.<br /><br />One movie may carry different messages and with this movie, one message alone can bring the movie 5 star rating. The message of sacrifices.<br />I do not understand why some critics consider this movie a propaganda. This movie sends a message that NAVY SEALS is NOT for everyone, that if you choose this path, you may die before your child is born. A propaganda does not need real SEALS to participate in it. They don't have to shoot live rounds, to make things really authentic.<br /><br />After seeing this movie, I have a stronger belief in great men do exist, in courage, in patriotism and in tradition. I feel an emotion so strong, a value gained so great that is hard to find in most of the so called \\"well acted\\" Hollywood movies.<br /><br />.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really loved this book! It had a mixture of romance and drama. So good! I totally fell in love with it.
B004EPZ06G|2.0|The first movie was great, hit it out of the park. I had high hopes for this movie, but it didn't come close to meeting them. I bought this for $3.00 with $2.98 shipping, its a movie that i think is worth four of five dollars, but I wanted it off my wish list so I picked it up. I doubt there will be a third, but if so they need to listen to the audience of the second movie and highly improve how they are going to do it... there is so much room improvement. I would recommend this movie to someone who hasn't seen it yet and has a open afternoon with nothing on TV and nothing else to do anywhere else.

You can only use it on one computer, and without that, only with streaming wifi.  When will Ultraviolet figure out how to get these companies to stop being so greedy?  If you want this movie on your Ipad, etc, you have to buy it again somewhere else.  Forget that!  I'll just watch other companies' movies, such as Universal's.  Thanks for nothing Paramount!
0345803485|2.0|I didn't like it.  There are too many references to \\"inner goddess\\", \\"flushing\\", and \\"he's hot\\".  The storyline seems immature, the inexperience of the main character seems over the top and unrealistic.  I don't think Christian is a great Dom, and I don't think that Anastasia is much of a sub either. (which she admits).  I've read many short-stories that were more erotic than this.  I think that this book could have become much much better, if it was edited and changed quite a bit more. It takes halfway through the book before Anastasia really does anything.  The characters in this book need to be better developed.
0553801473|1.0|Disgusted by the trend started by Jordan all those years ago to create the unending series. And now Martin continues the process.

B0055EDBIE|5.0|Seriously, Lenny Kravitz is the most underrated rock artist of the last 20 years. \\"Black and White America\\" just happens to be little reminder of why he is still rocking out after all this time. His music is like a cross country locomotive speeding along with every inch of its might and then slowing down to bring people aboard to experience its unique journey. This album has all the right elements of soul, rock, and funk to keep you grooving like its 1972. \\"America\\" falls right in line with all of his past efforts giving consistency at its finest with guitar ridden jams and smooth soul ballads. But most of all, \\"America\\" proves to be his most mature, socially conscious record of his career. It picks up where \\"It's Time For A Love Revolution\\" left off and carries the torch back to a time period of music with a message - relaying a messages of optimism, strength, and hope.<br /><br />Once again, Lenny delivers an amazing album. 5 Stars.

0439023548|1.0|SPOLERS BELOW so don't read review if you have not read the last book!!!<br /><br />Wow!  Where to begin?  There so much wrong with Mockingjay on so many levels.  I'll never be able to cover all that disappoints me with this last book but here goes my \\"short\\" version rant.....<br /><br />While I loved the 1st 2 books and perhaps even about 1/4 of Mockingjay is tolerable until the moment they bring Peeta back into the picture and he tries to strangle Katniss.  Here the author loses me as the our main characters and their story start to completely unravel into a big chaotic unrecognizable MESS to NEVER come back full circle to wrap anything up in any satisfactory manner!  While the subject matter in this trilogy is barbaric and horrible the storyline and characters are intrigueing and engaging in the first 2 books and you really think the story is going somewhere with good overcoming evil at hand with being all wrapped around a sweet endearing love story.  Until the 3rd book goes KERPLUNK into oblivion! Where the first 2 books can be read with caution by younger readers (perhaps 12 & up) this last book becomes unfairly inappropriate for them about the time Finnick starts in with his revelations about Snow.  The material from here on out becomes way too adult oriented for this younger audience at this point.<br /><br />Our beloved admirable Peeta that I am sure most readers come to love and adore becomes a completely different character until he has a VERY slight return at the end but by then any emotion you could have for him or any of them for that matter has wained because he never truelly comes back.  The author NEVER gives you \\"THE MOMENT\\" between Katniss & Peeta that is so deserving of at least Peeta's character.  Katniss remains cold and selfish toward Peeta no matter all that he has done and sacrificed for her.  So while Katniss deep down is actually a decent person with a good heart the author never allows the character to completely SHOW PEETA what he has always meant to her--only the audience via the 1st person gets a glimpse of this but not the character of Peeta in any real sense.  There are so many missed moments in this last book I could go on and on.  The author totally misses the mark.<br /><br />The author leaves the reader in pretty much the same state the characters are left--empty former shells of themselves--numbed with no happy ending in any way shape or form.  As soon as I realized the parachutes that came down and killed the children and Prim was actually real and not some drug induced episode I was very angry.  I thought, REALLY?  After all this the author leaves us with Prim dying in the end when the whole premise started with Katniss giving her life for her sister.  Katniss is the MOCKINGJAY, the GIRL on FIRE but she flickers out to nothingness pretty much like everyone else.  She never actually win the day so to speak!  She is in a constant morhpine induced crazy fog.  This is a FICTON book after all so give the readers what they want and wrap it up with VICTORY, true love winning out and redeemable characters not drug induced crazy chaotic scenes that move so fast you feel you are high as a kite as well with no \\"we won the day\\" feeling taking out the evil Capitol.  I mean Katniss doesn't even actually get the true revenge on Snow.  He actual gets more of what he wants in the end.  The actual fall of the Capital is skipped.  If I wanted what could perhaps be anything  of a reality version ending with sad endings and never really getting out of the despair- how about I just watch the news or read a non-fiction book?  I won't even waste my time discussing any of the other characters as it seems the Author didn't either as she appears to lose interest too and just wanted to hurry up and finish.<br /><br />HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY here......Hopefully Producers of the movies will see this & \\"fix\\" it to give the audience something to cheer for otherwise---why go see Mockinjay in the theatre with it evolvinginto this depressing unsatisfying mess!
081297381X|5.0|Whether this book is read as philosophy, statistics, economics, a manual on trading, on Wall Street, or whatever, it is marvelous. It describes life as it is, life in all its unpredictability and uncertainty, and how one can achieve the mental outlook necessary to deal with unpredictability and uncertainty as far as one ever can.<br /><br />It is fun to read the other reviews and see how Taleb infuriates the little men. \\"Theory is grey, but life is green\\".

B007PBKG5G|5.0|I admit I borrowed the phrase \\"Otis and Janis had a Baby\\" from another reviewer. However that is exactly right. Brittany Howard is amazing. She puts me in mind of Janis Joplin.

Best 5.00 I've spent in a LONG time !

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After Seeing EL JAMES Interviewed on 20/20 and hearing so much about This book i simply had to see for myself what the Hype was all about... UNFORTUNATELY All i can say in My Opinion is that This Book Is so bad I had to return it after seven chapters... Now I would have ended the pain much sooner but Unfortunately I had to wait seven chapters and Drag myself through the most Mundane of details in order to Get a glimpse of what \\"Down there\\" actually meant ( Yes it's a Vagina ) .... My conclusion is That Judy Blume [[ASIN:0385739869 Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.]] writes better fiction than this. I Am Guessing that for the very reason the twilight series Actually succeeded .. a Book like this does not need to have any basis In Writing Ability Much Less literary excellence and This Ensures that there is something out there for everyone... Seriously \\"His head cocked to one side with a sly grin\\" is just one of the \\"simple\\" phrase that is overly done ( six times in seven chapters ) I'm only guessing that the word \\"cock\\" is suppose to wet one's whistle in anticipation for the real action of safe words and dungeons and the art of flogging... all are as well basic though if you have never done anything more naughty than pick up this piece of trash i suppose i could understand ? ANYWAY in short my advise would be to SAVE YOUR MONEY and go buy some Ben-wa-balls  [[ASIN:B001SN7TCA Climax Kegels Ben Wa Balls with Silicone Strap]] and a book on finding your G Spot [[ASIN:1592334563 The Secrets of Great G-Spot Orgasms and Female Ejaculation: The Best Positions and Latest Techniques for Creating Powerful, Long-Lasting, Full-Body Orgasms]] For a better use of your time and money!!!

B007UXSDYU|5.0|Loved this movie.  It always was moving, moving, moving.  No dead points.  I never got bored.  I probably will watch it again.  It is reminiscent of Red Dawn, but has it's own twists and turns.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually just finished the trilogy.  The Hunger Games-Book 1 was a great book.  The author pulled me in from the first page.  I was VERY skeptical about these books but my son wanted to read it since many of his classmates were and they loved it.  I didn't care for the subject matter but we went and saw the movie which intrigued me and then I decided to read the books.  Yes, premise is barbaric horrible, unthinkable but this is acknowledged as such from the get go via the redeemable characters.  You feel for them and get sucked into their horrific world.<br /><br />I would not allow anyone younger than 12 to read this book and actually proceed with caution for 12-15 due to the overall theme of the book.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I saw the poster for Troll Hunter listed in the newly available films on another service, and immediately laughed to myself thinking it would be some terrible animated film based on a reasonably good idea (troll hunting could be made into any number of fun films).  After reading the feedback though on the other service, and then primarily here on Amazon, I made a note to myself to go watch the film.  I forgot about my note unfortunately for a number of weeks, but then thankfully remembered last weekend and decided to watch the film streaming through Amazon.  What a great film!  I really enjoyed how well it was put together and would recommend it to any of my friends.  It is shot in a documentary style approach, which is popular with many television shows today, but was also popular back on low budget but highly popular films such as the Blair Witch Project.  Anyway, I highly recommend Troll Hunter and wish it had been longer or if they had come out with additional films.  I want to explore more in the world they portrayed.

0345803485|1.0|Between the repetitive language and lack of a real storyline, I found my eyes rolling and my mouth blowing air with the turn of each page.  The first few chapters held my attention, then my annoyance peaked about halfway through. I literally couldn't stomach finishing this book and have no idea how there could possibly be two more books in this series.  The success of Fifty Shades is purely due to the power of PR and herd mentality. Unfortunately, I got sucked in.  Don't waste your time or money.

B0041KBWM0|5.0|My wife is not in romantic movies as a rule but she just loved this one.  This series is sensational a not to miss for romantic buffs.
B007WBRL48|5.0|This season has been some good and some bad but not much great.  This episode, the real return of Bobby I would rate unamong the great.  I thought that they didn't do justice to Castiel's return and I wasn hoping that they would do better by Bobby and they did.  I also liked Annie as a character and I wish we had seen more of her earlier in the series.  I was a little puzzled by Dean's final reaction; so I hope they flush character development out some in future episodes.  I also hope that Bobby stays around long enough to get revenge on Dick Roman for that shot to the head.  I really want Castiel and Lucifer back too but I doubt that they will bring back both of them.  I could care less about this new Meg.  Here's looking forward to season eight of Supernatural my favorite show.
0060574216|5.0|WOW after reading this I know I was wrong to expect my husband to react a certain way.  We truly are from different planets lol!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I think Samurai Vs Zombies Degenerate is really fun. I recommend it to anybody but especially those who like zombie, defense, or sword games
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so addicting. I love being interactive with characters from my childhood. I would definitely recommend this game to adults and children
B000YIGNKE|5.0|My wife is not usually in the mood for romantic movies but these British romances bring her to tears.  For you romance lovers this is a must see!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was a surprise, wasn't sure what it was about but thought i'd try it. as soon as i finished the first i ordered the second book and then the third..thank you amazon for making it so easy to enjoy great books. i have told all my friends to get it

B003O86FMW|5.0|My daughter wanted me to read the Hunger Game books, so this was #2. I really enjoyed it and I am now on the third and don't want it to end!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|i have 2quell games &amp; i really ejoy them. They get more complicated as u go &amp; they R gr8 mind teasers  will buy the next one that comes out too.  One of the few apps that i have had 0 problems with on my tablet!  LUV this game,
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I have had the watch for about 1 month now...and am very pleased.  I have not had any problems with the automatic movement as some of the other reviewers have commented on.  I set it per the instructions when I first took it out of the box and have not had any issues.  I do where it daily, so I have not let it sit for greater than ~12 hours, but it has not lost/gained any time since I've had it.  Overall, it's a very comfortable watch, decent weight.  I love the canvas band, but I understand they're not for everyone.  The watch case itself is a \\"standard\\" size, not a huge one like is trendy now, which I prefer anyway.  Overall, very pleased and it's very hard to beat for the price.  If you don't like canvas band, don't let it deter you, as the band is easily interchangeable.
B005HSL626|1.0|this game is fun but doesn't quite work for my kindle fire. the first 30-40 sec. are fine but then the screen goes blank. there is no picture. I had to unfortunately. uninstall.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is way fun and addi ting to play! I love it. the only problem is that you don't control when you attack.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This mind-blowing action thriller is one of the best ones in movie history.  Guy Pierce is totally hot (for me) and the story is so fast and complicated we watched it three times in row (boyfriend).  Because of the way its told, there are even more twists and turn than you usually expect in a thriller.  A lot of other reviewers have explained it better than me, so all I'll say is WATCH IT.  This is spectacular film with great tension, great characters, great mood, a hint of horror in the way he's losing his mind, good action, and overall a really cool experience.  Wow!
B006C1DH92|5.0|I think this is one of the better game thus far. My daughter enjoys playing it, and so do I.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Wake Up, + Haiti, + Rebellion (Lies) in that order is my favorite stretch of music ever. One of my favorite albums ever.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy it more than the solitaire that comes on most computers.  I'm a musician and don't enjoy the sound effects so I turn them off.  Worth the space on my Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game! no complaints or criticisms. I enjoy playing it. I'm glad I chose this app over the others offered! don't miss out!
B006T5G73Y|5.0|very good movie. Thought it was going to be a boring, but it was very good movie. I recommend you get this one.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I play this on my I-phone 4 and was really curios if I purchase it for my fire if I can use the same account....I can use it on my I-pod and I-phone
B0061JPYX2|5.0|This is a great representative album of a truly talented singer gone too soon. Amy you are missed and your work will live on.I only wish you left us with more. A Lioness you were and this album is a treasure. I am so glad I bought it the more I listen the more I treasure this representative work of who you were as a singer.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I ordered these hoping to replace my old Turtle Beaches, and I got way more than I expected. First off, these headsets are compatible with Ps3 and Xbox 360.Secondly, these headsets have an AWESOME bass in them,(I listened to my favorite song on the PC and they were REALLY LOUD!!). Lastly, the price for these are a STEAL!! If these were Turtle Beaches, they would cost around $80.00, but since they're not, they costed me $30.00!! Get these they are simply AWESOME!!
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Gideon Cross is a billionaire, handsome as sin and never seen twice in public with the same woman. New York's most eligible bachelor is a man skilled in sex and completely uninterested in relationships. Enter Eva Tramell, a beautiful but insecure young woman, who starts working in the same building (named Crossfire) with Gideon. The minute those two lock eyes, the atmosphere gets not just charged, but ready to combust. Gideon will do anything, and I do mean anything, like following, spying and completely invading Eva's life with or without her consent, to make her agree to go out with him. Eva's reluctant at first since she hides a tortured past that makes her fear Gideon's possessive character, but she doesn't seem able to say no when he touches her either. As their relationship progresses through many obstacles, Gideon seems to throw more and more of his own rules to the wind, in order not to loose Eva. And as it turns out, Eva is not the only one with a shady past that can get between them...<br /><br />If the description above sounds to you suspiciously like Fifty Shades of Gray, you're not the only one to think that; this has 50 Shades vibes all over the place. In fact the only differences seem to be that Eva is tortured herself and rich to boot. Plus, no BDSM kinkery in this first volume, though I believe the second one will make up for that.<br /><br />On the other hand, cliches and similarities aside, this is a very very enjoyable book. The writing, which many readers found amateuristic in 50 shades, is way much better and polished here. The plot twists keep the story interesting and the secondary characters are likable and engaging. Eva and Gideon are hot and steamy together, and I really liked reading about their scenes together, inside or outside the bedroom.<br /><br />My reason for the 4 stars rating, is not however the similarities with other books, but the repetition of the same scene with few details changed, in the second half of the book itself: Eva finds something about Gideon -or he says something- that offends her, she runs away, he chases her back and they have hot, make up sex. A chapter goes by and Eva runs away again, Gideon makes up to her and they have hot sex again. And again. That as you can guess, became old sooner rather than later. Despite that though, I like Eva and Gideon enough to look out for the second book in the series when it comes out and pray for their much deserved Happily Ever After.a finds something about Gideon -or he says something- that offends her, she runs away, he chases her back and they have hot, make up sex.

0140449337|5.0|Marcus Aurelius, one of the Roman emperors, composed a series of writings that we call the \\"Meditations\\", which, however, he had not intended for publication.  As private work, the context and meaning, and indeed the subjective tone of some of the writings, are not always conducive to our understanding.  There is also the time and cultural differences that bear keeping in mind, that the meditations come to us from almost 2000 years ago.<br /><br /> He does focus on much of a general nature that speaks of attitudes about life, his perspective on humanity and his sense of community.  Throughout the courses of the writings he repeats themes associated with his concerns toward his fellow human beings, a large perspective in which we see ourselves as tiny social atoms in a cosmic unfolding, a sense of basic decency and kindness, and a sense of unity of ourselves with nature.  Overall, one gets communicated a sense of profound respect, decency and nobility, and a sense of his feeling of worth for each individual in a cosmic community.<br /><br /> I did not always capture the meaning or intent of his words.  So great is the sense of nobility and duty that is communicated in this short book, however, that one's spirits are almost inevitably drawn toward a very positive outlook, and an intellect that is attempting to encompass in this outlook the manifold possibilities of existence, not just his individual, and quite religious perspective.  I felt quite uplifted and inspired by reading the meditations, despite the fact that this Stoic perspective is one with deep roots in a different culture and a distant time.<br /><br /> Of course, one acknowledges that the quality and integrity of the translation by Martin Hammond is important.  On the other hand, however good the translation, we would inevitably face difficulties in relating to this alien culture.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is such a great sequel to the Hunger Games. Once you start reading it is difficult to stop. This book takes you to multiply directions leaving you with a cliffhanger. Do have the third book on hand \\"Mockingjay\\" as you will immediately want to continue reading.
0439023521|4.0|I've had to rest for a few days because of illness, so I read this book in two days. By far my fastest read ever. I did like it because it is all told in the first person by the main character, Katniss Everdeen, with only one story line and the story flowed very smoothly. I also happen to like survival stories, especially in the outdoors.<br /><br />The story is based in future America after a brutal civil war with \\"The Capital\\", obviously the winner, running the county which is divided into 12 Districts which were the losers of the war. Each year The Capital draws two names, one young girl and one young boy from each of the 12 Districts. They are all then put in a controled environment where they must kill the others to be the only suvivor. This is done to remind the people in the Districts of their place in life.<br /><br />Of course, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a trilogy and I am already reading \\"Catching Fire\\" and trying to figure out the title. This is one of the few books which I have read, that I think will makes a better movie and I plan on seeing it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is pretty fun and reminds me of the classic gather and build type games.  the pace is good and graphic are good too.
B007UXSDYU|2.0|We were enjoying this movie for about the first 45 minutes and then it just took a drastic turn and become a heaping pile of unrealistic and sadistic crap.  It wasn't about surviving, it was about S&M, rape, torture and it went too far.  It ruined what until then was a decent movie.  Not award material, but still interesting.  What was Rosanna Arquette thinking when she took this role?  Is she that hard up for cash that she would take a degrading role like this?  Slight spoiler regarding her role...her daughter gets taken and how does she respond instead of trying to get her back?  Starts rotating on some man meat and willingly gets abused and no one does anything to stop it. If you, like us, got this because you like post-apocalyptic type movies, you'll be disappointed in this one because that is very little of the story line.  Almost the entire movie takes place in one bunker-type location and there is no focus on survival besides rationing water and can goods.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of puzzles. Hours of entertainment. Works great on Asus Prime and Motorola X. Looking forward to the next version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun and entertaining it keeps me from being very very bored. so anyone can play the games on this app
B004YD1KTO|3.0|Grace is attending a school sports event.  Her 8 year old son, Adam, is competing, while her 17 year old daughter Jenny is working inside the school.  When fire erupts inside the school, Grace tears inside to rescue her daughter.  Both are dragged from the school, unconscious.  The rest of the book is narrated by Grace from her coma in hospital.  While she and Jenny are unconscious, they are able to move outside their bodies and to observe the police investigation to find out who started the fire.  As it becomes apparent that someone is still trying to ensure that Jenny does not survive, the investigation takes on an increasingly desperate tone.<br /><br />This is a clever novel, part mystery, part thriller, part story of a mother realizing what her family means to her.  The premise of Grace's \\"spirit\\" narrating the book takes a little getting used to.  At first I thought she was dead, and I was also confused by the fact that the entire book is written as if she is talking to her husband.  As a mystery, it works well.  There are plenty of red herrings and a couple of genuine twists that you don't see coming.  It is terribly drawn out though.  The pace could have been quicker and repetitive segments either left out or trimmed.  I never felt like giving up on it - I wanted to know how it would come together - but I did find some of the journey tedious.  Plus I could see the ending coming a mile away.<br /><br />I'm tossing up between 3 and 4 stars.  This is a very readable book, but ultimately I didn't feel involved enough in it.  I'd recommend it, but I wouldn't classify it a \\"must read\\".
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book... couldn't put it down. Thank you for letting my imagination run wild with this wonderful read!!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was shocked to see 11/22/63 appear on my Kindle.  I'd read the sample chapter and really disliked the story.  But since it showed up, I must have pre-ordered it.  And when I read the book from the beginning, the sample chapter fits nicely with the story.  As someone who went through a serious conspiracy theory phase in the late 70's, I found the whole concept very interesting.  I really enjoyed reading the book.<br /><br />The Kindle format starts with a message that \\"this edition contains a movie....\\" but it wouldn't play on my Kindle DX.  I wasn't too surprised on that.  But the video won't play on Kindle for the Mac, Kindle for the iPod or Kindle for Android.  When I bought the Kindle Fire, I figured the special content would play there, but I was wrong again.<br /><br />Amazon, where is my special movie included in this book?
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like this game because unlike a lot of other games out there, it places no stress on me. There's no time limits and it is a thinking game, but if you get stuck, you can use hints. I'm almost done with all the levels and I've only had it for 2 weeks, and even though I could go back to improve my scores, once I'm done with this game, I don't see what purpose it'll serve.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|I gave this a single star not because of the movie - the movie is great - but because of the digital copy.  In order to get the digital copy, you need to go onto Paramont's site and download their software, then they force you to basically enable spyware in order to download it.  I would really like to know what is wrong with every other movie digital copy that lets you download via iTunes or Windows Media Player.  Also, what should be a five minute process is now a five hour process since I need to download it from a site rather than unlock disk content.  I won't buy a Paramont digital copy again - or any other movie studio - as long as they force all this extra crap onto my computer.
1451673442|2.0|A lot of verbiage to capitalize on \\"The Secret.\\" It could have been covered in a chapter.<br />Why an entire book on the power of \\"Thank you\\" in every and any of life<br />s circumstances.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Absolutely riveting DVD. This is a performance you'll watch more than once. The videography is incredible. Top notch start to finish. The closeup shots of him singing, playing, his solo work -- simply beautiful. This man is a genius, a legend already, and will go down as one of the all time great writers and players. The interview pieces in between sets are terrific. It's just astonishing to see his skills on the guitar. Left me open-mouthed many times. Get it. Enjoy it. We get to witness genius the likes of which are few.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game there is a bunch of awesome graphics.it is super awesome one of your best gameszombies are so cool make more games like that I play every dat
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool I liked it very much and enjoyed the thing but coins are hard to get in later levels<br />good game
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is beautifully designed and captivating.  The puzzles are challenging while somehow being remarkably relaxing.  Very zen.  I've played it over and over.
B005WFWVL4|4.0|This movie explores the possibilities and dangers of living in a society where worldwide transportation is readily available as a means of spreading disease. The assumptions are all plausible and move with a rather frightening logic to their devastating conclusions.<br /><br />While this movie moves along quickly and definitely holds ones attention it is also depressingly feasible and demonstrates how vulnerable our society is to the spread of a serious disease and how thin the veneer of civilization that protects it from chaos really is.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13 but the subject matter is serious enough that I would take care as to which members of the family saw it; it has some very disturbing scenes showing patients as the disease advances.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Mayer's skills are breathtaking. I've never seen him live, but I've watched 'Where the Light Is,' his live concert in Los Angeles in 1977. His lyrics are rich, and many are wise beyond his years. 'Belief' -- what a war protest song. Never have heard lyrics like it before. His guitar playing is astonishing. His trio is awesome. Mayer really cuts loose, goes way beyond his previous work. His renditions of Hendrix's tunes -- this man absolutely blows me away with his abilities. And the guy is only 34 as of this writing. The last thing he wants is to be labeled as 'pop.' That does him a huge injustice. We're witnessing a legend -- already, and if we're lucky, we have him with us for a lot of years to come. He's intent on changing and growing, never satisfied. Stay witness to his work. We see few of his genius. Any of his work is worth having. Whatever God or gods there are, I gave thanks to them for the gift of John Mayer.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like this game. its fun but it would be better if it gad it to where you could do the fighting. all in all its a good game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really love this game! Just wish it didn't have to reload in energy so much other than that I think it's fun.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I bought the paid version for my Kindle Fire and LG Optimus T.  Works fine on the Fire but forces close on my phone every time I open the app.  Uninstalling on the phone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is so cool. Its a fun game with a few mini-games throughout. My only problem with it is that you have to go to options to get out. But, compared to the ups of the game, it is very minor.
0345803485|1.0|That's a couple hours of my life that I will never get back.  I can't believe I PAID for this book.  Does anyone know if it's possible to ask<br />for a refund on something you bought on Kindle?  Curse you, Matt Lauer, for giving this woman air time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not much of a book reader, but everyone was talking about this book so much that I could not resist.  I bought it through my phone, and using the kindle app, I started reading it during my breaks at work.  I did not want to stop reading, I think I even started work late too because it was that good.  When I got home, I finished the rest of the book on my ipad.  I am not going to say what it is about, but it is worth what I paid for and then some.  I have yet to see the movie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Finally, a platformer for my Kindle! I just love it! I stomp monsters and throw projectiles at them! Get it, and save your gold!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great graphics, challenging boards, and a fun story to follow :) Mah jong in so many different symbols - I'm having a blast!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fantastic to play while watching Tv. good to fill the commercials<br />I love the face book integration as well
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a classic side scrolling defense game.  the graphics are good, the controls are ok.  overall not a bad waste of time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I play 24 7 I recommend this game to you I tolttlay love it play it dream it and if I could eat is. ligoey wonderful game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|a lot of fun reminds me of &quot;Mario Brothers&quot; except  easier. i think all ages would enjoy playing this game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun, entertaining game with some interactive games within it, and some clips starring the characters from the movie. great deal for free!
0156012197|1.0|This review is actually from Richard Howard's (hardcover) attempt to improve an already perfect story.  I was telling someone about &#34;The Little Prince&#34; about a year after I first read it in the 70s. It wasn't until then that I realized the much deeper messages this book offered. I went home and read the book a second time. It was truly magical. From the very first page I felt like I was a child sitting in my father's lap while he narrated &#34;his&#34; story to me. The syntax was slightly different than what I was used to, but so perfectly fit the story that I soon looked forward to &#34;hearing&#34; more.  The Little Prince left such a memorable impression on my life that I decided to purchase this latest edition for my granddaughter's 9th birthday. My hope was that she, too, would understand the deeper meanings woven throughout the story because, well, she IS a child.  I went to bed early one night and decided to browse through this edition that was a different color than the one I enjoyed. I immediately noticed that the dedication to Leon Werth was different. It didn't &#34;feel&#34; the same as the one I remember. I was disappointed. I became even more upset as I read the first chapter. I no longer felt like I was a child sitting in my father's lap while he narrated &#34;his&#34; story to me. This story felt more like it was being &#34;phoned&#34; in.  A few minutes ago I gathered together the wrapping paper, scissors and tape to wrap the gift from Papa Rick. The entire time I was cutting the gift wrap to fit the book, something deep within me kept reminding me, &#34;This is NOT the same story I remember reading. This is NOT the same book. This book doesn't FEEL right!&#34; I decided to check one more thing: how this &#34;updated&#34; edition interpreted the secret from the fox, a passage that I have often quoted from memory. Once again, the &#34;new&#34; translation missed the point. The secret was watered down. The meaning had somehow changed. &#34;Superficial&#34;, &#34;shallow&#34; and &#34;sterilized&#34; comes to mind. That's when I got so &#34;p.o'd&#34; that I decided NOT to gift this book to my granddaughter.  I purchased the edition that remains dear to my heart and soul, the one translated by Katherine Woods, and gave that copy to my granddaughter.  Nothing personal, Mr. Howard, but attempting to improve something that's already perfect is like peeing into the wind: You might get some temporary relief, but you'll soon have more problems coming right back at you.  This Little Prince's next stop is called &#34;Craigslist&#34;.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I thought it was fun to go through all the levels. I enjoined it a lot, but I could never find out how to get the mini-game to start.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|There are a good amount of stations that don't participate with this app, so that sux.  Other than that this is awesome.
0345803485|1.0|Dont get me wrong I love reading a trashy romance novel, but this was just badly written.  I could not get past that!  It was a interesting story line, but the main character was a bit to creepy for my taste.  There has to better erotica writters out there.
0985114606|5.0|I read this in 11 hours yesterday. I took it with me everywhere. Really helped me pass the time waiting in my doctor's office. As much as I love 50 Shades of Grey, BARED TO YOU got to me. I can't stop thinking about these characters. Sylvia Day has created a hero and heroine that seem all too real. I love Gideon's vulnerability and Eva's strength. I do like Eva better than Ana because she actually stands up to Gideon when she has to. Ms. Day, please don't make us wait too long for DEEPER IN YOU!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Omg these books are amazing!!! If you are a person who's into books with lots of action, and suspense (oh definitely suspense!), then this series is PERFECT for you! It's also really convenient how you can buy all three books in one purchase, for a hard-to-beat price, that saves you at least 30 dollars from what the hardcover price would be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great, easy, entertaining read ... didn't appreciate the story line until I started reading the book, I was hooked with in a few pages and now can't put it down. Into the 2nd book and and pins and needles to find out how the story ends.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its awesomei just love this game. this is an awesome samurai zombie game. I I I Inigo I I I I I I I I i
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love playing this game my family loves it an it a good game for the kids. try it and you'll like it
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a pretty fun game and definitely worth a download. It is a simple game but really fun. So far so good.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I really enjoyed this set.  I initially purchased the set after seeing the first season of Game of Thrones on HBO.  Loved it so much, had to read it...lol.  I did not give it 5 stars because, at times, the names and places can get a bit tedious.  There are so many characters and places (all of which are unusual) that it can be hard to remember them all.  So at times, I'd be reading and unaware of who, or where, I was reading about.  Aside from that, love this story.  I'm currently reading book 5 and can't wait to see how this all ends.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is an awesome game that is hard to play at first but after the first zombie waves it is easier to understand.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|i really like this game i very much reccomend it to any age 8 and up not that it is that gory just takes a small bit of skill to pick your skills
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Great game, but I wish I could figure out a way to keep my genius 9 yr old kid from figuring out my passwords so he'll stop ordering games when I'm not looking.He loves the bright colors, it keeps him busy.
B006XIR9KM|3.0|Why in the world would you make it more difficult to match sets on easy level? Developers made the blocks move so you can't memorize where they were, no game just a frustrating experience, I don't even know why I gave 3 stars except graphics are good- but no to the game
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|angry birds is a fun app if u play to long it gets boring u should play it though ok
B007SYWFRM|5.0|loveee it .. need more thing to keep u occupied...more ways to get coins also..and acorns so u can buy animals
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I loved the set. It had many more things in the box. I have always loved the Sound of Music and will enjoy this set.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not actually listing 50 reasons to enjoy this book, however, I will simply say this subject matter is not for everybody.  I happened to enjoy the explicit erotic exploits the characters explored with one another.  For that alone, I give it 5 stars.  It was intriguing to ponder about the 50 shades of the character Christian Grey.  I am anxious to find out more about his dark and twisted background.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I have loved this movie since when I first saw in on cable. I was way to young to see it in the theatre. My being born in 1972. Even if I did see it at 4 I would be scared out of my wits!!! Also I would not be let to see it because of the nudity it has in the beginning.<br />However seeing it in my teens, I saw it as a horror flick and a good suspenseful movie. Then in recent years I realized how well all the elements presented here are breathtaking. Elements such as direction, acting, setting, music, cinematography. I feel it is a movie that you need to see over again to really grasp the chemistry of all that. Here the direction is such that one slip up and you do not get the right feel and tempo, especially during the prom scene. That famous scene, where the building up of the blood spill is very much Hitchcock worthy. Music cues lighting, it all is just wonderful!!!<br />It is one of the very few times where you are rooting for the monster/villain. I find it hard to categorize this film as horror. In my adult years I see it more of a Psychological Thriller.<br />It is also surprising of the oscar nods Laurie and Spacek received. A true rare in a \\"Horror\\" film. I do wonder if Hitchcock saw this movie and if he did what he thought about it.<br /><br />A lot of people around think I am crazy for liking this movie. I tell them it is like a paining you see in an art gallery. One likes it, one hates it, one has a single word for it and one has a thousand. To me this movie holds a million!<br /><br />Foot note:<br />If you ever come across the soundtrack and you love the movie as much as I do get it. I ordered mine here on Amazon. I must tell you the tracks are very well engineered! They are true to the film. It is a masterpiece, and wonderful addition to my library.

0307593312|5.0|When sitting down to begin reviewing this novel, many conflicting opinions and ideas have flown through my mind. On a technical level, this book almost fails: the translation can be rough, the plot is often slow and tends to drag, and the characters seem unrealistic and detached. If we were going off of that purely basic merit, I'd probably give this book 3 stars, maybe 3 and 1/2 because I consider myself a Murakami fan. But, in the end, I cannot do that, because, against all odds, the whole of this novel is much greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is about two people living in Tokyo, 1984. Aomame is a powerful, liberated woman who delivers justice in her own vigilante style. The other, a reticent genius named Tengo Kawana, is involved in a controversial behind-closed-doors deal to ghost write a novel. These plots seem to be totally unrelated, but over the course of the year 1984, Tengo and Aomame's paths cross, and maybe not just for the first time.<br /><br />When you read that summary, however, worry probably comes to your mind. The first seems decently interesting, but doesn't the second one come off as kind of... I don't know, bookish and academic? Unfortunately, yes. And, to be honest, Tengo's story line is probably the backbone of the novel: most of the mysteries stem from that one and a lot of the action occurs involving it. Often times, over the course of the novels 3 long \\"Books\\", or sections, the plot seems to drag as the narrative jumps through time to describe even the most minute details. The pace can be deadly.<br /><br />However, as fatal as it feels while reading it, looking back from the end of the novel, the slow movement sort of makes sense. Murakami deftly covers all the small, seemingly unimportant things the exact same way he covers the monumental, the magical, and the life changing. The narratorial voice is definitely detached throughout the novel, but it needs to be that way to present some of the more fantastical and surreal elements in such a wholly realistic way. The presentation of these elements is so powerful that it will have you searching the world around you for evidence of its existence. Beautiful.<br /><br />The Translation, however, can be quite *wonky*. I don't know how else to describe it. The book was translated by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel. Jay Rubin has translated a surplus of Murakami's other work, so I'm inclined to believe that it was Mr. Gabriel who dropped the ball a bit. Nothing major, it's just that here and there, sentences get awkward and often fall into the classic \\"Subject-Verb-Object\\" style of sentence. This isn't gramatically incorrect or unclear, however, it does make the dialogue sound stilted and the descriptions to sometimes be overblown and almost campy or mock-literary.<br /><br />A note to potential readers: this book is explicit. When I say \\"explicit\\", I mean it heavily feautres rape, incest, gratuitous sex, lots of description of genitalia, violence, some mild drug use, and, of course, some language. Wow. That's a long list! But, as a 17 year old male, I'm not too too offended by the inclusion of this. In fact, some scenes had me smiling at the outright gall of Murakami to include what he did in this book, and not only throw it in for the purpose of being racy, or to just develop a theme, but to actually create and strengthen a plot thread. Murakami is one of the only authors I've read that can marry despicable violence with the commonplace beauty of butterflies and kind words.<br /><br />This is a monstrous novel. The first edition, hardcover copy (which I assume most people will be reading until the three-book paperback box set comes out-- which I will be purchasing) is 925 pages long. In my opinion, this story could have been told in 100-200 pages less. During the first \\"Book\\", the length really bugged me. But at a certain point during Book 2, right after one of the most climatic and intense scenes in Murakami's opera, I kind of just settled into the story and let it take me where I wanted to go. Patterns emerge, irony and parallelism surface, and everything falls to the beat of the drum. (\\"Ho, Ho\\" as the Little People say.)<br /><br />One final thing that I find particularly extra-ordinary about this book is that it not only confused the heck out of me, but then it proceeded to clarify things and generally increase the range of my thought process. This is very deep, philosophical, mind-expanding stuff-- if you let it be. Once you get yourself into this book, truly fold yourself between its sentences and wrap yourself in the blanket of the plot, the deep stuff starts coming to you and you'll be wondering about Cat Towns, Little People, Two Moons, Cults, and everything else in this novel.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, in spite of all the craziness, this novel is a love story about two people searching for each other in today's hectic modern world (errr-- well, the modern world of 1984, but its close enough!). The Theme is vast and expansive, but there is something for everyone to relate to here.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would like to share with you an episode form my life. I have a friend who is also my age and loves to read, and we often discuss modern literature. She, a huge Victorian fan, feels that it's kind of going downhill. I tend to be more modern in my tastes, but for a while, I understood what she was saying. However, 1Q84 has actually started to change my mind on the subject. Murakmi has such a powerful sense of interlinking and parallellism, ironic situations, metaphors, and over-arching allegories.<br /><br />Let yourself get lost in this novel. If you hate it, I'm truly sorry. But try not to focus on the bad stuff... the technical level failures-- anyone can screw those up. Instead, I encourage you to get excited and happy about the good things this book has to offer: the powerful mythos, the advanced literary techniques, and hope for the future of literature as a whole. Murakami for the Nobel Prize! Woooo! (okay, I'm getting a little ahead of myself here.)<br /><br />Like I said earlier: If I was basing this off of the little things in the book, this review would be about 3 stars. But, my personal response to this book has been amazingly positive. Halfway through it, I went out and bought a second copy so I could keep it nice on my shelf for years to come. It's that kind of book-- lasting. And because it fights so hard to do what it wants, because it made me feel amazing while I read it, and because it's highs are so much better than it's lows are worse, I couldn't give this book anything but 5 Stars.<br /><br />A lot of people will dislike this book, but that's okay. Because those who do like it, will like it a lot. Just for the chance to like something as much as I enjoy this novel, I encourage you to try this book.

1594202842|4.0|This is a slightly amusing account of a type A mother trying to manipulate her daughters lives to get them to do something she feels is important (piano and violin). She tries to blame her over-zealousness on her Chinese heritage.  In one sense its amusing to watch some other parent go through the painful process of trying to prove that their child is the next Mozart, Einstein, etc.  On the other hand, its slightly horrifying to think that parents like like this actually exist and aren't just in movies and stereotypes.  You do have to have to hand it to Amy Chua for laying her life out there.  I'm sure she realized she'd be getting ridiculed before she published, and she felt strongly enough to still do it.<br /><br />The bottom line:  If you're interested due to the hype, go ahead and read it.  If you don't read it, I don't think you're life will be any poorer, and I'm sure you won't miss any child rearing secrets you didn't know.  I did the audio version, which Ms. Chua reads herself.  She has a pleasent reading voice, which I found enjoyable.<br /><br />Now the comments:<br /><br />I was running around telling my kids \\"You should be glad that I'm your father and not this lady....\\" Compared to Amy Chua, I'm not a tiger mother.  I'm more like a bobcat mother.  A's are required, but we will take an A- if we have to.  There is no question about them taking all levels of calculus, chemistry and physics in highschool.  It's a given.  I've told my kids  their first (college) degree must be technical. You can always move down the brain chain, but its very hard to move up.  They all learned to play a musical instrument.  We also push sports at our house, no fat lazy couch potatos that pass for kids these days.<br /><br />BUT....I have to wonder....What is Amy Chua afraid of?  Why push your kids that hard? ...and is she willing to get out there and do the work herself.  My dad always told me he would never ask me to do something he wouldn't do himself.  I could see it, I knew it was true, and I practice the same with my kids.  I'm their teacher, but I'm also their competitor.  With all that time going into music, I never got the sense that Amy Chua learned to play the piano or the violin. I don't get the feeling that Amy Chua led by example.  That's not how you get your troops to respect you.<br /><br />I wonder if we would have ever heard this tale had her daughter not made it to Carnegie Hall.  For all those parents whose kids didn't make it to Carnegie Hall, did they realize the sun would still come up in the morning?  I'm not saying don't aspire, don't work hard.  I am saying that Amy Chua has something else driving her other than her Chinese heritage, and she's trying to instantiate it via her kids.<br /><br />Finally, I got the sense that Chua seemed to have the mentality of crushing boulders with tack hammers.  I'm not sure that if practicing something once is good, then practicing it 5000 times is 5000 time better.  Our brains don't function that way....see \\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\", Norman Doidge, or look up studies on \\"deliberate practice\\".  \\"Tiger Mother\\" seems to indicate that Chua's view is brute force repitition is the only way to do things.  I say, work smarter....wouldn't that be Asian?<br /><br />Oh, and I'm not Asian,  I'm just some white guy who's a year and a day older than Ms. Chua, with 3 boys who are pretty capable and well adjusted, despite me pushing them.new it was true, and I practice the same with my kids.

I downloaded it on kindle to see all the fuss is about.<br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON READING THIS if you are a mature enough to have your own life.<br />This is a joke!<br />Even as an ESL I could tell this book is bad in writting.<br />Who are you kidding?!<br />And what is all the inner goddess all about?<br />My inner goddess just puked after reading this.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I really love this app. It is awesome. I love the feature to lock your notes with a master password and the checklist option. This app is absolutely amazing. I also love the calendar that is included. One suggestion would be to have a preview of what you have scheduled once you are looking at the overall month. Other than that, awesome awesome!! Hope for a newer and revised version!! Love it! :)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Timers are being set to 233 hours randomly and am unable to play.  5 stars when fixed. Note for others: I play this without spending actual money and find it enjoyable. It is something of a &quot;play on break time&quot; game. Not for extended periods. Gets more rewarding as you level up.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I enjoyed this game.  It is, for the most part a \\"find-hidden-objects\\" game with a few challenging twists, and it was these twists that made the game fun and addictive.  Clues that are available during some seasons and not others are the most challenging, but the one that really had me stumped was the way to descend down the well to screen 6 (?).<br /><br />Once I figured that out, then finishing the game was fairly easy.  I did think some of the clues were rather clever while others rather easy. But, in all a nice balance of hard and simple clues and puzzles.  The nice thing about the game is that it took me several days to complete, rather than an hour or two.  So, it is a game you can come back to and continue playing for several days.<br /><br />I do agree that the hint screens are a bit clunky, but I did make use of the map feature that was included in this game and not the previous game from the same company.  I would have enjoyed a simple help and tip guide.<br /><br />Graphics are really good, and the game worked really well on my Kindle Fire. I enjoyed playing it.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This is an intense story with a lot of plot. It felt short reading it but it's actually a full book. A lot happens in a short amount of time and sometimes it's a lot to take in. It's a great book if you like surprises and romance! Another great read is A Perfect Blood.
B006XIR9KM|2.0|The game would be great, but I can't see the top row on my HP Touchpad.  It plays well, I just can't see the top row.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|This game is great for passing time and just to playacting game because you are bored so git this game it is well worth $0.99 so buy it it is their best game yet
B004FOA84A|3.0|I bought this after playing The Lost City, and perhaps I should have reversed that choice.  Unlike The Lost City, this game does not have the hint and map features, so it's up to you to figure out the clues and locate the puzzle pieces.  That being said, I finished the game in a few hours and wished there was more to it.  I agree that it could have been longer with more screens. Again, the graphics were nicely done, the puzzles fairly easy to solve, and it worked well on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />This had a nice balance between clever and challenging clues.<br /><br />I probably would have been less disappointed if I had played this game first and followed it with The Lost City.
0374275637|4.0|This is a good book that has relevant, thought provoking information. The author points out that our mind does jump to conclusions that are often times incorrect and that we should not be relying on trusting our 'gut feeling'. He describes our mind has having 2 Systems which are referred to as System 1 and System 2. System 1 is our automatic, effortless responses and System 2 considers, evaluates and reasons, its the mental effort required. The author recommends that we slow down and rely on System 2 more and not simply rely on a reactive System 1 response. This book will get you thinking!
B002IR3PSC|5.0|(This DVD+CD was bought at Amazon.com)  I bought this Tull DVD + CD from Amazon.com because I wanted to make sure I got it new.  Over the years I've seen Tull in concert 12 times, with 8 of them being at Madison Square Garden.  I've read where some people have complained about the sound.  But what I liked about the DVD WAS the sound.  They seem to have eliminated a lot of fan noise which made it sound better.  When you purchase a ticket to a Tull concert, it says Jethro Tull in Concert.  It doesn't say \\"plus lots of annoying fans screaming and yelling.\\"  So that was a big plus for me.<br /> Overall, I liked the DVD but don't ever remember seeing that bassist as Ian said:  \\"Filling in on short notice for John Glascock.  On short notice.\\"  Glascock had heart problems and died a short while later, unfortunately.  It bothered his friend, Barrimore Barlow so much, that he didn't want to play anymore.<br /> I was looking for one thing on that DVD that Tull must have done a few years earlier.  Perhaps it was in '75 or '76, they played at the Garden and right at the start of \\"Cross Eyed Mary\\" they used an oscilloscope on Ian Anderson while he played the opening flute solo.  It was perhaps the best thing I ever saw him do, his arms moving, his legs moving as they focused that white blinking light on him.  Then once the flute solo was over, the stage lights went back on and Ian started the vocal.  Seeing that left me stunned.  The crowd applauded.  I don't know why they haven't put that on film?<br /> Anyway, if you've never seen Tull in concert, this is the DVD for you.  And if you have, there are still things you'll see on the DVD that you might have missed before.  Enjoy!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I read this book with every spare minute that I owned: whether in the car, in the bathroom, or while being a passenger in my husband's care. It was absolutely worth it. The author brings you through a world wind of emotions, and brings you back to a place you would have never known: Paris in 1942.
1612680011|5.0|This is a great book that gives you very essential and simple financial advice. Here are the lessons I learned from this book.<br />1. Asset is something that puts money in your pocket every month and it does not occupy all your time, otherwise it becomes a job.<br />2. Liability is something that takes money out of your pocket every month.<br />3. Spend less than you make.<br />4. Buy assets with your savings. (Poor and middle class people tend to buy liabilities their whole lives - huge house to live in, expensive car, boats, etc.)<br />5. When you have enough assets that generate enough monthly income that cover all your expenses, then you move into the wealthy category.<br /><br />You can start applying the principles in this book at any stage of your life. However, if you start early (20s-early 30s) you have a bigger chance of becoming rich.

Then I registered for Net Flix, for their 30 day free trial, to watch the rest. It was surely, erotic, thrilling, thank god for a rewind button. I wanted to view scenes over and over again. The King was scandalous, was that what I loved the most: yes.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|The book was great; the ending was unsatisfying.  This book did not clarify what happened to all of the characters that we have grown to love in the books and HBO.  What happened to The Stark children; to the Lannister children; to Tyrion; to Jon Snow and his wolf.  I know it implied that Jon was killed, but what about his wolf and does he change...IS he really dead???  What about Danyeres and her dragons???  Does she make it to Westeros?  Get busy George R.R. Martin...Your story is not finished and we are waiting for the next book.

Wonderfully detailed writing, love the way the story is full of surprises and twists.<br />Not sure what genre I would classify this as other than a great read that will start you thinking about ideas and concepts that might otherwise pass you by.<br /><br />On the weird side: I had an issue with compatibility of the ebook file on my tablet so I posted so. The immediate response I got was shockingly from Mr. Howey who promised to look into it immediately and find a solution. I was and still am blown away.<br /><br />Mr. Howey: I know you read your reviews religiously (its says so at the end of the book after all), so I just wanted to thank you for your excellent work, and encourage you to keep writing. Wool allowed me to escape my own personal silo (I own a small business) and really helped me coalesce some of my own thoughts using your story as a springboard.<br /><br />Keep up the great work!<br /><br />Aka: Sgt Carrot
B006OB3K56|5.0|This movie portrays life in New York City as an enormously empty place, empty in terms of meaning and personal connections.  The protagonist played wonderfully by Michael Fassbender, walks around almost like a wolf looking to find a mating partner for the moment.  He stares women down on the train.  When he does try to make intimate contact with a coworker, he ends up being sadly impotent.  This was hard to see, but gave me insight into his need to troll endlessly looking for human connection.  His sister is a fair to middling singer with deep wounds that are transparent and manifested by self destructive and suicidal behavior.  The missing link I see in the movie, and I could be wrong, is that the siblings had at one point in their life, an incestuous relationship, that she wants to continue but he does not.  Instead he seeks to clean himself with annonymous sexual liaisons. I think that the brother being offended by his sister's sexual encounter with his boss helps to strengthen this hypothesis.  He cringes like a child listening to their connective noises, and has to go out to jog while they finish.  The glare of graphic sexual encounters is necessary in a way to contrast to their otherwise meaningless lives, and I did not find it to be offensive. Neither party is willing or able to confront their demons.<br /><br />Overall I found this movie to be provocative and is on my mind days after seeing it.  I think it is worthwhile to watch.  We all have some demons that we act out in one way or another.

B007VYQ6DS|5.0|Just got back from seeing \\"Chimpanzee\\" with my girlfriend and our two young boys. They loved it, and so did I. The first viewing in a long while that received a standing O. I cannot wait till the Blu-Ray transfer.<br /><br />This is the story(narrated by Tim Allen, \\"Toy Story\\", \\"Home Improvement\\")of a newly born chimp named Oscar. We watch him grow up with his Mother and the other Chimps among the clan. Freddy, the Grandfather-leader is my favorite.<br />You cannot watch this without thinking of how unbelievably human they are. Look at their eyes, their communication and feelings; its all on caught on film and wonderfully done. I loved the footage of their tool and decision making, so, so human. Though the story of Oscar is its focus, other stories such as Scar and his clan who are at a territorial war over food sources and the communication and the execution of hunting their prey is genius.<br />Wonderfully told by Tim Allen as he takes us through the story of the chimps with his comedic style.<br />My kids loved it and so did I. Its nice to watch something real and educational for a change, making this a perfect family film.<br />Short film but very sweet and well worth it.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am a 40 something college student.  That shouldn't matter, but it does.<br /><br />Ana, the main character is a virgin.  Ok, so it's highly unlikely, but conceivable that there are a few virgins at colleges in America.  I can accept that.<br /><br />There isn't really anything outstanding about her, she's pretty mundane, yet this fabulous, rich man takes an interest her.  Um...ok.  I guess I can accept that, after all, isn't that the lure of a romance novel?  Boring and mundane readers get to pretend that they too could somehow attract some outstanding guy.  I get that.<br /><br />At the beginning of the story, Ana is in her last few weeks before graduating from university.  Shortly after hooking up with Mr. Grey, he buys her a computer and sets her up with an email address...(sound of a needle being ripped from an old vinyl record)...What????  A modern day college student who doesn't own a laptop?  Ok, maybe, but no email address???  I can't get past this.  I tried, I really did, but I can't.<br /><br />When you enroll at a university, they assign you an email address.  Almost all communication with the school, with professors, with other students, is done via email.  Many assignments are turned in online.  In fact, many schools REQUIRE students to own a laptop, though I can see how a student might get around this requirement, but no email address?  A college graduate who is completely naive about computers???  I can't do it.<br /><br />The author has lost all creditability with me and I can't get it back.  I have this notion that the author must be completely out of touch with today's world in order to write such nonsense.  I have visions of some creepy, computer-illiterate, old guy sitting in front of an ancient typewriter, pecking out his sexual fantasies.  It gives me the creeps.<br /><br />I understand that this error may not bother everyone as it has me, but I try to report my honest take of the books I read and this was the deal breaker for me.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet.  Wonderfully written, well thought out book.  I didn't find it too long - if anything I was annoyed when it ended.  Truth be told - I discovered this book and bought it on my kindle to help pass the time while I was home with my son battling the flu - I had a very hard time putting it down and finished it in 2 days.<br />This book is well-worth a purchase.  I count myself lucky that I have found a new author to enjoy the way I used to enjoy Anne Rice novels.  I am also lucky that part two is coming out in a couple months - I hate waiting to find out what happens next!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so amazing it has a great varity of games you can play. also it has a wide selection of games I mean 124 games that's a lot to choose from (:
B0055SWM08|5.0|I wish I could set the music to play even when the game's closed. I'm glad there are hints. I wish the background in the shelf area changed with the designated year.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is really fun! but when I got to level 5 it got harder really fast. at the finish line it wouldn't let me jump all the way so I would hafta start the level over...
B005SDMDRW|5.0|I always find books by Michael Connelly engrossing with good mystery plots.  This one is no exception.  There are twists and turns and surprises, it's never predictable and is well written.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I read Mr. Dreeke's book on a long flight and felt the urge to practice the techniques he outlines many times over.  A short and easy read, Mr. Dreeke does a fantastic job of very clearly explaining each technique with excellent examples.  As a Ph.D. student in Clinical Psychology, some of these techniques were familiar to me (and I can attest that they do indeed work) but others were new and will be invaluable to me in both the therapy room and in my normal life.  If you are looking for some great tips on talking to people, and doing so well with good results, this book is worth it.<br /><br />I cannot more highly recommend his book, it is definitely worth the time and money!
0345803485|5.0|This book was the first of it's kind for me I loved it! It was erotic, captivating and funny at time I would catch my self as I lol. Tomorrow I will go buy the other two books! I would pay 3x the price of this book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game to play especially if you ate a fun person who likes new things. fun for all ages thanks tot making this game
B004KZOXJA|5.0|Another page turner from Lauren Oliver.  Although I'm in my sixties and the main characters are very young, I don't find it at all childish in approach.  The storyline is good and Oliver writes so well that I got lost in the book and devoured it all too quickly.
B0039HV3P2|4.0|I really enjoy this story.  I have watched it many times.  It is a very good remake of a classic.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was fairly captivating until the end.  The book had the worst ending I've ever read in a novel.  It's like the author just wanted to get rid of it to start a new book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is really similar to Mario, and super fun. User friendly controls and high quality option. best of all - it's free!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I'm 2/3 of the way through the series so far, and am learning a lot.  I really enjoy the documentaries that precede each episode.  However, thus far I'd have to say Band of Brothers outshines The Pacific by far, particularly in terms of character development.  That said, I do recommend The Pacific!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|this album was great but they still could have done better but i do like it and see i listen occasionally to softer rock music and rock that isnt so heavy but i do like this band and know alot more about them and have followed them since the begginning and if you like shinedown then this is worth it so just go ahead and buy it cause trust me its really good
0691152640|5.0|My latest read was \\"This Time Is Different\\" by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.  The only thing I really need to say is that if you're looking for the definitive overview of centuries upon centuries of financial crises worldwide, this is it.  Instead of going specifically into one crisis, they go into a broad overview of worldwide financial crises from the past eight centuries.  This is a truly remarkable effort they've undertaken.  I don't want to steal their thunder, and I'll thus keep the book review in fairly broad terms.  I will say, however, that the main theme of the book is exposing the foolishness of believing the title because it never is different (in this context).  We just think it is.<br /><br />Before we dive into the content, I'll say that the tone and writing style are both engaging.  It has an academic feel to it, obviously, but it's not that dry academic feel we get so often in books like this.  They actually spruce it up.<br /><br />I'd also point out that this book is the source of several key data points we often hear about, including how government debt/GDP ratios above 90% increase the probability of danger.  There are some critical nuances regarding this measure that they highlight.<br /><br />Part 1 lays the ground rules for the rest of the book.  Chapter 1 explores how they define crises in the book.  In Chapter 2, they introduce the concept of debt intolerance and a discussion of how/why some countries may be more vulnerable to crises stemming from high levels of debt than others.  Chapter 3 discusses their database and methodology.<br /><br />Part 2 focuses on sovereign debt crises.  This is when a government defaults on debts owed to foreigners.  Chapter 4 is a more high-level, theoretical, even abstract, look at this event and addresses several key nuances, such as the question of illiquidity versus insolvency and what exactly constitutes a default (many alterations to the initial deal, such as extending the duration or reductions in rates or balance, could be considered forms of default).  The next chapter examines the mechanics of external default and the chapter after that explores the history of such incidents.<br /><br />I will, however, single out Chapter 5's exploration of Newfoundland in the late 1920's.  This is a riveting tale of how external default basically forced Newfoundland into Canada.  It was a historically significant event in that democracy and sovereignty literally took a back seat to debt.  Few Canadians are even aware of this story.  In some ways, this mirrors what we're seeing today with Greece, as their sovereignty is taking a clear back seat to their debt.  This is the exact opposite of how Iceland handled its problems recently, but these are a whole other story.<br /><br />Moving on, Part 3 takes us on a journey through the world of domestic default.  Here, the government defaults on debts it owes to domestic entities.  Like Part 2, they first focus on the more theoretical aspects of the matter in Chapter 7 before moving onto a look at the mechanics and dynamics in Chapter 8 (which also explores the history of these events).  Unlike before, the last chapter focuses on the question of whether domestic or external default is worse and seniority in determining who is higher on the ladder for loss recovery.<br /><br />Part 4 gets really meaty as it covers other types of crises.  Chapter 10 explores banking crises and shows that, while a nation may be able to graduate from the risks of sovereign external and domestic default, nobody has yet \\"outgrown\\" banking crises.  In banking crises, it's not an issue of whether the government will default somehow, but some kind of issue with the banking system.  The key point is to differentiate between the government and the banking sector.<br /><br />Chapter 11 explores a type of stealth default called currency debasement, in which a government defaults on its debt by weakening its currency.  In the days of yore, when we had metal-based currencies, the governments would just reduce the metal concentration and reissue currency, but the nominal debt remains the same.  More recently, central banks would fire up the figurative printing presses, but even that's outdated because they just electronically increase the banks' reserves today.  Chapter 12 takes currency debasement one step further and looks at inflation.  I've discussed many of these dynamics previously.<br /><br />Part 5 is where they try to apply all this knowledge to the present day.  They examine our recent global crisis, which they called the Second Great Contraction (SGC) and is also commonly called the Great Recession, through the lens of history.  In Chapter 13, they explore the run-up to the SGC.  Chapter 14 then looks at the aftermath of previous global crises to give us a glimpse of where we may go with the SGC.  They follow in Chapter 15 with an exploration of contagion, which looks at what factors are involved in containing a crisis to just one nation or region versus a global issue.  Chapter 16 is the pinnacle of the book.  Here, they attempt to create a crisis index.<br /><br />Part 6 attempts to string it all together.  Chapter 17 asks the question of what we should take away from history and the SGC for the future.<br /><br />This is a must-read for anybody who wants to understand financial crises on a broader scale.  It won't tell you much about any one specific crisis (aside from the most recent one), but it will show you the commonalities underlying them.  Truth be told, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|This is the best IP camera application out there... I am using it professionally for over 18 months and love it!
1400031524|3.0|One of the pleasures of reading the Wallander series is the insights we get into modern Swedish society.  In this novel, Mankell sends Wallander to Riga, a location with which Mankell clearly is less familiar.  As a result, the writing in the last half of the novel is a bit forced and formulaic.  It's still worth reading, but not up to the standards set by Faceless Killers.
B007Q476KU|3.0|Pros:<br />>Beautiful cinematography, decent soundtrack.<br />>Epic action scenes<br />>Happy ending<br />>Some good moments, a few good lines, good lessons.<br /><br />Cons:<br />>Cliché, overly sentimental, cheesy.<br />>Really obviously unbelievable moments--to the point where it's hard to focus on the \\"feel good\\" or action because the impossibility or plot hole is too evident.<br />>A lot of the accents sound fake and contrived.<br /><br />Mostly I just didn't know how to feel about it. The first half felt like a kid's movie, with the cheesiness and over-earnest-ness. I got a bit bored and had more than one eyeroll. But I definitely wouldn't show my young kids the war scenes and second half, which had a tendency to get a little gruesome. Couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a family feel-good movie, or an epic. Just a confusing mixture of genres.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|if you like angry birds the oringinal, you'll probably love this. its a cool twist and its worth the money.
1439127700|5.0|Every person interested in politics should pick up this gem!  A terrific summer read - well written by the tremendously talented Duffy and Gibbs.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|Still cartoonish but interesting with how the characters are so human in detail.<br />The story is simple but the action scenes are worth your time to watch.<br />Humor and adventure all rolled into one movie using state of the art equipment that produces cartoon people with emotion and adventure.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game my kids and fight over who's going to play it nexts!!!<br /><br />thanks for letting us be able to download this on the kindle fires!!! vickerys
B007SYWFRM|2.0|a lot of mgmt but it is varied enough to hold interest...<br />the scrat movie is worth your time to reach...
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I am surprised how much I like this book. The premise seemed far fetched, but it was in instant gripper. I like the way the characters are written. It is typical YA, but I enjoy this style of book. It was an easy, fast read and I downloaded Pandemonium immediately when I finished. There is also a novella called Hana that I am reading. I recommend this book for sure.
B005K17RU0|3.0|this app crashes if you try to add another location to pick from to check the weather. I am in different cities a lot and that's dissappointing. just opening it makes it crash and sometimes even when you're viewing your own city..even before the app opens, it crashes.
B003MC5N28|2.0|After looking at all the rave reviews...it must be me.  But, \\"The Giver\\" fell flat for me.  I really really like the beginning and I liked the world that was created, every body so polite and all. And then you find the bad things behind the curtain.  In fact I liked the polite world so much that I wouldn't object to ...the bad things behind the curtain, that make the society possible.<br /><br />The latter book was so unsatisfying, like how could there be no sun, but stuff grows, and how could there be no color?<br /><br />This book has a great story idea, unfortunately it doesn't flesh out.<br /><br />PS I especially liked the dinner scenes where each member of the family has to politely wait for other family members to share their day and then they comfort each other!  Great stuff!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just what the title says - great game! The concept is not new, but this is definitely the best of it's kind!
B004UID2LC|5.0|it fine u no just get it youll be happy  i wonder if it works with no internet connection though
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is a very nice lightweight headphone. Very good feeling since doesn't push into the ears. No pain after use.<br />Very good for hiking/ running. Wish could use for biking too, but doesn't go well with the bike helmet. Not designed to be used around the neck.<br />Overall it has an amazing quality, good sound and most importantly much lighter than it looks. Like it and recommend.
B0062NARCA|5.0|Great for long trips in the car. Works on U.S. PSP's. Be sure to have a car charger. You can get the 1st part also. I have had no problems with region 0 movies with my USA PSP 3000.
0316056863|4.0|Although this book wasn't as amusing as actually watching Tina Fey perform, I really enjoyed it and loved learning more about her personal story, which is told in a very engaging way. If you like Tina, buy the book!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game was very addicting with solid graphics and great gameplay. Until my timers glitched like everyone else's. Now they say I have to wait 936 hours to collect from my buildings, animals, and crops. So, you see, this game is hopelessly flawed - at least until the developers fix this glaring issue. In the meantime, I will be uninstalling this application and spending my time elsewhere.
B007SGM084|2.0|I agree with other critic. As much as I want to own this Trilogy, they've set the Kindle edition price far too high.
B006FXJVHY|5.0|Great for long trips in the car. Works on U.S. PSP's. Be sure to have a car charger for your PSP. You can get the Part 2 also.
0345803485|4.0|I'm not one that reads \\"Erotic\\" books, but for being a new author on the scene E.L. James did a good job. The only thing I find this book lacking is the use of the same words and phrases over and over again.  It would have been nice had the words to explain situations werent overused...the premise of the book is good though!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Even though the plot line combines/borrows from three different books in the series, the story is in keeping with the spirit of these books, which is all I really care about. I loved the series as a child and it is great to see the characters come to life. I hope they pursue a sequel.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome game! It's really entertaining and easy to earn coins. It could use an easier way to exit the game, but if you go to the settings menu the menu bar comes back and you can exit the game that way. Otherwise I love everything is great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Normally not my type of read but I could not put it down !! Recommend to everyone!! I read all three in 4 days!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Another great Connolly book. Love his writing style. He knows his subject. I'm a retired Detective Sergeant and can vouch for his knowledge of police work<br /><br />T W Morse
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is slightly addictive in nature and once I start I have a hard time stopping. would reccommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are ok. kills time when you have nothing else to do. controls are a little off though...or maybe that's just me.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|If you are a writer or an artist, you should read this book and take its lessons to heart. It's short, simple, sweet, and to the point.
B001N3OJEG|2.0|I was so happy to find this movie to stream because I needed it for a school project. I streamed it and it seemed like every 5 mins the screen froze and I had to restart my computer and find my spot. It took forever to watch and changed the configuration on my tv. I never had that happen when I used Netflix but then again Netflix didn't offer the movie by steaming. Stuck with freezing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! I read it in a day!! It's a fairly easy read that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time! Everytime I would take a break from reading, I felt as if I had paused a movie and couldn't wait to continue! Definitely worth the buy and I can't wait to start the sequel!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an amazing quick read. I could not put it down  for to long. It took me three days to finish. I recommend this book to all my friends and family.
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|I had semi happy memories of this film when it first came out.  At the time (a long time ago)I found it campy and sensual in an odd sort of way that helped carry the total ineptness of the film and every thing about it.  I'm afraid it hasn't aged well. Today its just tacky and unpleasant. It is shockingly bad.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could there possibly be anything better then buying a book by an author you've never heard of simply because the price is great and so are the reviews only to discover that the story is fantastic? The good guys are good and the bad guy, well, he's just doing his job. The story flows along well and leaves lots of room for more stories to follow. Right now am gonna head on over and take a look at \\"Molly Fyde\\".
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This isnt a great movie or anything, but it is exactly what you would expect from a Mission Impossible Tome Cruise movie. Lots of big scenes and a fun pace, with a few amazingly hot women mixed in. There were some really cool scenes, like driving a car off...something undisclosed right now in case you havent watched....to get somewhere faster, a missile hitting the side of a building and bouncing off, a prison break, etc...There were some funny moments, as would be expected when you've got Simon Pegg in the cast, and the end features a funny cameo from Ving Rhames as well. As always, nothing goes right, and adaptation to circumstances are key, overcoming impossible odds to essentially save the world. I think if you are in the market for a fun, fast paced action flick no shortage of unrealistic stuff going down. this will fit the bill nicely.<br />side note...you can definitely tell that Cruise is getting older in this flick, and if you arent enamored by Agent Carter, well, you arent a girl or a guy realistically.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter, but read it before giving it to her. It is a FANTASTIC book that would be best read with your child to discuss.  It is written in a light hearted tone for such a difficult topic, but this is what makes it so enjoyable to read. The main character is resilient and strong in his own way.  I really like that the story is told from various character's point of view. This makes for a great conversation piece with your kids who have felt bullied (or have been bullies) because you can see that different people have reasons for doing what they do and it might not be intentionally mean.  Communication between people could help the negative feelings, but people are often afraid to talk openly.  This would be a great book for a 5th - 9th grade class to read together!
B003K16P50|2.0|I don't think I would recommend this book.  I didn't like the style it was written in.  The story line was interesting, but the writing was awkward.
0765348276|4.0|Up to now I hadn't read anything by John Scalzi, which is a bit of a faux pas in SF fan circles these days. So I started, somewhat unoriginally, with the book everyone mentions.<br /><br />Old Man's War is what I think of in my head when I talk about written science fiction. It's set in the future, it has weird alien races, advanced science and a fair amount of action.<br /><br />On the surface there's nothing really exceptional going on here. We've had clones before, and scary aliens and battles in space. What makes this work is the execution.<br /><br />The story here is simple enough. People who reach the ripe old age of 75 get to enlist with the Colonial Defense Forces and go up into space to defend the growing human settlements. When they do so they discover that they had no idea how comfy and safe a life they had been living and how harsh space really is.<br /><br />I say story rather than plot, because it isn't quite a plot. Along the way we learn more and more about the universe and the races that life in it as well as the CDF and it's methods of defending humanity. But it's more of a man's biography than it is a singular plot.<br /><br />Scalzi presents us with a cold and dangerous universe. Populated by aliens we really don't understand very well. Many of which are as capable (or more) than us. But he humanizes it with the characters that populate it. Some of those characters really don't get much screen time, but they are distinctive and when some of them die, it does hurt a little.<br /><br />In the quest to be new and original, sometimes the basics get forgotten. And those basics are far more important than any burst of originality. I'm glad I read this and I'm looking around to see what other books of John Scalzi's I might want to read soon.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very good game i recommend  it to everybody who has a kindle or tablet good graphics and everything not bad worth the time to download
B004MC8CA2|2.0|what can I say? it's the Bible! not sure why it is incomplete. there have been passages that I have gone to look up and find they are missing.  it's kind of like buying a book and finding chapters missing. it definately could use an overhaul.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Perry Mason always found the real killer. Haller looks for something just as good: a plausible alternate to his client. Or did his straw man really do it? Does it matter? Yet, in the end, it does matter and provides one of the best endings Connelly has written.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked the book quite a bit.  The only issue I have is it seems like to meet a deadline the last 25% of the book was just slapped down on paper.  The LOVE the first book and the 2nd was very good also..  Just didnt seem like the same author for the last part of this book..... Other than that  awesome series  Also  I kept waiting for the pearl to play a significant part in Peeta's recovery...  just sayin'
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome game. I am not sure how much more can be said about this game. I over Scrat he's awesome! Go Scrat! Yay!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is amazing, its a great way to pass time. its even better if you like/love the movie. so I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't like that it says 101 games but really its only a few until you complete them and purchase more with your points.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved the ice age movies and I love the ice age games!So addicting and awesome! Even though I have a kindle I can stol get out of the game.And to the people who were being dramatic about it stop.Its an amazing game!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game. Works well on the Fire, no problems running it.  Perfect way to relay. and waste time. If you like the old Oregon Trail and Farmville, you'll love this one.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|First off, I'm a BIG fan of Colin Firth, and I've loved the BBC miniseries for many years.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />I think that Matthew Macfayden is, honestly, the best Darcy. Hands down.  Kiera Knightley did a great job (I wish she hadn't been quite so belligerent at the end of his first proposal), and the liveliness and sparkle to this version really outshines all others.  It reminds me of Kenneth Branaugh's Shakespeare works . . . which I have long loved.  People are people are people . . . have been, and always will be . . . and I loved how this version really allowed us to see what the characters felt.  One of my favorite things about this version is seeing how startled Darcy is by his attraction to Elisabeth; and how he struggles against it, but can't keep himself from doing small things like taking her hand as she steps into the carriage when leaving Bingley's.  Elisabeth, shocked, looks down, and we see his hand grasping hers for a second . . . and then him stretching and closing his fist as he walks away, his hand full of electricity from her touch.  I mean, really . . . it's superb.  And the way Macfayden's face opens and turns so tender and vulnerable when he speaks to Elizabeth simply melts you.  He goes so well from icy pride to elecctrified yearning.  I really wish that this version predated the BBC series, as some of the elements here would have really improved the other.  (I think it would have a feel more like the BBC Emma series, which is next on my list.)<br /><br />The director did a masterful job of filling nearly every minute of this film (which I wish was four hours long!) with so many things that let us into the whole story, instead of seeing it from the outside.  You feel the exuberance and love and annoyance that accompanies a household of five girls, and I dearly, dearly love Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett.<br /><br />Hate this version as you may, but I love it tremendously!<br /><br />Now, if there was only a director's cut edition . . . if anyone is listening, please make one!. . if anyone is listening, please make one!
B0076NAW48|3.0|Great instrumentalists should concentrate on what they do best, not showcasing weaknesses. Blues tunes like these require vocal talent, which Mr Leavell lacks. Great piano but zip it please.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a really fun game along with the other really fun games that are made by the same company.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|animals are awesome. graphics are awesome. dialogue is awesome.  funny characters.  fun game to play and very very addicting. recommend this game
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Not his best, too much time building up to what was no surprise, and the end was not even a chapter. There should have been more in the end.
B00466HNHM|4.0|This has one of the best sound tracks of vocals I have heard in quite a while. The audio quality on the vocals was very high in my opinion.  My wife and I enjoyed the movie as well. It is worth the money for the vocals alone.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|this book was a very exciteful and joyful fast read. if you are one to like political scandels and drama then this is the correct book for you. i enjoyed this book and you will to.
B0053TMP24|4.0|i love the new twist on an old story especially on the Greek and Roman myths and stories. With how they put the Gods of the Western worlds moving west to the American shores and keeping with the original stories makes for a special entertaining story
B0000024YL|5.0|Thanks for the Simon & Garfunkle cd.  It is a great classic; timeless.  Got it for particular songs, yet fortunately, their were a good deal more melodious songs that I encountered.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. fun to keep adding games as you go. perfect for kids and free.  my kids love it. cool.
B00005JKDR|3.0|The DVD skipped a lot. I know it's used but it's still disappointing to miss major parts of the movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Randomly found this and I love it. Puzzle and strategy all wrapped into one. I just keep coming back because other games don't hold a candle to this. Download it and you won't be sad.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great but a little hard but when you get a lot of points it gets easy and I like it
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Just logged in and everything says it will be ready in 205 hours!?!?! Think I might hafta be done with this game....
B007R41E8O|5.0|fun adventure and puzzle game. great resolution and visuals. cool creepy storyline definitely worth the 99&cent; but i caught on a free day :)
0307593312|5.0|I just want to add that this book is perfect for the Kindle or an e-reader. I loved reading it and had the luxurious bonus of not having to drag it around (the paper book is XXL)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I feel like it is and good game and keeps you going it helps you calculate and teaches you how to save money for other occasions
B000K7MMP4|1.0|I've been watching nearly all Pride and Prejudice movies and my favorite so far is still the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle's. Unfortunately this 1980 edition is very pale in comparison to the other adaptations. The dialogues are not faithful to the book and the portrayal of the characters are quite off. Fortunately, this is just a library loan. I would hate to spend my money on this piece.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this app is fun and cool. Works great on my kindle fire. Easy, got the hang of it quick. Cant ask for much more for it being FREE!!!
B003YUQ4OE|3.0|I was so hoping these would fit but I have a high instep and they are way too tight across the top.  I gave them away!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I read the book, watched it on the big screen and have seen it on on cable TV at least 5 times in the last week. This is simply the best movie on business I have ever watched. It is funny, heartfelt, serious and though-provoking.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good way to waste time. not overly difficult but good game play. I definately recommend it.  power ups are nice and easy to get and use.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|The movie was pretty good with expected exciting action scenes and cool \\"SPY\\" technology.  It was a typical Mission Impossible Movie!

0345803485|5.0|I don't regularly read these types of books, but decided to try the first one of this series to see if I could get into that type of book. To my surprise it kept me turning pages, forgetting the time & lost sleeping hours. I quickly finished the book & ordered the second one to find out what happens next with this pair, also to find out what really happened to Mr. Grey to make him who he turned out to be. The story itself is very interesting, smoldering at times & I really could feel Ana's emotions. Although, Ana is very intelligent at times in the book she's almost to naive. The only one thing that really irritated me was how many times the author used the phrase \\"Inner Goddess\\", but I understood why it was used. One other thing was how many times can one actually referred to how his pant hung off his hips(unnecessary)there are other parts of a mans body to describe. All in all I really like the book, It wasn't boring at any time, which was another reason why I bought the next book.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I really loved this book.  The characters were heartbreakingly real.  This did not feel like a \\"typical\\" Stephen King book, but perhaps I need to revisit his other books.
0545265355|4.0|The title of my review sums up my opinion.  The story is very good despite the authors writing style being very simplistic.  You attach to the main characters and wonder up until the very end how their interpersonal relationships will pan out.  The author did a great job keeping me guessing on that as well as her ending to the final book in the series.  A real cresciendo of shocking turn of events.  The second book drug along to some degree, but was still interesting and definitely set the stage for the grand finale.  I recommend this series to young readers and to people who want a fun quick read.  If you like sophisticated plots and a wealth of characters, this book is not for you.  Personally, I truly enjoyed it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awsome app glitch or 2 but still good I advice if u like taking care of things this for u

B000056MOQ|5.0|While Deutsche Grammophon offers a CD alternative, this 1985 concert in St Peter's Basilica clamours to be seen and not just heard. Where does one start? The liturgy itself is sumptuous. I'm not quite sure how much of it can be attributed directly to the itinerant preacher-man of Galilee but it's mesmerising all the same (those who lack an affiliation with the Old Firm will be mystified and rightly so). And then we have the two major participants, Herbie and JP2, together under the one baroque roof. It begs the question: who was the greater autocrat? The author of `Veritatis Splendor' or the guy who promulgated a fourth Beethoven cycle? It's an open question. When I first viewed this concert, I trembled as the Principal Conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic trooped up to receive communion from his Holiness - for a second I thought Herbie was going to `reverse polarities' by snatching the chalice from JP2 to distribute the sacred hosts in his own right: sadly in a way, there was no such occurrence. Yes indeed, this concert is the Twentieth Century's response to the Congress of Vienna (and let's not forget that a certain Princess of legendary hauteur was also in attendance).<br /><br />\\"Archbooby\\" Colloredo was right in a sense: the Old Neapolitan format of the Mass where the Credo and Gloria are broken up into distinct sections is no friend of the liturgy. It is refreshing to see a Mozart mass `go to work' in context - and how well it supplements the sacred ritual. A frail looking Herbie is clearly afire and he elicits a spirited, energetic response from the Vienna Philharmonic and the Singverein alike. The Crucifixus in particular is deeply moving. Kathleen Battle sings like a `Bright Seraphim' in the Agnus Dei and the Dona Nobis Pacem rings out like an `Urbi et Orbi' blessing from the balcony of St Peter's. Herbie made a recording of Ave Verum Corpus, K 618, in his years with the Philharmonia - sadly the performance here is by the Vatican choir alone. While the Basilica was obviously packed for the occasion - and court-biographer Richard Osborne reports it was a hot and stuffy day - the engineers have provided us with a reasonably transparent recording.<br /><br />All in all, even if this performance will not make you fall to your knees, your eyes will not leave the screen. In Hoc Signo.lica was obviously packed for the occasion - and court-biographer Richard Osborne reports it was a hot and stuffy day - the engineers have provided us with a reasonably transparent recording.<br /><br />All in all, even if this performance will not make you fall to your knees, your eyes will not leave the screen.

0385534639|5.0|I just completed the audible version of this book and ordered the hardback version to read at a later time...after a bit of time as passed so I can share this book and process all the complicated plot twists the book has in it.  I loved this book and its plot full of complicated turns that carried you away to a dreamlike circus that is the stuff dreams are made of.  I am going to reread it since the plot goes back and forth in time so much that I felt a bit lost while listening to the story.  This is one of the negative drawbacks of listening rather than reading an actual book.  You cannot easily go back and check dates and time.<br />I started this book without knowing a think about it rather than the title and it hooked me at once!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games series was as good as the first.  I couldn't put it down. It just shows that a sense of right and determination can change the world.

B007Q476KU|5.0|First of all for all those who left negative comments, you really should read the book first, so you can get a better understanding of what this film is based on.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film, and very good adaptation of the book. & While it is based on the play, and the book, it does stand on its own. A few of the scenes also differ from the novel, and are a little more violent. But, that happens in movies, and it doesn't take anything away from the story. Speilberg does an excellent job bringing the realities of war and what happened to the horses and their riders, during world war 1. the depiction of Albert's family, and the love he had for his horse was also amazing.<br /><br />I would rate this film right up there with the best horse movies of all time. Like Secretariat, Sea biscuit, the Black stallion, and Black beauty.
0385738773|5.0|Great book!! Loved the story, the twists, the turns, and the ending, oh so good!! If you haven't read this book yet, stop reading this.........<br /><br />This book deserves a good discussion. Is WICKED good??? Such an awesome book!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've only recently started reading sci-fi books and Ender's Game was a great book for someone first entering the genre.  The storyline, character development, and immersion of the reader are both very deep while still remaining straight forward.  Card does a great job telling this story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game for kids and a lot of fun.  My six year old son loves playing it. I would recommend. it to anyone
B006YTTVHO|1.0|It's a good thing I got this as a free Kindle offer, because I would have been really disappointed if I had spent money on it.<br /><br />The author offers no advice that you haven't already figured out by being a living, breathing human person functioning in the world.

B001VFTYWI|5.0|I love all of the Kay Scarpetta series and am reading the books in sequence.  These characters are so well-developed.  I hope Cornwell doesn't drink as much as she has her characters swilling down the booze.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|I saw this game at first to be a stupid zombie game.But after some playing its very fun they could have made the controls more in depth. its a great way to waste time and you don't have to use in game money like most flu games.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I think this game is a lot of fun while challenging but still a thumbs up its very very intertaining

B005ELQVGW|2.0|Bj&ouml;rk... an enigma. I guess she's like Marmite (Vegemite for my southern hemisphere chums); you either love her or you hate her and I love her. But for all her other-worldly, crazy-Icelandic charm and occasional flirtation with musical genius I can't help but spend most of my time listening her music thinking two things:<br /><br />1.  Well, it's not Debut is it... and<br />2.  What on earth are you wittering on about woman?!<br /><br />So it was with trepidation that I sat down to listen to her most recent offering Biophilia. The NME described it as being quite possibly \\"...Bj&ouml;rk's defining statement...\\" which rang alarm bells for starters (I'm pretty sure the NME would stand up and applaud these days if I ran through their office strangling a screaming cat as long as I did it in skinny jeans and with the right haircut).<br /><br />So, OK, back to Biophilia. What do I think?<br /><br />I hate to be predictable but I'm afraid it's a bit from column 1 and a bit from column 2.<br /><br />It's not Debut and a lot of it is bordering on the nonsensical.<br /><br />OK so I know that this complaint from a Bj&ouml;rk fan is like a dog owner being upset that his dog can't hold a conversation about musical theatre but it's not the good nonsensical that Bj&ouml;rk excels at; it's the kind that makes you think she wrote the lyrics by throwing a box of those fridge-magnet words ([[ASIN:1890560014 Magnetic Poetry Kit: Original]]) at her refrigerator and seeing which ones stuck.<br /><br />\\"...car... boat... mushroom... hatstand... desklamp... follooooooow... PERFECT. Another song done!...\\"<br /><br />But what about the music Ken? I hear you ask. Surely that saves the record?<br /><br />Well, I'm glad you asked, because the frustrating thing about this album is that there are parts of it that do sound like Bj&ouml;rk is back to her best, but they are all too few and far between for my liking (and occasionally sandwiched between bits of utter garbage). Take the third track of the album, Crystalline, which is a fantastic track until Bj&ouml;rk shoehorns in a wedge of pretty bloody awful drum'n'bass at the end (that I suspect she cobbled together on a drum machine she got for Christmas). Why Bj&ouml;rk, why?<br /><br />If this album was made by anybody else it would of turned me away from the artist quicker than a bumnut through an eggslice, but for me the thought of bat-$h!t crazy Bj&ouml;rk sitting at home playing with her drum machine and beating a xylophone with a shoe like it was a pap at Bankok airport kind of makes me smile. So you keep churning out the tunes Bj&ouml;rk and I'll keep listening*.<br /><br />*To Debut.talline, which is a fantastic track until Björk shoehorns in a wedge of pretty bloody awful drum'n'bass at the end (that I suspect she cobbled together on a drum machine she got for Christmas).

B004EPZ03O|1.0|I was looking forward to the Muppets with much excitement, I was thinking how i used to like the older show from the 70s, and so was eager to watch this new movie with high hopes and big expectations.<br /><br />However, the Muppets really let me down, I was very disappointed with this terrible terrible movie.<br /><br />and where do i start to explain how bad this movie is, and what went wrong !!<br /><br /> I guess everything about it was very badly done and poorly executed. there was clearly a lack of imagination and lack of Muppets magic !!<br /><br />Now I know that this movie is a family one, and is mainly aimed at kids and the young ones, however, it doesn't even appeal to kids as well, in fact, my kids lost interest early on and after only a few minutes from starting the movie.<br /><br />So the movie starts with an introduction to a muppet named Walter, who for some unexplained reason is living with  Humans and has a human as brother, Gary played by Jason Segel.<br /><br />Walter is a big fan of the Muppets \\" obviously !! \\" and never misses a show during the 70s, soon the show stops and the Muppets are no more and are forgotten by the world, so years pass by and we are jumped to our current time, where Walter and Gary are all grown up and are ready to take a trip to Los Angeles to visit the Muppets studios and bring back the Muppets to life !!<br /><br />Jason Segel was just not made for a role like this, he does not have the talent of a dancing and lively performer needed for such a role, and he looked uninterested as ever !! his acting looked so fake and unreal.<br /><br />we are also introduced to Gary's love interest and girlfriend, Mary played by Amy Adams, and here the love story is devoid of any believable emotions and is as boring as ever. I think the character development was poorly done for these two main characters and so no real attachment from the viewers towards them.<br />And while Amy was slightly better than Segel here, she still looked uninterested and her character lacked the charm needed. probably not Amy's fault but rather to the lack of creativity in character development in the script.<br /><br />speaking of characters, almost every Muppet is brought back here, which might be a bad thing, because so much characters were squeezed into the film not allowing enough time for viewers to connect to certain Muppet characters. It was clearly aimed at focusing on Kermit, but even him was rushed into the film quickly without explanation to where he was and why he is living the way he was all alone.<br /><br />the plot was flat and silly, with a mixture of the Muppets reuniting and struggling to get back into show business and having to have to deal with an evil rich businessman who wants to take over the Muppet studios and turn it into some oil producing company or whatever. that villain role went to Chris Cooper, who also seemed out of place here and was one of the worst villains of all time in movie history, a Cliche of a villain with the obvious \\" ill get you Muppets \\" and \\" I will destroy the Muppets \\" lines !<br /><br />It was clear that the people behind the movie were concentrating more on which celebrity to bring in as a Cameo rather than focusing on the plot. there were plenty of Cameo appearances including Selena Gomez and Zack Galifiankis which did not add anything special to the film.<br /><br />the worst part of the film, is as i mentioned, the lack on imagination, magic and life in the movie. the dances and songs seemed lifeless and lacking the magic or spirit needed for such movies. it ended up dull and very very boring.<br /><br />sorry to say this, but this gets a fat zero, avoid it !!<br /><br />[...]
1612130283|5.0|Excellent book!!  I was hooked from the first page. Some of the story becomes redundant but it was a good read! I recommend all 3 books...Great love story!
B005HSL626|5.0|I think it is a great game!!! even if it does have adds in fact this is my second time getting it because I already got all of the bonus blades and backgrounds!!!!!!!!!!
0812548094|4.0|Even though this book has a crazy amount of typos (kindle version) i could not put this book down. It was not as good as Wizards First Rule but it was pretty d*mn good. This book you meet the sisters of the light and the sisters of the dark and what I like most about the Terry Goodkind series is his books definitely take you to another world! This is a great and fun escape into the midlands. One thing I don't like about a lot of fantasy novels is they can be somewhat hard to read because the author is taking themselves too seriously or describing things so much you forget what is going on, you don't have to take ridiculous english classes to understand the writing in this series. And it makes it for a very fun and enjoyable read! i want to read this whole series!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an extremely fun game.... when people say you have to shut it down on kindle fire really you just have to open the menu and go to settings than the little bar comes up. I would definently recommend this app!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i really like it!! works great and i love the characters!! only problem i have is it is to hard to expand.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|this game is really fun and enjoyable. if u liked the book, u are going to love this app. even though it costs money, its totally worth it. the only thing that kinda stinks is it takes a long time to load, but otherwise, its awesome!
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This books feels like the end of part one of a song of ice and fire, and what a finale it was. This time around we get exciting new character insight as we see scenes from the point of view of Jaime and Samwell and they are great additions to the chapter leaders. The story continues its frantic pace as the characters deal with the world crumbling about them and their attempts to eek out a life for themselves seems to be constantly in vain.<br /><br />The story i always equate to my friends with comparison to these books is the film slumdog millionaire. The reason i mean this is because the character in slumdog goes through so much hell you almost beg for some light at the end of the tunnel. Martin makes you feel this way with a song of ice and fire. You seem to constantly hope there is going to be a break for the characters or a bit of fortune and just as you think Martin is going to give you a happy moment he kicks you in the gut. This book showed his willingness to take chances and not pander to fans he may have built with the first two books which makes its unpredictability all the more sweet.<br /><br />If i had one criticism of this book (I read both volumes as a whole) it is that it does seem slightly padded at times. While John Snow's story is constantly interesting, Arya's should have been edited down. A lot of what she does is important it is not all nearly essentially and found myself wondering where they were even going with her as she seemed to wander a bit too much. Having said that this book and series is fantastic!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i really like this game and i suggest u get it because it is really close to the book. i find it is really entertaining and addicting. so, if u like the book, u are really going to like this app. thank u -mackenzie shaw:)
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Clash of Kings picks up from Game of Thrones without missing a beat. In fact the pace which built in the first book feeds into this second volume so well it is impossible to put this thing down. My favourite aspect of this book is the balance Martin finds in this volume. It is not all action all the time or all talking and tension. At the start Arya's story is packed with action and excitement while Tyrion's and John's are slower to build. In the second half of the book the stories flip and the action can be found through Tyrion and John, while Arya's pace slackens. An excellent volume with some exciting set pieces and some interesting new character additions. As Martin continues to build his exciting world he seems more than willing to burn it to the ground.
0670022411|1.0|I finally gave up after 250 pages.  Really thin story and characters that never fully got my attention.  Too bad, I had big expectations.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've tried several remote desktop apps,  and Splashtop is the easiest to set up,  most reliable and has the best interface in my opinion.  I don't need remote access often,  but when I do it suits my needs perfectly!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Now i really like this anime though the only problem would be that it overshadows itself with all the echi moments which is great what guy wouldnt like it but it does take away from the storyline sometimes overall i think its a great anime if you can get past the echi moments and watch the storyline because it really is interesting almost reminds me of zomieland its random but it definetly makes something of itself so for those into some 24/7 echi with hot girls doing some zombie killing and a non wuss male protaganist i definetly recomend it its really fun and has a some reall good character development its definetly not what you would expect.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is so cool I honestly Play it 24/7 I so so so so so so so love it. Fun.

B000P6XU5G|5.0|An old formula that rarely fails..This one however hits a home run! John Wayne, Dean Martin and a Young Ricky Nelson along with venerable Walter Brennen(couldn't tell if he was young or old in this movie) and angie Dickenson and the typical bad guys played by a outstanding cast. However one of the best parts was the protrayl of alcholism by Dean Martin. Very innovative, It was never protrayed in this fashion in the movies until the famous \\"lost Weekend\\" Movie starring Ray Milland.  Dean Martin did an outstatnding job (and he rarely drank--so I heard). Howard Hawks did this again in \\"El Dorado\\" with Robert Mitchum.  Young Ricky Nelson did a fine job both acting and \\"singing\\" with Dean and Walter.  Excellent good old fashioned Western with a bit of social awareness.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|I would give it a higher rating if a better resolution was offered and it allowed for searches of all the streams.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read this book before going to see the movie so it was my first purchase on my new Kindle. I loved the book, and plan on seeing the movie in the near future.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I grew up believing that everything is worth reading.  However, this book is a school girl's fantasy written in a school girl's prose.  An \\"E\\" for effort, for a supposedly mature woman's attempt to be a writer.  I am sure that professional writers get a real chukkle out of this success at making money.  Mercifully, reading this on a KINDLE made it easy to opt out of finishing it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have found this game to be elegantly simple and addictive.<br />It is very relaxing to play with the zen sounding music. Before you know it, time has passed.

B004EPYZUS|2.0|Sorry folks. This DVD was pretty much a waste for me. It was simply....not engaging and even boring.<br />You have to credit Tom Cruise. He is no doubt a fine actor and a Guy who deservedly can be proud of his physical conditioning. But, that just could not save this movie.<br />Jeremy Renner was utilized poorly. The movies stunts were sometimes laughable.<br />All in all ...I would save my money. Unless of course you want the movies you watch to have all the great reality and suspense of a poor reality TV show.<br />What is most dismaying, is that with just a bit less over the top unbelievable stunts and a bit more real character development..it might have been a fine movie.
0553266306|4.0|I had thought I'd reached the point of finding most international mystery/thrillers somewhat tiresome, however I found a refreshing exception with this novel. It seemed to embody storytelling that was at the same time fast-paced and action laden, while essentially being about a psychological test of endurance and wills. Based largely on actual events, it also provided an interesting history lesson as well as portrayal of mid-1960s culture in Europe. Most compelling to me was the development of the character Claude Lebel; the French detective - an everyman of sorts - who, without warning, has the weight of the world thrust upon him.
B007KX7WZQ|5.0|If you watch \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" on TV, I don't have to tell you how great this video series is. Owning the episodes for re-watching is a real treat.  While some say the writing faltered a bit in the middle of the season (there are still three more new episodes to come as of this writing), taken as a whole the series is thrilling.  TVD fits between \\"Twilight\\" and \\"True Blood\\".  To me, \\"Twilight\\" is bloodless (pardon the pun!) and True Blood is good but R rated.  If you haven't seen TVD, buy the third season, but buy seasons 1 and 2 also so you can catch up.  You will be so caught up in the absorbing story lines, the wonderful characters, the danger, the sexiness (but no complete nudity or graphic sex for those of you who need to know that), and the beautiful people who are also good actors, that you will be hooked!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is perfect for angery birds fans. It always opens on time never fails to intertwine. Its a interesting twist on angery birds with trying to rescue birds but its still amazing.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book draws you in and doesn't let you go. You will have no choice but to fall in love with the characters. I was even more pleased with how the ending unfolded. It is intense, romantic, and wonderful!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. My only complaint is that you can't add random players as your neighbors. Wish that will get fixed.
B000OVLINI|5.0|What a remarkable and unusual book! I was hooked from the moment I read these two reviews:<br /><br />From Stephen King: \\"If you thought the true gothic novel died with the nineteenth century, this will change your mind. This is the real deal, a novel full of cheesy splendor and creaking trapdoors, a novel where even the subplots have subplots...This is one gorgeous read.\\"<br /><br />From the New York Times Book Review: \\"Gabriel Garcia Marquez meets Umberto Eco meets Jorge Luis Borges for a sprawling magic show, exasperatingly tricky, and mostly wonderful...\\"<br /><br />I simply cannot improve on these two testimonials. Since the original was in Spanish, we owe a huge debt to the translator, because the descriptive language was marvelous:<br /><br />\\"...we walked through the streets of a Barcelona trapped beneath ashen skies as dawn poured over Rambla de Santa Monica in a wreath of liquid copper.\\"<br /><br />Speaking of life with his father after his mother's death, the teenaged protagonist, Daniel, says: \\"Six years later my mother's absence remained in the air around us, a deafening silence that I had not yet learned to stifle with words.\\"<br /><br />On striking a match to light a candle in a long-abandoned mansion, Daniel observes, \\"A copper-colored bubble lit up in my hands and revealed the dancing shapes of the walls that wept with tears of dampness, the fallen ceilings and dilapidated doors...[and much later in the garden] The air smelled of weeds and wet earth. The stone, dark and slimy with rain, shone like the skeleton of a huge reptile.\\"<br /><br />\\"I was thankful for the mantle of the night, for it concealed the tears of terror running down my cheeks.\\"<br /><br />In many ways, this magical story was a tribute to books: their power to inspire, entertain, and change the reader. Daniel overhears a customer in his family's bookstore say, \\"...few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.\\" Later, Daniel's true love, Bea, says that \\"the art of reading is slowly dying, that it's an intimate ritual, that a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us, that when we read, we do it with all our heart and mind, and great readers are becoming more scarce by the day.\\"<br /><br />This last excerpt will resonate with those of us who love to read. It makes me want to be the greatest reader I can possibly be.love, Bea, says that \\"the art of reading is slowly dying, that it's an intimate ritual, that a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us, that when we read, we do it with all our heart and mind, and great readers are becoming more scarce by the day.\\"<br /><br />This last excerpt will resonate with those of us who love to read.

B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read the first book in this series, then you are in for another great surprise. This book has many twists and turned that were unexpected and kept my interest throughout. I recommend reading this book along with the rest of the series as it is good for both males and females alike. Def a great and easy read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun as long as you dont spend a lot of your own money.<br />just enjoy the game for what its worth.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm not really much of a game type of person but I loved this game app. It kind of reminds me of Mario except with a leprechaun. It's pretty fun to play, plus it's a great way to pass time. Wouldn't give it a five because it's not addicting to me, but based on the quality and the game itself, it deserves a five.
B000002OAZ|4.0|I just heard this cd. the clown named Craig who gave this a one star review has his head up you know where. This is a fine, and fun recording. How da heck can you go wrong?? cmon!!! Howlin M@F@#'n Wolf kiddies!! with the Rolling Stones rhythmn section (Watts & Wyman). Maybe Craig thinks he is a re incarnation of Robert Johnson or sumthin. Seriously...Get this nugget and listen for yourself...i lucked out and found it in the library, so it's going right to my Itunes!
0143038419|1.0|I could not finish this trivia and was very disappointed. She could not make me care about the tiniest thought she had, especially in her ashram era.  No literary or redeeming value whatsoever.  Give me a story with characters about whom I care.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|Wow. The Hunger Games is an amazing movie. I was priviliged to see it twice and look forward to hopefully seeing it again! It has slight language but not too bad. If you have read the books, they of course like all movies have to do,  you will realize that they left some content out, but they do a nice job on not making the figting scenes too graphic. I will remind you that if you haven't read the book first, you need to because if you don't, in the movie,you could be possibly confused on what is happening during the storyline.  It was a fantastic book and the movie is great too! I highly recoomend this product.
B000K7D5L4|5.0|Originally some the earlier Bergman films were harder for me to get into,<br />because most of the Bergman I saw first were from late in his career<br />and far more 'naturalistic' - 'Fanny and Alexander', 'Autumn Sonata',<br />'Scenes From a Marriage' etc. I don't think I understood that for much<br />of his great career he was as much an experimentalist (at times) as<br />David Lynch, or Fellini, or Kubrick or Godard.

B00756GKBA|4.0|Really think this is Madonna's best album since Ray of Light. More so than Hard Candy and Confessions on a Dance Floor, this one has more of her personality and ironic sense of humour stamped on the words and music. I bought it in spite of having been a bit underwhelmed by Gimme all your Luvin and Girl Gone Wild but even they fit nicely into the other, more impressive tracks. The style is future dance/pop, dare I say more along the lines of Gaga's music (only SO much better than her second release!). While Hard Candy smelt a little too strongly of an attempt to fit into what was playing in the Top 40 of 2008, this one actually attempts and succeeds to break some new ground - such a relief as this is what Madonna's fans expect of her. Were she to just start mimicking her peers it would make for a sad chapter and possibly end to her exceptional career. Recommending this one to both the fans and the curious.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I have to say that Nicholas Sparks isn't one my favorite authors. I have found that I either LOVE his novels or find them predictable. I have to admit that the television movie previews are what drew me in to this novel. I previewed it on my Kindle and enjoyed it. It is well written. Although it is a little far fetched that Logan would walk across the country and so easily find Beth with just a picture, that is what makes it an interesting read. This is a great novel for a lazy weekend spent with a hot cup of coffee and a good novel in hand.
B0063IH60K|5.0|really releaves some stress plus you can choose your deals. it works great on my kindle fire too. you can even challenge yourself on here!
B00377E5SG|5.0|DVD is good quality and plays well on blu-ray appliance.  This order arrived within the estimated time and all was in good condition. \\"Sabrina\\" is a gentle \\"chick-flick\\" with a great cast, attractive characters and solid acting. It is an old favorite of mine and when we tossed our old VHS player I needed a DVD copy for those rainy days when I want \\"company\\" while multitasking.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this is a complete copy of Mario bros. It just has a leprachaun, and some other things, but otherwise it is a complete copy. don't buy it.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Very interesting reading with the right facts and documentation. An eye opening reading for someone who wants to understand how nations have developed the way they have and how the bases for the right and wrong system motivations are key to any system. Very enjoyable read.
B000002KHB|5.0|If you claim to be a fan of Deep Purple, and do NOT own Machine Head, then Shame On You! This is that rare album that has no undesirable tunes...the whole album rocks you like it's 1973 again! Buy it, put it on your own 70s-vintage stereo, and crank it up til your ears bleed! ROCK ON!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved all three of these books! I have to say I was sad when it ended! The characters were well developed and the details were very well thought out. If you saw the movie the book is 100x better. There is a lot they miss in the movie.... Who am I kidding though the book is always better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great way to past the time. the adds don't really bother me. you get used to them real quick. For a free game I really like it because you don't have to exit app to do.something different.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the challenge of beating games to get points for more games.  some of the games seem silly but I have had a hard time getting past a few of them
B0054JELS4|5.0|Product arrived sooner than promised.  And the price, was considerably lower than all other prices quoted.  Hope we can do business again!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game set. the games are the just right mix of challenging and easy. very fun to play.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is an amazing game!!!!!! a must get for anyone! thanks glue!!!!!!<br />controls wonderfully. and is highlybresponsive and addictive. one of thebfirst games coins n credits are easy to obtain
B007885NOA|5.0|I bought this album a couple of weeks ago without having heard it. Then promptly bought everything else they'd done. Fantastic vocals, heart wrenching lyrics backed up with beautiful guitar work. He has a heartfelt voice with a accent that you could listen to all day.<br /><br />I saw them live in Melbourne last night, it is now in the top 5 gigs I have ever been to. If you get a chance to see them live they are exceptional. The type of gig where 800 people are dead silent hanging on his every word and then the next signing in unison.<br /><br />If you buy one CD on a whim this year, let this one be it. Once you've heard it you'll buy everything else. And if you can find it grab the 2CD version it has 8 tracks from the album fully acoustic.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it has lots of cool functions. it has been very accurate. so far. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great way to kill time when you're waiting around to do something. I also like to just open it up and make a few moves on commercial breaks.
B00785P2QC|5.0|good game it is a lot funner than the normal city building games fun for the whole family great to<br />play by yourselves
B007SYWFRM|2.0|inasmuch as Lauren thinks we're stupid if we have to shut down to exit she isn't holding my kindle.  the game looks like it should be fun.  the options were grayed out when I tapped the &quot;stuff&quot; button and the navigation bar to return to the home screen doesn't exist nor reappear with the usual tap.  I wont continue.  I've removed the game.  waste of time if my only way out is to turn the device off including when I wanted to back up to see options before purchasing coins.  I have lots to read and other fun games.  don't need this nor criticisms of others. p
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|it was good until its timers. messed up but if you sell the building and rebuild it and it works fine.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|If u like a challenge try this game. So much fun! Fun for any age however not so much for younger kids. Try it and c how smart you are!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Awesome book.  I feel like i knew him. Read it for biography report. Hard time choosink facts because there were so many facts.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|This would be a nice app if I could read the information on it. The background is to bright. If I could turn it off and have a black background I would be able to read the numbers and letters. I went to settings and put the background at zero percent but no change. I did buy this app and would like to be able to use it. So please help. If we could make the background black or make the letters and numbers darker it may work. Thanks, Ron
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Never have I read a more repetitive book. Too much of the story consisted of lip biting, flushing, gasping, and eye widening. Someone needs to invest in an everyday language thesaurus instead of worrying so much about incorporating the obscure word of the day.<br /><br />That being said, the premise was interesting enough to hold me through to the end, but not enough for me to continue on to the second let alone third book.
1451627289|5.0|I just finished this book on my Kindle. I have to say that I am sad I finished it - I didn't want it to end. King did an excellent job of entwining real life events with an interesting view of 'what if.' King did a masterful job of balancing all of the story lines. I think this was a particularly interesting read for me as I lived through the times of the Kennedy murder and all the fallout from that single act. I also enjoyed the 'trip' back to the mostly more innocent days of the 50's and 60's. For those who didn't live through the time, it would be a revealing peek at how life was back then. Again, I thoroughly enjoyed this book!<br /><br />Note: Amazon must time travel as well. I see that it posted this review as being done in April, but I actually posted it on May 6. And it was a Kindle book, not the hardcover, that I purchased.
0439023513|1.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />At the end of the second book, Katniss and co. have relocated to the rebel city of District 13, the city that the Capitol maintained was destroyed. From here, the characters plot their attack against the hated Capitol and President Snow, joining in the rebellion that's now taking place in all of the Districts, for a showdown between President Snow and Katniss Everdeen....<br /><br />I thought this book had potential and hoped that it would be an improvement on the second book, a lacklustre sequel to the brilliant first book. While the story of &#34;Catching Fire&#34; felt like it was dragging its heels, &#34;Mockingjay&#34; doesn't even bother to disguise its weariness. Suzanne Collins basically gives up in the third book, she (and when I began reading it, me as well) just wants it to end. She's out of ideas.<br /><br />First off, why is the rebel city basically another version of the Capitol? They're a group of people who escaped the Big Brother/tyrannical rule of the Capitol only to replicate it almost entirely in their new, separate city. I don't understand why Collins made this choice, doesn't she want us to like the rebels at all? It'd be like in Star Wars if there were two Darth Vaders fighting each other - which one do you root for?<br /><br />But that detail slips by as you realise how slow the pacing of the book is. Katniss spends pages and pages recovering from her injuries before heading off to view a battle scene and becoming injured again. So she has to recover all over AGAIN. With the focus on Katniss who is unable to leave the safety of the rebel stronghold, this allows Collins to avoid writing a potentially riveting scene of Gale and Finnick leading a covert op to the Capitol and bust out Peeta. In fact, a lot of action and exciting scenes are avoided entirely by Collins who either can't be bothered or doesn't feel she's up to writing them. So instead we get to read about Katniss recovering from her injuries, playing with her cat, blah blah zzzzzzz....<br /><br />And if you think Collins was out of ideas in &#34;Catching Fire&#34; when she instigated another Hunger Games to liven things up, wait until you realise that she pulls out that trick again with this book. Yes, you read that right, there is ANOTHER Hunger Games in this book! Except it takes place in an urban setting, in the streets of the Capitol, but it's still very, very contrived.<br /><br />The final battle is very sketchy. Once Katniss and Gale make it to the President's Mansion, an explosion renders Katniss unconscious and the reader finds out about the victory in a sort of brief outline, with a lot of exposition from Plutarch. Once again, Collins fails to write what was potentially the most memorable scene of the series, and I don't know why she didn't. It just feels lazy and, to go back to the Star Wars analogy, what if instead of focusing on blowing up the Death Star the film was about Princess Leia sitting in her cell by herself doing nothing?<br /><br />This being the final book in the trilogy, characters will die and Collins gleefully kills off characters she's built up, once the attack on the Capitol finally gets going. But don't expect anything memorable, the characters (and one really major one) are dismissed in a line or two and then the story moves on. Even Gale isn't spared from this treatment, though he survives, he disappears and is given a line at the end and that's it - so much for Katniss and Gale's special friendship!<br /><br />What really bothered me though is the lack of triumph at the end. The evil Capitol is overthrown, peace and equality and freedom now reigns, but there's no feeling of success once you put the book down. You don't care that the rebels won because they were mostly unpleasant and unlikeable throughout. Katniss is miserable throughout as well so you don't feel good about her because she doesn't feel good. There are no more Hunger Games and yet rather than feel glad, you just wish they'd bring it back because the characters are so boring without it.<br /><br />This third book stands in stark contrast to the first book which was hugely entertaining and thrilling to read while this third one is a chore to get through for very little enjoyment and a very poor ending, which is very disappointing, as I really wanted all of the books to be as brilliant as the first. However, Suzanne Collins' inventiveness didn't hold up as the series went on and instead of going out with a bang the series sputtered out like a damp firework. So much for the mockingjay, I'd suggest anyone contemplating reading the trilogy to just stick with the first book and move on.ing it back because the characters are so boring without it.<br /><br />This third book stands in stark contrast to the first book which was hugely entertaining and thrilling to read while this third one is a chore to get through for very little enjoyment and a very poor ending, which is very disappointing, as I really wanted all of the books to be as brilliant as the first.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|super easy game. very fun with great graphics. I would love to see it be more difficult butnthat may come
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love this little game would give 5 stars but you can't visit random friends and no one I know plays. every time I go to visit random it tells me I am not connected to a network or no Internet access or need yo reload app tor update. And lastly not enough stuff without acorns. other than that a wonderful game.
0374275637|5.0|Understanding the difference between fast and slow thinking is just the start.<br /><br />This book will force you to re-examine how you think about anything and has the potential to dramatically improve your decision-making skills.<br /><br />You'll be surprised at how easily some of the following can throw you off - what you see is all there is, the law of small numbers, substitution of easy questions for hard questions, priming, anchor skewing,  positive versus negative framing, memories versus actual experience, loss aversion, and endowment effect.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|The hunger games was a fantastic read and half way through could not put it down the end was a little disappointing but I still couldn't wait to start book 2! Am now on book 3 enjoy!

B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game is a rich hog.  I get tired of games with no story alawar has put out some good stuff
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Awful......not even near the quality as the original.  If you decide to extend your A.B. collection, skip over this poor excuse for a game and hop on over to angry birds space!
B007SSDS24|4.0|Instead of taking it for what its worth too many people try to find faults with movies. This movie is entertaining and has a descent story, people are just too picky.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is pretty awesome its really cool I love it and so do all of my friends I'm going to tell everyone I know to get this game and you should totally get it too. consider me doing you a favor
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I've been enjoying this game off and on for a long time. unfortunately the buttons dont seem to be in the right place on my galaxy nexus. but I still like it on the ancient vtab and it was good on my original incredible.<br /><br />really wish they would update to work on newer devices.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I'm not a Mission Impossible girl; never watched the other 3 - heard yays and nays about them and I can't tell you why this one got my attention. I don't trust previews as a rule. Sometimes there's no more action than what you've just seen. In Ghost Protocol that's impossible! I watched the video on my laptop but I was in the movie. I kept leaning toward the screen, motioning with my hands, reacting, reacting, reacting so involved my legs didn't have time to turn to jelly as I was running down the side of the tallest building in the world in Dubai with Tom Cruise. He was exhausted, he kept going; I couldn't let exhaustion get the better of me, I had to keep watching. His team weren't supermen, excuse me, superpersons - there was one female but they did incredible things almost leaping tall buildings at a single bound. They dodged bullets, got hit, winged it on their own just like any of us would do faced with a crisis that had to work out. I sat in that chair facing the assassin, staying calm, hoping...<br /><br />  It was the combination of absolutely shocking scenes, the Kremlin blown to bits erupting under Ethan Hunt's feet - I didn't expect that, the Secretary getting shot - who's left on their side now - that can't be fixed, together with \\"you bet your ass captain\\" Simon Pegg, not to mention the female of the team who is alluring yet as tough as her male counterparts, and the late addition analyst as the 4th member - the boy next door and full of surprises. I hear Tom Cruise is 50. That's just a number, let me tell you. I can't remember the last time I felt exhilarated after watching a film. Don't worry, I didn't go downtown and try to run down the side of a building - in the mid-west they're lower to the ground - but I knew I could if I tried.<br /><br />I just bought a copy. Why are you sitting there reading?
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This review is primarily for [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] (KF).<br /><br />I have been using Google Calendar (gCal) for years, since the moment they put it out actually. I have come to love it for a variety of reasons. I don't do smart phones (for now) so the ability to use SMS for various gCal functions was what sold it to me. That is, until I got my KF.<br /><br />Once I got my beloved Kindle Fire, this was one of the apps I specifically looked for, since I was already using gCal. SMS was great, but I felt this would be so much better. Happily I found that it is.<br /><br />This pretty much has all the functions that the web version offers, but for KF this is essential for offline accessibility. Additional tablet features (that gCal doesn't have) offer a rich set of wonderful settings that are just too numerous to list here. That goes for Pros as well. There are too many pros to list so just suffice it to say, that pros are many and amazingly wonderful.<br /><br />All that said, this loses a star for a couple of annoyances.<br /><br />#  Unlike the official Google web version, the day and week views do not display the end times of appointments, or events. This is essential. When I open the app, it's usually to schedule another appointment. I need to be able to see, in one fell swoop, what times I have open. I cannot fathom why it is written this way because it isn't like there isn't plenty of room for it, because there is more than enough room to add end times.<br /><br />#  There is no option to sync in the background. It does have a \\"force refresh\\" option on startup of the app, but most apps that have web sync options usually give you the option to sync X minutes, hours or times per day. When I'm at home, I use the web version, so it would be one less headache if I didn't have to remember to sync before leaving the house.<br /><br />All in all, this is great and helpful but just be aware of its faults as well.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Wish I could play it as good as my best friend, who is clueless about computers, IPADS, etc., but always gets me to the next level.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is like farmville on facebook but 4 times better. very fun game.  probably my favorite app on my kindle fire.
B0002S947K|5.0|Don't think he gets as much credit for who he is.  Have major critics in my house, and everyone loved him.  Hope he keeps it going.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Started and now I can't stop! Recommend it for anyone who likes solitaire but wants a little more &quot;umph&quot;. No issues while playing it on my Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think this app truly is part of what the Lord said would be fullfilled before his return.  This app allows the Word to be heard in all nations via the web!  I love the fact how easy it is to use and it even has an audio capability.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game(: This game offers a lot of fun for either kids, or even teens, like myself five stars yeah
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just finished the second book, and I must say I enoyed it more than the first one. I couldn't put it down. This book was so much more than the first one. I'm clicking the buy now for the third one now.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the Irish Mario I love this game cause I'm Irish its cool how the bores are so similar its very cool
B007J4T2G8|4.0|As the other reviews stated there are a lot of repetivie sayings about his grey eyes and long fingers, and I am surprised that I continued to read this book, but I couldn't put it down. In the book Christian is arrogant, and very sexy, an I guess that is why I was drawn in to. In the book there was alot of hot scenes, which I think it was not really needed. I bought the second book, which I am almost finished, and more than likely I will be purchasing the third as well.
0385344228|5.0|Stomach-clenching, this book puts you right in there feeling the pain and angst of a parent, loving your child more than anything and faced with horrible decisions, facts coming at you from every direction that break your heart. This is a legal thriller, shocking and emotionally draining, about a murder trial with heartbreaking details that lead to so many twists in the storyline. What would we do if our son was implicated as the prime suspect of a murder case? The writing is superb! The conversations are so real, so filled with love, compassion but also doubt, and misery. This will leave you emotionally drained. It couldn't have been written better!
B00005TQKQ|5.0|If you have a box full of old family videos recorded 10-15 years ago and you're considering dusting off the old 8mm/Hi8 camcorder to transfer these videos to DVD or computer hard drive you might want to consider running  Sony's V8-25CLD head cleaning cassette through the camera before playing the old tapes.  Just insert the cleaning cassette like you would a blank video cassette, push the play button, and in 10 seconds the recording and playback heads on that old camera are sparkley clean.  If your transferring a lot of video consider running the cleaning cassette once for every couple of hours of video playback.  You've all seen the grainy, blurry, videos posted on YouTube?  Not your video.  The scene of your cousin, Raylen, vomiting in to the punch bowl, at Uncle Ned's retirement party, will leave no doubt to his identity as the image will come through nice and sharp, as you relive that historic family moment, viewing it, at home, on DVD or putting it, out there, for the world to see.

0345803485|5.0|I usually wait until I finish a book before I write a review...actually I always wait but I couldn't wait with this one.  I have always enjoyed romance novels, i'm fairly young (26) with no children and a wonderful man of my own but have never been in this type of domineering relationship and I found at times when reading the book that I wished my partner were more forward and take charge, anyways, when I saw a recent spot on morning television talking about this book I thought I would pick it up.  I really don't think (from what I have read so far) that the critics are being fair with this author. I like the simplistic writing style, her use of witty emails between the hero and heroin are genius. The book is not the \\"dark tale\\" the media have reported it to be, I find it to be very funny with a dark undercurrent at times, and incredibly steamy! Many readers have been critical of the main character Ana, describing her as meek and easily controlled, someone with a weak mind, but even though this is a tale of a s&m relationship I actually believe Grey is the one who is powerless, his constant need to keep in touch via email and his almost frantic to have Ana....so yes I believe deep down the character Grey is just as powerless to control his desire and desire to be in her presence even if she refused his \\"contract\\" I hope the rest of book 1 and books 2-3 prove my prediction to be true and that Ana is the one who is truly holding the reins in their relationship.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|this is awesome.  most games i just remove and forget. this is as vital as tetris and solitare!<br /><br />great graphics, snappy load times, and an easy concept. LG Optimus Slider &amp; OGDroid<br /><br />i would have paid for this.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted to this game.<br /> I play it all the time. Love it.<br />Try it. You will love it too.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|My review might be better understood by sharing what I wrote to Anita.<br /><br />Anita, Is a pleasure to read your story, it is my first book bought online, just 1 hour after Wayne Dyer post it on facebook (Im from Argentina, quite far from you, and can understand all your wonderful message although english is not my native language). Just reading half of it and being so touch, so moved, it makes me read it on \\"happy tears\\". So you can be so greatfull not only from tearing down every mile that separates from your potencial reader, but from (in this moment my heart is who is telling me what to wright, an amazing feeling) reaching each of those hearts, beings, or as you say \\"love beings of a Whole One\\".  Once again, my best wishes for you, and it would sound like a plain word just to say \\"thank you\\", just as you know make it sound with an unconditional LOVE!!
055358894X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was so involved and so enthralled. This book just wrapped itself around me, I could not put it down. I was thinking about the characters and their situations when I was away from the book, excited for when I could pick it up again. I found myself reading it so fast, I had to  slow myself down, because I did not want it to end. I see the author has one sequel out, with others planned, but a little slow on publication, so I just did not want the book to end. I can't decide whether to start the sequel or not, since it may be so long before the third book is out.<br />I am not going to explain the plot, that is done in other reviews, but I will say if you like characters that grab you and won't let go, even the villains, this book is for you. If you like stories that make you laugh and make you cry, and keep you on the edge of your seat, this book is for you. If you like plots that surprise you and make you feel as if when you keep reading, something will change or turn, that keeps you wanting to read, this book is for you.<br />The author is to me just a great story teller and isn't that why we read to begin with? For a good story? This book is the real deal. Loved it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A definite must read!!! Couldn't put it down - can't wait for the movie.  What a great ending to the trilogy.
0062183591|3.0|First, the book dabbles in the controlled lab experiment world excessively.  This was a disappointment because Mr. Ariely could have made more convincing arguments by analyzing real world behavior similar to Messrs. Levitt's and Dubner's Freakonomics.<br /><br />Given the slim material on real world observations, we would expect to see a high correlation between lab experiment results cited and real world outcomes.  After all, what's the point of lab experiments if the results are largely confined to the lab setting?  Unfortunately, even in this area, the book fails to establish a strong connection.<br /><br />For starters, the experiment subjects are predominantly from a pool of college student population who are hardly representatives of society at large.  According to a 2008 research study published in the NY Times and conducted by sociologists at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, college increases risk factor for bad behavior.  \\"When male students enrolled in four-year universities, levels of drinking, property theft and unstructured socializing with friends increased.  The reason appears to be that kids who don't go to college simply have to grow up more quickly.\\"  None of this is reason enough to invalidate the experiment results, but if college student behavior is the primary source of data used to extrapolate societal behavior, then surely a more diverse pool of participants would make a stronger case for Mr. Ariely's assertions.<br /><br />A set of Mr. Ariely's experiments show wearing fake clothing or accessories increases dishonesty.  What are the ramifications of this tendency outside of the university lab?  For one thing, stiff enforcement of regulations can temper dishonesty at all levels, e.g. in Singapore.  But participants in these experiments had no disincentives such as penalties of any kind to deter cheating.  Therefore, these controlled experiments were not fully representative of real world dynamics, and their real world ramifications would have to be taken with a grain of salt.  If we were to accept the experiment results as highly correlated to societal behavior, China would be the most corrupt country in the world, with fake products rampantly sold on the open market with limited government crackdown.  This is clearly not the case according to Transparency International:  In 2010, China ranked 78th out of 178 nations in corruption.  Moreover, there can be numerous other factors contributing to cheating that can render the wearing of fake clothing as irrelevant.  If a single fake article of clothing didn't exist in Greece, cheating on taxes would be just as prevalent because of lax enforcement of tax regulations.<br /><br />After numerous lab experiments showed cheating is highly correlated with creativity - the more creative you are, the higher your likelihood of cheating - Mr. Ariely and his partner, Francesca Gino convinced a large advertising agency to allow them to administer a series of moral dilemma questions to their employees; questions such as \\"How likely are you to take home office supplies from work?\\"  What comes to mind immediately is the validity of the responses.  Which employee, knowing there would be evidence of their moral compass floating out there, would respond truthfully to these questions?  No matter how confidential the responses are, I for one would not fully trust that my responses wouldn't be shared with my employer.  At any rate, the responses showed employees in creative positions scored poorly on the moral scale than creatively challenged accountants.  Does this mean accountants are highly moral individuals because their lack of creativity reduces cheating propensity?  Do the terms \\"creative accounting\\" and \\"cooking the books\\" come to mind?  How about the infamous Enron accounting practices which \\"ignited\\" Mr. Ariely's interest in cheating  - from the first sentence of his introduction?  The creatively challenged accountants can be and are easily manipulated to reportfraudulent financial results to the public.<br /><br />And then there is the slight problem of overwhelming the the reader with excessive subconsciously induced cheating factors.  Presenting various instigating factors of cheating may give the reader the false impression that that each factor is additive.  If one factor, wearing fake clothing, increases the propensity to cheat by say 10%, the next factor, creativity surely doesn't add another 10% for a total of 20% increase in the likelihood of cheating.  Many creative individuals are fashionistas, and may very well wear fake clothing which would seemingly make them uber cheaters.  Contributing factors to cheating are not mutually exclusive;  the impact of one factor doesn't begin where another one's ends.  There is significant overlap among the various factors that contribute to cheating, e.g. deficient regulations, lax enforcement of regulations, ineffective parenting etc.  Therefore, any of the motivations for cheating discussed that does not contribute materially to the outcome should be considered as irrelevant because of other competing factors, an idea that is ignored by Mr. Ariely.  It would have been better to focus on, or at least highlight contributing factors that if mitigated would yield a significant positive impact in behavioral outcomes.  For example, government corruption in and of itself is not detrimental to the economics of a country.  Corruption combined with a flight of wealth to foreign Swiss bank accounts is detrimental.  Focusing on government corruption as the culprit for ill economic impact misses the point.<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly, Mr. Ariely excessively marginalizes the rational cost benefit analysis for our cheating tendencies.  Early in the book, Mr. Ariely dismisses the SMORC model (Simple Model of Rational Crime) as inaccurate and incomplete.  If our objective is to advance our selfish interests, many of the tendencies Mr. Ariely categorizes as irrational are in fact rational.  Rational behavior may not be moral, but even with a twisted objective, behavior that furthers the objective can be considered rational.  Iran, for example, is rightfully considered to be a rational actor by the likes of our top military official, Army general Martin E. Dempsey.  While many of the Iranian regime's actions, such as supporting terrorism may appear irrational to us, they are perfectly within the confines of advancing their imperial interests in the Middle East from a weak military position.  In the process, Iran cheats and lies continuously about anything and everything to the international community.  North Korea breaks every agreement with the West, sometimes before they are implemented.  Perhaps different dynamics are at play at the macro level than what Mr. Ariely describes at the individual level.  The SMORC model is clearly operating in full force with these decrepit regimes, and decisions that appear irrational to Western observers may in fact be perfectly rational from the standpoint of these crooked governments.<br /><br />The truth about \\"The Truth About Dishonesty\\" is that it is more about amusing individual TENDENCIES to cheat in lab experiments that may ultimately prove to be immaterial, and less about real world individual or societal contribution of these tendencies to behavioral outcomes.  I'm throwing my lot in with the rational model of dishonesty.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so great! its the best game on mobile since angry birds space!!!!!!! plus, scrats so funny and cute and weird! !!!!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|The first 200 or so pages of this doorstop were terrific. Everything you could want in a novel. So I thought King was back on track and writing a concise, interesting story like he used to do-when editors stepped in. But no, the next 400 pages were just filler, and padding. This guy really likes to hear himself type. So finally after slogging thru this thing I get to the end and--big whoop--. King is back on my \\"I think I'll pass\\" list.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of my top three games of all time. The most beautiful of any game I've ever seen, and the music is my favorite of any game. If there were an mp3, I'd buy it. Sometimes I launch the game just to listen to the music.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I'm in love with his series. I couldn't put them down!!!! It's not your typical oversexed romance book, theres conflicted love, a strong woman kicking butt, inventive worlds, and mysteries that have you guess until the end.
0439023513|3.0|Well. First off, let me start off by saying; there are a LOT of negative views about this book. And I don't know why. I shall come back to this topic shortly. Personally, I thought it was good, and had a realistic ending that made sense. It DOES, however, have room for improvement. There were some times, in which, the plot may seem to go by too fast, or not explained. Certain deaths may seem \\"vain,\\" or, \\"rushed.\\"<br /><br />(Warning, spoilers ahead...)<br /><br />For instance, when katniss blacks out several times in the book, not a whole lot is explained. This is to be expected, since this is in a first person account coming from katniss, who is the one who blacked out. Not a whole lot to explain. When Finnick dies, someone had complained about it being \\"too fast, with not much though.\\" Here's where it gets tricky. This is a book about terrible, terrible things. It is about war, hatred, anger, betrayal, fear, and rebellion. This book, in it's concept, is not pretty. This is not a twilight book where the main character is so dependent on someone  else, it makes themselves look one-dimensional. Ugly things happen. When Finnick died, katniss saw an imagined past experience of finnick flashing before her, and then up and left, lest she share the same fate as him. That's how it works.<br /><br />A few other things. Peeta's capture and disfigured personality seemed to upset some readers, saying it was pointless, even though it really wasn't. They were holding him for information, to try to beat it out of him. When that didn't work, they held him, because they knew that katniss valued his life so greatly, so if he hurt, she would hurt. And finally, flushing his old memories of katniss with bad ones, so he would try to harm katniss should he see her again, which he does. Again, not a pretty sight, but a necessary one. For me, this only added a stronger bond between them in the end, knowing what each other has been through, and finally, and peacefully living their lives. Speaking of the ending....<br /><br />I liked the ending. I really did. It was a tad rushed, true, but the main concept of it was sound. One thing that irritates me, however, is that fan's whine and complain that \\"katniss didn't pick gale, wahhhhhhhh.\\" Even more irritating, is stupid fangirl's who have automatic discontent with a book once the character they want to get with some other character, doesn't, and then proceeds to complain of how \\"depressing, dark, and sluggish\\" the book was. Do NOT ruin this book for yourself by coming in with any preconceived thoughts or taking sides with a character. It is supposed to be a story. Not a who-ends-up-with-who soap opera. If that's the case, it's hit and miss. If the person you want ends up the way you do, it's a great book. If not, it's a terrible book. (SPOILER) As far as gale and katniss go, Gale's personality was much too fiery and hostile, coupled with katniss's own strong minded attitude. And even though they are good friends, Peeta was the one who was with her in the arena. Twice. You can't break that kind of a bond. One that is only made when your life is on the line and you have to trust your life with someone other than yourself. (END SPOILER)<br /><br />All in a, a solid book, and a mostly satisfying ending for the series. And again, this is a dark series. So of course, you are going to have people crying over what they wanted to happen in the end. \\"Perfect\\" happy endings just don't happen in these types of books. And they shouldn't. And I'm GLAD it didn't, because that would take away the nature of the book itself. Now I'm not saying this is a sob fest, with absolutely no hope, that will make you depressed for weeks on end, but It might make you think. It did for me. So please, don't listen to the 1 star ratings just because they didn't get what they wanted. Read the book. I can't say with 100% certainty that you won't be disappointed, but you shouldn't be.
B005TPCQ5I|3.0|THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br />I have been excited to see this movie ever since it came out in theaters but didn't get a chance until now. And I really enjoyed it....most of it. But I am now sitting her in shock, and a little grumpy, because that movie was NOT a romantic comedy. I cried my eyes out. I just want to warn viewers like myself (who still really liked it and would have watched it anyway) that this movie is not a romantic comedy. But I thought it was well done and I loved the romance between Emma and Dex.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This trilogy was recommended by both my daughters. These books are very intense and exciting. Highly recommend them to any young and older adult.
B00406UK5A|4.0|There will be Blood! Director Neil Marshall delivers another powerful and violent action movie.  As noted this what some call a \\"Sword and Sandal\\" movie about the lost Roman Ninth.  Great music, wonderful music, beautiful cinematography, and the cast dives into all their roles giving some wonderful performances.  Too bad this \\"little\\" movie was skipped by many.  The blood and guts may be too much for some viewers but if you can handle that this movie is a nice action piece that moves fast and keeps your interest. Also Recommend Neil's movie \\"The Descent\\" for more those who like horror but seek out the \\"directors\\" cut = ending makes more sense on that edit.

B007ONQ42O|2.0|Yet another example of a band reinventing their sound to appeal to the brainless zombie consumer masses.  Their first album was great.  As another reviewer has said, this has southern rock and pop in it now.  I actually thought it sounded like a lot of the sassy strong female vocals country music that's out there now.  I know everyone changes a little to stay current, but this is just sell out garbage aimed at college age nickleback and shinedown fans who will buy into anything with breasts and a guitar.

B007FH9GT2|5.0|The movie was as dramatic as the book. For our age group a bit more graphic than use to, but should have been prepared for that as the book was also \\"graphic\\". It is just easier to flip through a couple of pages vs a few frames of movie.  Would recommend the movie, but with a reminder of some difficult graphic violence. The download was completed quickly and with out interruption during the playing. Liked the movie and the service was great. Thank you Amazon. You've done a great job once again.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great game. bug free and lots of fun. perfect game to play for a few min but can end up playing for much longer
B006XIR9KM|4.0|I downloaded and played this game while waiting for water to boil for the Mac &amp; cheese I was making for supper. A good way to pass time even if it only a few minutes. :)
0345803485|1.0|Fifty shades of gruel because this badly written novel is hard to stomach! Expected a deeper story along the lines of the \\"Story of O\\" but it is more for a younger reader, students or 20 somethings,Twilight fans, it started like a bad harlequin novel to me or teen mag article. I lost interest early on and I usually try to give a book a fair chance but this was not holding any interest for me,But I did finish it and will not bother with the two other books, seems to be written by a love struck teenager not a mature woman.According to twilight fans she stole the story of Bella and Edward?  (sorry no knowledge of those books)and just changed the characters names. It is all hype and no substance. Save your money and time.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|The book is a clear exposition of the implications of astrophysical findings to date.  Krauss explains the various theories that remain possible and why, together with a review of earlier theories now dis-proven by recent data.  This will provide understanding of current thinking in astrophysics for those with interest in these ideas but lacking in mathematical skills.  May be unsatisfying to those unprepared to align their beliefs with the evidence.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been a long time since a book gave me shivers, but Howey managed this about a third of the way through \\"Wool\\" and what a delightful plot twist it was.<br /><br />Suffice to say, this novel is layers upon layers, and what was already a clearly self-contained situation exploded in a satisfying and logical way that put the plot on steroids.  Given the premise, this is more 'social fiction' than 'science fiction' but that's me musing because this is as accomplished a story as I've read in a while.  The characters were realistically drawn, the dialogue felt natural and the balance of description and interaction was just right.<br /><br />I also liked that there were numerous shades of grey in the ethical consistency of both the characters and their history.  \\"Wool\\" acknowledges that good and bad can have blurred edges, and that perhaps the ends justifies the means in certain circumstances.  It is also ambiguous enough for us readers to inject our own belief of what came before, and that's always fun.<br /><br />Basically, if you like gritty science fiction that's more character driven than gadgets galore, then I'd give \\"Wool\\" a go.
0446572993|5.0|I have read every book David Baldacci has written.<br />Enjoyed them all, but, this one was special.<br />I hope Will Robie comes back.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a good app and fun its just like a arcade games I would get it if I were you

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this application because its free and it has a ton of awesome games that you use without buying any other games
B00785P2QC|5.0|a very addicting game. did not come across any issues. played it for a couple hours straight and didn't realize it had been that long.
B003L7DK74|4.0|Flight of the Conchords is about a New Zealand duo, Brett and Jermaine, trying to make it in the music business in New York, with the aid of their hapless manager. It's gentle fun. The musical pastiches are impressive.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really fun!<br />its a really great game that does a good job of leading you through it. its great!!  its also got good intentions and morals so its great for kids!
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a great card game and a great way to pass the time. with the choice of a winning deal or a random one.
B004SEUJYG|4.0|If you expect this movie to have a film look to it, you will be disappointed. It's spooky the way it looks like it was shot last year with HD video cameras instead of 40 years ago in glorious 70mm.<br />The aspect ratio is correct at 2.2:1, the colors look good, if a bit more vibrant than I expected (I may have to check the mode on my LG TV, which sometimes forgets to use my calibrated settings.)<br />Judging by the occasional spot that flickers by, not alot of hand effort went into this master, and I would still prefer to see a better effort.<br />At $10 on a gold box deal, it's totally worth it given that the better remastering that was talked about early last year still hasn't appeared.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|This movie was great on so many levels.In my mind the most important one was the family aspect. I also really liked the acting it was very believable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I.really love ice age village, it is a very addictive game. the only problem is that it wont let me visit other villages.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a great game anyone can pick it &amp; start playing but good luck on getting ur tablet back with a lot of battery life left because this games has such great music the player never wants to stop flying! I love this game hours of fun.
0439023521|5.0|I'm on the third book in the series, that should tell how good this book is.  It keeps you wanting more.  Well written and an easy read
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have enjoyed this game pretty well, those who have posted that you have to shut down kindle to exit the game are wrong...all you have to do it go to the menu on the lower right screen and go to settings and hit the back arrow button.<br /><br />The only problems I have come across is a glitch that took away one of my animals and it wont let me visit neighbors, it keeps saying I need to update the game and exiting it will fix it but it doesn't. oh well...I'll live without visiting them lol.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|The game was great fun until I reached about level 10.  That was when the game froze up.  I restarted my kindle and a Msg appeared that said the game needed an update.  After the update all my progress was lost. I was greatly disappointed.  :-(
B005C0DHEY|5.0|It is admirable, the effort put forth to bring this information to light. It is also frighteningly disturbing the lengths the oil & gas industry would go to in order to suppress this information. This film suggests corruption at the highest levels of government to circumvent environmental laws designed to protect to well being of the American people.<br /> While the movie is filmed on a low budget the story is well presented and organized in a way that is easy to follow. Probably the most telling feature of this film is the fact that not one person from the oil & gas industry was willing to be interviewed to explain their side of the story. There is a scene in the film however of a Congressional hearing that sheds some light on why the industry declined to be interviewed. This movie is a testament as to the power of individuals uniting together to make their voices heard, illustrating the expression \\"all that is necessary for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing.\\" I highly recommend this movie to those that want to be educated on the very real danger of corporate money's influence on our governance and the consequences.A powerful documentary.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I went to see Act of Valor in the Cinema on its release, I gave it five stars for the Action scenes alone.<br /><br />Using an exceptional blend of real-life people and original filmmaking; Act of Valor stars a group of active-duty Navy SEALs, which shows their true commitment to country, team and family. The film is inspired by true events and combines excellent combat sequences using the latest battlefield technology resulting in a true to life action film for the ultimate action/adventure movie fan.<br /><br />The film focuses on a SEAL Team and shows the secretive world of these elite and highly trained soldiers. In a story of global anti-terrorism, Act of Valor takes audiences deep into the kidnapping and rescue of a CIA operative, which reveals the discovery of a deadly terrorist plot against the US. The SEAL team is then dispatched on a race against time manhunt, to prevent the terrorist attack.<br /><br />There has been some talk about the quality of the acting, but take into account who is playing the main characters, then this is not a movie about acting, if we can believe that professional footballers and wrestlers can play soldiers then why can't we let real Navy Seals show us how its done! [...]<br /><br />As appeared in the May issue of An Cosant&oacute;ir (Defender) The Irish Defence Forces Magazine by Sgt Wayne Fitzgerald<br />[...] or [...]
0439023521|1.0|OK. I ordered this book becauuse of the great reviews. Thousands of people love it but I HATE it! I got just over 80 pages in before I decided that I should give it away to a teenager. The story is fine. The writing is horrendous and the entire story could have been condensed to at least half the number of pages that were used. Also there was not a single character that I found relatable. I was in nobodies corner... Horrible book
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|This was first time to have to deal with Ultraviolet/Sony in order to obtain my 'free' included digital copy of a blu-ray/dvd movie.  Amazed at all the hoops you have to fly through in order to have the digital copy on your computer.  Still wondering if it will still be there in a year or so.  First you have to register and come up with an ID and passwords on 2 sites, or was it 3?  I lost track late in the day.  And one site kept logging me off, and after I input the small code after help from my magnifying glass, the code did not work, but then all of the sudden the video was on my site anyway, maybe it was the praying?  But still, I could not get the digital copy where I wanted it most, to my iTunes digital file.  I did figure out how to download the download manager and I think it did actually download to my computer instead of just the Sony cloud, but I will not bet my life on it.  And had the same problem with Universal too.  No, I do not care for the promo emails so why bother?  I am not a 12 year old kid that wants the magic rings or emails telling me the videos to get since I often sit through the 20 minutes of movie reviews when I do rarely see a video at the theater.  I just miss the days not long ago when you could just stick the dvd in your dvd drive and voila' the digital file downloads to your iTunes file with no hassle or work to do.  So now, you got to pay 20 bucks for the video, and then pay again by wasting your time to get the 'free' video.  Amazing!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Super addicting series. I am so sad it is over. Very entertaining and well written. Kindle trilogy was priced excellent.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a fun app! even though to get the really good stuff it take real cash. but to exit the game you must go to the options menu to have the bar pop up o. the bitten of your screen.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is fun takes to long for energy it should last longer but I still like it my kids like it too
B001TNGOXY|3.0|I love the movie but I was suprised by the quality when it's supposed to be a blu-ray.  It was kind of grainy and not a high definition look,my Sony blu-ray player and LG tv is brand new.  I don't have the problem with other dvd's, however, this is the first old movie I bought in blu-ray.  Kind of disappointed, I could have just bought a regular dvd I guess. The shipping was fast and the dvd seemed to be in good condition.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Exactly what I needed and expected. My kids use it every day, great quality. Love the ps3, also works well as remote for the dvd player
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A sexy and tiwsted love story. A fantasticly fun and itnriguing read! I couldn't put the books down and read all three in three days.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|I like the show and have always been a fan, but this box set was somewhat disappointing. The case and episode guides are flimsy [they came apart after a few weeks], and several of the discs stopped working after being viewed only once. I never returned them because I thought I had done something wrong; however, based on other reviews, it seems as if the discs themselves are defective.
0345803485|5.0|I loved all three books was glued to book from beginning to end of third book,passing my nook around so other can enjoy them.<br />  It was steamy but a great Romance always something exciting going on.Always rooting on Anastaia in the book the whole way.<br />It has helped spice of the bedroom for sure.loved it.
1401937519|5.0|This is a book for everyone's library!! Anita's story keeps you reading non-stop to the end and then re-reading over and over again. And it's TRUE!!  What a gift that she has given all of us - sharing her amazing journey with dying, visiting Heaven, being cured of her end-stage cancer, returning to her body, ........buy it for yourself, for a loved one, for anyone fearing death!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm addicted to this app. some of the games are a little confusing at first because there are no directions, but overall, great games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I haven't used this app much yet but I absolutely LOVE that it has The Message translation. That was the main thing I was looking for in a bible app and it was really hard to find. So far it's also been very easy to use.
B007G5GYHA|3.0|My favorite scene was the dance off with the cats. Absolutely hated the ending for Humpty Dumpty. He was a bad egg. \\"Ooo,\\" says the cat with paw over mouth. Best non-liner ever.
0374275637|4.0|I purchased this on the recommendation of a professional acquaintance, so I was tentative when I purchased it.  This book is a wealth of information.  It is well-written, but is not an easy read because the concepts are complex.  Take your time when reading it and you will learn a lot about how our minds work (or don't).  I have applied concepts from this book in several work and personal situations and found the results amazing.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I love Sinead O'Connor's music, lyrics and of course vocals.  This album is a great mix of upbeat, love songs and darker, anger-tinged songs.  Mellow at times, but a few rockers thrown in.  Truly a great album that has been in constant play on my ipod. Highly recommended.
0062082353|3.0|I have read many books on World War II and the military written by professional authors.  This falls short on literary style and use of vocabulary, but it is an interesting story.  There is no doubt the author conveys his thoughts and feelings in his own words.  If your interested in what our generation's heroes think and feel while serving us in Afghanistan and Iraq, this book is worth reading.  Thank you for service, Chris.
B004EPYZV2|2.0|I really like the movie.  However, the Ultraviolent digital copy process is ridiculous!  Too many steps to download.  Can only play through the Paramount manager, which must be downloaded as well.  Can't find the movie file on my computer.  Will not play through iTunes nor will it play on a mobile device unless that device is connected to the web and the movie streamed from Paramount.<br /><br />In the future, I'll boycott all Paramount blu-ray releases and only purchase HD versions of movies through iTunes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Like the two previous books by Suzanne Collins in this series of the Hunger Games, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Why I first started reading the Games books, I have no idea, not having read anything by Suzanne before.  The initial book had me wondering whether I had got into a rather peculiar situation or not, I found I was reading something which was for younger adults and me being 80! but I kept at it and found myself being taken into this world, maybe not quite make belief, but another place.  Not horrendous or over the top, although on the other hand, mysterious and not altogether quite right! That is what got me and kept me reading, and I'm so happy that I did.  A goodly tale, and though the film is out, I haven't seen it.  Usually a film of a book I have enjoyed doesn't come up to it.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Really enjoyed listening to the Hawaiian songs while viewing the movie.  Just had to buy the soundtrack items. With few exceptions, all the performances are marvelous.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the Twilight Saga!  The DVD arrived in a very timely fashion and the price was unbeatable.  I love Amazon and recommend that anyone purchase from them.  This is a great movie and a great series for that matter, I am very pleased.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|This would have been a pretty good feature film, if released in movies. For a straight to DVD movie, it was excellent. Good video, plot, and overall acting. Worth a look if you like norsk mythology and sci-fi.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|A heart wrenching and heart warming story with beautiful cinematography and excellent acting. As far as films go, it is hard to ask for more.
B006XIR9KM|1.0|This app will not work on a Cruz t301 tablet...  It's listed as being compatible, but after downloading, it won't install...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some seem impossible which keeps you coming back for more. the kids love it while at the doctor or dentist.
B004V26A2A|4.0|I bought this book for my daughter. She needed it for some kind of school project that she was doing. I was really pleased with the option to buy new or used and also with the price. It made the book very affordable for us. It took a while to come though. I think we waiting for over a week, but other than that we were pleased with it.
1601253788|4.0|My major disappointment with this book is the cover, there was a portion of it which either intentionally or unintentionally did not get properly laminated and has worn off a bit. Being a perfectionist I find this immensely disappointing.<br /><br />My only other complaint with this book is that they continue to have this habit of creating 'groups' of monsters. The Devils and Daemons were enough, but apparently now there are Asura, Div, Kytons, Oni, Kami all of which boil down to \\"More inherently evil things\\" (with the exception of the Kami) and most of which don't even have a consistent theme, look, or abilities. Speaking of which, why aren't all oozes called \\"Ooze, (Name)\\" and grouped like that?<br /><br />There are some people that call this the asian bestiary, and they're 2/5ths right. There are a large number of asian inspired monsters, but there are just as many if not more other monsters. There are some old favorites, my particular penchant being for the Normal Animal A + Normal Animal B = Ridiculous Monster C (ie Owlbear).<br /><br />In summary the Bestiaries and their exotic monsters are my favorite part of being a DM. I wait only for the return of \\"Hamster, Giant Space\\".
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun to do and real similar to other world building apps.  only thing I find that I don't. like is that they make it difficult to sell some of items you aquifer.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am really enjoying this game.  It is becoming addictive. I just wish the energy did not go down so fast.  Very fun.
B0055SWM08|3.0|its a good way to pass the time on a rainy day. some of the levels were a little harder to get worked out.
B00005N6RU|1.0|I purchased this dvd in good faith that I could simply put it in my dvd player and watch the movie and not have my family crowd around a pc.  I went back and checked and your advertisement and it did saw region 2 disc which at that time did not mean much to me but to me it don't make sense to sell dvd's in America that won't play in an American dvd player. When people order off Amazon they look for cheapest price in order to save. Since you are not willing to pay for the return, not willing to refund the postage paid and only will refund 50% of the purchase price it's not worth the effort to return it and since I don't know anyone in Japan, Europe or South Africa I'll throw this mess in the trash where it belong.
0316010669|5.0|this guy is good! his thoughts are a real eye opener that can be used to explain many things in life.
B000G1ALRK|4.0|This album is awesome and a great introduction to eric church. it has a full range of up tempto songs to slow ballads. no filler crap on this album and be sure to buy Carolina, its awesome!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is were you build a village and is really easy to play I just downloaded this game and I am already at level 10
0756407125|3.0|In \\"The Wise Man's Fear,\\" Kvothe continues to struggle to pay his tuition at the University, escalates his rivalry with Ambrose, picks up on his on-again, off-again not-really-a-relationship with Denna, and continues his search for the secrets of the Chandrian. In the meta-story, it's day two of Kvothe's narration to Chronicler and Bast.<br /><br />This book's predecessor, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was one of the most critically acclaimed fantasy novels in recent years.  It was inevitable that the second book in Patrick Rothfuss's debut trilogy would have a hard time living up to expectations. Although it's an enjoyable read, it seems Rothfuss let his momentum carry him through the sequel.  That being said, I actually laughed out loud once as I read this book and that rarely, if ever, happens.<br /><br />The worst part of The Wise Man's Fear is when Kvothe wallows in a mystical land with a seductive fairy sex goddess.  Aside from this portion of the plot and some extensive wandering in a wilderness, the book moves quickly and readers are enwrapped in this intriguing coming of age story.  Think of this novel fulfilling a similar role that \\"The Two Towers\\" fills for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It's a more like a filler or interlude to the real story with a huge cliff hanger at the end.  Judging by how long it's taking Rothfuss to finish his trilogy I have faith that his concluding novel will be back on par with his first.
B0063GORYU|4.0|i like it for a distraction from chaos.<br />its relaxing in its simplicity.<br />allows the mind to defuse from stresses that bog us down with mundane hype.
0061122416|5.0|In his journey to unknown lands, Santiago, a young shepherd boy, has the adventure of a lifetime. He meets kings and paupers, impersonate and genuine fellow travelers, and even the great Alchemist himself - only to discover the treasure he had been seeking was in the place he least expected.<br /><br />In this parable of a man striving to fulfill his potential, Celho implores his readers to wish, yearn, and dream without any fear of defeat; to follow longings till they are obtained and the deepest desires until they are fulfilled. I recommend this quick read and inspirational tale to all interested in getting out of the \\"rat race.\\"
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a new application for me, and it makes me smile and just shake my head.  It really works.  The radio reception from all over the world is amazing.  The Kindle Fire is a great addition to my Kindle 2.  I'm not ready to retire my Kindle 2 because it's still my favorite for reading.
0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind tells the story of Kvothe, who became one of the most infamous arcanists the world has seen in recent times. Set in a world rich with history, most of which has been lost to legend, myth and hearsay, Kvothe, now in hiding, retells his story from his childhood as a traveling performer to his teenage years as one of the brightest at the world's highly exclusive University.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss creates a realistic plot that doesn't seem artificial or neatly packed together but rather tangled and random as life tends to be.  Some extol the book's descriptive prose and witty language as its best trait but I prefer the plot itself and the mystery of how the protagonist, the mighty Kvothe, ended up as a lowly bar keeper.<br /><br />The cliche \\"it's the journey, not the destination that counts\\" holds true for readers of this novel.  Enjoy the ride and don't rush through this extensive read.  I recommend it for all readers, not just fans of fantasy. I am an avid follower of post apocalyptic and dystopian literature yet this book hooked me all the same.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game! love to play this-  best game so far that i have down loaded. very User friendly and has cute redneck sayings!! ha
0439023521|4.0|Highly recommend reading before seeing the movie - the movie was very true to the book. The story is a great one that will probably be entertaining for generations to come as well as to older generations.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by several people who have recommended other good books in the past, and I heard there was some sex in it.  Teehee!  Who doesn't like to read about an occasional sexcapade? However, this book was really boring, repetitive, unrealistic, and went nowhere. The only reason I kept reading is because the psychologist inside me wanted to get to the explanation of how/why this guy was 50 shades of &*%$ed up...hate to break it to you, but there was no climactic moment when that was revealed. If Christian's horrible past is discussed in either of the next two books I will never find out because I will not be reading them!<br /><br />Frankly, I am concerned that so many people liked this story and liked Christian, and I think it's a poor reflection on the intelligence and taste in character of American citizens today!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is awesome because it has zombies in itnandnits really good<br />and I also dig the 3d graphics. I hope the next flu game is good!
0345522478|5.0|I enjoyed this book and the authors humor, if you are looking for a fun snarky book I would suggest this one.
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book. Im looking forward to reading Mockingjay. This is a good trilogy to the hunger games I enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome my little brother and cousion could play it all day long so could I
B004MC8CA2|5.0|well I would say that it is the most intresting(loving) parts and some sad parts that really come from the heart
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is a movie for our times and one of the best movie made to date. At least for me, it is my favorite movie. Perhaps it's because I'm a biologist by training and a conservationist by perspective. Thus, I see parallels with the destruction of the Pandoran forests for the desired mineral 'unobtainium' with the destruction of Amazonian rain forests for gold and mountaintop removal in the Appalchians for coal. Corporate power and desire for riches are a driving force in our culture and we immediately recognize this along with the military support to back it up. At the same time, many of us 'feel' for the 'noble savage,' or 'blue monkeys,' as denigrated by the corporate manager of operation on Pandora. The mercenary militants seem to share this 'them verse us' attitude and cannot see the forest for the trees. One of them, Jake, becomes more sensitive to the indigenous over time as he interacts extensively with the Navi, especially the female who becomes his mate.<br /><br />Through the richly peppered action scenes, our hero (Jake), overcomes many obstacles to ultimately save the natives from the alien humans. Superb action scenes with riveting suspense keep the viewer focused on the screen throughout the movie. In short, the movie is rich in special effects, the science is pretty good and extended in a believable way, environmental concerns are presented along with the general demise of indigenous populations (although in this case the Navi make a comeback with the help of 'Aywa' and the other creature of Pandora - the most unbelievable, but appreciated part of the final battle for Pandora). Add a little fantasy with flying dragon like creatures and a love story and you have a very appealing movie with some environmental, social, and economic messages that many of us can see and appreciate. Great movie, don't miss it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games and they're all really fun so far,  I cant wait to get all of them unlocked.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game, so far it's not difficult enough to be a real challenge, but then again I've just started paying, I'm looking forward to some really difficult puzzles as I play along
B00008AY3L|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of music. The title song and \\"Amen Omen\\" are definitely worth listening to. The range in styles of music was a pleasant surprise. The song , \\"With my own two hands\\" is a very cool reggae number. I believe Ben Harper has his roots, or at least a strong part of his musical influence is from reggae.  The instruments are played well. I like a lot of the lead guitar work on this disc as well as the harmony vocals. I first heard Amen Omen on a commercial and liked the song. I found the title and author and bought the disc. Very nice stuff.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a must have. a fun twist to the tower defense games. so pick this game. a free game at that. up today.
0793518326|3.0|The music transcribed is great. I wish I could give the transcription 5 stars, because the music is great. The music is so tiny though it's nigh impossible to read. Piano or guitar, the only way you can play this is by constantly stopping bending your head in and reading a tiny bit at a time. I'm not an old man, I'm in my twenties with 20/20 vision. Your best option is to bend it with great force, crack the spine and photo copy (for your own use of course) and blow it up a bit. All the work that was put into this masterpiece was ruined by putting it into such a compact medium. They should have made it 200% larger and made it spiral bound. I'd still recommend this book, despite the caveats.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a fun game for kids.  It has the same basic concept as Mario bros. Just using a leprechan instead.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it would be an awesome game if you didn't have to depend on energy. other then that negative it is a fairly good game.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is very simple to start playing and is tons of fun. It also has a large amount of levels and game styles
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read the books out of order and then saw the movie, The Hunger Games before reading the first book. So it jumped around for me, but one thing this author is good at doing is getting the reader emotionally involved. It's not real, and the logical side of my mind knows it, but I was so pulled into the deep point of view of the book that I was lost and cried for the character's. Catching Fire is a very good book. I just can't stop thinking about the series. Even after I close the book, weeks later something about it just stays with me. Would highly recommend it to anyone.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I had fun playing this app intul I found out it made noises kindansounds like a ringing tellophone!just with out the bell sound!I deleted it...never heard the sound again.........BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&divide;(  &gt;:(

B007SGM084|5.0|These books are the best book I have ever read.I loved how \\"vanilla\\" love helped heal a messed up man;and yet how kinky sex is good for a couple.Anybody with an OPEN mind SHOULD read these book. GREAT love story.
B006X96PF6|4.0|[[ASIN:B006X96PF6 Troubadours On The Rhine]]Classic Lorenna McKennitt. Amazingly rich sound for a trio. When turning up the volume to hear all the nuances of the recording, her voice can be piercing, but somehow it seems ageless and still keeps her wide range after all these years.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I find this game soothing and challenging all at the same time. When I get stuck on a level I just put it down for awhile and come back and solve it. I love this game!
6305428042|5.0|I have been watching this movie ever since I was old enough to know what a movie was. Even though I am 21 now, it is a tradtion to watch this movie on Halloween and even some of the other 364 days a year. My boyfriend laughs at my because I am so in love with this movie and will turn down dinner to watch it. I will definetely be showing my kids this movie when they are growing up and I just hope that they fall in love with it just like I did. BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
B00347A43O|3.0|I think the one driving force for audience is Chris Pine in the lead role, whilst I didn't rate him much in \\"Star Trek\\", his acting talents shine through in this role. I like that he is not content in being cast in the typical Hollywood pretty boy roles, and plays the more aggressive, merciless survivor.<br /><br />The film focuses more on the relationships between people post-apocalypse, there is not much of a back story but I don't think this is a problem, as it does not make the film dull or hard to follow. I did find this entertaining, and tense in places, with a great support cast.
0545265355|5.0|it arrived on time, good quality. my 10 year old loved it and i did too! makes a very nice and inexpensive present for kids who like to read!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love this version of Angry Birds.  It's very exciting and easy to maneuver.  I would recommend this app for anyone you enjoy Angry Birds.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a great read. It would be difficult to find a biography more relevant to the times in which we live. It is fascinating to explore how Steve Jobs, his team and his relationship with Bill Gates shaped so many of the things that so many of us use and enjoy in our day to day lives. Sam :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app just took an hour of my life. What I received in return for that hour was brain exercise that I didn't even know I was doing. All the while, I was so relaxed I can take a blood pressure reading &amp; know it won't be artificially inflated because of stress.<br /><br />The music is great. It is soothing in a way that seems to encourage deeper thinking &amp; better performance. The graphics are clean, crisp &amp; easy on the eyes. &quot;Hints&quot; are given to introduce new features of the game play, as you need them, rather than in a list at the beginning. You can repeat a level as many times as you want. (For me, that meant until I got it perfect.) And it'll tell you how many times you've been killed at the level while trying to get it perfect, WHILE keeping track of how long you've been playing the game in total, with gentle messages at 30 &amp; 60 minutes.<br /><br />Those are nice features but the best aspect of this game is that I have to think to be able to do it. I haven't enjoyed myself that much in a very long time. I was seduced into thinking, rather than being &quot;forced&quot; into it. What a delight!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I finally got rid of my VHS movies with the intent to replace my faves with Blu Ray when Amazon brought out this special set. It is a fantastic collectors set. I love it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|P & P is one of my favorite books. The characters are easy to relate to and often lovable. It's an honest and humorous read. I own it in paperback but I had to have it on my kindle. It's an obvious classic and should never be rated less than a five.

B007PKOKTK|4.0|Knew nothing about this one when we rented it for our family movie night with the kids (7 & 3), so my expectations were low.  I was pleasantly surprised by this wholesome, cute, and fairly consistently funny little flick.  The story centers around a slacker 30ish guy living at home, mostly unemployed, and without any direction or motivation, much to the chagrin of his family.  Simultaneously we meet a similarly unmotivated, directionless slacker bunny living near Easter Island with his father (none other than the Easter Bunny) shunning the expectation that he'll take over for his father and hoping instead to become a famous drummer.  The paths of young human and young rabbit meet and together they help one another grow up & discover their true callings.<br />The animation is top notch, and the mixture of live action & animation is handled seamlessly to winsome effect.  The overall attitude is family-friendly with only a few possibly objectionable bits: a brief scene where the bunny tries to get into the Playboy Mansion because he's heard it's where 'sexy' bunnies go & he considers himself sexy, and a few utterances of \\"Oh my God.\\"  The PG rating is appropriate but it's a very mild PG and probably suitable for all ages.  Even our 3 year old found nothing to be frightened by, which is unusual.<br />The biggest strengths are crisp writing and humor that works for the most part.  There were several laugh out loud slapstick scenes and the whole thing is just pretty fun.  Overall a lightweight but pleasant movie with a good sense of humor and broad appeal.  Recommended for a rental.

0143120530|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book - even with my short attention span I eventually managed to get through it.<br /><br />Besides learning a few memory tricks - which this book is NOT really about, though provides it as a nice \\"side dish\\" - I, for example, learned (and felt good about it) one validation of my views, such as \\"Monotony collapses time, novelty unfolds it\\" - as the author was drawing conclusion from the \\"hermit\\" experiment conducted by Michel Siffre, a French chronobiologist, in 1962. I thoroughly enjoyed the more complete version of the above, and even wrote it down as one of the tidbits in this book:<br /><br />\\"Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next -- and disappear. That's why it's important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives.\\"<br /><br />This is just one of quite a few tidbits and interesting facts that this book provides. Take, for instance, plateau management technique with the ruthless quote by Bruce Lee (\\"...move beyond it. If it kills you, it kills you.\\" - by the way, I was unable to find this quote verbatim outside the book. I hope Ed Cooke didn't make it up ;), the most forgetful man in the world, and the man who remembered too much, along with the Rainman real life prototype Kim Peek.<br /><br />This book definitely broadened my horizons. I would recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cute little city builder with premium content that is easy to avoid and not necessary to enjoy the game. give it a try probably worth a little of your time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun stuff!!! gotta get this if you've ever played the original on an old Mac. takes patience but if you've got that., you can play the full featured version.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I purchased this cover along with my Kindle Fire. I wanted a case quickly and did not research enough. Intially this case was $39.99, but Amazon reduced the price $10.00 and gave me a credit. The case is flimsy and not easy to prop up. I do like the color and smooth surface. Overall I think that this case would be a value in the $10.00 range.<br />I have since replaced it with a black leather M-Edge which I'm quite pleased with. It has a magnetic cover, and folds that lock into place to prop up the Fire. I impulsed purchased it at a \\"Stationary\\" Store, that sells staples.It was comparitively priced with the Marware Case.[[ASIN:B006OK0P1Y M-Edge Incline Jacket for Kindle Fire, Black]]

B000PMLFRA|3.0|No he didn't! Yes he did, because he can! Little does Mr. Lucas realize that these movies now belong to all of us and we want the originals, not these altered versions! Yes, folks... These are the unnecessarily altered versions that just really dissapoint and ruin the whole experience. I was disappointed from the moment my movies arrived, when I saw the simple flimsy packaging and especially the lack of any extra footage DVD's or within each movies extras... There is nothing aside from the boring commentaries. You would think that a trilogy of this magnitude would be worthy of so much more, but no... Not even decent packaging.<br /><br />The quality of the picture and sound of the movies, however, are absolutely amazing! I couldn't believe how fantastic and how new these movies looked, because they definitely do not look like they are well over 20 years old! I was really excited watching the first movie and extremely pleased with the picture and sound quality, until I saw a fake Jabba The Hut slithering across my screen asking Han Solo why had he fried poor Greedo...  That's when my excitement ended and I when I knew, that there would be more of this in the other episodes. For now, this is as good as it gets...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The trilogy was delivered right to my kindle account right away. Having all three books in one was excellent for reading. The book is very good and an interesting story. I recommend it.
0449806979|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm a mother of 2 kids. One is 3.5 and the other just turned 1. This book has literally changed our lives. I read this book about 3 months ago. My 3 yr old is now eating A LOT better, is willing to try new things (eve if it's one bite) and is eating a lot healthier. She is finally learning how to enjoy food and enjoy eating, at home and out. She is also sleeping better at night. It's taking a little longer to implement the things I've learned from this book on our 3 yr old but it's only taken days with our 1 yr old. He sleeps 13 hrs at night and eats everything. I never, and I mean never, make special food for him for dinner. He eats what I cook for the whole family every night. He never eats baby food. Last night I made enchiladas with kale, spinach, mushroom, and corn and he gobbled it up! We love to eat out as a family now. Our kids are so well behaved and sit through and enjoy every meal. Read this book it will change your life.
0439023513|5.0|Of the several reviews I read of Mockingjay I was disappointed with reviewers apparent lack of understanding about a person's and peoples' response to emotionally traumatic events such that Katniss and other characters of the trilogy lived through (and for some, what they failed to survive). Especially when one considers Katniss is a 17-year-old psychically and emotionally incomplete young woman who witnesses and lives through horrendous events and terrors. One need only to read of and understand the traumatic stress endured by soldiers returning from battle and war; marriages and relationships fray and die, coping with the basics of living is a day-to-day struggle, and some don't survive their experiences.<br />Katniss, as well as so many other characters of The Hunger Games, endured tremendous tragedies, horrors, and emotional battering. I believe Suzanne Collins wrote amazingly well of the ways in which post traumatic stress affects someone, especially someone so young as Katniss, yet manage to keep themselves together and go through whatever process they needed to heal themselves, and evolve in the process.<br />My opinion is that Book 3 of the trilogy, Mockingjay, is the best, and certainly the most mature, book of the series. Some dislike, complain about or lash out against the book, especially its ending, wanting something different than the honesty and reality Ms. Collins well presents. As one reviewer remarked--the ending isn't a fairy tale, nor should it have been. I agree wholeheartedly. Especially for the young people who read Book 3 and the whole trilogy, they get an honest, respectfully measured, and well-done conclusion to a well-done story.<br />(I hope that movies based on the second and third books in the series devote the necessary time and consideration of the internal lives of the characters, or at least of Katniss's character, that wasn't done, to my disappointment, in the first movie. Despite its drawbacks, Jennifer Lawrence does an admirable and fascinating to watch job of being Katniss Everdeen, just as she did in her Academy Award nominated role in Winter's Bone.)and fascinating to watch job of being Katniss Everdeen, just as she did in her Academy Award nominated role in Winter's Bone.)

1609611543|5.0|Like Dr. Atkins \\"Diet Revolution\\", \\"Wheat Belly\\" is destined to be one of the most important books on diet and nutrition of the 21st Century.  Following Dr. Davis' advice, I've lost 25 pounds in 3 months, and I feel so much better in every way.  My blood pressure dropped from stage 2 hypertension (over 160/100) to normal (less than 120/80), without even exercising (I need to start... I know)!<br /><br />It's easy, actually.  Just avoid wheat and sugar, and eat real, nutritious foods.  Read the book, and you'll understand.  It's an easy read, and Dr. Davis backs up his conclusions with medical studies and lots of personal experience as a Cardiologist.  This book has changed my life in such a positive way that I am now buying copies for my family and friends.  It's a \\"must read\\".
B0055SWM08|5.0|Ok, so I know the words &quot;perfect, zen, and puzzler&quot;, don't usually go in the same sentence, but Quell can do ANYTHING! I kept wanting to download it, but it was paid for, and I'd never bought a paid for app on amazon app store before, so I didn't want the hastle of regitering my credit card (Yes, I know, I'm lazy...) Even though it was FAOTD on and of for months, I wasn't sure a puzzle game could be worth it, and I barely knew anything about it. Finally, they offered it as the free app of the day, and I downloaded it without hesitation to try it. It is so amazing. It is one of those perfect, calm, relaxing, soothing games that never has any bugs. It is fun, relaxing, and easy to play for just a few minutes, or on hour-long car rides. I love the home-ish feel, the graphics, the music, everything! This is truely the best puzzler for android, and it is (as I already said) amazing, and can do ANYTHING. Do yourself a favor and buy it and play it for just a few minutes, scrach that, you'll be addicted in minutes... It's just that good...
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the best games of the century. I love this game along with Stupid Zombie and Angry Birds. Its Awesome.
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie to get the back story behind the achievements of this remarkable woman:  How she got into Oxford (a woman!) in the 50s, how she graduated from one of the toughest universities in the world, how she broke into the man's world of British politics, became prime minister, and how she turned around a country on the brink of bankruptcy.  Unfortunately, none of this story was told.  Half the movie was spent on hallucinations the filmmakers attributed to her later years.  What about her life!  They even glossed over her intense relationship with US President Ronald Reagan with nothing more than a dance.  I was gravely disappointed.
B004RE29PO|5.0|I received this the 2nd day it was expected to come. First off, it is of course blu-ray including the 1986 version and the 1991 version. Special Features and deleted scenes are included and the menu's are very interesting, showing facts about the film such as weapons, armor, vehicles, the marines. etc. I myself is a aliens fan. Love all but alien 3 and aliens resurrection. It wasn't all that grainy. I recomend this to all aliens fans
B005N0PJJO|5.0|Everyone has said so much already about this book and the series,  But not many people talk about what a wonderful love story it is.  The power of unconditional love is revealed, and that this love can heal even the most awful memories.  We are all worthy of this love.  This book reminded me to love my husband every day, and tell him how much he means to me.
B00005JKNF|5.0|The product was cheap even in New condition. It came in the condition it said it would be and the movie arrived in a timely manner, much earlier than the actual arrival date. The movie is crisp and new with no dents or scratches. I saw this movie on Netflix and absolutely loved it, so I bought it through Amazon. I have watched it once seen it arrived and the picture is clear and much more audible than Netflix. Give Gosford Park a shot, its a good one.

B006RUJST6|5.0|So I promised myself I wouldn't use some cheesy play on the word slammed, but daaaaaamn this book not only slammed me right out of my book slump but slammed me into total Colleen Hoover submission!! I confess I wasn't slammed right away. In fact, I was devistated. Utterly disappointed and totally convinced this was going to be another generic romance that happens way too quickly....<br /><br />I was wrong! Wrong. Wrong. WRONG!!! The turning point for me was the plot shocker and what a shock it was. My mouth was slammed wide open with complete surprise. I love it when I don't see it coming. The story was transformed into a heartshattering, heartbreaking, and passionate story of love, loss, turmoil and a whole bunch of other stuff. It was an emotional rollercoaster gone wild!!!<br /><br />This is usually where I talk about the characters I loved, didn't love, or loved to hate, but I can't. I loved them all. You don't just fall for Layken and Will's relationship, you fall for every single one! Her relationship with her mom, her brother. Will's relationship with his brother...Relationship-fest 2012!!!! I'm in love...with EVERYONE!!<br /><br />I instantly dove right into Point of Retreat without even coming up for air. I laughed, I cried, I became totally sexually frustrated!! I never saw this series coming, but it slammed into me with such force that all I can really say is read the book!!<br /><br />More reviews at: [...]

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Graphics great!  First time I played I couldn't stop.  The price was definitely right because I'm getting hours of fun.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|The overall concept was good. The structure of the game could have been more thought out and planned. For the cost of the game was worth in some since and others no. Overall to complete a game in less than one day is not good but for the cost yes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm 45 this year, and I thought... seriously why would I read this book based on kids killing each other?  I started this first book and couldn't put it down and read all 3 in a few days!  They were extremely well written and worth the read despite the hype about the series and the movie, this was one set of books I'd recommend.  Although I will say this:  The basic plot is offensive and the stories are quite violent.  It really causes some introspective thought on human nature and casts a not so favorable look at out own behavior as there are a lot of parallels to be found in human history.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it....relaxing!!!!! I love this game, not a lot of ads to interrupt!!!!!  You will really enjoy this game. Stay prayerful and blessed...

B002RKSXJG|5.0|I ordered this free Kindle book after reading the general description and other readers reviews. I was immediately taken by the story and couldn't wait to finish the book. The characters in the story are given their own narrative. Of course it written in the eloquent 19th century style which makes it a most enjoyable read. The characters are well developed and very entertaining. I am so thrilled to be able to have these free books available on my kindle.
B004SKLD9A|5.0|EQUILIBRIUM is a \\"stylistic allegorical sci-fi docudrama\\" with sufficient classical good vs evil twists to warm the heart of both nihilist and marginal moralist alike, aided by appropriate excursions of cinematic excess. Any sub-perfect plot aspects are largely rendered nonintrusive by the character and performance consistency of all the main actors.<br /><br />Kudos to the the casting director for a near perfect match-up of expected typecast personas with the screenplay characters; what often is a distraction or weakness in many films becomes another level of storyline dynamic.<br /><br />While this is not an Oscar-level Tolstoy epic, at worst it is certainly a very good 100+ minutes of enjoyable escapist R&R; at best, a graphic exposé into disturbingly probable aspects of future societal structures, some of which are already manifest in our present techno-existence.<br /><br />Oh, and the martial arts stuff is kick-ass!<br /><br />[ PS: I agree with many other reviewers regarding various sub-par distributions! The only one, in my opinion, to purchase or view is: OAR 2.35, remastered, in 5.1 audio, and Blu-ray. Any honorable production house can provide this at approx. 10 USD and stay rich all day, every day. ]
0545265355|5.0|This series is absolutely fantastic. I admit I was hesitant to read books aimed at teenagers, but then I saw the movie. I was intrigued and then read the entire trilogy in a week! The characters are so real and vivid (and might I add played brilliantly by the actors in the film).  I wish there was another one! Read these books - you will not be disappointed!
B007ED9FIY|1.0|The movie is a great movie but not for family...I repeat ..if you have any person who has morals who is a true religious person..This F_BOMB movie is not the one for you.  I cannot understand why a great actor would settle for this low crap language when he is such a good box office draw.

B003Y5H542|5.0|I simply loved this animation movie.. It is clean nostalgic adult humor using old movie jargon.  I laughed and laughed.  The writters and the producers and director did a marvelous job making this movie.<br />The kids watched..the older ones over 10 liked it those under laughed at the characters but got lost several times in the plot and lost interrest.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|The last twenty minutes of this movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, completely unable to look away. I loved Denzel Washington in this. He is probably one of this generations most gifted actors but has proven, without doubt, that he can play the action hero with just as much aplumb.And he got plenty of capable help from Chris Pine. A very effective action duo.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|I found the movie lost something.  You cannot make a movie good with alot of action scenes.  There has to be some substance and believe-ability..this movie failed by my thinking.  LOVE the actors hated the movie...BUT the price was reasonable as always on Amazon...

B00062PN6I|5.0|These are hands down the best ten dollar headphones i've ever purchased. Behringer, a name i associate with quality products, assembled, a fine set of over ear, cup, monitors from some cheap feeling plastic. Not the absolute finest audio quality, but i can't really tell the difference between these and a WAY MORE EXPENSIVE pair of similar headphones. I have been using for DJ'ing, and they are comfortable, adjustable, 1/4\\" or 1/8\\" ready (simply unscrew adapter). Heavy duty cord, with plenty of length to move freely.<br /><br />Great buy for anyone needing NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES! I cant even hear my monitors when cranked and cue'ing in the headphones while mixing. For only ten bucks i'm astonished at the sound of these.<br /><br />First day using them, if anything changes ill update my review.
