B0045OHUNM|5.0|Brilliant debut. Take Aphex Twin, 4AD's back catalog, and near-fatal dosages of LSD and mix them in a blender. Apply an ear for pop ditties and you've got something not just out of left field, but out of Planet Earth altogether. And her next three albums are equally genius. Claire Boucher has a long, weird, career ahead of her...
B008RTE09S|3.0|I noticed the language in the product details of MMT blu-ray says Italian. Why? Is that language dubbed in the film? Or is it actually in English? I don't understand that detail. HELP! Three stars for now cuz I don't know why the language is ID'd as Italian.[[ASIN:B008RTE09S Magical Mystery Tour [Blu-ray]]]
B0098460O4|5.0|I purchased this CD from AMAZON UK when it became available several weeks ago.  I do believe I play it every day, and sometimes several times a day.  Their voices are clear, crisp, unique, passionate, and uplifting.  Buy several - for yourself and for stocking stuffers.  You'll be thanked like never before!
B005FITIK0|5.0|I had to post a review after noticing that this movie has really polarized audiences.  There is no doubt this is a dark comedy - perhaps what may help people who are considering watching this movie is to know what to expect out of a dark comedy.<br /><br />Watch the trailer.  Notice that Theron's character is a walking train wreck that still makes any red blooded guy's jaw drop to the floor.  Notice that in nearly every scene in the trailer, Theron comes off as totally off, from the dog in her bag, to the binge drinking, to how she constantly tries to steal a husband who is happily married with a newborn child, and how everyone in the trailer knows she is a tad touched in the head.  If you found the trailer to be hilariously funny, you ain't seen nothing yet...that's just a warm-up to what will promise to be one of the funniest movie's you'll see in a long time.<br /><br />The laughs are similar to the laughs American Psycho delivers.  Christian Bale's signature film is also a similarly disturbing movie with another character that is totally off, yet somehow Bale is able to make you laugh again and again at lines that are so inappropriate that one can't help but to admire the comedy.  Like American Psycho, this movie also comes attached with what would otherwise be deeply disturbing content (if not for the humor), although not quite to that bloody of a degree.<br /><br />If you found American Psycho to be such a turn off that you had to turn away in revulsion, expect a similar result after viewing this film.  If you found American Psycho to be one hell of a dark comedy that was loaded with social commentary, you will find this film to be along the same vein, except with no blood and more laughs.  I have to commend Theron again for taking on a very challenging role - to act out a character that many will love to hate, will face no small amount of humiliation, and will leave audiences hating her even more when it is all said and done, all while looking her best.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|My wife and I tried to watch this two times. Each time we fell asleep. I would pay to see this one. At least on free tv, the commercials give you something interesting to watch inbetween the times the movie is showing.
B000LJB9U0|4.0|This is a great movie.  Natalie Wood's last.  Christopher Walken is great of course.  Cliff Robertson.  Louise Fletcher who played Kai Winn on Deep Space Nine.<br /><br />This is great SIFI.
B0050X1OQ6|4.0|Life many of the reviewers here, I utilized this module in a Synology product, specifically: [[ASIN:B0078RETQE Synology DiskStation 8-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage - Black (DS1812+)]].  It has worked without any issues.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney returns with in the zone.<br />Features hit songs me against the music , toxic and everytime.<br />4th #1 album in the charts in November 2003.
B00913P6G0|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air!! I only listened to the snippets before I bought it and I am glad I bought it.  It really shocked me to hear an album from the new school of hip hop that is actually worth listening to and saying that it is a classic and not just good for a second.  I believe that Kendrick's career is going places.  I hope he doesn't change now that he is becoming more famous.
0316069906|5.0|as with the other reviews I have read, a word of warning...reading this book may well change the way you eat, that's how powerful it is. This is coming from an unabashed carnivore of 60 years. An excellent book, doesn't preach or take sides, just gives his perspective, as well as ranchers, farmers, vegans, PETA people perspective.After reading the facts, you may find yourself making a decision about your diet that will surprise you.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|you should get this game Because you can get more of the sesons and you get the levels holloween and you go to Christmas and more holidays.
0738212415|5.0|I haven't drawn in a long time. I picked this book because I needed a refresher course without taking an art class. It's great for learning (or in my case, relearning) the basics. I got through the book in less than 30 days (I'd say about 20)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good games to kill time. just wish the controls and instructions were better. writing this review for free points :)
0525953728|5.0|This is a real eye opener and a page turner. A must read for anyone in the active service. Don't be put off by all the bad press about the author leaking secure info to the enemy. Nothing in here is classified nor does it pose a threat to the security of our special ops units.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Season 5 of Mad Men was great, all very interesting stories for the cast, great ending that leaves you hanging.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Trojan Horse is Mark Russinovich second techno thriller. His first one being Zero Day. Mark is a Technical Fellow in the Platform and Services Division at Microsoft, he is very well known in the Information Technology arena as an expert in security, operating systems. He is also the author of several Microsoft Press books in addition to being a regular contributor to TechNet Magazine and Windows IT Pro magazine.<br /><br />In the first book Zero Day we meet Jeff Aiken a forensics specialist that runs his own company where he travels from client to client helping them analyze how they were compromised, he covers how Jeff works to determine how malware gets in to the systems and how he is driven by his drive to find the where, what and who of the infections and security breaches he investigates, when he finds that there is more to the malware he is investigating and how it is related with several events around the world we see how Daryl Haugen from the US Computer Emergency Response Teams helps him to put the pieces together, we also see how when the terrorist find out what he is doing the dangers move from the digital to the physical world where now the attacks are no longer viruses and Trojans but a trained soldier for hire sent out to get them. We also learn about his past before the fateful attack in September 11 and how it affected his life. The story in that book centers around a plot from the terrorist group al-Qaeda to repeat their attack on the west but instead of planes and bomb the use of computer malware. Mark covers as part of the story many of the areas that many in the security community know very well and those are:<br /><br />1. How difficult is for Anti Virus companies to really protect us from all types of malware.<br /><br />2. How do many criminal and political organizations that may lack the resources to write their own tools and develop new attacks are going out and out sourcing skills from the vast pool of security professionals and coders thatare willing to find and sell Zero Day exploits to the highest bidder and are not driven by any political or Religious motives.<br /><br />3. He covers how companies many times do not take the security of their products seriously enough and do not prioritize the patching of security holes.<br /><br />4. The complexity and political motivations of the Federal government trying to control, regulate security and react to emerging threats.<br /><br />He does all this with what I found to be a very good mix of technical information, plausible scenarios, drama, actions and a bit of romance. On this his second book and continuation of the adventures of Jeff Aiken and Daryl Haugen as they run their own company and are called to help investigate an infection on government system changing information so as to influence the politics and events in the Middle East. We see how Jeff Aiken is driven again with his fascination to discover who is behind the infection and what they are doing. This brings Jeff to the attention of Governments that want to stop his work and silence him so their agenda is not affected and they can succeed in their goals. This book differs from the original in terms that instead of covering a Terrorist organization we are seeing how governments like China and Iran use the Internet as their new battle ground and are of operation for covert action. We also see how even the US government is moving in the advancement in the technologies to be able to address threat not in a kinetic manner but thru technological means to infiltrate and take proper actions in covert manners using the internet and even how to jump in to systems deemed secured and air gaped. Marks covers in addition several areas of interest for security professionals in our industry, these are:<br /><br />* How private companies help the government by providing the appropriate skill set to develop exploits and security research that can be use offensively in covert actions.<br /><br />* The shiftof malware from collecting information to modifying so as to alter event and actions in the physical realm.<br /><br />* How digital supremacy affects and influences the politics and actions of governments.<br /><br />* How governments use their offensive technological resources in the aid of other governments for political gains.<br /><br />* He also covers how many governments are willing to shift from a digital to a kinetic approach to protect such secrets and actions.<br /><br />The story takes us thru Europe as Jeff moves from country to country trying to save the women he loves and stop the plans of the Iranian government and the Chinese government who are providing them with the technology means to carry out their plans for economic gain. The book keeps the reader engaged at all times and we see how the writing style of Mark has improved and morphed in this second book. The book has the right mix of action and technology making it one of my favorites books this year. Hope to see more books from Mark that continue with Jeff Aiken and his adventures in the digital and physical
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I really enjoyed Fifty Shades Freed. It is a real page turner just like the other two books and at one point I literally couldn't put it down! I found it exciting and very romantic. I enjoyed all 3 books so much that I have read the trilogy twice back to back and will probably read them many times in the future! I really recommend it!
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica has said time and time again that they can't appeal to every nitpicky crowd so they play whatever they want. One crowd in particular is this quote unquote \\"Die Hard Thrash Metal Metallica Fans\\" who are clearly limited in taste of music. I enjoyed Master of Puppets just as much as I enjoyed The Black Album because I can appreciate music in general. But I do have to admit that I did not like St. Anger and Load. Not because they weren't \\"thrash metal\\" but because they just didn't stand out as good albums to me overall. So if being diverse is bad then why don't you slam Zeppelin or Tull who surely had some influence on Metallica. Whether it be DIO, Metallica, Maiden, Priest, Megadeth, Sabbath, Zeppelin, Purple, Tull....etc.; It is still good music no matter what petty sub-genre you think matters. Metallica never sold out. The real sell out would have been releasing Kill'em all type albums over and over again. I hope that clears this up.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I enjoyed Fifty Shades Darker very much. It is a real page turner! I found the developement of the characters interesting but mostly I found it to be very romantic! A lot of sex, yes but the romance was, for me, stronger. I really recommend it.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Although I did overall love this book, I hated the ending. But I suppose the sequel ( which I will be buying) will sum it up for me in the majestic, descriptive writing that is Lauren Oliver. I will not give anything away, for I hate it when people do that, but I will warn you, prepare to be bawling. I hope Pandemonium will be just as good, and I look forward to accompanying Lena for another suspenseful ride. Hope you love it as much as I did!!!
B00975L81Y|4.0|This certainly isn't their best album and this doesn't really have a \\"Principle of Evil Made Flesh\\" vibe like Paul Allender claims, but it is a decent effort and a fun listen.  It doesn't have the same atmospheric qualities that the older albums do of course, but it's certainly better than the last three records.  I'd but it on the same level as \\"Nymphetamine\\" or \\"Damnation and a Day\\", where it isn't necessarily great but it's fun.  If you hate this band, this certainly will not change your mind and I would stay away from it.  If you like them, it's worth adding to your collection.
B009YDB2QK|4.0|This episode sets the scene for Woodbury and the Governor. It is more scene and exposition and less action. Pay attention to the details. As a fan of the graphic novels, I am very curious to see how this storyline plays out.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This Movie has to be the best out Of the dc products I do wish Dc would be more Bold & Not be affraid of making a more adult More Anime Movie & not just another cartoon Batman Is To deep for just another Cartoon! Loved this One & can't wait for the part two
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Great book, full of useful info written in a clear, concise way.  Read it cover to cover in an afternoon and started implementing what I'd learned immediately!  If you have anything to do with web design, development, user experience, user interface design, even print design then you can't afford to not read this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|a great game ....i wish the playing time was increased. i hate waiting for energy. costs are too high also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book! Love all of it. If you have not read this book read it right away!
0316228532|4.0|After the 7-book Harry Potter series, Ms Rowling has made a successful leap to an adult novel filled with intrigue, adventure and humor.  Well done.
B00913DPW2|2.0|Initially looked good, but within 10 minutes of play, I'd found an important item, but when I expanded inventory to access it, inventory was empty. Apparently either the game is just buggy, or it can't properly handle larger displays.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Simple and fast.  One of those games you pick up and play for a few minutes of mindless entertainment.  Tons of levels - but essentially, all the same, just larger areas and dots to deal with.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|. . . Because I like the series.  I was disappointed with this latest installment of Riordan's Olympian story.  I found it to be sluggish, with little of Riordan's usual sparkle.  I'm hoping this is a transitional piece, simply there to prepare us for the journey to Tarturus.  The cliffhanger ending is great, though - despite the fact that we have to wait another year for the next installment.
B008G33OJM|1.0|I have had 3 replacement BluRay Discs and none of them play.  They have been tried in 4 different machines and nothing.  There is a serious problem with the BluRay discs and it is on many forum sites where people cannot play the BluRay, but they can play the DVD.  This company did an awful job of quality control and have caused a lot of issues.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app was just what I was waiting for!!!! Great way to Pin pin pin!!!! You won't be disappointed!! Prepare for addiction!!!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|... But can't wait for more ;) its a very surprising ending i think. Definitely didn't see that coming after finishing the first book!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Anyone thinking about getting this version, do yourself a favor. Stop thinking and get it. You will not be sorry. It's a fantastic movie and looks great in all formats.
1594744769|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! Wonderful find! So fun to have pictures mixed in ;) Such an exciting story...could not put it down....I want more ;) hehe
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a great movie. I wish I had went to the theaters to see this. I will add this to my collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could care less what other people say about this book i love it and have read all of the books. I don't look at this book as being just about sex, is about change and unconditional lover and learning to be loved despite what flaws you may have and frankly I think this book should be a mandatory read for men lol minus the kinky stuff it really explains how to pleasure a woman through a use of her senses.... I'm just saying:)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great collection of the Wool books. Wool 1 & 3 are the best stories, while 2 & 4 feel more like bridge works between the odd books.  Wool 1-3 are each told from the point of view of one person and have one theme - I especially enjoy the journey of 1 and 3 because you know the conclusion at the start of the story and then learn how that came to be.  Wool 4 and 5 are told from many different points of view and aren't quite as focused.  All of the stories are an enjoyable read and leave a painting of a world that you'd like to see more stories from.
B009329ZF2|2.0|look I'm a screw up but i know every thing. ooh crap every one is dead i need to take charge ,,,<br /> I'm the hero<br />the end<br /> that was the movie..<br />i saved you 19.99

B009NQKPUW|3.0|so is it a spinn off or is it a start<br />who knows<br />ewww awww o crap every one is dead thats the move..
0547569653|5.0|\\"Eat and Run\\" is a fascinating story that is as much about a man's search for zen and the meaning of his own life as it is a recollection of training and running ultramarathons. I think what really made me appreciate this book was how humble Scott comes across, even in light of being one of the world's legends in the field of ultrarunning. This is in complete contrast with someone like Dean Karnazes, who is much more likely to come across as boasting. I have read several running books in the last couple of years, including \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Ultramarathon Man\\", \\"The Lola Papers\\", or \\"My Life On The Run\\". While they all have something valuable to offer, this one in particular really struck a chord with me. I guess \\"Born To Run\\" would be a close second.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i can save my craft projects that i find on the web for easy retrieval. Make a grocery list to retrieve @ the store.  This has made my life easier.  Still finding new things to use this for everyday.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I usually want to know if someone saw the movie at a theater, was it worth the premium evening price, matinee price, wait and rent the DVD.  The highest rating for me would be to pay the premium price, and later buy the DVD.  I rented this one, and watched it after downloading.  It was full of action, had a reasonably good story line.  I would rate it to watch at a matinee, or download as I did.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome movie, we love it! The effects are really cool, in general the movie was great.. I cant wait for the next one.
0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling has hit it out of the park once again.  She has the wonderful ability to make you feel, taste and smell everything the character tastes, feels and smells.  A must-read!
1469984202|5.0|I had fallen down the Amazon Rabbit Hole, looking for something to read while waiting (impatiently) for Justin Cronin's \\"The Twelve\\" to be released and my mouse settled on Wool - Omnibus Edition. It was the last line of the description that sucked me in...\\"they are given exactly what they ask for...\\" How can you click away from that?!?!?! I don't get a lot of time to read during my days, but I've been reading my equivalent of \\"can't put it down\\". (\\"The Twelve\\" has been out for a few weeks already - I haven't touched it...I'll get there, but I have to find out what happens!!! I'm just finishing up Book 5. This is smart reading, and you can't help but become part of the Silo. It's a must-read!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a game worth the price, of nothing! It is a fun, addicting game that helps pass time. sitting in a doctors office or waiting for an appointment? Play Flow Free!!:)
B009OA57MI|5.0|This app is really good. This company has other great apps out there. For this app to stay great they need to update it every so often with new planes.
B007SGM084|4.0|l never was so captivated in a story in a very long time. I hope there will be more in the near future. I was disappointed when I finished them all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was captivated from page 1. I was emotional wanting more, and more it held me close I became Anastasia. I've heard bout this book. From everyone seen woman reading it on the train now I know the expressions they made and why lol
B00913DPW2|5.0|this is a fun game to play, I love it!!!!  :) just be very careful with using you're hints and watch out for the zombie in the basement he's one ugly scary dude!!
B000FC1D0O|2.0|This is some weird victorian translation.  With some gems like \\"Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it.\\"  Awesome, if for some reason you enjoy superfluous victorian english.  It is like someone wanted to translate this text from the Greek of ~200AD and stop at 1600AD english and for some reason not go all the way to modern.  This is neither literal nor a translation that takes liberties in order to help understanding, but rather it is for those that would like some gratuitous difficulty.  If that is you, I don't judge, you might like this book.  However, if you just want a good translation look elsewhere. I thought Russel McNeil's was better though not great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The whole series is fantastic.  Would definately recommend these to anyone.  It does have graphic sex scenes so if you are shy you may be a little intimidated....
B00913DPW2|2.0|seems like a cool game, but did not run smoothly AT ALL.  didn't even make it into the house - too choppy.  i quit.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Unfulfilled.....<br /><br />The book started off as a very slow read. I stuck thru the bipolar narrative, and settled into its twisted plot, which was AWESOME. I almost couldn't believe how twisted the characters were. I fell complete in love and obsessed with the story line. Then the ending ..... Really?? That was it?? Unfulfilled!!! Unless there's a part 2, but still... That was it???
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Loved this book. Ken Follett writes such readable books & at the same time manages to teach us history. Thank you.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app has been a great addition to my devices.  It lets me know exactly how much battery I have to use and tells me exactly how much time I have left to perform certain functions.
0425263908|1.0|It's like reading poorly written Cliff Notes on Fifty Shades. Don't waste your money, even if you haven't read Fifty Shades - don't waste your money.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I didn't care for Casual Vacancy - I stopped a little more than half way through. The characters just are not interesting to me. I was disappointed.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I am so happy with this cd purchase. Another hit for a great guy!!!!!  I will continue to biy his music if he keeps cranking out such great stuff.

B00846REIS|5.0|This book kept me on edge the whole time. Can't wait to start the second one. Really well written and got
B0091REZMW|3.0|The puzzles are fun at first but quickly become repetitive.  Significant in app purchases are necessary to make more than plodding progress after the first few levels.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story line with a stubborn, strong heroine is empowering for today's young girls.  She is a complex character who commands our respect and sympathy.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Our little granddaughter loves the movie and the music. The characters and Disney's brilliant colorful rendering makes it a true classic for all. Great movie for all ages!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app -- noticed some bad reviews above BUT -- one (overheating) probably relates to trying to &quot;calibrate&quot; &amp; then plugging in charger.  Calibration IS trying to draw battery down to see how it reacts -- so yeah, if you plug it in then, it will overheat (um ... duh?) One other complaint -- Auto Open on charger connect / disconnect -- is easy to shut off in this app's settings.  I think Battery HD is pretty cool -- especially the charge level graphing &amp; voice alerts!!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a very nice game with nice graphics for a nice price. xD very well done all in all. Three modes, classic, zen and arcade. You should get it!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|It has all of the pieces for a good read. The premise is just a valid today as ever. I started his other book Trojan Horse as soon as I finished this one.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Got hooked on this album from the first listen. These guys are incredibly talented. Smart lyrics, funny lyrics, heartfelt lyrics --> awesome!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Better than 50 shades!! I loved both books and cant wait for nr3!! The writing style is good and the story is very interesting.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Really more of a solid 'C', absurd and ridiculous but for this gem of a quote: \\"Man has enslaved each other since they invented gods to forgive them for doing it\\". It would have earned an A+ if good old Abe had exterminated the Twilight twits and trampires...<br />Good thing we only spent $2.99 to stream it.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I just got this watch, and read through the directions.  They say you can manually<br />wind the watch by rotating the stem when it's pushed in all the way (this is not<br />a watch with a locking crown).  As far as I can tell, at least my watch cannot be<br />wound this way, it must be wound only with the auto-winding mechanism.  That would<br />be OK if I wore it every day, but it's not my only watch.  Also you could put it<br />on a winder, but that would probably cost more than the watch.  So if this were<br />a simple watch with no day or date, I wouldn't mind shaking it up a bit and setting<br />the time when I want to wear it, but the calendar makes this a headache when you've<br />let it sit for a few days.<br />That being said, I still like the face design, and the smaller size vs. most sport<br />watches. Mine gains about 10 seconds a day, which isn't bad considering price.  All<br />in all a good value.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|All in all I thought Prometheus was entertaining.  I'm glad I rented the movie and didn't purchase, as I probably wouldn't watch it more than once or twice.  The movie was definitely intriguing and entertaining, but definitely had some open-ended topics that were never really looked into.  It seemed like they were trying to cover too much in too short of time, so there were several things that came up during the movie that left me simply wondering what or why that happened.<br /><br />[POSSIBLE SPOILER]<br />I also didn't realize - going into the movie - that it was meant to be a prequel to Alien.  Throughout the whole movie I kept thinking to myself that it was very similar to the Alien franchise, just with a slightly different twist.  In the end it made sense why it felt that way, but even then there were lots of questions throughout the movie left unresolved.  Perhaps these will be answered in upcoming movies, but the direction it was heading didn't imply that was the case.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book has a great story even with sexing part pretty rough. I do think no children under 18 should ever read this book as they might not understand this is fiction. I think the story is a love story that has lots of funny parts and keep you on the edge of you seat while reading. I hope the author wrights more novels but doubt she can top this novel. I hope she trys. thanks
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines a thriller with  ending that is unexpected. Mack has woken up in the forest with bruises, memory lose and unsure where he's at.  Doesn't know if that's he's real name.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a great way to unwind. The music is beautiful and lulls you into a meditative trance. I look forward to new versions.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headset arrived fast. I bought this for my son. He does on-line gaming and  it works well for him.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My 4 year old loves the Angry Birds so it was a no Brainer purchase.  It's easy to set up and has provided hours of enjoyment for the whole family.  I like this one better than the Ice version.
0061122416|5.0|So The Alchemist is not the most eloquent work of literature ever written, but the beauty lies in the substance, not the style.<br />Contrary to popular belief, the novel is worth reading.  It takes a couple hours to read, but changes your perspective for the better.  It tells you to live your life, follow your dreams, and listen to your heart.  The story is not so bad either.  If you're looking for a masterpiece of English prose, then this book is not for you.  If you're looking for a short, thought-provoking story, then this is it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Nice movie. Great audio-visuals in the movie, interesting script. I Would look forward to the Prometheus sequel. Bring it on !!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This was a very fun game. But it had a few glitches like lagging every once in a while and a few times I have lost all of my progress.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|very happy with all the customizable options. i love the volume fader that gradually wakes me up! and i also like the variety in sound choices.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|When I saw that item in the list, I was a bit sceptic specifically considering the price.  Let me tell you that my knives's blades are always very sharp with this file. It is small, easy to use, fits in the hand nicely and it is very effective.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game I have evr played. if you temple run, this is the game for u. everyone should play this game!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think this app teaches you to earn your money. I love it so much don't bother buying diamonds though to expenses.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the wifi  feature that it offers to play with other people! even without wifi its awesome!! I would get it if I were you!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Booty Quest is a pretty fun game to play. I've heard about it before but never tried it. Now I am glad I did!
B009FZZFME|5.0|Was able to watch it next day hr. Great.... Fast from my pc to my xbox on my us tv...
B00136JS12|5.0|Great prices in music, better than iTunes. Awesome alternatives, and good variety. You Rock Amazon, thank you! These sales makes you want to keep buying. I was looking to update my collection, this will serve me well.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a lot of fun, but challenging sometimes. overall a good game, but it would be nice not to rely on glu credit so much
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Being a closet sci-fi fan, I was intrigued enough by the reviews and five star rating to order this series of short books (stories?) by Hugh Howey.  The title \\"Wool\\" serves as a double entendre for the stories contained herein.  The time is the far distant future on an earth that has long been devastated by some world wide calamity that is never really explained, but the world as we know it no longer exists, with what's left of our culture living in underground silos of incredible size.  While end of the earth as we know it stories are many, this series of books puts an interesting and compelling twist on the well worn theme.  My only criticism and my reason for lowering the stars I awarded was the ending, which felt rushed and contrived.  Still, all in all, a great read.  Four Stars.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is an easy to use photo editor. You can adjust the brightness, color, crop, fishbowl, and more. You can save your images on different quality levels and it has some nice filters to play with. You can even make Internet memes though it is not easy to edit what you have typed in on the Kindle Fire. That's my only real gripe with this app. Try PicsArt as well.
B00913DPW2|5.0|this game is very fun and indeed spooky. I just about bought it for 1.99 but when I saw it was free, I was so happy!  this is a great game to have for the upcoming halloween, and is a game everyone should have. be smart and haunt!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|if I were you just get world craft there are no animals to kill the only thing you can do in the game is builed
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it! I have found some amazingly creative ideas, hope to be able to use at least a quarter of them
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Today is 10/30/12 . . . Let the creep-fest begin.  Seriously, \\"Let Me In\\" is a really good horror movie.  The introduction to the main characters was delivered well. The plot development was excellent.  The way the movie begins, you don't have a clue as to who that character is until later, at which point the movie really leaps to the super-creepy level.<br /><br />I don't like to describe details about the movie because it will potentially ruin the suspense for those who have yet to watch this movie.  It will not disappoint. The \\"innocent adolescent attraction\\" as well as the \\"common bullying known to occur among adolescents\\" factor is really engaging and contributes to the eventual \\"okay, who-knows-what\\" moment--making that transition definitely creepier.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, and you don't mind that 'some' of the characters are just shy of age 13, certainly not older than 13, you should watch this movie.  On the creepy scale from 1 - 10, 10 being the  creepiest, I would rate it a 8 1/2.  Turn the lights out.  Grab a blanket and enjoy.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a easy to learn to play game that has help demonstrate basic economic skills to my nieces. To respond to the complaints about having to wait for energy to continue game play, I would say this is a key part of the teaching behind the game, it helped show my nieces that they have to think ahead (i.e. they could pick harvesting food or collecting money, but if they don't harvest the food then they can't service the businesses or collect money again till they do harvest)  The waiting for energy also encourages my nieces to come back to play again and again to care for their town without taking up huge chunks of their game playing time. I love checking my town 4 or 5 times daily when i have 5-10 min to spare.<br />In short this game is easy, fun, and a great in between game.
1616960922|4.0|In the Emperor's Soul, the usually lengthy Sanderson gifts us with a great short story of a forger who is offered her freedom in exchange for creating a forgery of the Emperor's soul (which was damaged in an assassination attempt).  There are many great fantasy writers out there, and I don't mean this as a \\"knock\\" against any of the others, but Sanderson is simply the best in the genre.  I don't know if he's even capable of writing a bad book.  My only complaints about The Emperor's Soul is that I wish it were longer, and I wish he would write another book and make this a series.  It's certainly interesting enough to warrant another visit to the characters and story.
B008MBXFEM|4.0|Though I agree with other reviewers on here concerning the feeling that this release was 'rushed' out the door to get the biggest bang for their buck---------yes, here is hoping that a special 2-disc release will be coming!--------this soundtrack still kills it (for me, at least).  Whereas BATMAN BEGINS reinvented Batman with a soundtrack that tied together emotion, horror, and action in a way nobody saw coming; and THE DARK KNIGHT took BB's themes into the realm of thriller, which made for a truly awesome soundtrack; THE DARK KNIGHT RISES continues the reinvention-pattern with taking those themes into the realm of epic on the level with Star Wars and LotR.  Watching the film, I felt the music fit the tone like a glove as its predecessors did.  Simply listening to the soundtrack itself makes one think of the epic awesomeness if Batman landed in Mordor and began to duke it out with Sauron........just saying.<br /><br />Is the quality the best that it could be?  No, and I'm sure we'll see an impressive multi-disc edition in the near future (which this time will live up to the hype).  Is the dark epic/emotional feel there as in the others'?  Absolutely, and that's enough to hold me over for now.  Did Nolan and Zimmer save the best for last?  I think so.
1440503257|4.0|The only association this book has with Harry Potter is sharing traditional English foods.  The book's author, Dinah Bucholz, took passages from the Harry Potter and provides the reader with the matching English recipe. For example, the recipe for Petunia's Pudding starts with \\"When Harry comes in after doing his chores, he notices that the dessert Aunt Petunia prepared for the Masons is sitting on top of the refrigerator... The British call any dessert \\"pudding\\"... Since the classic trifle is covered in dollops of whipped cream and often decorated with sugared violets, this is probably what Petunia intended to serve the Masons.\\" Bucholz then provides a recipe for English Strawberry Trifle.<br /><br />This is an \\"unofficial\\" cookbook, so you also won't find any of the purely unique items like Butterbeer that Harry enjoyed at Hogwarts.<br /><br />As cookbooks go, it's okay. There are no pictures to see what the finished product will look like, and the book is printed on a bond paper that won't survive contact with any sticky substances in the kitchen. It's also missing basic information such as preparation time.<br /><br />True Harry Potter fans are going to be very disappointed with this cookbook.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A Great read. Eagerly awaiting the next book.<br />I cannot wait to learn the ending. A well written story about trust .
B009346RSS|5.0|On my old tv, I used the analog output to connect some PC speakers.<br />(Yeah, they aren't as good as a proper home theater setup, but they are certainly better than the built-in speakers)<br />Well, my new tv does not have any analog audio output. It only has optical audio output, so I needed something like this to make the tv and the speakers play nice.<br />The only problem is that with my old tv, I was able to control volume with the remote, and with my new tv + this box, I have to adjust volume on the speakers themselves. I do not believe this to be the fault of the box as all it's doing is converting digital to analog.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|All the levels and games are great. Basic levels for my preschooler, and advanced ones for me. Only thing I would change is an answer guide or hint help.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this. I was debating on if I should get Blu Ray or not but I figured that because the movies were filmed a while ago, they weren't meant for Blu Ray. So I figured there wouldn't be much of a difference between the two. I'm glad I got the non Blu Ray because I can watch them on my computer as well as TV, portable DVD player, etc. :D
B000000WFZ|5.0|This sound track is beautiful and beautifully done. A-Plus!<br />Recommend to see the movie (On Demand) and then order sound track.<br />You will listen over and over.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|This app does what a $180 calculator does for 5. I think a pen would be smart and they are only ten dollars I hope. Guess I need to buy a pen soon, but with so many tablets and laptops, I am wondering if I will get the next Fire HD that is bigger or wait for next year when they get cheaper. I will have to decide this after the presidency and before black friday.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved 50 Shades if Grey this book is a must! I read it 3 times in a week! Can't wait for the last one to come out next May!!!!
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I very seldom take the time to write a review for a movie but this one just had me screaming to put down my words.  I was a huge muppet fan as a kid.  I watched the show every week.  From the spinning ribbon on the TV right before Kermitt appeared in the O until the last note was played I would not move away from the TV.<br />I had been hesitant about watching the movie as I was truly worried that it would not live up to my expectations and everything that the Muppets will always be to me in my heart.  I am so sorry I waited so long.  Yesterday while at home with my 18 month old daughter hunkering down and waiting out Hurricane Sandy we watched the movie.  At first it seemed like just a fun loving movie that reminded me of many of the reasons I loved the Muppet Show.  My daughter was tough to keep entertained at frist (but again she is 18 months old) but she sat and played and watched and played.  Then it happened and I cound not stop the tears coming to my eyes.  Just as they started the portion of the movie where they put on the show and you see Kermit ready to open the door to the O and that all to familiar music started.  It was like I was back in my parents house sitting in the living room watching our little TV and loving every minute.  What made it even more special was watching my daughter dance to the open credits, or how she laughed and jumped around when the cluck cluck trio started singing.<br />I will admit that there were times I wondered if some of the cheese of the supporting story might have been a bit much but the more I watched the movie the more I felt like it was perfect.  It clearly shows that this movie was made with the same love of the Muppets that so many of us have from childhood and it is exactly what was needed.  Anything less would not have been as moving.<br />Thank you for showing me a piece of my childhood that I am even more exicted about sharing with my daughter.  This movie showed me how much I truly wish they would bring back theMuppet show.  Our kids need the fun and wholesome entertainment and this movie truly shows you just that.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this is a pretty cool game to play. I have had a few glitches but overall this game is a lot of fun and you can play with others through facebook and gameloft.  I wouldn't mind playing this like a computer game.
B002VPEAM6|4.0|Salmon Fishing in Yemen by Paul Torday<br /><br />Belief in the impossible and the impossible accomplished.<br /><br />An interesting concept introducing Salmon Fishing from the misty cold wet highland rivers of Scotland to the hot dry treeless desert wadi that sees water sometimes. This is the vision of the Yemeni Sheikh His Excellency Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama and the task presented to the British Dr. Alfred Jones, working for the civil service at the National Centre for Fisheries Excellence.<br /><br />The unbelieving scientist Alfred Jones who thinks this an impossible task is reluctantly converted over a time and after meeting the spiritual Sheikh who believes and is focused. In the end Sheikh's dream becomes the scientist's dream and together they make it a reality.<br /><br />Humorously related the story takes on an unusual structure, presented as part emails, part letters and part diary entries, giving voices to the many characters. These take the form of conversations - between the Alfred Jones and his ambitions career-wife who thinks the salmon project is a harebrained idea and her husband a `no hoper'; insights in the dealing between the scientist and Anita Brookner who is a high powered agent for the Sheikh; and what goes on between various other characters in the civil service. The many voices and points of view can be confusing at times and sometimes there is more telling, and less showing.<br /><br />Most interesting and hilarious part for me was the true hipocrisy of the civil service, how governments work. Officials with an eye on foreign policy take credit for `all' when all goes well and wash their hands off the project when things do not.<br /><br />There are breath-taking descriptions of salmon and water, interesting fishing scenes and without being boring much information on salmon and salmon vocabulary.<br /><br />I found the end of the story a little disappointing and also found the Sheikh'agen a little weak in the end. But in spite of my view of the end Salmon Fishing in Yemen novel is a great read. Humorous, insightful, and full of interesting facts woven in seamlessly.<br /><br />Salmon Fishing in Yemen confirms the idea if one believes in something wholeheartedly, however difficult the project, however impossible the project seems, it can succeed. And that is my belief too.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is a movie for grown-ups. The screenplay and the direction had me mesmerised as a captive in the cinema. We were all so intimate with James Bond. The silences as dramatic as the chases over roof tops. These actors had to act.<br /><br />The simile of the two rats meant we were in serious Bond territory here. From the old world in the shadows without grief, to the new age of touch-screen decisions. Without grief. This old man saw the flaws as did Daniel Craig's James Bond. The humor still shines. The world is within.<br /><br />Skyfall is a top flight movie. Never mind allusions to others in the franchise, I noted respectful glances at The Usual Suspects, The Third Man, Citizen Kane and Gladiator before other Bond movies. See this movie in the cinema. I left as 007. Hands in pockets; ready for anything.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />19 February 2013. The dvd version of the movie has just been absorbed. Thunderous soundtrack of music, guns, bombs and crashes. Cinema sound at home blasts like no cinema I've ever visited! Subtitles I was looking forward to, especially what Bond says as he leaves a gambling house. Hope you note the Citizen Kane scene when the simile of the two rats is explained to Bond and ourselves. Very famous focus trick as one man approaches another who is close to the camera. Delicious Mendes.<br /><br />Now the film is filed next to the other Danial Craig 007s. Do you mind if I fantasize about working on the screenplay for the new Bond film? People actually get paid for such a thrill.
B0061S073A|5.0|It does successfully keep my child out of the rest of my Kindle and I installed it on my android phone as well.<br /><br />My 3 year old knows how to find the app and loves using it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers is a great movie.  It ties the previous single super hero movies together very well.  I watched it at the midnight showing and the movie still blew me away at how amazing it was even after seeing it multiple times.  You notice new things and different jokes each time you watch it.  Great one liners and sense of humor throughout the film.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I was really enjoying this book.  It was like \\"The DaVinci Code\\" only intelligent and worth reading, since the narrator was looking for a mysterious author and had only a handful of barely read books to go by, all with Franco's Spain as a backdrop.  Interesting characters, good pacing, all the sorts of things a good mystery/thriller should have, even if its more about books than anything else.  Then, after I'd read about 75-80% of the book, there's a plot twist.  Crucial information is revealed to a mystery that, up to that point, I didn't even notice was there!  And the best part was, with complete hindsight, it made perfect sense.  Well worth the read even without the twist, but much more so with it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I LOVE this game, I've played for quite some time and have yet to grow bored of it. I recommend the app to anyone who enjoys a good solid game!
B004ZJZQH4|5.0|This has always been a terrific movie and seeing it in Blu-Ray (with a combo pack as well) just made it even more spectacular.
B004OVDVBQ|4.0|Scary, disturbing and a real page-Turner.  Jolly good read.  Written over two time lines the plot develops with brilliant<br />Suspense
B004R6JG7G|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies from the 1980s and seeing it in Blu-Ray with the enhanced sound and picture quality made it all the more terrific.  This was one of the films that defined the 80s
1455527475|5.0|This is an every well written book that is extremely contemporaneous and relevant. Mr Smith, a capitalist with conscience, explains how the average American is paying the price for rampant unethical capitalism. This book highlights how a \\"to large to fail\\" financial giant functions in an essentially unregulated fashion, where money managers pay more attention to personal bonus payments than to developing sustainable client wealth and asset growth. After all the financial turmoil on Wall Street, despite the senate hearings and promises to change, it appears that its business as usual at Goldman Sachs. They continue to make money without the best interests of their investors at heart, in fact it seems steering their investors into complex and risky investments is now their guiding principle. Mr Smiths' book may not be the downfall of Goldman Sachs; his description of how a greedy institution abandons its principals and the feduciary interests of its clients, will make the company's inevitable collapse a lot clearer.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies, charting a course through post-WWII American history and showing how a simple man with a solid heart and strong values can be an example for millions.  I have never liked Jenny who rejects Forrest throughout the movie (despite his undying love for her) and dates a series of losers and ruffians.  Only at the end, when she has a child and is dying, does she decide to commit to Forrest.  Seeing it in Blu-Ray made it all the more special
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I used the demo first for a few days and it was great. It was really accurate and fast. However, it has become sluggish recently. There are long delays and sometimes it thinks I'm holding a button down so like if I tap \\"Q\\" it enters the number \\"1\\" instead.<br /><br />If not for the lag and delays, this would be near perfect.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Definitely one of the best superhero movies EVER! Arguably the best yet. A definite must see!<br />Even if you don't like superhero flicks but love a good action movie with a fun story line, it's a must-see.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|I would love to go to an Adele concert.  But she doesn't swing through my part of the world too often and tickets are like 5 times the price of this DVD/CD combo, so I got it.  I don't buy things like this, but I wanted to see the experience.  It's well worth it.  The included cd is in my car on constant rotation and the live versions of these songs are great, with new quirks and choices as well as her crowd banter during the show.  Good crowd banter is the mark of a superstar.  If you love Adele, get this, have a party and watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun and addictive and is almost more fun than temple run. I highly recommend this app because it is really fun.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Ken Follett's excellent historical fiction, World Without End, set in thirteenth century England captured my imagination. Characters and plot have depth. Reading the book ruined the new TV movie for me. The book is so much richer!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really love this game,  and my kids love it too! :) We think you will enjoy playing it as well. Still trying to unlock next level.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Sturdy case fits well. Glad I did research on various cases before I bought one. I would recommend this for the Kindle Fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and I had this on the ipad and I loved it. really good game!!! but for the people who do in app purchases you shouldn't since it is just a game and its not worth paying real money ( it goes with every game)
B0083SBJXS|3.0|Customer advertised under the description Marvel's The Avengers (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging). With a minor note in the product details says it only has the feature film. Very shady way to pawn off a blu-ray as a two disc combo when it only had the feature film. Disappointed.
B001JI72AI|5.0|I've watched Apollo 13 over the years and it has maintained a level of greatness unmatched by many movies. The cast was top-notch, and the story was so harrowing, that it would've taken the worst of directors and producers to not pull this off. The effects are still really good, even for it to be a pre-CGI movie. One of my top 50 favorites of all time.
1452101426|5.0|The perfect book for a lovely and very personnal Pixar Movie, an amazing movie. Together with Ratatouille this is Pixar at it's best!
0984999302|3.0|I have no doubt that this book is written by really cool people, who actually know what they are taking about.<br /><br />Running a small startup myself, I however would never find time to actually read a book this size - let alone filling out the 42 different checklist at the end. This book suffers, from what we in Europe would call what could be translated to the \\"American texbook disease\\". You guys are paid per word when you write stuf, and that shows.<br /><br />So please Blank & Dorf - next time look to your friend Osterwalder (Businews Model Generation) to se how you can make deep insights easy acessible. I have have no doubt that you're brilliant people, but either you haven't done the Customer Development yourself this time - or startup owners are just not the intended customer.<br /><br />If you could write something quickly accessible (i.e. shorter), i would be happy to pay the same amount - or even more for such a book. - Just to give you some customer feedback :-)<br /><br />Best Regards (and I mean it)<br /><br />Uffe Thorup Thomsen
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Ms. Dugard's ordeal is a parent's nightmare, and raises difficult questions about the human response to unthinkable situations and about how much to discuss with a child in case the unthinkable ever happens.  The writing is clearly her own, and more than anything else in the story reveals how much of an 11 year old little girl she still is in significant (if not chronological) ways.  But I felt she glossed too much over the details and over the choices she made along the way.  Most important, the story ends without an important chapter:  How her rescue affects her life as a grown woman and mother, and how the truth impacts her daughters.  Not that I want salacious details - the imagination fills that in just nicely.  But meaningful details about how she survived those first few years, what she knows about her female captor's role, and a serious reflection on how she got to where she did (both captive and freed) would have been the real illumination.
1416550550|5.0|This book has instantly become one of my favorites.  Kate Morton does a spectacular job of weaving an intricate web of mystery surrounding the abandonment of a young girl on a ship bound for Australia in 1913.  I love how the story follows the perspectives of several different characters, moving back and forth between past and present.  I did not want to put this book down.  The ending was so beautifully written I cried.  Definitely a great page-turner for a cold, wet, rainy/snowy weekend.
0345803507|5.0|Box was the right size for the book and it was well protected inside. Nothing looked wrong or mishandled. I will definitely be ordering more products!
B004QK5N5W|2.0|Product was described to work on the iPad two but it didn't work for it nor did it work for the iPod touch fourth generation as described
B009NQKPUW|1.0|They should have stopped with Alien.  I kept waiting for the story to gel, nothing interesting or cohesive happened.  It is a waste of time.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|We would Recommend this series for anyone.. ! You'll watch more than one episode at a time. But be Careful, it's addicting
B007MB5OCE|3.0|The story, about a 100 year old man escaping from a nursing home is preposterous, of course amusing.  His fellow travelers, or accomplices, are interesting in their own right.  You just have to suspend logic.  Characters like this do not exist, or do they?<br /><br />Nice, light read.  Pick it up and put it down without wondering  about what comes next.  No need to lose sleep.  In fact, it might induce sleep!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is amazing! I tried a few other calculator apps,  but this one is by FAR the best. I love the set up and options on this app,  it makes it so easy and quick to use. I love this app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book really kept me interested, I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to read the final two books.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|We have followed Morrison's career since \\"Them\\" days.  He just keeps cranking out good music.  We have all of his music since the early 90's and have seen him in concert (he is a little more cranky these days ) a couple of times ; never a song we didn't like, or wanted to fast forward through.  Update...  Morrison cut an album back in the early 90's... \\"Night in San Francisco\\" that was live at the Masonic in San Francisco. We think this was probably his best CD ever released. If it is not in your collection, you might want to hear a few cuts then acquire.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Fun and action packed movie in the typical Marvel tradition. You know the good guys will come through in the final reel but the suspense getting there is great! The movie leaves the door open for sequels so I'm sure we'll be seeing the Avengers again ...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun! Its great for all ages :) it was a quick download and continues to pick your brain. The only thing is that it doesn't necessarily get harder wih the next level...but that's not a detriment to getting this app
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it! every word. just dont like to wait sooo long for the third book to come out in may
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I love the bad begining.  it is a really enjoyable book  i give it 4  stars because if you‘ve seen the movie u might have been expecting more but if u contiune   reading them u will enjoy them more and more
B008XG1X18|5.0|Gone are the days of cluttering my house with magazine page rip outs. Now I can organize pictures, recipes, and inspiration for ideas easily and without clutter!!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Details like not needing to hit my D2's ALT button and gradually increasing alarm volume add up to make this app great. The multiple alarms and math problems are all features that are good at the heart of the app, but the small thing make it more than just a good, solid app to something all apps should try to be.
B008H6GHL0|5.0|this movie beats all the real action resident evil movies out of the park, although the story could of been better overall it was a movie worth seeing
B007THA4FI|5.0|An odd, very understated slice of life novel, touted as Rowling's first adult novel. About half of the main characters are teenagers, but they are not as uncomplicated as Harry Potter and friends. They have lots of problems, both real and imagined, self-inflicted and imposed by their parents. A couple of good solid cases of abuse, some drug and alcohol addiction, most parents, at least the males, are suffering from delusions of various sorts.<br /><br />Not a happy little town, Pagford, even though its image tends to the idyllic. Barry Fairbrother, popular member of the Town Council dies unexpectedly, leaving the town in shock. There must be an election, and as the several adults strive to fill the vacancy, they inevitably add more stress to the lives of their spouses and children.<br /><br />Eventually one of the teen age children makes a move, foolish and vindictive as it might be, and the adults overreact in typical ways. The main characters are two sets of friends, two boys and two girls, and a solitary girl from the Council Homes, the slum. Assorted people enjoy or suffer from assorted vices, thrash about in reaction to mostly imaginary enemies, and eventually a tragedy ensues.<br /><br />In true Rowling fashion, the real story is class warfare, the lines clearly delineated in personality and action. The Sikh family of doctors play a prominent part in the conflict, even though their instinct is to avoid any confrontation. Nobody seems to embark on any quests, nobility of spirit is prominently absent, and even \\"muddling through\\" has its limits. All that said, I very much enjoyed this novel, the meek inherit a few benefits, if not the earth, and life goes on.<br /><br />Recommended, if you are willing to take it as it was written, and don't try to make it fit your idea of what Rowling should have written.

1449410243|5.0|Now I can understand the lack of new material here in Matthew Inman's latest published product is upsetting to some, but the simple truth is that this book is continually laugh-out-loud hilarious, incredibly creative, and it has The Bobs.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, The Bobs are one of the greatest things to ever hit the internet in the forever of the internet. Better than the multiple variations of the Willy Wonka meme. Better than anything that makes fun of Gangnam Style (if you're reading this in six months from now, you'll have no idea what I'm talking about, most likely). Better than all of the wonderful pictures of things made out of Bacon. The work-week of The Bobs is just... dare I say?<br /><br />(Dare! Dare!)<br /><br />...brilliant. Inman is one of the best creative forces that the internet birthed from its electronic loins, and he's also something of a pretty awesome philanthropist. From the bogus counter-suit when he was dealing with the morons at FunnyJunk.com to the campaign to raise $$ for a Nikola Tesla museum, he's a pretty good guy. And an incredibly funny guy. And some of his work is surprisingly poignant, while being funny at the same time.<br /><br />You've been reading all this stuff for free on the internet for a few years now. It's time to give something back, and get something in return. This is a very easy purchase.<br /><br />It also helps to be a cat lover.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I would say it is really well written. The hard part is liking any of the characters. Essentially the main character is a cutter who goes back to the environment that made her want to cut. Her sister is a sociopath and narcissist. The mother is distant and wrong for how she tries to show her love which is the point for this screwed up family. The husband seems useless and for decoration. All the people even a lot of the side characters are gossip shallow fake people. It comes across that small town life is what engenders being broken.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Overall, a good game. Wouldn't pay $4.99, but pretty good. I got it when it was the faotd, so luckily I got to play it for free. $4.99 is pretty steep, so I would wait for the price to come down a bit. Probably took me about a week to beat it, and I don't think there's much replay value unless you really like swapping games.

B005S9ELQ2|5.0|Ben Affleck (The Town, Gone Baby Gone) took a true story and made a very dramatic and suspenseful film from screenwriter Chris Terrio's (Heights) screenplay based on Joshuah Bearman's original news article \\"Escape From Tehran\\".<br /><br />Afflect's choice of dramatic tension and getting some incredible performances, including his own, from this talented ensemble of players was a real surprise. Not having ever been a fan of his acting, more of his writing (Good Will Hunting with Matt Damon), he proved to me now that he not only has the acting chops, but now he can motivate and drive a major motion picture with true passion.<br /><br />The story is about the six American's who back in 1980 needed to escape Tehran because of a hostile takeover of American citizens working in an American Embassy.  Over 60 American people were held hostage for just over a year. It's a suspenseful look at what real terrorism is and was when, with the help of the Canadian Ambassador, a successful mission was executed under the guise of making a fake Science Fiction film Called  `Argo'. Complete with fake spaceships, actors and laser guns!<br /><br />Afflect is the CIA specialist who is assigned to find a way to secretly get six hostages out of Tehran without anyone knowing it. With the help of special effects make-up artist John Chambers played artfully by John Goodman (Monster's Inc., The Big Lebowski) who convinces the famous film director Lester Siegel played sharply and honestly by Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine, Get Smart) to produce and direct this fake film `Argo'. John and Alan are incredibly sharp and witty together on screen.<br /><br />Bryan Cranston (Drive, Breaking Bad) does an amazing job of playing the CIA department chief who waivers from interfering in the rescue to ultimately forcing the president himself to make the rescue a `true'go! Victor Garber (Titanic, Cinderella) gives his usual personal and thought provoking performance at the Canadian Ambassador who takes in these six refugees at the risk of his own and his wife's life. Tate Donovan's (Hercules, The Shooter) plays the nervous and sometimes overzealous leader of the six refugees who must pull off portraying himself as a fake `movie director' in order to keep their cover real.<br /><br />This movie is filled with tension building scenes and nail-biting moments where you are literally speaking to the screen as if (either in your head or aloud) these characters can hear your excitement and pleas for their safety.  Jacqueline West (The Social Network, Water For Elephants) did an amazing job of costuming for this 1979 - 1980 period as did Kate Biscoe (Contagion, Water For Elephants) who did amazing work on the period makeup and hair.<br /><br />`Argo' is a film about a Science Fiction film that really didn't happen, but was made to be real with press junkets, PR announcements and even a fake office of production just to help get the six people out alive during a time of civil war in one nation.<br /><br />It tells an amazing story with amazing performances by a now surprisingly visionary director that is in Afflect. This is not only a piece of history that we all should refresh ourselves with in these uncertain international times, but a film that will literally keep you on the edge of your seat till the last frame. This was a very well made motion picture.hese six refugees at the risk of his own and his wife's life.

B009OYTIXS|4.0|Watching the premiere tonight, director David Nutter (Game of Thrones, Entourage) did a great job of taking a dark `superhero' and making his true heart and honest motivation guide his actions. As an origin episode, the pilot always has the hardest job of setting not only the tone of the project, but also the back story that makes the series have a spine or not. Nutter did a great job of using his camera choices, stylish movement with action-packed fighting choreoraphy and getting very sincere performances out of his cast.<br /><br />Writers Andrew Kriesberg (Warehouse 13, Fringe) and Marc Guggenheim (Green Lantern, Flashforward) did another amazing job of making the backstory motivate and intertwine with the reality of present day. The story is fairly simple whereby after five years on an island, Oliver Queeen, the son of a rich millionaire with a bad reputation, comes back to civilization with heightened strength, agility and overall dexterity to make him extremely accurate, quick and very deadly. The complexity of the situations, the city and his family and friend make Oliver very confused.<br /><br /> Stephen Amell (Heartland, Private Practice) was incredible in his delivery of a young man with a major attitude change since his survival of a boating accident and being stranded for five years to survive on an island. His eyes and quiet delivery of the `new' Oliver Queen made you, as an audience, not only understand his feelings but often sympathize with his situation of returning home only to learn his mother has remarried.<br /><br />Katie Cassidy (Gossip Girl, Melrose Place) plays Dinah Laurel Lance who very convincingly makes you eager to see who she could ultimately turn into (spoilers that I know about but can't tell). Katie performance was sharp and strong and certainly is going to give Oliver a run for his money both literally and figuratively!<br /><br />Jamey Sheridan (Homeland, Trauma) plays Oliver's father who sincerely gives his son a reason to survive and has a dark past himself that only his mother, played by Susanna Thompson (NCSI, Kings) seems to be very concerned about, to the point of deception. His father does give Oliver the ultimate sacrifice. His mother married someone close to the family played by Colin Salmon (Single Ladies, Death In Paradise) and it shocks Oliver to take some serious action.<br /><br />Innocently, but extremely traumatized by her brothers disappearance, Oliver's sister Thea, played by Willa Holland (The O.C., Gossip Girl) gives him even more of will to learn the details of who is trying to kill him for information about his father. There are some incidental characters like his best friend, played by Colin Donnell (Pan Am), who is saved by not only Oliver but also by the Green Arrow himself that has the potential to pan out into something really good in terms of a guy-guy relationship!<br /><br />The pilot was impressive and I was going in a little skeptical, and concerned, but I was impressed with Stephen Amell and his strong, sexy, bold and yet quiet performance. If the series keeps up its strong storytelling and deep performances, the impressive action sequences, the artfully designed fighting choreography and clever use of real arrows, will only make watching the show that much more enjoyable.

B008966SLM|4.0|I recently saw Robert Cray in concert and he was awesome.  I love Bob's music and looking forward to his next release.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|This has got to be my favorite film of the year so far. Tom Hanks (Forest Gump, Catch me If You Can), Halle Berry (X-Men, Die Another Day), Hugo Weaving (Pricilla Queen of the Desert, The Matrix Trilogies) and Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge, Harry Potter) all gave tour de force performances, that, along with the film itself and the directors, I would be very surprised if not one or all of them did receive Academy Award nominations. They were that amazing!<br /><br />I couldn't begin to tell you how unique and dynamic each of their performances were because they all played at least six, sometimes seven completely different characters with amazing make-up changes done by supervisor Heiki Merker (Goodbye Lenin, The Physician).<br /><br />A special note goes to Japanese actress Bea Doona (The Host, Take Care Of My Cat) - she was incredibly haunting in all of the seven roles she played. Two of the roles were male! They were all completely different and masked in her various make-ups, costumes and character nuances, she is vibrant. I would nominate her for several awards.<br /><br />The story is set in the past, the near past, the present, the near future and the far future. You sail aboard the classic ships of the 1800's one minute and the you are racing on the futuristic light-hover highway of the year 2144. Mixed in conspiracy, drama, greed, envy, ego and throw in a same-sex love affair, all with the intent of the message of making decisions, good or bad, in your life can and does follow you throughout time.<br /><br />Three directors were needed on this film and for a very good reason. It is so complicated and detailed that it would have probably taken three more years to make if they didn't. Tom Tykwer  (Perfume, The International) directed the sequences called `Letters From Zedelghem,' `Half Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery' and `The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish'.  While Andy Wachowski (The Matrix Trilogies, Speed Racer) and Lana Wachowski (Speed Racer, The Matrix Trilogies) directed `The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing', ' An Orison of Sonmi -451' and `Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After'.<br /><br />The music was inspiring (three composers) Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer; the visuals were dynamic and the cinematography by Frank Greibe (Run Lola Run, Perfume) and John Toll (Braveheart, The Last Samuri) was so dynamic and awe-inspiring it was pure candy to the eye.<br /><br />Writers Lana Wachowski (Speed Racer, The Matrix Trilogies), Tom Tykwer  (Perfume, The International) and Andy Wachowski (The Matrix Trilogies, Speed Racer) did an amazing job of mixing SIX, yes SIX stories with the most complex and intriguing intertwining of character archetypes  and drama from the original book written by David Mitchell.<br /><br />This was a wonderful, mystical, magical film, filled with passion and heart and a true metaphysical and philosophical concepts of how our past affects our present and our present affects our future and how certain people, patterns, action and memories may guide our lives through good and bad times. Keep in mind all these six stories are intertwined and happening at the same time. It is a long feature, about 2 hours and 52 minutes long, yet is has amazing performances by the entire cast in each story. See the film, then come back to this review and see all the characters everyone played intertwined over the whole film below.

B003HV0TN2|4.0|The Name of the Wind seems like your usual run of the mill fantasy title and started a little slow in the first few pages BUT very quickly transformed into one of those \\"can't stop or put it down kind\\" of fantasy novels.  With wonderful, smooth writing which wraps you up and takes you away, you forget about the usual formula of \\"young unlikely hero/heroine who does it tough, who comes good and succeeds somehow against the odds.... but then there's a twist and another and another etc etc.\\"<br /><br />I finished the first book and moved on to the second which takes up immediately after the first - no long winded prologues or rehashing the first book - fabulous!.  I have 12 month old twins and let me tell you sleep is very, very precious - but I am sacrificing sleep to read these books!!!  I may regret this in a week or so but right now it's heaven to get everyone to bed, have dinner and then be swept away to a different place..

0783225547|4.0|The movie sets the context of the story at the outset when Dr Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) and his fianc&eacute;e Marianne are trying to escape in a 4-wheel drive from an eruption in Colombia. Harry makes it but Marianne is killed. Then Harry is sent by his boss Dr Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan) on a routine visit to a dormant volcano near the town of Dante's Peak. Once there Harry detects some disturbing signs that the volcano may no longer be dormant and just might be waking up. Harry warns the town's mayor, Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) that the town should be put on evacuation alert, but his boss overrules him. On a visit to a local hot spring pool, Harry and Rachel, accompanied by Rachel's two children, discover the bodies of two swimmers who were boiled to death by an eruption into the pool. Now Paul and the team arrive to investigate further. Although Paul is sceptical at first, the discovery that the town's water supply has become contaminated provokes him into action. The children's grandmother lives in a house precariously perched on a hillside not far from the volcano, and Harry and Rachel try unsuccessfully to get her to leave. When the volcano does erupt, the filming of the panic in the streets as people try to leave, and of the eruption and accompanying earthquake shocks is very realistic. This was a tense drama, well filmed and acted. Of course, in some respects, you have to suspend belief about certain implausibilities. But this isn't a geological documentary and, for what it is, it is exciting.

I don't know why Gideon won't just TELL her anything and just leaves her hanging with her thoughts.  He tells her not to overthink it, but doesn't give her any other information, and then just walks out (again).  I will finish it today and look forward to the next book.  I am sorry that I have to wait til May 2013 though !!!!!  I sure hopes there's a happy ending with these to !!!! :)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|From reading the book title, the reader knows that Jacob will require defending.  The author allows the reader to explore the possibilities of what might be fact along with the intricacies of the America's legal system (evidence,intent, etc.).  A reader can place himself or herself in the role of different characters questioning how they might respond to this situation without the obvious real danger of what reality can bring.
1427207348|3.0|I liked the book and the story but I really did not like Katherine Kellgren.  Ordinarily I really enjoy books on CD but I really had a hard time getting through this one.  First of all, the narrator spoke as though she were narrating some sort of mystery or disaster, the way her voice rose when speaking in her own voice, i.e. not the dialog.  Actually the dialog was pretty good but it was what was in between that I really did not like.  And when she would say something like, \\"Millie said,\\" she would say it so quickly that it plain sounded ridiculous.  She may be a well-respected narrator, but I will, from now on, avoid any book narrated by her.

B007G51UV0|5.0|I was a little scared about having to deal with possible bent pins or other non working components but my fears were put to rest upon visual inspection of the board. BTW, the motherboard and CPU got to my doorstep in 22hrs using regular shipping. I must have timed it just right. After visually making sure all was well with the board I hooked it up on the bench outside of the case and when I fired it up there was a red CPU led light and no BIOS screen. Looked at the CPU and stock fan for the core i7-3770 and found the fan wire blocking the rotation of the fan. Re-routed the fan wire and it booted right up into the UEFI BIOS. I'm new to this type of BIOS so of course it was very nice not seeing the same old bright blue BIOS screens of old. I have not setup all of the AI software and WiFi Go yet so that still needs to be tested out but the rest of the system is working magnificently.<br /><br />I'm all ready to overclock with the Hyper 212 evo but I don't really have the need to do so at this time. I will definitely do so in the future though.

He then finds himself involved with the San Francisco-area hi tech world including Google and other mysterious organizations in a big way.<br /><br />I really hate to write more because I am afraid that anything I say will spoil this read for you. Do yourself a favor and just read it.

0340822775|2.0|This book is a collection of novellas. The first, about a man on a ship going to California during the 1849 gold rush, is OK. The second is an enjoyable imitation of Oscar Wilde. The third is an execrable crime thriller that piles cliche on cliche, without a shred of plausible story or an interesting character. The writing wouldn't have passed a freshman English class. I suffered through that hoping the fourth novella would be better. Again a completely implausible, cliche-ridden fantasy, this time about a publisher making a fortune from a badly written novel. I gave up one-third of the way through this book.
0345803485|5.0|I heard all of the hype over this novel and gave it a go. it was interesting and I will read book 2. The way she describe the sex scenes were legendary though. It was very on point and that is what carried the book. Hopefully the next storyline is a tad more interesting.

1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children<br /><br />  By Ransom Riggs<br /><br />While browsing through Glenwood City's `New Fiction' shelves, this novel literally fell into my hand. It was the weird cover that got me to peek inside and read the flap.<br /><br /> \\"A mysterious Island. An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of peculiar photographs.\\"<br /><br /> Throughout Jacob Portman's childhood his grandpa told him some off-the-wall weird stories of growing up in an orphanage on a strange island with even stranger children. Children that never age; one was invisible, another could levitate and one could make flames pop out of her bare hands. Headmistress Peregrine could change into a bird--and there were monsters too. Yet, as Jacob grew older, he began to realize his grandpa was one screw short from being totally bonkers.<br /><br /> Through the use of very old black and white photographs, author Riggs weaves a curious and puzzle-filled mystery that even this fantasy skeptic found enthralling. Rigg's talent for creating characters that are obviously peculiar but also very human added a refreshing believability that sometimes seems sorely lacking in this popular genre. And I'm happy to report, there wasn't a vampire in sight. But there were those monsters.<br /><br /> One day grandpa Portman called Jacob at work. He was in a panic, demanding to know where the key to his gun collection had been hidden. He tells sixteen-year-old Jacob that the monsters have found him and soon he'll be dead without his guns to protect himself.<br /><br /> \\"...Find the bird. In the loop. On the other side of the old man's grave. September third, 1940. Emerson--the letter. Tell them what happened, Yakob.\\"<br /><br />Jacob listened to his final, rather puzzling words and then watched as the life slipped away from his grandpa. Off in the woods, Jacob thought he saw the monster that had torn up his grandpa as it fled into the night and so began his strange adventure. Jacob and his father fly to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he soon discovers the bombed out ruins of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.<br /><br />Bringing along several old photographs Jacob had found at his grandpa's, he discovers an old steamer trunk full of more of them. Then he finds the children--or they find him.<br /><br />\\"Then I heard a girl's voice say softly, Abe? Is that you? I thought I'd dreamed it...Then a lantern glowed to life above me, and I craned my neck to see a half dozen kids kneeling around the craggy jaws of broken floor, peering down...Suddenly I understood. I'd seen them in the photographs.\\"<br /><br />All his life, Jacob was an outcast, an oddball, the nerd always placed in accelerated classes and he was forever being bullied. Now, here on this remote island, a whole new life was opening up to him. Author Riggs brings a refreshing turn of phrase that is both captivating and clever. Though he's no RK Rowling, there certainly is a great deal to consider for the movie-version that most certainly is in Riggs future.<br /><br />And there's going to be a sequel and I, for one, can't wait!father fly to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he soon discovers the bombed out ruins of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.<br /><br />Bringing along several old photographs Jacob had found at his grandpa's, he discovers an old steamer trunk full of more of them.

B008AX18Y6|3.0|While this is a  well written book, there is too much \\"name-dropping\\" and trivia included.  Nevertheless it allows one to gain a fair insight into Salman Rushdie, the man; a man who sometimes comes across as ungrateful and egotistical.  I guess these are traits in many' if not all of us, so we should not judge him too harshly.  It was amazing to learn that the British had to invest so much in security for him, which at times he seemed not to appreciate. As usual Mr. Rushdie's prose is beautiful and lyrical.  It is somewhat striking how productive Rushdie was during the period!!  Does adversity spur us to greater heights?
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|At first it was great, no interuptions, only a small corner of the screen.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a great read and all the better from a first person objective. This one keeps you reading and hoping for more.

B000QRIGLC|4.0|The book is kind of slow at the beginning. There is a ton of background , but this is a story that every American should hear about.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Had to read to see what my wife was so enthralled in. I'm glad I did, it was a good read.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|While I really like the \\"Iron Man\\" franchise, I am not a fan of the genre per se.  I tried to watch \\"Thor\\" and wasn't very impressed.  And the \\"Hulk\\" films have been - at times - more than dismal.  So, it is surely a good thing if I give a movie such as this a four-star rating.<br /><br />The first half hour seems to move at a snail's pace, and I was thinking, \\"This is really going to be a disappointment.\\"  I believe that Samuel L. Jackson is heavily featured in that timeframe, and I am still not much of a fan of his for ripping A. O. Scott.  Personally, I think that Mr. Jackson was off-base at best and unwise at worst.  \\"Hey, Mr. Scott didn't like your film.  Who cares?\\" would be my rebuttal.  So yes, I am a little biased against Mr. Jackson because of this.  (I've always thought that Mr. Jackson is somewhat overrated as well.  Decent actor but surely not in the \\"great\\" category.  But it could be argued that Mr. Scott may be the best film critic out there.)<br /><br />But then, Robert Downey Jr. enters the picture.  Ah, you know the film will be fun then, and it is.  He is not only a very good actor - perhaps excellent at times (watch \\"Chaplin\\" if you disagree with me, one of the best performances ever), but he's also very funny.  And then Mark Ruffalo adds to the fun.  I really liked his work in \\"Zodiac\\" and he does, in my opinion, the best Hulk ever.  And it's not even close.<br /><br />This film seems to be about sticking together as a team, and having a leader who's willing to lead and followers who are willing to follow.  Sometimes, if you have the right team, you can do some pretty amazing things.  Should be a film for Fortune 500 companies to watch, and try to remember what it was like when people - and companies - actually cared about doing great work.  Well, good luck with that now in the US.  Even Captain America may not be able to save you.<br /><br />Pretty big recommendation by me.  If you're not a fan of the genre, just wait until the second act and you might become a fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the beet game ever I have it on my ipod. I got so exited when I seen on my kindle fire app store love this game

B009IKPOUO|1.0|I reviewed this for others on the day I bought the album, 2 weeks ago.  The review slightly edited follows.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I just went through all 11 songs.  Here is my take:<br /><br />1. Two songs I will play without alteration.  I do not like one of the songs, musically.<br />2. Babs owns \\"How are things in Gloccamorra?\\", making Julie Andrews' professionally competent rendition (the best I knew of, slightly above Judy Collins) sound pedestrian.  It was almost as powerful as listening to Rita Connelly sing some of her songs that I had heard others sing -- and even some of my early reaction to Rachel O'Donnell, before I grew used to hearing such a clear voice without the hangers-on.<br />3. Babs has a few \\"annoying habits\\" that come from singing to a dumber and dumber audience (as time went on) instead of to a classically schooled composer.  One of these is showcasing her profound talent at singing a note in one range -- and then jumping two octaves for the next note.  As I would note to her given an opportunity to do so,  \\"would you want to listen to this on a violin?\\"  She'd probably laugh -- and then cry.  Her second annoying habit is when she changes the volume in her singing.  Babs is one of the few people who can hold a note at almost any possible volume.  The point is not that Babs CAN sing like this -- the point is that songs should not be written to be performed like this.  And great singers should not be encouraged to be annoying for reasons of FALSE MARKETING.<br />4. Babs is occasionally forced to have \\"cowpoke choruses\\" stuck into the music.  \\"Cowpokes\\" (I can not use the perjorative in a public forum) can not sing -- falsetto is not singing.  Falsetto is noise pollution.  The cowpokes are hangers-on -- in this case trying to piggy-back over one of the top five voices of all-time.  They insult their own intelligence.  They can not insult Babs's profound talent.<br />5. The new album is supposed to be a finished product.  What this USED TO MEAN was that the first thing one would hear from a bandleader would be his first note played on an instrument.  One does not buy a Streisand album to hear anything other than hearing \\"Her Greatness\\" (she is) sing, and the SILENCE of the vocally talentless.  To hear gratuitous piling-on with pretend \\"ownership\\" tags that I have come to understand as such, makes listening to the songs that Barbara sings AS UNDESIRABLE AS ADDING GRATUITOUSLY WAILING 'COWPOKEDS' AS CHORUSES, NO MATTER HOW \\"SUBTLY\\" HIDDEN (faint choruses I have come to regard as being ways to use the diamonds (Babs) in order to get agenda-driven garbage onto a recording made by microphone -- often to \\"make quota\\").  Since when did attaining quotas for \\"cowpokes\\" (to be politically correct) have anything to do with playing music?  OVERTLY?  Marketing?  Sure.  Music?  NO.<br /><br />Should Babs resing the same songs (rewritten to get rid of the COMPOSER problems), and ditch the cowpokes and worthless chit-chat at the front of each song (annoying to listen to should I want to hear the music again), I would pay 20 times what I paid for this album.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This is. the best game ever.I love this game.this. is so fun it is so addicting.this has really good graphics
B0082KPF32|5.0|I'm not one that enjoys or even tolerates much of the growls/screams prevalent in metal nowadays and often if the growls are at the forefront of the sound/mix then I generally can't get past the vocals enough to enjoy the music. That being said, I do really like Cynic - especially \\"Traced in Air\\"  - and their use of the growls in a somewhat sparing matter that added to the music for me, not distracts.<br /><br />With these guys I heard enough in the samples musically that interested me coupled with all the great reviews to really give the album quite a few spins and I wound up really enjoying it despite the vocals. If the growls don't bother you and your a fan of very strong melodic prog-metal with some nice diversity in sound, then stop reading and buy this album, you won't regret it.<br /><br />If the growls present a problem for you then, all's I can say is that there's both clean and growls (sometimes concurrently) being used on the album and what's going on musically is well worth getting past the vocals. They carry a similar theme throughout the album which they pick up variations of throughout each song and by the time you're done it really feels like it ties the album together into a cohesive whole.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of progressive heavy metal though there's passages you'd swear you're listening to Jean-Luc Ponty's Enigmatic Ocean with as much violin as they feature throughout the album.

B005NQ94LM|4.0|So many years of annual reunions to rekindle a love that somehow is allowed to lapse while life goes on.<br />With all the struggles and success they each encounter, the one thing that endures is the tender moments these two have shared.  It makes you wonder if they will ever get together for a lasting relationship as they meander over the years, without each other.  The interaction between these two is quirky and romantic and it develops more intensity over time although they always regard each other as special friends.  I loved the dialog, the looks they gave each other, and joy they conveyed while together.  But throughout the story was a sadness and longing for them to be together, never knowing how it might turn out.  I especially enjoyed seeing Anne Hathaway in a role as a Brit.  I thought she seemed very convincing with her demeanor, accent and all.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Prometheus had a lot to live up to many thought it did not live up to the hype surrounding it.  I thought it did.  While prometheus isn't perfect I found the acting, effects and plot to be very good.  Something that I thought throughout the movie was that it didn't know if it wanted to be a sci-fi horror like the original ALIEN or a sci-fi actio movie along the lines of the sequel ALIENS, so it kind of is both.  The ending was satisfying even though it dragged on a little bit. 4/5 stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Definitely a great read...I won't spoil it but true to form the author continues to twist the plot..just when you think you know where the story is going...bam! I became invested in the characters ...truly a wonderful series!

The instructions Deb gives are clear and you understand exactly what you have to do for the recipes to come out perfectly.  She gives great tips in the front of the book to let you know what kind of ingredients she uses, so you can replicate the results.  I also like the way the book is organized.  Basic chapters: Breakfast, Main Dish Vegetarian, Main Dish Meats, Sweets etc...you don't have to hunt through an entire book looking for a recipe because it is organized according to the author's whims.<br /><br />There are cute little stories, like in her blog that talk about each recipe and they are fun to read.  The pictures make you want to eat everything.  ****EDIT****  There has been talk that she wrote too much about her son in the book.  Let me say, she puts a little snippet before each recipe.  Sometimes she puts a blurb about her son in these.  It is not obtrusive and doesn't take away from the recipes.  So, the people who are complaining about this, are being silly and making an issue out of a non-issue.  It is all recipes.******<br /><br />But, best of all, this is a normal woman who is making beautiful, wonderful dishes, that anybody can make.  I love a cookbook that is for the home cook, but that takes your cooking to new levels.

I tried to not set my expectations too high, and tried to give it a fair shot as I would any offering from a new author.<br /><br />Despite this, I couldn't get through this book. The characters were beyond unsympathetic- they were just boring. The plot was slow moving, and when it did get going, would do so in disjointed spurts to then fall away again to chapters and chapters of lackluster prose. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to finish the last few chapters.<br /><br />Better luck next time.

B000E0LB8G|5.0|I can't rate this set of Beethoven Piano Concertos against other period instrument efforts, but I can testify that after hearing these performances by Steven Lubin and The Academy of Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood, I'm not sure I have much inclination to attempt such a comparison. The performances long ago rocketed to the top of my favorites list, joining such vintage modern sets as Szell/Fleisher and Klemper/Barenboim. (I own the concerto cycle in its earlier incarnation on L'Oiseau-lyre and so don't have the sonatas to comment on.) At least one other reviewer has complained about the wimpy sound of the fortepiano versus the orchestra, and while I wouldn't deny that such disparity doesn't perhaps exist at times, I'm happy to accept it as another way these works can sound -- having the keyboard be a scaled-down collaborator with the orchestra doesn't sound all that bad to my untrained ear, as does the sound of period instruments itself. If you want old school, there are certainly several other sets you can reach for. If you hanker for Historically Informed Performances of these works, you can't get much better than this set.

B007THA4FI|3.0|To be absolutely truthful, I'm only halfway through this book.  Harry Potter it isn't.  So far it's bad people (Muggles?) behaving badly, or perhaps merely humans behaving like humans.  The book is short on nobility, self-sacrifice, altruism, and fantasy does not exist, except in the minds of some characters, and such fantasy has thus far been either violent or sexual.  Ms. Rowling knows some four-letter words, too.  But I intend to finish it, because she can definitely write, and I want to know how it ends.  I care about many of the characters, venial and flawed though they be.  I hope she will attempt other \\"adult\\" fiction (not that the Harry Potter series was kiddie lit), and find her voice in that genre.<br /><br />10/31/12 Okay.  I've finished it.  Nobility, self-sacrifice, and altruism are all in this book after all.  Still rate it at three stars.  I'm glad I stuck with it.

This from the prologue - \\"This property (Antifragility) is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good food recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance... Even our own existence as a species on this planet. From that simple subhead comes a myriad of component/contributing topics.<br /><br />No esoteric talk there; Nassim's intelligence and wit made reading a total pleasure. His explanations are sophisticated yet simple. His work is peppered with anecdotes which mix clarity with verve.<br /><br />Nassim spins off from the stated topic to connections with universal concepts. And does it all with elegance, humor and clarity. To write this<br />I peeked at 5-star Antifragile reviews. They have it pegged extraordinarily well; they must be very smart, scientists or all of the above. Anything more I could say would be less. Read them for hard facts. I'm going for a more humanistic touch.<br /><br />Rather than be redundant I'll speak to everyday readers: This book is a joy to read. Seemingly small ideas are expanded to one's delight with insights, comparisons, compact and fascinating explanations. I'm not one to read scientific tomes; but I found Antifragile continuously interesting in its many threads. I didn't know where what would lead to. Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a great writer. Must be a genius too. The pages of my book are now filled with underlines, margin notes and reflections/questions/referrals. I'm going to be re-reading this for a long,long time.<br /><br />A confession: I was just diagnosed with White Matter Disease. My  neurologist told me to read challenging books to spur synapses (whitematter) growth, overcoming memory and cognitive breakdowns. I chose this book expecting a tough read. Nassim's so articulate, eloquent writing carried me smoothly, enjoyably through tough topics. I owe this man alot.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kate Morton's stories are wonderful although attention to detail is required.  This one is, like others, awesome, excellent and tightly (accurately) woven. I love this one from beginng to end.  She is a master at framing the scene early that becomes pivotal in the end.  I will continue to read her books.
B000TFHJJQ|2.0|I recorded it from TV, and it took 3 evenings to get through it.  John Lithgow, a good actor, came across<br />as a caricature of a bad guy, with a terrible fake English accent.  The other actors did their best, but it was predictable - you knew it would end with the fight between Stallone and Lithgow.  Some good action scenes, and nice scenery. I'd say rent it if you absolutely must see it. I'm happy that I have now erased it.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Technically well done. I like the movie A LOT. But I think the Engineers motives are not explained well enough for the story to make sense. Yeah, there will be a sequel, but if Damon Lindelof is still involved, the answers will NOT be easily discovered.

He loves the part where he's at the elevator and met the little creatures, with a face expression that will just make you laugh into tears. I also want to say that it was fast shipping and the quality was excellent. Nice job amazon, I just love your website. I can find everything I need especially kindle books.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great product. i bought mine a few years back at bass pro shop.. but regardless, its the same sharpener. i love it! it have 2 blade sharpeners. CARBIDE and CERAMIC. the silver one is the carbide and is used to get a edge on a edge-less knife. the ceramic is to doctor it up and get the blade real nice and sharp. i love the diamond rode too that folds out. i use it on my serrated blades to sharpen the serrations. its also good for gut hook sharpening. i llike the size also. fits in the little from pouch on my SOG knife sheath. has a landyard hole also. even though i don't use it.  i would definitely recommend this sharpener! i made a video of this sharpener a while back btw.
0374214913|5.0|Disarmingly charming the book weaves through the real and imagined, serious and playful, reality and fantasy with seamless ease.<br /><br />Talking about data visualization, ruby programming, Google, musty old bookstores and what it means to be 20-something and to have not quite found out what you want to do with your life...<br /><br />I devoured this book almost in a single night and thoroughly enjoyed it in a way I've not enjoyed a book for a while. Highly recommended. It'll make you want to learn more about typography, 3d set design and go on an adventure!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book was good. You need to really enjoy reading for this one. I think the only reason I continued to read this one was because I live in this area of PA and because I really wanted to find out who this was and who they were writing to. It does have some sad moments, and these kids have some real issues. But if I wasnt so bored after reading the Harry Potter series I probably wouldnt have read it. But I dont regret it. I only give it 3 stars because I only liked it, but nothing to go crazy over.
B008DVJMAW|4.0|Saw them on Palladia. Loved their sound. Best Southern Rock I have heard in a long time.  Now on Zac Brown's label and on his tour. Hope they get near KC some day.<br />Bought all their CDs.

B008RZF1UO|4.0|Silverthorn retains the best elements of Ghost Opera & Poetry while bringing back some of what made albums like The Black Halo and Karma great. You get sweeping orchestrations, catchy melodies, and fierce guitar-work all tied up nicely with a background story. Yes, this is a concept album.<br /><br />Kamelot is entering a new era with lead vocalist Tommy Karevik, and I see Silverthorn as a sort of bridge between two worlds. There are definitely echoes of Khan throughout the album (nowhere more evident than Sacrimony), but Tommy's own style also gets track time. I imagine the next album will truly let Tommy settle into his own groove and the band will be free of Roy's ghost.<br /><br />1. Manus Dei<br />2. Sacrimony............................ ****<br />3.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I've been reading and watching the show since it first aired, and I think this book may be the best, thus far. George RR Martin has such a talent for making you understand why each character has such a dynamic personality, and shows why some villains aren't so terrible. This book really shows the true self worth of each person, and every chapter moves a piece in the game of thrones. This series is a masterpiece!
B0072HDP9M|5.0|fried green tomatoes.... Is a lovely read, it won't set the world on fire, but it' is easy and so consuming.  It hops from present day back to the thirties and while at the start i found this a bit offputting, you soon forgive the writer and find your self hearing the narrator's voice in your head, telling the story.  There are a few storylines to grab your attention.  If you get a chance to see the film, do, it keeps to the book religiously, it is so well adapted, and then, to read the book again, the faces are there.  I strongly recemmend this book, it is short and thoroughly enjoyable

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Passion Pit is a group I originally heard on Pandora while they were still fairly unrecognized. With this last album, the band has truly exploded onto the music scene, and for good reason. Bright, sumptuous melodies paired with lyrics that evoke emotions from even the most rugged, manly listener out there. Can't go wrong with Passion Pit's Gossamer!!
0071752854|5.0|Pitch Anything describes the dynamics of human interaction whereby Oren Klaff proves that some rules are necessary for delivering effective presentations, for persuading others or for any other type of social communication. He outlines those rules to readers in this well written, evidence based and entertaining book. Specifically, the dynamics and language of successful deal making interactions are professionally presented, the terms are identified, defined and related through engaging stories from Oren's personal experience. Consider this a prize book that you could ignore, or use to gain counterintuitive wisdom and high esteem for communicating your own message.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I purchased this book knowing it would be a bit different from the Harry Potter series. It is all over the place and so disjointed. I am finding it hard to finish. I am also recommending to our book club not to waste their money by paying for it either!

030759565X|5.0|Deb Pearlman's new cookbook \\"Smitten Kitchen\\" arrived last night after much awaited anticipation, and after looking through the book, I know it won't disappoint.  My mouth was watering as I read the recipes and gazed at the gorgeous photographs.  Remove the book's jacket for an unexpected surprise.  Deb inspires and entertains by the way she writes.  I've already ordered a second book for my sister- we give each other a special cookbook for our birthdays each year.  I've tried many of the delicious recipes from Deb's award winning blog by the same name, Smitten Kitchen.  I found Deb's blog a long time ago doing research on the web- I'm a culinary instructor and a chef.

The only thing I didn't like was that it end fast. I love it so much that I wanted to watch more. I had great time watching it. I felt like I was kid again. Worth watching.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|So many artists today claim to be musical geniuses ... but that are all no-talent jokes.<br />Donald Fagen is one of an exceptional few artists making music these days whom you can truly call a musical genius!<br />His music always leaves me breathless ... with tingles running up and down my spine. Fagen is a true master of mixing the best of funk, R&B, rock, pop and jazz into one perfect package, and his ability to write amazing melodies, sophisticated chord changes, deep introspective lyrics, and nasty funky grooves is nothing shy of supernatural.<br />The man is a GOD of music. Pure and simple.<br />Whether with Steely Dan or as a solo artist, Fagen's compositions have always represented contemporary music at its absolute highest of excellence.<br />SUNKEN CONDOS is no exception.<br />The album features nine perfectly polished soulful gems that create a musical experience that leaves you HUNGRY for more ... but sadly, with Fagen, it will be a long time before you ever get any more. So enjoy them while you can!<br />My all-time fave on the album is MISS MARLENE. Good lord, this song melts my heart. It's classic Fagen and represents WHY he and Steely Dan are national treasures throughout the world ... and have been since 1972. Everything is perfect with the track: the groove, the changes, the melody and lyrics. Every time I hear MISS MARLENE it literally brings tears to my eyes ... it had been FAR TOO LONG since I have heard music THIS GOOD! So long since I have heard Fagen-quality music.<br />But all the songs on SUNKEN CONDOS are amazing ...<br />Another great song is I'M NOT THE SAME WITHOUT YOU. The lyrics on this track are very clever, satirical and even hilarious ... and remind me why Steely Dan lyrics are considered the absolute best in recorded music this side of Dylan.<br />Another great track is WEATHER IN MY HEAD, a cool bluesy song that brings to mind the dark elements of Steely Dan's classic THE ROYAL SCAM.<br />I'd like to THANK Donald Fagen for generously releasing another album. (I was pretty sure he had retired after MORPH THE CAT, which was all about meeting your end ... whew, thank god he did not!)<br />And, Donald, if you are reading this review ... PLEASE, man, don't make me wait another six years before you release more new music. (That's my begging on the ground in humble prayer position.)<br />FIVE STARS ... only because I was not allowed to give it SIX.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!<br />Buy this album, listen to this album ... and thank GOD ABOVE that musical geniuses like Donald Fagen still exist in a world littered with the likes of Taylor Swift, Pink, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Justine Bieber, and countless other no-talent hacks lining the local compost pile.<br />Long live The King: Donald Fagen!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I love this movie, because I didn't know what to expect.They had different twists and it was such an amazing disney movie. I loved the characters. The main guy character had a personality that was very interesting and funny. He was not a good guy type in the beginning, but of course the girl changes him. Worth watching.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|I have enjoyed playing the 3 levels but the last couple of times I tried to play, the game freezes & so I finally give up & quit.  It would be at least 4 stars if you could really play & the game wouldn't freeze.  I would only get one ball...it just didn't work like the first few times I played.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It wasn't bad. It could have been more exciting with a better plot. The movie dragged at some points and had some muffled dialog.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Listening to this album is like time traveling back to my youth.  I find myself playing this over and over, and liking it more all the time.  At first I wasn't sure that I liked it that much but after just letting it play a couple of times, I realized that it was bring back into mind the ideas and thoughts that we had back then. The other night, we played it at a party and all of our friends started to smile as the music drifted over them.  The other thing that makes it powerful is knowing how this music powered the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa.  It doesn't hurt that the new documentary and 60 minutes piece on Rodriguez showed you what kind of a person Sixto Rodriguez is: a poet, and a gentle spirit. Easy to compare him to Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan, but with more of a raw street feel.  In this time of 99% and 47% - it's clear that Rodriguez speaks to us, the real people.

B000002BQK|4.0|Butterfly, in my opinion, is Mariah Carey's best album. Mariah Carey herself even thinks that it is, calling it her magnum opus (which means \\"great work\\" in English). The best songs on the album are \\"Honey\\", \\"Butterfly\\", \\"My All\\", \\"The Roof (Back in Time)\\", \\"Fourth of July\\", \\"Breakdown\\" (featuring Bone Thugs-n-Harmony), \\"Babydoll\\", \\"Close My Eyes\\", \\"Whenever You Call\\" and \\"Fly Away (Butterfly reprise)\\". \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" (featuring Dru Hill) and \\"Outside\\" are alright, but they aren't ones that I would usually replay over and over again.
B003QSMC18|5.0|I own this movie. I went to the theaters two times just watch this movie and end up buying it. It is one of my favorite disney movie. I never get sick of watching it. I know all the words and the sayings. I memorize all the parts. To me it is worth watching over and over. It is funny, romantic, and even cause tears in your eyes. It teaches the meaning of never giving up on your dreams, but realize that at the end of the day your family and your loves one are more important. Watch it.

0525958002|4.0|Remembering John Taylor as the prettiest of the Duran Duran pretty boys didn't help my first impressions of this book. While the funky groove laid down on the Rio album made for great listening, the band quickly became a shadow of its former self. In this memoir,  Taylor puts everything in its proper perspective. Looking back at his rockstar-dom through the eyes of a mature man, Taylor creates a highly entertaining, informative, and poignant tale of excess, discovery, and peacemaking (with ones past) that is intelligent and throughly enjoyable. I'd rank it right up there with Keith Richards' excellent account of his own rockstar existence.

1401233791|3.0|I read this story in the 90's when the issues were released. Batman: Knightfall is the fall and rebirth of Bruce Wayne as Batman. This story was conceived as a result of the wonderful The Death of Superman arc. Most people don't know this, but, when this story was first conceived, Denny O'neil, the editor of Batman comics, had planned to have Batman beaten by a new character (Bane) and then fake his death. This would serve to effectively take Bruce Wayne completely out of the Batman books for an entire year. Someone at Warner Bros. heard about this and denied the request at DC editorial, believing Bruce Wayne couldn't be absent. As a result, Batman is paralyzed by Bane, a replacement is temporarily found (Jean-Paul Valley) and Bruce Wayne's Batman comes back, with Bruce Wayne still involved throughout the entire story. There are nearly all Batman villains in this at some point and Tim Drake (Robin III) prematurely wears the Robin costume.<br /><br />Now, a word about Bane. He is a tank of a man with as much brain as he has brawn. He was raised in prison and taught himself everything. He built his mind and body to extraordinary really is a genius of intellect that plans Batman's destruction and succeeds. He has never been correctly portrayed in any film. In 1997, Batman and Robin featured Bane as a dumb, overgrown, monosyllabic strongman. 2012's The Dark Knight Rises featured a fairly intelligent Bane who was brawny, but that version was still nothing compared to the comic book version as far as intellect and strength was concerned.<br /><br />This story doesn't hold up. It suffers what most mainstream comic books in the 90's did. It's too flashy and overblown. The concept is great, the execution not so much. There are some legendary Batman writers involved in this, but this story really should be left in the 90's where it belongs. As a result of my opinion on this entire story, I will not review the other volumes.

B009JCL58G|5.0|Trying to write a brief synopsis of Cloud Atlas is an exercise in futility, given that it is one of the most dense, multi-layered, and complicated - but brilliant - films in several years, but I'll give it a go. It's based on David Mitchell's sprawling 2004 novel, and at it's core is a story about humanity's continual yearning for freedom in all its forms, the way in which the threads of life are interlinked across time and space, and how the smallest gestures in one lifetime can have enormous and profound effects on generations to come. The film spans six separate time periods across multiple geographical locations, and even different genre. Contrary to appearances, these disparate elements all do connect with each other, having been expertly woven together by directors Andy and Lana Wachowski and Tom Tykwer, who worked separately on three segments each, which were then edited together to form the final cut of the film. It stars an ensemble cast including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant, all of whom play multiple roles across the different stories, under varying applications of hair, false noses and prosthetic teeth.<br /><br />Music plays a very important part in Cloud Atlas, forming a great deal of the narrative's connective tissue, linking themes and concepts across multiple segments and multiple genres. The music is by the composing trio Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil, who have worked together on several of director Tykwer's films, most notably Run Lola Run, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer and The International, and go by the collective name `Pale 3'.<br /><br />Intellectually and structurally, the score for Cloud Atlas is a masterpiece, with everything being built from its two core elements, the \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet\\" and the \\"Atlas March\\". In the film, the Sextet is written by the fictional composer Robert Frobisher in the 1930s segment, but the music contained within itextends its tendrils into at least two other portions of the film, influencing the fate of one character, and coming back in circular fashion as an inspiration for itself in the past by way of a dream about the future. It's an intentionally classical-sounding piece, emanating from a recurring 7-note melody that swoons and weaves its way around the various parts of the string section, moving from one lead instrument to another, while the orchestra swoops and flies around it in various expressive counterpoints. It's very beautiful, and certainly fits the screenplay's notion of it being a work of art whose impact spans many generations, endlessly fascinating those who hear it.<br /><br />The Atlas March, meanwhile, is a hesitantly romantic piano piece which carries a slight sense of melancholy, and is first heard in the opening cue, but appears in numerous guises thereafter. This piece seems to signify the importance of the recurring relationships within the film, romantic or otherwise; characters whose paths cross in one time period, do so again decades or hundreds of years in the future, and this music that accompanies them on their almost pre-destined encounters seems to suggest a cosmic order to things, of past lives influencing the present.<br /><br />In an attempt to give each segment its own identity, each one features a slightly different palette of instruments, ranging from modern action scoring and electronic elements to large and vivid statements for the full orchestra, choral textures and much more. The most overtly classical style of music tends to be most prominent in the segments set in either the past or the distant future, while the more contemporary and neo-futuristic scenes draw influence from jazz music and more progressive synthesized textures and colors.<br /><br />The \\"Opening Title\\" underscores part of what is, chronologically, the sixth piece, an action/sci-fi segment set 300 years into a post-apocalyptic future in which the human race has become a band of pidgin-speaking hunter-gatherers tormented by vicious hunting tribes, but whose fortunes change when they are visited by intellectual aliens looking for keys to their own past. The cue features a superb, enticing, almost hypnotic motif for guitar and harp, under which the first subliminal allusions to the Sextet appear on soft, undulating strings. At the other end of the scale, cues such as \\"Sloosha's Hollow\\", \\"Won't Let Go\\", \\"Catacombs\\" and \\"The Message\\" are a dark combination of orchestral, vocal and electronic textures and dissonances which occasionally explode into powerful, vivid action sequences to accompany the rampaging attacks of a cannibal tribe, but which are tempered with more supernatural-sounding choral textures that try to capture the benevolence of the advanced civilization that visits the battered, broken world. These cues often contain recurring echoes of the opening title, especially in the continued use of the guitar motif.<br /><br />The historical parts of the film - a waterborne drama set in the 1830s on a galleon in the Caribbean featuring a young businessman, a freed slave and a murderous doctor, and a 1930s homosexual romance centered around an English composer trying to write the perfect symphony - is underscored with the pretty pizzicato-cum-scherzo effects of \\"Travel to Edinburgh\\", the slightly skewed performance of the Atlas March on piano underneath the otherwise frantic-sounding cue for Frobisher's conductor \\"Kesselring\\", and the bold and lush \\"Temple of Sacrifice\\", which presents an effusive, fully-orchestrated statement of the Atlas March. The relationship between the composer Frobisher, his lover Sixsmith, and the elderly composer Vyvyan Ayrs, is the most overly romantic and melodramatic sequence of the film, and also the most musically important, as it is in this sequence that the Cloud Atlas Sextet is actually written on-screen, although its musical influences lie elsewhere in the timeline.<br /><br />The politicalthriller segment, which is set in San Francisco in the 1970s and concerns an investigative journalist digging into the shady dealings of a corrupt nuclear power plant, tends to be a little more modernistic in style, and a little more subdued and less florid than the `classical' pieces, but still retain a predominantly orchestral core. Cues such as \\"Luisa's Birthmark\\" and the propulsive \\"Chasing Luisa Rey\\" feature light, glassy electronic textures and contemporary, occasionally jazzy orchestral timbres, with the barest hints of the Sextet motif buried underneath. The hints of the Sextet theme are cleverly carried on from the 1930s segment, and musically illustrate the links between Luisa Rey and the elderly Sixsmith.<br /><br />Later, the modern-day segment featuring the vaguely comedic escapades of the bumbling but likeable Timothy Cavendish, a hapless book publisher trying to escape from a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest-like care home, have an almost circus-esque quality, with hooting woodwinds and Nino Rota or Wojciech Kilar-style rhythms in \\"Cavendish in Distress\\" and \\"Adieu\\" underscoring his chaotic adventures.<br /><br />The segment set in the dystopian-totalitarian Korean future, a in which a genetically engineered waitress initiates a rebellion, embraces electronic scoring much more prominently, with cues such as \\"Papa Song\\" having an ultra-modern sound design element for the ghastly restaurant where the waitresses work. The largest action sequences occur in this segment too, with cues such as \\"Sonmi-451 Meets Chang\\", the exciting \\"The Escape\\", the powerful \\"New Direction\\", and the gripping \\"Sonmi's Discovery\\" building up a real head of steam, while making some clever allusions to both the Sextet theme and the Atlas March in the string ostinatos. \\"Sonmi-451 Meets Chang\\" also introduces an unexpectedly lyrical theme for the forbidden affair that develops between the two unlikely lovers, making their plight that much more moving, and the choral work in this cue is quite excellent.<br /><br />One or two cues even span multiple styles, notably \\"All Boundaries Are Conventions\\", which presents a superb performance of the Atlas March in various different manifestations; it begins classically, as if re-imagined by Johann Sebastian Bach, but gradually works in the humming male voice choir often heard in the future segments, and builds to a large-scale finale. The final three pieces on the album - \\"Cloud Atlas Finale\\", \\"The Cloud Atlas Sextet for Orchestra\\" and the \\"Cloud Atlas End Title\\" - take the two central themes and many of the various elements heard in all six segments, and significantly increase their scope and size, presenting concert-worthy performances that stand as some of the best cues heard all year, often incorporating with a haunting choral element reminiscent of the best parts of their score for Perfume.<br /><br />The way in which these two thematic elements cross-pollinate each of the six sections of the film really ties together the core idea that the movie is trying to convey: that, irrespective of location, or time, or race or gender, the hopes and dreams and aspirations of humanity remain the same. There's also a recurring theme of rebirth and resurrection, whereby the same characters (or ancestors/descendents of the same characters) are destined to re-encounter across the ages. By continually presenting re-orchestrated and re-worked variations of these two themes - either with overt statements, or little rhythmic allusions in the music's underbelly - the connections that link a freed slave on a ship in the 1830s and a humble tribesman four hundred years in the future become clear.<br /><br />Scores like Cloud Atlas, which have an important and identifiable structure that relates directly to concepts in the film, intelligent and sophisticated application of thematic elements, and no small amount of beauty, harmony and excitement in the music itself, reaffirm your faith in what film music can be when it's done right. It's the polar opposite of the potentially damaging `write some basic pieces and see where we can stick them' school of thought that some composers espouse, and proves beyond a doubt that a talented composer - or, in this case, group of composers - working to actually tell a story through their music, with recurring ideas and narrative-driven specificity, will always make for a more satisfying and fulfilling score. Look for Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil to pick up their first Oscar nominations next spring; this is one of the scores of the year.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|omg this is the best game ever. I had many games before and so far this one is the best
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book as well as the first in the trilogy. Follett is a master story teller. Love his books.
B0000027G6|3.0|I was happy that the CD was in good shape.  There were no scratches or dings in it and it plays beautifully.  It made me unhappy that the hinge on the case was broken when it arrived.  I will have to replace that so I don't lose the booklet or the CD.
B009VW5K12|5.0|This is still my favorite show and I'm ecstatic how I have not lost any interest. I love all the characters still and the story lines are interesting and don't forget the chemistry.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is soo addicting and I'm on it all the time getting ideas for anything and everything! A definite must have(:
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It does not register the stats 90% of the time.  Just does not work properly.<br />I am very disappointed.  Weather is an important factor in life.  Very frustrating to sign in and not have any and I mean NO information availble.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I immediately fell in love with the Piano Guys upon my first exposure to them. If you haven't watched their videos on YouTube, do so, because they are fun and lighthearted and appropriate to the music. I only wish the videos would have come with the cd.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This season is just more of the same great Bones that we know and love! Angela proves just how awesome she is, Sweets grows some balls, and Booth and Bones strengthen their relationship. I was afraid that throwing babies in the mix might throw off the flow, but if anything it gave the writers more to work with.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|Secretary is absolutely the best film I have seen in a very long time, and one of the best I have ever seen. I won't spend any time going over the plot because, if you're reading this, chances are you already know it. This is the first Hollywood film I have seen that treats BDSM relationships in a realistic, and (most importantly) non-judgemental manner. Many scenes in this film will certainly ring true for anyone involved in the lifestyle. (I enjoy this lifestyle myself and i live it day to day)<br />The acting is, in a word, superb. James Spader turns in his usual high-caliber performance, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is stunning(and beautiful as well!) She conveys more emotion with a single glance than most actresses could in a lengthy monologue.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  It's fun, challenging and addictive all at the same time.  Really causes you to think!  There are times when I have to walk away and come back to it.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I watch it almost everyday. I love how it goes back in time & then to today-keeps you on your toes. Very twisted!!! I LOVE IT!!!!! While watching it, you feel like you're actually there.
0307591549|4.0|Happiness advantage is one of many books written on positive psychology. The author style is very friendly and descriptive. Narrations are easy to read, captivating and funny at times. He is able to make his point come across without being authoritative. I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to develop this wonderful way of thinking and through it, ultimate success.
1455527475|5.0|Well written and completely accurate portrayal of the excesses and improprieties of Wall Street culture.  I can say firsthand from my own experience on the Goldman trading floor, Greg Smith must have really held back in this book.  There are so many more outrageous stories and examples that could have gone into this book.  But nonetheless, I don't think the book was meant to be an SEC complaint with specific indictments but a mere snapshot outline of what is wrong with Wall Street today, and Goldman Sachs in particular.  The book reads easy, does a great job explaining some of the trader terminology, and is really best suited for those with little to no exposure to Wall Street who are looking for a \\"no B.S.\\" account of what is plaguing the institutions behind our global financial system.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|If your goal is to be entertained by science fiction special effects, you will love this movie.  It has some of the best CGI in any movie I have seen.  Every bit as good as Terminator Salvation and the recent Transformers movies.  I loved them.  But unlike these movies, there was no serious plot.  Or more accurately, the plot was so immature and the characters so one-dimensional and superficial that I was often rooting for the aliens to wipe them out.  This is a movie aimed at 12 year olds, not adults.  Even most teenagers will quickly turn this off in favor of a vampire love story.  Be warned.  The plot is very hard to take.<br /><br />That said, the special effects are worth getting the blu-ray.  You will find this movie much more enjoyable if you root for the aliens.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I did read the whole book, but the scope was so wide reaching that it was difficult to keep up with the political activities and opinions of all the characters. It did help to make clear that the issues were not so black and white as it may now seem to us 60 years later.
B001TW69J4|5.0|Wow! Another Hidden Gem In The Prog Metal World!! A Must Have For Any Rock Collection! Get It Now, Hurry!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app n how it keeps me informed on the battery life. I'm totally enjoying my kindle fire!
B000TDDHQ2|5.0|I have been listening to this album for over 25 years now. There were periods of years when I didn't hear it at all. But then I would hear it again and the same head space would immediately open - dreamy, foreboding, a feeling that we (me,man-kind)are just here for but a short-while  but life will go on \\"within us and without us\\". If we accept this then we see that this is beautiful and optimistic music about a greater whole than ourselves alone, about a planet that has so much time to change and re-invent that we are insignificant to the continuity of life here which will shrink and swell in time to another sort of rhythm.<br /><br />Some pieces like \\"The Lost Day\\" always evoke the same visions even after years - In this case, for me,  a single-handed lone yacht  in the Southern Ocean - enormous swells, not too much wind for now but the halyards clinking against the mast tell us the wind will come roaring again, soon. The man will suffer like Donald Crowhurst to the point of insanity, but the boat doesn't care. She will ride it, with or without the man, bare poles and all, way past the Cape and back again, circling latitude like the Albatross.<br /><br />Thank you Brian Eno for the peace and contact with inner-self  you have given to me over the years.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is the absolute best calander app out there. Does EVERYTHING! Your missing out if you don't have it already. Got to get tablet optimized widgets though. Need a 6x6 minimum for tablets.
B009329Y30|5.0|This was a sweet story of a soldier finding the woman who unintentionally saved his life. Really enjoyed the movie and Zac Efron is one sexy man!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great job, nice ending or was it a continuation,  Loved it and want more.! Would definitely love to find out how Christian is handling his new family .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is temple run with a more open world game play to it. i highly recommend  this game. its one of the best games ive downloaded. even better than ones i had to pay for. theres some adds butt s&amp;%t its free. ads are expected. doogiedoes
B002ZHKZCY|3.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The transfer is adequate, with a good level of detail.  Black tones are nice and dark.  The color saturation is good.  There is some film grain visible, but you have to be fairly close to the television in order to see it.  From a few feet away, it looks crisp.  So while this is not the best blu-ray transfer I have ever seen, it is not the worst either.  As to whether or not you should upgrade from DVD, I would say that depends on how well you like this film.  If it is one of your favorites, then go ahead and upgrade.  But if not, you can probably get by just fine with an upconverted DVD.
B009AJDDQU|3.0|Ridley Scott's \\"Prometheus\\" had much promise but where it succeeds visually it falters in it's story telling.  There is no natural cohesion or flow to any of the scenes save for the opening sequence which is actually my favorite part of the whole film.  In those first few minutes, I truly felt transported to a world alien and foreign.  Once we return to earth, although only moments later, I had great anticipation for what was to come but increasingly became disappointed.  There are so many questions left unanswered and I don't understand the logic in the decision making to some scenes.  Why did the first engineer in the beginning eat the black stuff?  Why did the awakened engineer immediately become violent?  This wasn't just an origin story for the \\"Alien\\" franchise, it hinted at being the origin for all humans and I couldn't wait to see what would be uncovered.<br /><br />Being a huge fan of science fiction and of Alien and Aliens, I can't hate this film.  It is related to those beloved films even  if it's a third cousin once removed.  Ridley Scott remains a master of visual story telling.  It was some of the best 3D I've seen so far.  Being a fan of the television show \\"Lost\\" I was excited to see what Damon Lindelof would introduce but much like his successful television series it seems as if he was just that...lost.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am so disappointed with this book. I have not finished it as I am finding it really hard to get into......I never let a book defeat me but this might be it! Next time I will think twice before rushing to buy one of her books.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I never thought I'd say that about a calculator but it IS fun to use. The display is easy to read because of the large font and I like how you can view the history of calculations. I would recommend this app to anyone. Best of all, it was FREE!
B006VGGAC4|4.0|I ordered this out of pure couriosity. I used to admire Arnold S., but after the debacle with his housekeeper I lost all respect for him. I must say that the book is very well written( much like my own memoir LOVE BETRAYED; also available on Kindle),[[ASIN:B004LGTIFW Love Betrayed a memoir by: Karen Hinton]] and his life story is quite fascinating. I enjoyed it very much.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Brilliant character development! Mature subject matter so definitely not for kids...but fabulous novel for adults!  Can't wait to see what Rowling does next!
B0091THRCU|1.0|This is an awful piece of junk. It is so tight, I could barely get my iphone 5 in there. And when i did, the pull tab didn't work, which means I had to rip the seams to get my phone out of there. Am sending the defected product back for a refund immediately.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|If you like late 80's early 90's rock or the dream of being a rock star. You would enjoy this movie. But it was not for me.
B000I8FRIO|5.0|THis book was as advertised and was nearly the one my son remembers. Ordered for a Chinese family to lewarn English.
B00866JL96|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks! It does bother me when things get changed in the making of a movie, but I still think it was a good movie! Plus, they're both good looking! It was a good adaptation, I'm just picky which is why I gave it 4 stars.
0525953728|5.0|The book was well written and gave me the feeling of actually being there during the mission. Reading what the SEAL's sacrifice for our country to defend our freedom is amazing and makes you proud to be an American. Reading a first hand account of what really happened  was very interesting and exiting to read. This is a must read book.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This was an inspiring read.  It contans just enough wisdom and a sprinkle of technique to be a library keeper.  I will be rereading this book from time to time.
098555780X|5.0|Good book. Very informative and broken down so every layman can work thier way through the knots. The photos are clear and crisp and relatively easy to follow. I recommend this book highly.
B003ES61EE|5.0|I bought this with my Canon DSLR and I have been quite pleased with it. This lens pen does a good job of cleaning smudges off of my lenses.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Choice of larger circular pad or smaller triangle pad<br />+ Compact size<br />+ Cleans smudges well<br /><br />Cons:<br />- cleaning pad sometime comes out when removing lid<br />- Once in a long while a bristle will fall off the brush<br /><br />The cons that I have here are really minor and I plan to purchase one or two more of these so I can always keep one with my camera.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I really liked these books.  I could not put them down til I was finished with them.<br />dramatic,thrilling. I'm glad I finally picked them up to read
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Great CD! one of my favs as its one of those cd's you can actually listen to almost every song on it and like them all. most cd's you only find a couple good songs on..
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I use the i3-2120 CPU in both a FreeNAS home media server and in a Windows 7 64bit home theater PC (HTPC). This Sandy Bridge i3 has performed admirably in both situations, getting the job done and remaining cool. In both situations, I am using the stock Intel HSF, and the fan has been barely discernible. Note that on my HTPC, I am not performing any video format conversions. I think the most stressing activity performed on the HTPC is ripping my DVDs and Blu-Rays to MKV format.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Like in their first CD Mumford and Sons produce music with an unmistakable sound. This is the mark of real creativity, true genius.  This group and their music will live for the ages.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Could not put the Kindle down.  Was done in a day and a half.  Something about the book was addicting. You will become part of Christian and Ana's lives. You will start to read and look up and be shocked at how much time has passed. Thankfully, when you finish? There is another book to buy. Totally mesmerizing, tantalizing and seductive. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|Pros:<br />+ Plenty of room for large filters<br />+ Padding in each compartment<br />+ Has not left any sort of mark on my filters<br />+ Securely closes with combination of clip and velcro<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Velcro is loud and seems a bit redundant with the clip<br />- It can be a bit hard to fish smaller filters out of the pockets<br /><br />Right now I use this case for the inexpensive filters I purchased when I first got my camera. I am waiting a few months to make sure nothing happens to those filters before I put my more expensive filters in this case but after about three weeks there are not marks, smudges, streaks, or scratches on the filters that I have put in there so I feel fairly confident that any filter I put in this case will be safe.
0316228532|3.0|The Casual Vacancy indeed is a nice book. The characters were well described and represented different personalities which we deal with in our daily lives. What I liked about this book is that it reflects alot of the insecurities that poeple have. What did not feel so genuine is that the author focused more on the ugly sides of their personalities and occasionally mentioned any good sides, which anyway, could be intended by the author. Also, I felt that sometimes the events of the story would suddenly go to extremes without adequate preparation which is why at some points I was not emotionally connected to the plot. At some points I felt I can not put the book away, at other times I felt a bit bored and forced myself to continue reading. However, I had an overall positive impression about the book and would consider reading another book for the author.
B004ZQRJFO|3.0|wasn't a bad cd, had a few good songs on it, but the number of tracks is very limited compared to most cd's... nothing wrong other than that. Should probably charge half the price of a normal cd since it only has half the tracks...
1455519006|4.0|I always enjoy books by David Baldacci maybe because I used to live in the greater Washington DC area and he talks about familiar places and streets and highways of that part of the country.  I would agree with another reviewer in that the plot seemed to be confusing at times.  It starts out with Will as a trained assassin carrying out an assignment involving an Arab royal.  Then it goes ahead to another assignment which he is unable to carry out because it involves a young mother with two small children.  After that he is a marked man but even as he confers with his top boss, Blue Man, and gets yet another mission, the body count goes up.  He also meets a fourteen year old child prodigy by the name of Julie whose parents were killed.  Why is all this happening and what is it connected to or with?  The people who have died all served in Iraq but what did they do and what did they know that got them eliminated?  There's a lot of running, hiding out, changing safe houses that are no longer safe, because Julie also is targeted, because being a bright young girl she asks a lot of questions and someone doesn't want her to know the answers.  I like the Will Robie character with his cunning, drive, and compassion.  The FBI agent Nikki is sharp, as well as sharp tongued and she makes a good partner for Will.  Julie, the teen fugitive, adds some lightness but also displays some street smartness that would be lacking in most kids that age, and she doesn't trust anybody!
B002C949AE|4.0|An eye opening story about a horrific practice in many girls around the world and the inspiring story of a woman that wants to change it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is re-telling the story of the 20th century through the eyes of his characters, and they do have opinions...!<br /><br />Very well written as usual.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the \\"Winter of the World\\"

B004T4KQJS|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book after hearing an interview with the author on the radio and then deciding to order it.  It could have been shorter.  I thought it wondered a bit toward the middle...but this is a very big subject!  So,in my opinion, the author did an excellent job of writing about a complex topic in science at \\"just above\\" a layman's level.
0345803493|5.0|This was for adult only reading and met all expectations. While rather bazarre , it had mystery and love in abundance. It's a lot of hard reading since it has no illustrations or picture's but there may have not been any available that could be put into print. Nothing is shocking to me any more but I did find it to be an unusual but enjoyable book<br /><br />Pat Thompson
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This quote from one part of the series sums it up!  The writing and dialogue is rich and thought-provoking.  This Sherlock and Watson pairing is a perfect blend of serious and humor (more subtle).  The down-to-earth Watson is the perfect foil for this Sherlock, brilliantly played by Benedict Cumberbatch.  All of the actors are perfect in their parts.<br /><br />I do recommend using the subtitles, as the dialogue can be very fast, and unless your ear is tuned to the British accent, you may miss some of it.  This is quality TV/movie all the way!
030758836X|5.0|Great book full of mystery and excitement!  It was hard for me to take my eyes off this book, just couldn't stop reading it!

0099579928|5.0|I had a slow start with the first Fifty Shades book, but by the time I got on a roll with the series, I couldnt put them down. By the time that I got to the third, I was looking online and in the media to see what the chances were of another book coming out. I was not ready to let these characters go.
159102594X|5.0|I'm a bookish 20 year going to college. I don't waste my time on lame books and let me tell you, I've read this damn series three times since I borrowed the first book a few months ago. I love Stephen King, vonnegut, Bradbury, Orwell and those silly dragon lance stories but Joe Abercrombie is now my favorite author. Very realistic, very gritty and exceptionally interesting.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|I had heard of but not heard Gary Clark Jr. so this CD is a fresh take for me.  I especially enjoy the sincere committed guitar playing with excellent blues-based songs and solos. The range of material suggests he doesn't want to be pigeon-holed as a blues musician.  Not all the urban Afro-pop/funk is to my taste, but it's pretty well done.  Whether including this material was an artistic or commercial decision doesn't matter to me; I credit the artist for showing he can write, sing and play in other styles.  I'm playing to see him live ASAP!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is witty, blunt, and intelligent.. if you like him on Tv you will love this book. Easy to read as well.

B008G33OJM|1.0|NOTE: the low rating is due to the Blu-Ray not working, not the content.<br />All the current reviews (as of 10/30/12) on Amazon are for the DVD version.  Here is what I found when I purchased the Blu-ray version - hope this helps, and if others have found functioning versions of the blu-ray please let us know.  This may or may not be limited to the US version (though posts on Tarja's forums indicate it is other countries also).<br /><br />I purchased the blu-ray at a local store (had pre-ordered from Amazon but got an e-mail that they are having trouble getting copies - may be due to the issues) and the blu-ray ran fine through the logos but would not play the main menu, concert, or extras.  This was on a Sony stand alone player and a PS3 - both with current firmware.  I searched online and found many others have the same issues with the blu-ray in different brand players and on laptop/computers (search Tarja Act 1 blu-ray problems online to see the posts or visit the Forums at Tarja's site).  It seems like it is a manufacturing issue with the blu-ray which causes it not to play.  Hopefully the issues are resolved in the future - till then buyer beware if you purchase the blu-ray.
0062200399|4.0|Tristran Thorn grew up in the in the Wall, a town abut to the wall between Faerie and human realms.  He loves beautiful Victoria Forester, but she acts aloof and cold in response.  One day, they see a star fall from the sky landing on the other side of the barrier.  He tells his beloved Victoria he will retrieve it for her if she agrees to marry him.  She accepts his terms as nobody crosses the wall outside of the enchanted flea market held every nine years.  The young man also is unaware that he was conceived when his parents attended one of those galas.<br /><br />Tristran enters Faerie on his heart's quest.  Malevolent others also seek the star for evil purposes.  As he talks to mythological flora and fauna, Tristan battles against witches, goblins and trees.  However, as Tristan learns from the star what love truly is, the Lord of Stormhold's children deploy their nefarious plot.<br /><br />This is a reprint of the engaging coming of age romantic fantasy.  Tristan initially seems pathetic as a hero yet perseveres as he begins to understand right from wrong.  The motives and respective backgrounds of his star-seeking adversaries are developed so that the audience obtains an enjoyable tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B008X8QCTO|3.0|This game was a great game, and I don't say that about many lately. I love hidden object games, but they Must have lots of puzzles also to keep my interest. Bravo, this game has lots of things you need to figure out.<br />Yet, there is one thing that really really ticked me off - A bit more then halfway through the game that won't let you play anymore. Well, I knew I PAID for the game, so I checked my account, yep, I PAID for this already. Confused about this I paid again,as it was late at night... figuring Amazon would take care of this. Now I find out that there wasn't a glitch, but I was being charged again, just to finish the game. NOT ONCE did the game tell me I was paying for a &quot;Bonus or Extra&quot; .  I would have easily paid three or four for this game, but this &quot; we got you against the wall tactics&quot; is dishonest and wrong. So my rating will be only a one, because I absolutely hate being lied to !!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer by John Grisham finds a black man sent to prison for  a crime prosecuted under the federal RICO statue.  The author does a wonderful job calling on his legal knowledge in explaining and exploring the use of this law to send a middle-aged, small town lawyer to prison.  And what exactly did the protagonist, Malclom Bannister, do exactly?  It turns out to be an ordinary, plain vanilla transaction involving the wrong client, and money laundering that the poor man had no clue about.<br /><br />Thus, the author sets up a situation where a disgraced lawyer feels that he has been wronged by the government, sent to jail for ten years, and patiently waits for the right opportunity to get out of prison.  This opportunity arrives when a federal judge has been murdered, and Malcolm knows who did it and why.<br /><br />Yet, it wouldn't be a John Grisham novel if his protagonist simply does a straightforward deal with the government to spring him loose.  No, the author engages in quite a bit of creativity and fiction to expand the plot, and in the end, the readership will realize just how appropriate the title of the book is for this story.<br /><br />Along the way, John Grisham delights in showing the limited reaches of the federal government in following a man, from the use of prepaid phone and debit cards purchased from every day retailers, to the use of fake IDs and passports, to the renting of virtual offices overseas.<br /><br />Some readers may abhor the author's admitted heavy use of fiction, rather than research, for various aspects of the story.  I personally find the balance perfect, as the author leans on just enough dose of every day life to make the story realistic and credible.<br /><br />The Racketeer is a suspenseful legal thriller that will keep the reader engaged and interested to the very last page.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game - no deep thought process needed to play - You can plan a strategy if you want, but it's not necessary to enjoy -- nice game to just be able to relax while playing
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was so happy  to have second book to pick up after reading the first 50 shades of Grey in record time for me and am equally happy to know I can pick up third book when I finish 50 Shades Darker which have enjoyed even better than the first book!!!!!
B000ID37RM|5.0|This movie isn't old, it's classic.  And timeless.<br /><br />Based on the pulitzer-prize winning, bestselling novel by the same name, this original film is a good rendering of the book.  Gregory Peck is fantastic in the role of Atticus Finch and you'll even spot a young Robert Duvall in his big-screen debut (though he doesn't get a lot of screen time in this one).<br /><br />Admittedly, the effects are dated compared to today's movies, but if you want to see the book come to life, this is a fine version.<br /><br />Of course, the book is still better.  But then again, that is nearly always the case.  But if you have the time, you really should read the book instead . . . the film has cut a lot of the novel's fine nuances!
0060555661|5.0|GRAHAM REVIEW<br />Graham's original work itself is fantastic, if you take the time to absorb it and understand it. It took me two reads before I really felt like I grasped it well. I don't need to write an elaborate review discussing this book for people to know it is obviously an investment classic; it has Warren Buffett's full endorsement which is the reason a lot of people opt to read it in the first place. The practical advice offered is timeless. In particular I found Chapter 1 (the difference between speculation and investing), Chapter 8 (managing your emotions), Chapter 10 (discerning the advice from others) and Chapter 20 (having a margin of safety) to be enlightening, as those four chapters were probably the most useful to me personally. The advice in the very first chapter regarding the difference between investing and speculating gets lost on a lot of people today, as anything and everything that involves stocks, bonds, options, or futures seems to be categorized as investing. The portion of Chapter 8 that discusses managing your emotions is arguably the most difficult for people to actually implement in the real world, despite being a very important concept. Graham truly makes a compelling case in favor of a value approach, which as I will discuss later in this review, is inherently reliant on the belief that investments can and do become undervalued. Buffett notes that the most significant chapters for him were 8 and 20. I agree, but also add chapters 1 and 10 to that shortened list. For others that might be different.<br /><br />A unique thing that I appreciated about Graham is that he discusses two different ways of investing, depending on how much time you have to put into the matter. For those who have too many other things going on to put the time into it, he advocates \\"defensive investing,\\" which basically focuses on safer, larger companies and is a little more bond-heavy. And for those who want to put a lot more work into it, he advocates \\"enterprise investing,\\" where he lays out a more rigorous approach to value investing. While the enterprising method does indeed yield greater returns over the long run, there is nothing wrong with taking the defensive approach, particularly for those who aren't able to commit enough time in order to make the enterprising method effective.<br /><br />There are a few minor areas that are no longer relevant as they were in Graham's day, such as his suggestion that one should use a local bank to handle transfers of stock certificates... when it is basically all online these days. But if one reads it and remains aware that it was written in the early 1970s, then these little quirks will not bother them. I will also add that Graham places an emphasis on dividend maintenance that is probably less relevant today. In his day, strong companies actually paid out about 1/3 to 2/3 of their surpluses, whereas these days that is far less common. Graham's followers, including Buffett and Klarman, do not emphasize this so heavily (Klarman has gone as far as saying that looking at dividend policy is almost useless in today's era), although it is still probably relevant to look at the continuity of dividends especially for \\"defensive\\" investors. It should be added that while Graham has an almost aloof/academic air about him, he is equally humble and sincere, never underestimating the intelligence of his readers. And for those occasional uppity words that he uses, there is always a dictionary nearby. It may take more than a cursory read, but if you are patient, then this book is a gold mine. As a result, I give Graham 5 stars.<br /><br />ZWEIG REVIEW<br />Jason Zweig's commentary really deserves its own separate review, as this is basically two different books. Throughout MUCH (not all) of the book, I would have given Zweig 4 or 5 stars, as his commentary adds to the discussion and thought process of Graham. However, Zweig departs from Graham in a very fundamental way in three portions of the book, causing me to believe that Zweig either truly disagrees with or otherwise does not fully understand what Graham's argument is. Zweig essentially subscribes to the \\"Random Walker\\" camp of those supporting a Semi-Strong version of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and believes that one is simply speculating when choosing individual stocks instead of index funds. Zweig lets his own views seep into the book slowly, chapter by chapter, until it becomes more obvious that he is not a value investor. Graham did not subscribe to this relatively recent view (only existing since the 1960s) in his approach to VALUE investing. The entire premise of value investing is that securities sometimes do become undervalued, which is rare/impossible according to proponents such as Zweig. Though to my knowledge Graham never wrote a piece articulating his stance, his actions were to the contrary of what Zweig seems to believe his position was. It's also notable that his contemporaries/students blatantly countered the EMH viewpoint (see Buffett and \\"Superinvestors\\" below; see also Phil Fisher in \\"Developing an Investment Philosophy\\" chapter 4, entitled \\"Is the Market Efficient?\\").<br /><br />(1) In the first and most notable departure for Zweig, there is a portion of the book where Graham says \\"[i]t would be rather strange if - with all the brains at work professionally in the stock market - there could be approaches which are both sound and relatively unpopular. Yet our own career and reputation have been based on this unlikely fact.\\" (Graham, p. 380). If one reads the version in its proper context, then they will realize rather quickly that Graham is arguing that this unlikely fact of the markets actually being inefficient much of the time is actually TRUE, and is thus a compelling reason to study value investing. However... Zweig goes on in the commentary to say that Graham is pointing out that the market is efficient, and discusses the definition of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). This is clearly NOT what Graham was saying... rather the opposite.<br />(2) In the second notable departure, there is a commentary chapter of Zweig's where he discusses how to effectively manage your portfolio. In the chapter itself, Graham discussed stock selection. Zweig, however, goes on to say that people should not actually pick stocks with more than 10% of their money, as doing so is akin to speculating, and should instead place all or nearly all of their funds into index funds that can come close to tying the market because of the EMH. Even though this advice MIGHT (arguably) be relevant for the \\"defensive\\" investor that Graham discusses (those who do not have the time or want to put the time into managing their own portfolio), this advice is a blatant misrepresentation of what Graham advises for \\"enterprising\\" investors (those who want to actively practice value investing) in such a fundamental way as to make me want to give Zweig 1 star instead of 5. But due to my holistic review, Zweig gets more than 1.<br />(3) Zweig places an emphasis on diversification that I don't think Graham fully intended. Graham discusses the value of diversification throughout the book by taking multiple positions. Note though that Graham does NOT advocate buying everything...simply holding a few varied positions. But Zweig interprets this concept in such a way as to, in my humble opinion, advocate over-diversification... which is effectively nothing more than buying so many things that you should have just purchased an index fund to begin with.<br /><br />Collectively, Zweig's most significant contribution to the book was simply putting some of Graham's now-dated statements into context. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with believing in EMH in the markets the way that Zweig does, per se. But I am harsh on Zweig because advocating EMH and claiming that any stock is \\"speculative\\" is a blatant misrepresentation of Graham's views and stance. Despite departing from Graham quite fundamentally in two or three areas, Zweig mostly added a beneficial/informative conversation. Thus I hesitantly give him 3 stars.<br /><br />BUFFETT REVIEW<br />Warren Buffett has a brief introduction towards the beginning of the book that tells what readers can expect from reading his mentor, Graham. As already mentioned, he places additional emphasis on chapters 8 and 20. But more importantly, there is a compelling essay/speech by Buffett in the back of the book that is called \\"The Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville\\" that was given at Columbia University in 1984. You don't have to buy the book to read this essay, as it is free on the internet in a few different places. But it is arguably the best rebuttal to the Efficient Market Hypothesis that anyone has ever put out, and I don't know of any EMH proponents that have ever addressed Buffett's argument. In essence, Buffett points out that many different versions of investing that have little in common with each other beyond a decidedly long-term value-driven approach have all yielded positive results over time that have had decidedly superior returns to the market. There is unfortunately little written on this topic by actual practitioners, but Buffett's argument is worth a read. It's a definite 5 stars.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />As a result, I give this whole book collectively 5 stars. You can just ignore the areas where Zweig errs, sometimes rather substantially. You could safely ignore his additional chapters/commentary altogether, although I think it is useful to read for putting certain portions of Graham's writing into perspective. Entire book is recommended; but if you don't read the whole thing, at least read Chapters 1, 8, 10, and 20, as well as Buffett's essay. It's a great addition to any investment library. I know that adding those up rounds to 4, but it is Graham's book after all (much as Zweig might wish it was his)... so it's 5 stars.

B009HSVHV2|4.0|Monster is a solid KISS album.  Standard fare, full of innuendo and double entendres (\\"get off your chest\\" comes to mind).  But it's what I expected and what I enjoy from KISS.  It's not like KISS has ever been overly serious about their songs.  I am a little tired of the makeup though, when it was the reunion of the original members it was great, but bring back Bruce and do a no-makeup tour! Listen to Monster and have fun!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|As a fan of the books, I was somewhat skeptical, at first. HBO changed so much of their True Blood series that it's hardly the same as original books by Charlaine Harris. So, I was a little worried. Boy, was I wrong. They've beautifully captured the series. Even if you've never read the books, the series is so well produced, written, acted, and everything that you are really missing out if you haven't seen it.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Let's start off with the fact that, for what it costs as compared to other companies, this backpack is good.  But be sure this is what you want- it is indeed very basic, as the name suggests.  The velcro shelves are a bit flimsy and the bag is pretty small.  The zipper pulls say \\"Amazon Basics\\" on them, which made me feel kind of self-conscious about it, and, although I wanted something light and easy to take with me on the fly, I think this is just a bit too light and small.  If you have a smaller camera and not too many lenses, then this would be a good bag to start with- it's a good place to start.  Once you start buying more expensive/heavier lenses and cameras, an upgrade will be necessary, but, hey, we all have to start somewhere!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|We really enjoyed this original and inventive movie.  Eventhough I'm not a big fishing fan it's about so much more..this film manages to entertain while also encourage some deeper thinking.  It's also one of the few movies in which  Ewan McGregor actually sounds a Scotsman.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've been a Reacher fan since The Killing Floor.  I actually used to read the hardcover editions of the latest Reacher novel rather than wait for the paperback.  I loved these books.  Unfortunately, the thrill is gone.  This was, by far, the absolute worst Jack Reacher novel I've ever read.  It's probably in the top 10 worst novels I've ever read.  Mr. Child is either off his game, using a ghost writer or has fallen into some writers' abyss.  The story was boring, implausible and seemingly never-ending.  There was no plot development, no character development and no classic Reacher.  I actually hated this book.  Towards the end I started skimming paragraphs just to finish.  I very much hope the next Reacher installment is much improved.  A real disappointment.

B008I3R2VG|4.0|I feel a little better that the Killers new disk, 'Battle Born', has somewhat returned to form of their better material.<br /><br />See, I like the Killers' first two disks a lot, but their third, 'Day & Age' only had a handful of decent songs as did Brandon Flowers' solo disk. I had higher hopes for 'Battle Born' and they weren't completely shot to hell.<br /><br />Radio like when their debut came out is not the same, they're not garnering the radio airplay they once had, so the chances of attracting new listeners seem to be slimmer.<br /><br />The band uses a half-dozen producers to take on the disk and that doesn't quite work for them. I have always admired Steve Lillywhite and Daniel Lanois's work, but too much of that anymore is synonymous with U2 and Brendan O'Brien with the later Springsteen stuff - both of which the Killers have emulated -  and well, Stuart Price didn't quite pull off a coup with the Killers' 'Day & Age'.  There is something to be said about mixing it up, but something to be said for continuity. There might be too many chiefs here.<br /><br />Still, Battle Born is pretty good if pretty standard. Good tracks include \\"Flesh and Bone\\", \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\",  the title track, and \\"the Rising Tide\\".<br /><br />\\"From Here on Out\\" is like an outtake from Flowers' solo disk. Not as bad as some of that stuff, but not great band material. ...and like most 'deluxe' versions of any album, there is too much filler and it dilutes the core album.<br /><br />Still 'Battle Born' is a decent of enough disk. Look at it this way - there are more than a few decent songs to lift or Spin to.  ....and sometimes, that's enough.

1454701250|5.0|This book did not disappoint. Plenty of beautiful, color photographs of Gennine's work for inspiration, directions that are easy to read and follow, and great project ideas that I can see myself putting to use. This book will be great for adults and kids and you won't need to break the bank to start creating stamps, simply an eraser, a carving tool and an ink pad.<br /><br />As a follow-up to this review, making the rubber stamps have proved to be great fun and addictive. But to clarify on the review, I would recommend carving with kids over 12+ with adult supervision since the materials required are sharp. Further, the instructions in the book are a bit repetitive and sometimes could have used more explanation, such as carving the outline of the stamp, etc. but Geninne is such a generous artist that if you do have any questions, I highly recommend going to her blog where you can view a rubber stamp carving video that is helpful. I still highly recommend the book and her artwork. Such a talent.

Weiss has a lot of snippets of brilliance, but fails to weave them together in a way that leaves you coming away from this feeling like he felt in the moments where he thought, \\"Only love is real.\\" I think the raw material is there, but it just didn't come together well.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|[[ASIN:B0085Z8F4A Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy)]] There are so many possibilities to explain what was happening in this movie that it makes an exceptional Sci-Fi adventure.  Given the timeline of other Alien films, this one actually raises many more questions that it answers -- which is perfect for me.  Prequels always have a problem that they have to end in a way that you expect them to lead into the next movie, but this one doesn't try too hard to do that, and does so in an exceptional way.  [Spoiler alerts] For instance: if we know from other movies that Predators were already on Earth prior to this movie, then how do we know that the Engineers weren't going to Earth to attack the Predators, not the Humans as those in the movie assume?  We know from later movies that the Aliens and Predators are mortal enemies, so it only makes sense that the Engineers were also enemies with the Predators  -- Engineers being out to create life and Predators to hunt it.  I also truly enjoyed the switch that occurs in who you think the hero of the film will be.  The character makes a real transformation, shows amazing strength, and really makes me feel the pain that she is enduring throughout the movie.<br />I haven't actually watched the 3D version of this yet, but the Blu-Ray is great.  I'll update the review when I do.

B001Q5395Q|3.0|Starting with a goofy premise, and carrying it through consistently to the end, Killer Klowns From Outer Space (1988) is a colorful, and mostly entertaining, horror comedy.  With the theme of aliens dressed as clowns, the film has virtually no logical component, and a loose anything goes attitude, which becomes increasing over the edge.  It's a fun ride, but one that the writers may not have been quite sure how to end.<br /><br />The story follows a classic pattern for alien landings, as a brightly lighted craft passes streaks across the night sky, and lands out in the woods, in the form of a big top tent.  Clowns begin to capture humans, engulfing them in pink stringy material that resembles cotton candy.  Out on a date, Mike (Grant Cramer) and Debbie (Suzanne Snyder) search for the source of light.  They find the tent, enter, and discover some the cotton candy captives, then narrowly escape being captured by a couple of clowns.<br /><br />The pair report the incident to the police.  Sheriff Dave Hanson (John Allen Nelson), Debbie's ex-boyfriend is skeptical, but heads out with Mike to investigate, while Officer Curtis Moody (John Vernon) remains at the station.  The clowns spread out into the town, and begin to attack in a variety of ways.  They strike at the police station, capture Debbie, and bring her to an amusement park.  Dave teams with Mike and his friends, ice cream vendors Paul (Peter Licassi) and Rich Terenzi (Michael Siegel).  They arrive at the park, looking to rescue Debbie, and hopefully save the planet.<br /><br />The special effects, makeup, and sets, are all very well done, and really help to sell silly concept of evil alien clowns, with terrible looking teeth.  The action scenes are well executed, with a spirit of malevolent mirth.  Some of the alien \\"funhouse\\" type sets are especially cool and colorful, with lots of interesting accoutrements.<br /><br />Like an alien invasion tale from the 1950's, the story plays out in almost textbook fashion.  The characters are mostly likeable, although comic input from the Terenzi brothers is borderline annoying, and Debbie's dual love interests is a little awkward at times, as Dave assumes a more active role at the finish.  An amusing mix of the 50's and the 80's, Killer Klowns From Outer Space, is targeted at those who prefer their aliens with a big red nose.The characters are mostly likeable, although comic input from the Terenzi brothers is borderline annoying, and Debbie's dual love interests is a little awkward at times, as Dave assumes a more active role at the finish.

B009NPKTN6|4.0|What a ride!  I love Tom Cruise as an actor, because there's not much he can't do!  This film was fun!
B0018OIK0E|1.0|...and not in a good way. I would not recommend it, unless you were watching it to make fun of it at a party. Even so, it would be lackluster.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|Up until now, I've never been a Cameron Diaz fan, but she nailed it in this one. Same with Jennifer Lopez.I expected a cheesy movie...and it was amazing, all the actresses hit a home run with their performances. The movie looks at pregnancy from various perspectives, a one night stand, a married couple, a couple that can't concieve, the perfect girl that everyone can't help but hate, and also from a variety of male standpoints - young, old, single, married, etc. And basically tells you....you can expect anything, when you're expecting. Good movie.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Great movie, the action, humor, and nods to the original are top-notch. ***spoiler on dwarves coming*** I would have liked the dwarves to be a bit more distinguishable, it seemed like they were all grumpy. Anyways, a must-see.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I've seen both IronMan films, Captain America and Thor, and this is the best of the bunch. Robert Downey Jr. gets all the great lines and his character has all its former insouciance. The rest of the boys look pretty good in their tights too. I will buy this film and watch it again and again as I have the first Iron Man. The special effects are pretty spectacular, even by today's standards. I love how the Hulk actually looks like Mark Ruffalo. Very worthwhile distracting crash boom bang entertainment.
B005LAIGRS|1.0|The one I ordered did not work. So I will not be ordering anymore movies. Was very disappointed was looking forward to seeing this movie.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Wonderful songs, story and set.<br />Grammy, Lily 5 and Sophie all loved this second Movie.<br />We watched in three times in one weekend.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Good flick, definitely makes you think. The ending was kind of open ended, and didn't explain much which is why I hope there is a good sequel.
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|C'mon vamps that walk in the light? So stupid. oh and they sparkle too. Acting is horrible. Amazing what people like nowadays.
B00684J49U|5.0|I purchased this DVD set for a Christmas present that is on my daughter's list.  Shopping on-line is easier for me than getting out to stores.  I received the DVD set on time and in perfect condition. I couldn't ask for a better way to shop.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I pre-ordered this movie and was very disappointed in both the video quality (made in Mexico) along with the movie.  Too much use of four letter words, the dancing was mediocre and repetitive.  I am shocked that Matthew McConaughey, the fine actor that he is, would appear in this type of movie. True story? Maybe, but tough to follow.  Don't waste your time and money on this movie, sorry I bought it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers was action with humor.  My family had alot of laughs watching this movie. The actors are great together,it's worth getting.
B005LAII3U|1.0|just a terrible movie colin farrelle is a terrible actor. how could you remake gold you cant alchemist have tried the original was way better because it had Arnold and his dry sense of humor, make you laugh and then make you die. \\"you think this is the real Quaid? well it is\\". may god have mercy on holy wood for destroying classics. i was fortunate enough not to have paid to see this garbage but unfortunately i had to sit through this awful film FML! if you liked the original buy the new one if you want t be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is simple fun and a very good time killer to have when ur bored or just want to do something with ur life
B008JFLWLE|5.0|It makes math work so much faster and simpler. It is an ingenious app. Works very well and smoothly. Perfect.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I love this movie have watched it many many times. Customer service was super it was sent out so very quick.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci grips you from the get go...a real page turner that is hard to lay down.  Even if some of the plot gets a little far fetched, he delivers it believably.  I read all his stuff and love his storylines, plot, and characters.
B007SGM084|4.0|This book is truly a must read in order to formulate your own opinion. Before reading the trilogy, I heard mixed reviews. If you enjoy romance, suspense, action and drama then this is definitely the book for you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|really good game its so much fun the only thing is they totally copied temple run but they did a realy good job so I don't care love this game
B000JZ68GG|1.0|I never found this anywhere online, I was so disappointed and so was my best friend. Cannot find it anywhere to purchase as of yet.
B002BBJ52U|3.0|This movie wasn't \\"great\\" but it was a good movie for a Sunday afternoon.  It is humerous and heartwarming but definitely not a guy's movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game I play it all the time!! works very well not to many adds very easy to play!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green did an excellent job writing this book. I was skeptical about reading it at first because some of the reviews States that there was no plot. Some stories are just that & I think this is one...a great one.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A moving and delightful account of loss and searching for meaning.  It portrayed the uncertainties and often unsatisfying events in real life.  It is a great adjunct to the movie \\"The Way\\".  As a fan of most things English, I also loved the journey across the land.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. and the graphics are beautiful.  easy gameplay and nice music. love the design and story too.
0307895475|4.0|The guide itself is very helpful guide to all the little hidden secrets of TES V. There is quite a bit of added information for Dawnguard and Hearthfire, but the index is printed in TINY font. If you want to look up something quickly, get out the magnifiying glass. I would have gladly paid more for a few more pages to make the index quickly readable.
1451648537|4.0|i really enjoyed reading this book. Learning about Steves early childhood really interest me in knowing what he went through in his life. All the things that lead him to become what he was, with his strong personality and ambition. His mind set being different from the ones around him, is how he achieved all his goals. Reading all about his adventures and interesting stories during his high school years really got a laugh out of me. Also reading about his first job, introducing him into technology, that he improved over the years, which we now use to this day and enjoy.<br />the one thing i didnt like so much was that getting half way through the book, i already had an idea on what was going to happen, i didnt feel that intrigue towards the end of the book. But overall its a great novel and i would give 4 and a half stars
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|this app is okay. you should get it if you don't have a life. I done recament it so I wouldn't get it.
B000IDEORY|5.0|It was so fun to watch this older movie...I realized that I had never had the chance to watch it all the way through as it came out when my four children were very small and I didn't get to watch any movie all the way through!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a great story!! Very detailed and  couldn't wait to read the next letter! Left me wanting more but still happy with the feeling it left me with!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote definitely helps me keep things organized. I use it for taking notes in class and making lists for everything. Really helpful being in 18 hours of classes and president of an honors society. just need a calandar.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good Book 1 for a trilogy.  You are completely drawn in.  Story line gets better with each book.  She had him at hello.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This was a great dark Dark Knight tale. I especially like seeing Bruce Wayne as an old man since the majority of Batman lore has him young and in his prime. It's nice to see how an aging Bats fares against younger opposition. If you are a Batfan, I highly recommend checking it out, esp. in anticipation of Part 2.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|I bought this DVD on the spur of the moment. Anything Pink Floyd-related has to be good, right? Well, I made such a hasty decision, that I ended up ordering the regular DVD version, rather than the Blu-ray version. Still, I was excited when it showed up in my mailbox ... I could hardly wait to rip off the plastic and pop the first disc into my player and crank up my sound system. Of course, no Blu-ray means no 5.1 surround, so I have to settle for Pro-Logic. At any rate, both the audio and the video qualities are quite good, but I am sad to say that I am disappointed with the A/V synchronization; the video lags the audio just enough to be noticeable (and annoying).<br /><br />With a disc like this, where you get to see Gilmour's fingers make that guitar literally sing, I find it difficult to watch. Plus, it makes it look as if he's lip-synching the whole thing. Therefore, I only awarded 4 stars. Had the sound been in sync with the video, I would easily have rated this disc 5 stars
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Excellent 3D matching game with eye-popping graphics.  Reminds me of Mahjong...only *better* !!  Well worth the buck!  Thanks, dev!  :D.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of the books in this series - if you are looking for an easy read that fills your void of Jack Reacher stories, this will fit the bill.  Fairly predictable and almost a \\"I am tired of writing this one\\" ending.  That being said, if you have invested the time I have in reading this series, it is not one you should miss - just not likely one you will remember.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|Started out had my attention and was somewhat eager to read.  Got 1/3rd into the book and it's become somewhat tedious to read.  I'm NOT jumping to read, NOT straining the bit.
B001DTWJRE|5.0|I'm 23 years old and just now got into reading. This is my third Hemingway book and by far my favorite!!! Great book!!! A must read.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|We had been eager to see Dark Shadows since we missed it in the theater.  It did not disappoint.  Lots of creepy, campy fun.  Johnny Depp was wonderful, as you would expect.  Great performances also by Michele Pfieffer, Helena Bonham Carter, and Jackie Earl Haley.  Eva Greene was the real standout.  She was so deliciously evil! Johnny Lee Miller's character was funny, but for such a talented actor, he did not get nearly enough screen time.  Chloe Grace Moretz is a terrific actress, but was also underused in this movie.  SPOILER - the change her character undergoes at the end of the movie seemed completely pointless and added nothing to the film.  All in all, I would say it was enjoyable and worth watching.
B0095VP8D4|3.0|This apu can be overclocked to 4.3ghz easly with the stock fan. It can play games but dont expect higher than low settings. The reason im giving it 3 Stars its because I bought a 6670 to use dual graphics. But I get really low fps running dual graphics like 10 fps,1080p,low settings. I let the apu run solo I get 30fps with 1080p and low resolution. I dont get this it has not worked for Far Cry 3, Assassins creed 3, Skyrim elder skrolls, and saints row the third. I tried everything the motherboard setting,Updating the firmware and updating amd catalyst. Nothing has worked so if you dont plan to use dual graphics its a great card. Hope it was helpful.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Many questions are answered regarding the origin of the two scifi franchises Alien and Preditor.A absolute must see for fans.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|A fantastic (and fantastical) imagining of what the \\"old gods\\" are doing now that parts of the world have moved on. Finely developed characters, and even if your mythology isn't all inclusive you'll enjoy how he brings things together.
B004B8K2C8|5.0|The series may not have Robert Downey Jr. but it is just as compelling--and closer to Doyle's original vision. Superb plots that give you a shot (though a long one) of solving clues along with Holmes.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Thought this deal was too good to be true when I placed my order, turns out, I was wrong, It was an awesome deal. Thanks Amazon.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like it cause it gives alot of words i used it alot its awesome! that's why i like it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is intuitive and very easy to use.  Browsing from book to book is quick and easy enough to replace your Bible at church.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I won't attempt to summarize the movie as many others have done this before me quite nicely. I will say that I am a 63-yr. old grandfather, but consider myself a film fan and fairly 'with it' regarding current popular culture.<br />I found the movie very interesting and even riveting at times. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a terrific talent and has a very bright future. When I was watching this I could not help but reflect back upon my own high school experience. Maybe I lived a pretty sheltered life. I love documentary films because they deal in reality, and credibility ranks high upon my requirements for a good 'fiction' movie, at least a good crime or drama. Not so sure how high this one would rank on the credibility scale. I kept wondering if we would ever see a parent--aside from The Pin's dutiful mother--and I wondered if the kids ever went to biology class or algebra or social studies. But when you consider that the writer has basically fashioned a 40's-era LA crime noir but used a modern California high school as the setting, you start to get it.<br />After all, they're constantly updating Romeo and Juliet and other Shakespeare plays, so why can't they do it with this one? Give it a chance; I would suppose that younger viewers might be more open to it. But oldsters like me might get hung up on the believability aspect. It's difficult to imagine high-schoolers being this sophisticated, or devious, but if you suspend your sense of credibility and let the story take you along, you might enjoy it. It's an interesting premise, reminding me of River's Edge and Blue Velvet at the same time.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|It was easy to install and read. I learned things I didn't know about my wi-fi system. Clearly helped me determine which channel is best for me.
076781326X|5.0|it was just so wonderful to be able to get this movie. it took me back to when i was in elementary school and saw it with my sister i just wish they could somehow make it blue ray and adaptable for high def
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Is this a serious film about nihilistic teens who kill, about misogyny, about parenthood, about sadism ... about anything real?  No.  It's a silly contrived story with no depth.<br /><br />Is it at least worth seeing for the performances?  No.  I like Tilda Swinton and I like Ezra Miller, but they're not featured well here in these silly shallow parts.  The best acting here is actually done by the young kid playing the evil boy at ages 6 - 8.  He's just a kid; he's not SUPPOSED to be subtle, unless anyone told him to be, so he has an excuse.<br /><br />So, is it at least entertaining in some way?  Like, say, \\"Orphan\\" which is also unrealistic but which is a pretty good suspense film?  No.<br /><br />I could tell this film was awful pretty early on.  I only suffered through it so that I could write this review honestly, and warn others off from this.  It's worthless.
B009VB97EY|3.0|So, the bodies shown in the movie Magic Mike were, in all truth, pretty good.  Too bad they spent so much time on the degredation of feelings, drugs, meaningless sex and booze ...  just really glad i rented this and did not purchase it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The ads are annoying at first (except for the video ones; maybe because they're higher production quality I will often watch and enjoy them).  It's pretty easy to skip the ads you've seen a hundred times before tho so once you've figured out how to do that it's all good. Multi-player solitaire is quite fun too.

1455519006|1.0|I'm a David Baldacci fan.  Not because he's a great writer per se, but because the books are enjoyable easy reads. This one however, is poor.  The story is entertaining because it doesn't make any sense and you're hoping to figure it all out in the end, but the plot is completely sloppy.  It ultimately does not make any real sense.  The connections, the coincidences, the mastermind, conspiracies are beyond plausible.  The \\"make sense of all of it\\" chapter at the end that tries to show the connection between everything, but struggles to connect the dots in a legitimate way.  The timeline does not work, the infiltration isn't believable, and the revenge motive seems way too over the top.  No evil villain would plan such an intricate scenario that has way too many pitfalls  that would derail his desire for revenge.  Too many loose pieces. For this reason, the book is just poor.  The weak plot and explanations left me with an unsatisfied feeling.

B000002KDI|5.0|In my opinion \\"Live Rust\\" is Neil Young at his best. I enjoy the rawness of his live playing and this disc includes many of his most popular songs from his early \\"Decade\\" era. The songs are about equally divided between acoustic and electric songs with most backed by his \\"go to\\" band Crazy Horse. From easy listening ballads like \\"Sugar Mountain\\" and the lamenting \\"The needle and the damage done\\" to rocking standards like \\"Cinnamon Girl and Like a huricane\\" this recording is outstanding from beginning to end with no let up. My favoite cut has to be the oft covered and controversial for it's time \\"Cortez the Killer\\". This 6 minute 19 second centerpeice is full of awesome lyrics and dramatic guitar licks that in my estimation is the crown jewel of the group. Classis rockers should have a coppy of \\"Live Rust\\".
B009AMAMF2|5.0|\\"Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an' tho' a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud an' so is a soul. Who can say where the cloud's blowed from or who the soul'll be 'morrow? Only Sonmi the east an' the west an' the compass an' the atlas, yay, only the atlas o' clouds.\\"<br />― David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas<br /><br />Cloud Atlas was fun and worked for me at least on a number of levels. Best of all it did not feel like it took itself too seriously, which I was afraid of from the trailer.  It was just fun.<br /><br />It just presented as various short stories each taking place in a different time period reusing the same actors. And they all are different genres comedy, scifi, period drama, crime thriller. Each story could just as easily stand on its own, but putting them side by side makes you look at them a little differently than you might have.<br /><br />And I like the idea that while you could view these themes as either views on reincarnation, spirituality and how things happen for a reason ... you can also look at the characters as storytelling archetypes. See how the same type of character might work in a comedy as opposed to a drama for example. See how a comedic character can seem villainous, or how a supporting character expands when they're in the lead.<br /><br />They have a lot of great cliffhangers as you reach a climax in one story and move to another one. And there are connecting threads between the stories which you can view as just establishing them all within the same universe or timeline. Or you could think of it further that the former persons actions directly and unintentionally changes the course of the events on a grander scale than they realize.

DC will be slimy stuff.....the stuff of which tabloids are stuffed and made.<br /><br />Perhaps not something to be part of, even.<br /><br />One really must ask what the shows one acts in will be used for, how they will come out.<br /><br />The recent GAME CHANGE (2012 HBO) show was accused of defaming Sarah Palin of Alaska and others near her....and being a show with a political message, and propaganda favoring one of two sides (it also defamed the entire Republican party leadership indirectly)....i.e. favoring the Obama side of the 2008 election show, while defaming the Palin/ Republican people.<br /><br />TV shows like that can have political and propaganda agendas, and the coming HOUSE OF CARDS show could be the same.<br /><br />Food for thought.<br /><br />Might be well to avoid being used as an actor to be part of a political propaganda vehicle, if it turns out to be that.<br /><br />I must say that after reviewing the BBC version and books telling the Brit. HOUSE OF CARDS stories, I conclude it all has quite a potential for propaganda defaming one side and favoring another. ---------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like a hunting games and then to put a mystery on top of it all. I think people will enjoy this for hours.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun little game.  The only negative note I would add is that the higher levels -- say about the 12X12 grids and up) are a little hard to play on a smart phone, as opposed to a tablet, because the dots and lines get so small that it's easy to mess up because your fingers can't stay out of the way of the work you've already done.  Other than that, I quite like it.
B00979CS50|4.0|Neil Young is an artist that never has a loss of things to say.  Sometimes it seems like he and his buddy Willie Nelson are in a contest to see who can release more albums over their careers.  With such a hugh output, sometimes with Neil you get a gem and sometimes you get a product that's just so-so.  I have to admit I'm biased towards the full out sonic bombast that Neil and Crazy Horse make together, so I was excited to hear what \\"Psychadelic Pill\\" had to offer.<br /><br />For the first minute and twenty seconds of this release it sounds like the solo-acoustic Neil is taking you another acoustic guitar based ride, but that's when the electric guitars and signature Crazy Horse sound come in.  The first song on this album is \\"Driftin' Back\\" which has to be described as a jam band fan's wet dream.  At 27:37 in length it's longer than some country albums that are in my collection.  It showcases Neil doing what he wants moving the song from slow to fast then back to slow again with his guitar solo the centerpiece.  Late in the song Neil takes a jab at the state of the music industry being dominated by mp3 sales with the lines \\"When you hear my song now / You only get 5% / You used to get it all / You used to get it all.\\"  I couldn't agree with him more on that point.<br /><br />After such a lengthy first track, the second track \\"Psychadelic Pill\\" comes in like a mere blip at only 3:28 of hard rocking crunchy guitars and a flanged up vocal track.  It's about a girl \\"looking for a good time\\" and Neil and the Horse seem to be having a good time just turning it up to 11 and playing.  There's an alternative mix included at the end of the album as well.<br /><br />The joy of \\"Psychadelic Pill\\" is quickly taken down a notch on the third track \\"Ramada Inn\\" which is another mammoth lengthed track coming in at 16:51.  It is a song about a long, hard relationship looking for a way to keep going through alcoholism.  The time here is also filled with some of Neil's signature guitar work.  I don't know why it is, but the more Neil makes the guitar sound distorted and sloppy the better the effect.  It really does come across as a force of nature that can't be held back.<br /><br />\\"Born In Ontario\\" closes out the first disc with a bit of a country vibe sneaking into the Crazy Horse bombast.  It's not the best song on the album, but there's nothing wrong with a guy proclaiming his passion for where he is from.<br /><br />The second disc kicks off with \\"Twisted Road\\" a song about the music that Neil grew up with, paying homage to Bob Dylan, Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, The Dead and others.  Again, not the best song on the album and it could have used a little more punch.<br /><br />The riffs and punch return in \\"She's Always Dancing\\" but it's a jam band song devoid of any meaningful lyrics.  Not that it's a bad thing, it's a great melodic piece and stands alone with no lyrics at all.  I just think it could have been an even better, more impactful piece had the lyrics been fleshed out a bit.  With that said, the guitar is once again right in my wheelhouse on this track.<br /><br />The next to last track \\"For The Love Of Man\\" features a restrained Crazy Horse on what is a heartfelt ballad about having a disabled child.  It was originally written years ago and while it seems like an odd fit for a Crazy Horse album it is the most touching track here.<br /><br />The album comes to an end (not including the bonus track) with another epic lengthed sonic bombast guitar filled track \\"Walk Like A Giant\\" where Neil seems to come to terms with the fact that we are all just small players on a much bigger stage.  We know that Neil's generation wanted to change the world and while on some levels they did there is still a whole lot more to be figured out.  Neil delivers the angst here that you might expect from a kid blaring out his first track in a garage somewhere, which makes me smile.  Whether or not you agree with Neil Young you can't deny his passion for his work.<br /><br />It's not a perfect album, I don't think it's going to deliver any timeless anthems like many of Neil's past discs have and I don't think it can hold up with the genius of previous Crazy Horse collaborations like \\"Ragged Glory\\" or \\"Freedom\\" but it's still a damn good record.<br /><br />* EDIT * As someone pointed out to me in the comments \\"Freedom\\" wasn't a Crazy Horse backed record, just Frank \\"Poncho\\" Sampedro from the band appeared on the album.  It is still one of my favorite albums which features Neil Young absolutely shredding it on the hard rocking tracks.is work.<br /><br />It's not a perfect album, I don't think it's going to deliver any timeless anthems like many of Neil's past discs have and I don't think it can hold up with the genius of previous Crazy Horse collaborations like \\"Ragged Glory\\" or \\"Freedom\\" but it's still a damn good record.<br /><br />* EDIT * As someone pointed out to me in the comments \\"Freedom\\" wasn't a Crazy Horse backed record, just Frank \\"Poncho\\" Sampedro from the band appeared on the album.

0316113506|4.0|I've been exercising with weight training and high intensity interval training for a year now, very consistently. Have gained a lot of strength and stamina, haven't had the best results with reducing bodyfat. While exercising I feel great, then for a few hours afterwards, but I still have way more depression & anxiety that is not being improved.<br /><br />I plan on getting a Garmin  gps watch with a heartrate monitor to get in the range and start running, hoping it is the missing piece of the puzzle. Still a good book, better to check the library, I can't say it's a keeper.<br /><br />This book is about exercise and the brain mostly, it completely ignores nutrition, just so ya know. Must have good fuel for the motor to run well.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book is the best book she has written in probably the last five years, but nothing like her earlier books.<br /><br />I have read every book she has written cover to cover except Jaack the Ripper and Ruth Bell Graham's biography.  Unlike her past few books, this one continually held my interest and I would read it every chance I could get and is a page turner.<br /><br />I m glad to see she is back to writing in the first person.  She could have done a lot more with Luke's character in the book and not really sure why she even introduced the characters storyline since it didn't have much to do with the book, unless he will come into play in future books.<br /><br />She could have cut down on some of the pages.  I am not sure why she has to continually mention Iphones by name, it's almost like Apple is paying for product placement.  Or why it seems like in every recent book she has to bring up her kitchen has two fridges, the stainless appliances and the type of kitchen cabinets she has and goes into unnecessary detail whenever she cooks something.<br /><br />I recomend this book for anyone that is a Patricia Cornwell fan.  While it's nothing like the books she wrote pre blowfly, it's a big improvement over her past few books.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|Of all the horror gems, no creature is as frightening, and no face more durable in one's nightmares than Boris Karloff's portrayal of Frankenstein's monster in this Universal classic, \\"Frankenstein\\" (1931).<br />This newly remastered 75th anniversary version is superior in every way to any prior DVD issue. The video print is pristine and the sound, updated to 5.1, is incredible.<br />When 19-year-old Englishwoman Mary Shelley penned the \\"Frankenstein\\" novel in 1818, she had no way of knowing the legend she was creating. Nor could she have imagined Boris Karloff's brilliant portrayal of the misunderstood man-monster that Dr. Victor Frankenstein, (Colin Clive) created from grave-robbed body parts, including, quite by accident, the brain of a violent madman, which of course creates all the problems for Victor's ill-fated creation. One closeup look at the face of the Frankenstein monster, as Karloff portrays him, and one never forgets it. The makeup is brilliantly conceived by Universal Studios' \\"monster-maker\\", in makeup genius Jack Pierce: Heavy steel braces were fitted to his legs to stiffen his gait. The sleeves of his coat were drastically shortened to make his arms appear unnaturally long. Then there's the monster's Neanderthal brow which sets those \\"eyes-staring-from-Hell\\" deep into the face. The pallor, the thin cruel mouth--this is truly the gaunt face of terror itself, the stuff of worst-nightmares. Mr. Karloff himself added a final, frightful touch: Coats of wax were applied to Boris' eyelids to make it appear as though Death was desperately trying to close those eyes again, without sucess. Yet the creature itself has a fragile humanity that both frightens and draws us to him sympathetically all at once. In contrast, monsters in most any other horror or sci-fi films have makeup so cartoonish that they lose whatever believability and humanity that might have been theirs. Karloff's Frankenstein role works because his physical presence is immediately recognizedas quite human. Yet it is, by turns, both highly vulnerable and very dangerous. Boris plays the role emotionally for all that it is worth, without overdo. His performance in this movie, as well as \\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\" which followed, would, without question, earn Boris Karloff an Oscar.<br />Today, that is.<br />In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, though, Hollywood looked smugly down its' nose at horror movies, regardless of whatever meritorious performances lay within them. Today, the genius of Mr. Karloff, master of so many genres, is universally recognized. (Example: Who among you hasn't grown up loving the original cartoon version of, \\"How The Grinch Stole Christmas\\", which Boris lovingly narrated?)<br />\\"Frankenstein\\" opens with a warning given by actor Edward Van Sloan, (Dr. Waldman in the film). He cautions that some skittish audience members might wish to leave the theater beforehand, as they may find \\"Frankenstein\\" a \\"shock\\". \\"It may even horrify you,\\" Van Sloan intones.<br />Laugh all you want at this today, but the warning was most serious to audiences that December, 1931. One must understand that \\"Frankenstein\\" broke several taboos of the era: Cadavers, human brains pickled in lab jars, the body of a man swinging from a hangman's noose, not to mention the violent acts of The Monster himself, which are too many to list here. Such things were n-e-v-e-r shown onscreen before, period. This movie broke historic ground on many fronts.<br />There are some weird, almost comical inconsistencies that were common in films of the time, most notably the fact that Victor is supposed to be the son of a German baron. That baron, while dressed in Tyrolean attire, has a decidedly upper-crust British accent, as does Colin Clive's Victor character. That would never pass in this age of Christ speaking Aramaic onscreen; Authenticity is king nowadays, but in this case such flaws are easy to dismiss.<br />A final note: Since \\"Frankenstein\\" is essentially a morality play, the producer Carl Laemmle took distinct advantage of the black and white film medium using a technique called \\"chiaroscuro\\". This means that there are almost constant, symbolic contrasts onscreen between light and darkness, a.k.a good and evil. It works wonderfully. Better yet, viewing \\"Frankenstein 75th\\"  on any digital TV shocks me. Not just for Mr. Karloff's brilliant work, but it's amazing how well a black and white flick of that generation cleans up. The picture quality is simply astonishing.<br />All said, don't try to call yourself a horror movie buff unless you own \\"Frankenstein 75th\\". **<br /><br />** P.S. I would also add Karloff's, \\"The Mummy 75th Anniversary\\" (1932),\\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\" (1935), and \\"The Son of Frankenstein\\" (1939) in my must-have list!<br /><br />  - John T.R. Gorman
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I absolutely loved the first book and was excited to read the second.<br />The story kept me guessing from start to finish , it kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />The descriptive writing is amazing and kept my imagination running wild. Can't wait to read the next one.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|With only the 5th part left before the release of Halo 4, this has been an amazing movie thus far. As I had hoped a Halo movie would be, it's visually on par with Battlefield LA and District 9. Me and my wife have been waking up each Friday morning and watching the new episode first thing. I expected this to be low budget looking and it's Halo so who cares. The acting is completely believable, nothing I would roll my eyes at from overacting or silliness, and the CGI blew us away. It was done far better than I imagined it would be. I was skeptical about whether or not (trying to avoid spoilers here) \\"certain things\\" would be shown through CGI or not and when they were our jaws dropped for the rest of the episode. This is so good and a definite indication a good Halo movie can be done. 343 has done complete justice in keeping the fiction entertaining and we can't wait to see what the game is like. Please make more movies!!!!!
B0029O08WA|5.0|I listen to the cd alot......& it reminds of Bella's & Edward's story all over again. It fills the story out.
159514188X|5.0|This book is truly a great read. For anyone who has ever been bullied or for anyone who likes to read something a little more realistic this is a great choice. Don't read it if you are too sentimental, a lot happens and some of it is pretty rough.
B001S86J0I|5.0|There is just enough satire and spoof to make it really funny, and just enough of its own story to make it a great movie! Add great actors and you can't go wrong with this choice! Funny, family and date friendly!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome.you get paid in coins after you complete a game and you use the coins to buy the games you want
B009NPKTN6|3.0|I enjoyed the movie and especially Tom Cruise.  He was totally into this role.  There is a lot of singing throughout the movie. A little too much singing for me but a fair movie never the less.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|John Hiatt continues to amaze me.  How can so much talent be in one person.  Incredible song writer.  For some he is an acquired taste, but I loved him from the first time I heard him which was Bring the Family, Slow Turning, and Stolen Moments.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book, couldn't put it down. Gives insight to a young troubled mind, very interesting. I will read it again and again
B0091REZMW|2.0|too much going on at one time. have to spend more money to continue play. not worth it after having to purchase game
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Love this movie for the dance scenes.  There isn't much of a story line, but the dancing makes up for the lack of story line.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|This CD is classy, smooth and melodic.<br />Beth Orton's voice has subtly matured and developed richness in tone and depth from her Trailer Park and Central Reservation days. This release is worth the wait.<br /><br />Beth had been kicking these songs around for some time, as I'd seen her perform some of these live in an acoustic stripped-down fashion at the Melbourne Athenaeum on the 20th January, '12.<br />I'd read in InPress that Beth Orton was playing at the Athenaeum that night. She was back touring some 6 years after her last album.<br />Thought, why not, booked a ticket that afternoon, headed into town from work. Walking to train station, I got the sad news my niece had just died of cancer.<br />Feeling a bit sombre, I was pleasantly surprised with this concert, done in an unplugged style with piano and guitar accompaniment. The lilt and the melodies just lifted my mood.<br />The content was full of new songs, I thought that some were better and stronger than anything she'd done prior.<br /><br />I guess the gestation period of musical product is subject to the marketing whims of recording companies.<br />All the tracks are melodic and tuneful, simple arrangements, piano and guitar-based, building depth with subtle strings, woven into the lilt and rise of Beth's voice.<br />Where does this music fit in genre ? Call it indie alt-folk if you like. Just slap it on the CD platter when you want to de-stress and mellow-out your mood.
B009EANE3M|1.0|I am the Script super fan. I would be a groupie if my job allowed it. When #3 came out I bought it right away. I am so sad to say I was severely disappointed. Way too much... would you call that rapping??? was taking place in the majority of the tracks. Their 2nd CD changed my life, this one I would like my money back.
B005LAII3U|1.0|Ultimately, it only makes the audience scratch their heads in confusion. Why make a less good version of this movie? Couldn't this money have been spent on something original? Paul Verhoven is still alive. Why not pay him to keep making more hits?
0061992860|5.0|It's fun just reading some of this book's fun survival facts to another person. It holds a wealth of information. Edible/poisonous plants, first aid care, shelter building, snare building, knot tying, signaling... there's a lot in here. Very useful guide, even for a beginner like myself.
B00498XRPE|4.0|I spun up Alien in anticipation of watching Promethius.  From that context, it was nice to go back and see the original story.  There are some interesting overlaps (but small and almost insignificant) - Alien didn't explain or set a backdrop for promethius.  My guess is that Scott had the prop with the giant in the navigation chair left over in his garage and wanted to base a whole movie around it.  It was a minor part of the Alien movie - a scene seen in passing at most.<br /><br />but giving the movie it's due - I once again enjoyed seeing the original story.  With all of the follow up movies, the simplicity of the original flick was lost and in my mind at least, I had the story lines of the 5 or so alien movies all mixed up.  There were parts of the original that I forgot completely, so it was nice unscrambling my recollection again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is an amazing game! it can be a little hard on some games but it is good for burning time.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I had the original iPhone and purchased many accessories (Bose speakers, and many other type of speakers).  When I purchased my iPhone 4, I found that I lost the ability to have my phone charged while using these speakers.  I ordered this product, as well as Patazon Black Extension Dock Extender 30pin Adapter for iPod iPhone 4 4S.  The CableJive not only is an extension (needed for certain iPhone cases on the market), but it also allows charging.  The Patazon Adapter (which was about $4.00) does not allow charging.  The price difference for allowing full function of my accessories are well worth it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I like it! Definitely worth the the two bucks. Its more challenging than the other search games I've played. I like that, though. I like that it has an expert mode too. I haven't played it on that mode but I like I have an option.
B006LSZECO|4.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is a fabulous, delicious read!  Like a roller coaster through the dark, I wasn't sure where Gillian was taking me next!  I can't wait to read another Gillian Flynn work.  The genre of mystery is BACK and better than ever!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|awesome this app helps me so much with my work and questions I have about math. it also helps with decimals and almost everything you need.
1742200206|5.0|A few years ago I would have looked at a Lonely Planet travel book and moved on to another publisher. Not any more, since the Lonely Planet travel books have been transformed dramatically into one of the best travel books on the market. This particular book is on New York City and the first thing one will notice is the large map in the back  of the city. I noticed that in the travel book there are 84 museums covered along with 11 walking tours plus 247 restaurants. In New York there are thousands of restaurants and this book covers some of the best and most interesting.<br /><br />The travel book starts with the \\"Top 16 for New York City\\" and these include Central Park, Skyscrapers, Broadway Shows, The Statute of Liberty and the list goes on and on. There is a section of \\"need to know\\", that will assist you in planning for your trip and once there, these sections becomes a very handy reference guide. If you have only a limited amount of time to be in New York City there are suggested itineraries.<br /><br />One of the best sections is called  \\"Explore New York City\\" and here you find the various sections of town along with unique neighborhoods where you can spend unlimited amount of time exploring. There are a great many neighborhood maps scattered throughout the book. These over 430 pages are filled with all kinds of useful information and is one of the best, if not the best travel book, I now have on New York City. Well worth the small print price.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was reading it at work on my break and had to stop reading because it almost made me cry. I felt the love and the bond of the sisters. I have four daughters and I know how they look out for each other. I could really feel all the emotions in this book. Well done!
B0086HGW42|5.0|I saw this guy on Ellen and had heard his song on the radio, so looked him up on amazon, the samples sounded good, so got the album. It is great. He is an excellent song writer, really comes from the soul. So glad i made this purchase.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|really like this dvd with johnny depp he has unusual talents he is very able to play different kinds of roles
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|As the first point and click adventure game I ever purchased, I must give it five stars. The storyline was very interesting and the graphics along with the eerie music made it a little spooky which I loved. After purchasing many other games in this genre, I still consider this my favorite. The hints were very helpful at times, and the game was far from short. Hoping for a sequel soon!
1439130833|5.0|This DVD was life changing for me. I eventually shared with my son who completely agrees. I now have it on my IPOD in audio and listen several times a month. My favorite part is the Gratitude Rock. I have had several.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this is the most fun and entertaining game to play at home or just to plash for lots of fun.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|In short; Relaxing, Clear and Crisp sounds, Very pretty melodies, No annoying loops..And i really love the UI. Will purchase full version to support Dev. Just keep on adding new sounds to keep us happy. Nice job. xx
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed Book One in spite of racing through it and feeling like it was a superficial read. He's just a great storyteller even if the characters were thin. But Book Two totally pulled me in. At first I thought it was going to simply be hard-core Nazi horrors, but the characters really came through against the backdrop of these frightening times.You know you've read a good book when you're genuinely sorry to reach the end...and I am. I guess my only complaint, and it's super minor, is that some of his assumptions about women--their sexuality and things like breast-feeding--seem to be written by...well, a man! For one thing, women don't immediately start producing milk upon a baby's delivery. He might as well get the details right. But this is a quibble. Can't wait for Book 3.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Streamed through Amazon. The quality was great as was the movie. I recommend renting movies from Amazon. I have a device that let's me stream to my TV.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy this book given the hot and cold reviews.  I am so glad I did!  The book was amazing!  I find most thrillers predictable, but I didn't see the twists and turns coming at all.  I literally could not put this book down.  Some of the reviews complained about being disappointed in the way it ended.  I thought the ending was perfect.  It kept tone with the rest of the book.  This is my first book review, but I liked it so much that I thought I needed to say so.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Obviously if you are looking to purchase the secound season you loved the first. I highly suggest it the first eppasode was a bit of a struggle to see how we were going to connect the lives of our favorite characters but they did a great job.  Wonderful writing and tallented actors to pull it off.  I love this show! Picture and sound were also excellent. I couldn't watch anything else until I found out what happened in the end.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|Think DIE HARD meets---whaddevva. Lockout is still a good yarn for a popcorn \\"let's not think much about this\\" viewing. Just leave rational thinking and logic out of any plot evaluation.<br /><br />On balance the film is well acted although the writers tried too hard to do a 'Bruce Willis in Space' main character. Fine action sequences (if a bit---errr---unbelievable).<br /><br />Overall the film is well lit and filmed, and overall offers an entertaining diversion from reality.<br /><br />Of note is that the \\"making of\\" additional material is interesting in terms of how to do a lot w/o a lot of money. All of the creative thinking on a budget translated into a film that looks more expensive to produce than it did.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Wanted one as I was going to have a hip replacement operation, then in rehab.  Daughters bought it for me and got just the right one.  Love its many offers, and have already signed up for Kindle Prime.  I would suggest it to anyone.
B009FZZFME|5.0|i love this show sometimes i don't even want to wait to see the rest i wish we could watch at least 2 shows a week but i really love this show im posted in front of the tv every sunday
B009K0OPQQ|2.0|To go along with all this cheesy acting.<br /><br /> I didn't think the first season was all that great but I thought it had potential and would pickup so I watched it to the end. I have seen every single last episode of this series to date and I'm not sure Why I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It goes from \\"Okay,to Interesting, to Good, to Terrible, to Great, to Completely Awful\\" and that seems to be the episode cycle with this series. The balance of story writing and acting ability is never consistent with this show. Sometimes there's a really good episode and then one that is a complete flop. It's as though each episode has a different writer like this is a series of short stories all by different authors. Some time you hate you missed the show and sometimes you wish you didn't waste your time to watch it all. Then complied into that is the acting, and how bad it is. There are maybe but a handful of \\"good\\" actors on this show and they are all Villians. With the exception of Mulan just about everyone else makes you want to cringe at the way they deliver their lines. It's as though Uwe Boll is directing this show. The acting is completely all over the place.<br /><br /> For starters Seeing less Henry and more story started to make this show seem more promising and then came season 2. Not only is Henry all over the place but as usual he is the most annoying character on the show. I get it this kids supposed to be a key character but his acting is awful in every scene which makes watching him just make you shake your head and hope the scene ends soon. Whether the writers have him doing some stupid and pointless idea or if he's just running around town nagging people with the same \\"I want to help\\", \\"your a story book character\\" it just gets old and quick. Why and I mean WHY would you give the worst actor on your show the most screen time? This kids acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Kevin Costner! and I know \\"he's just a kid\\" yeah and a terrible actor. I wouldn't cared much or have said much if they didn't cram this kids in your face every 5 minutes into the show. No matter what the story is as soon as this kid appears it's ruined. I don't even understand this kids story. So what if his adoptive mother is an evil witch. She's nicer than 99.9% of the mothers out there.<br /><br /> Unlike his real mother she didn't abandon him and actually wants to be his mother.

She's a great mother but this kid can't stop complaining about her. For what? Pampering and spoiling him? Worse thing she ever did was try to show him how to use magic. If this show stuck to the point and didn't jump back and fourth to this pointless Henry Mills side story it would probably be worth watching. Instead I just find myself looking to spend an hour doing something else before TWD comes on.<br /><br />and by all means do bring the thumbs down. Hate the idea that someone sees this series for what it is. Semi interesting plot trouble by bad writing/acting.ared much or have said much if they didn't cram this kids in your face every 5 minutes into the show. No matter what the story is as soon as this kid appears it's ruined. I don't even understand this kids story. So what if his adoptive mother is an evil witch. She's nicer than 99.9% of the mothers out there.<br /><br /> Unlike his real mother she didn't abandon him and actually wants to be his mother.

B005KMX866|5.0|If you remember any of the songs this double disc set includes (and the artists that did them originally) then you will almost certainly appreciate the craftsmanship, musicality and attention to detail involved in making the collection.<br /><br />It is apparant that a lot of \\"love\\" for the genre and Sun Records was involved in recreating the material, and some of the 'covers' of famous hit songs are remarkable and almost all are really faithful to the originals.<br /><br />Chris Isaak should be really proud of this work! He is a really gifted performer!<br /><br />I am very glad I purchased it.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|This series, like most things HBO does, is out of the park! A home run! Awesome story line. Incredible acting. Breathtaking live action sets! If you want a story to wrap up into, Game of Thrones is for you!
B008XJM8IW|2.0|i was also burned by the \\"clean\\" version with no explicit language.  if i wanted to pick up a cd at walmart, i'd do just that.<br />the album itself, however, is sub-par and a big let down.  catchy, as all green day is, but weak.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book was defintely not a page turner, but it was somewhat interesting. The end was just disgusting. I never want to believe that people are actually capable of this or would degrade humanity to this point.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is a classic Kiss album but more - fresh, alive and bursting with an energy that a band that has been around this long simply shouldn't have. The band is clearly enjoying a new lease of life in the current format, and this album is as good as anything they have produced this side of Alive II. Ripping guitar solos, great song writing, fun, raucous rock n roll. Well done boys! You've done the KISS Army proud.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I have always been a fan of Mumford ever since the first time i heard them. Babel is well worth my money.
B000V674E8|5.0|Loved this album when it first came out. While so many albums of that era sound dated, this one sounds so fresh that you'd never know it was issued in the '70s. So many great songs and that unique Supertramp sound. Happy to have it back in my collection.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I would give this game 5 stars if it had some real hints to avoid getting hung up on any one level. Great graphics and also lends itself to replay.
B003VANOFY|5.0|excellent headphones even bought them on sale. even my son was impressed. he asked when would i buy him a set. told to get a job and buy them himself. excellent product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and fell in love with it so I just had to read the book! I am really glad I did this book is amazing and was really hard to put down. Now on to the second book and I can't wait. I really hope peeta and katnis work things out and end up together for real!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The above book is a fitting sequel to Fall of Giants. Once again Ken Follett had me up long into the night. Cannot wait for the next book of the Trilogy.  I am German and therefore particularly interested in Follett's portrayal of post WWll Germany.
B001FA0NZ6|2.0|Not thrilled that I spent money on this book.  The first part is really the same advice we've been given by Brown.  The rest of the book is dedicated to a career in beauty.  If I could, I would return this book.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|bought movie for my son and he watches it almost everyday! i know it word from word. thanks very much
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This was a book club selection, so like a good student, I committed to reading QUIET. As I turned early pages, I settled in.....finding the writing easy on the eyes and intriguing for the brain.  I began reading it enthusiastically, thinking I would learn about others and I wound up understanding myself better.  Susan Cain has completed amazing research and has made the information palatable.  I'm giving copies away as presents to friends!
B004KSQN7C|4.0|I like this album and I do believe it is the best album to date. I mean at least there were more than one song that I can keep replaying and not get sick of it versus in her past albums, you can probably just pick the hit songs as the best ones. I almost liked every song's rhythm. The music isn't too rowdy, but pretty smooth to listen to. I'm glad she is back on her track. She has worked hard, been lost due to publicity and such, but hopefully she is back on her \\"A\\" game. Go Britney!
B004EPYZUI|1.0|(This review is about the extended version on Blu ray, I haven't seen the theatrical version, but I assume it can only be better since it's shorter)<br /><br />I've seen my share of bad movies, but Sucker Punch is the first one that really made me angry for wasting 2 hours of my time.<br /><br />Sucker Punch was marketed as an action movie with pretty girls and gorgeous CGI. When I read some reviews about it trying to be \\"clever\\" and failing at it, I initially thought \\"well, it's going to be like The Matrix or Inception, good action/fantasy flicks with a pseudo-clever plot that one might enjoy or not, but which doesn't ruin the overall movie\\".<br /><br />I didn't have high expectations for Sucker Punch, I was just expecting an ok (or even below average) action movie. Turns out I was very wrong.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes of the movie are deceptive, because they make you believe the movie might actually have a solid scenario. The introduction is actually pretty good, the background story of the heroin is well introduced with beautiful dark images (Zack Snyder is good for this), and it tricks you into believing the movie is actually going to be \\"clever\\" as far as action movies go.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the 3 levels of reality the heroin will evolve in: her real life, where she is in an asylum scheduled for lobotomy, her dreams where she is a high-class prostitute working in a  brothel/casino, and her dreams within here dreams where she is the heroin of various video-game-like adventures with her friends.<br /><br />This might have looked good on paper, but practically this film fails on so many levels that it made me want to throw the remote at my screen.<br /><br />The most shocking part is the disgusting mix between the dark background story (a girl who is, in 2 levels of reality, scheduled for lobotomy, or scheduled to be sold for her body, and in both cases under the constant threat of rape) and the super manga/videogame universe, in which she evolves dressed in a schoolgirl uniform taken directly from a 14 year-old boy's wet dreams. So which one is it, Zack? Are we supposed to feel sorry for the girl because she is being abused, or turned on by the school girl uniforms and the massive amount of cleavage in the action sequences? Eventually, this lack of direction in what the audience is supposed to feel will lead you to either become bored, or feel dirty (is anyone supposed to be turned on by the sexy fighter when 10 minutes ago she was under the threat of being raped?)<br /><br />As an action movie, Sucker Punch fails because the action scenes have absolutely no suspense or no stake. When people get hurt in the Matrix, they get hurt in the real world to. In Sucker Punch, we see the heroin getting punched by a giant, her body hitting a wall at full speed, and not even sweating for it. As a result, from the first action scene, we know that nothing major is going to happen there. The result is that the action scenes follow each other and each one is more boring than the previous, despite the orgy of CGI spat at the audience.<br />The action scenes look like they are some kind of Promotion Video for video games, but even video games have better plots than that. At some point in the movie, the girls have to kill a dragon. The dragon is protected by Orcs, so they have no choice but to kill the Orcs, then the dragon, which is ok. But once they're done killing the orcs and the dragon, they start killing the paladdins that were fighting the orcs. So, which side are they on? Apparently none, as long as it means even more action scenes will be shown.<br /><br />As a drama, Sucker Punch fails because the audience doesn't get attached to any character at any time. The characters are dumb, and the scenario is weak. Dialogs are terrible, and not helped by actors who overall deliver a poor performance. Since the whole plot consists for the girls in finding 5 items, and it is described as if we were in a video game for retarded kids, there is, again, absolutely no emotion or suspense involved. Get one item, succeed, proceed to the next item, and so on. At some point, one of the girls dies, and you'll have a bad time remembering her name, who she is, why she was here, and why you even care... And if it wasn't enough, towards the end, the scenario decides that the true heroin of the movie is not the one you've been following for 2h, but another girl you didn't even care about, so if the audience's interest wasn't lost before, Snyder guarantees to do it at the end.<br /><br />As a movie overall, Sucker Punch pretends to be clever, but gives away everything so obviously that it is insulting to the audience. \\"Oh, she was in the asylum the whole time, let me show you 5 minutes of obvious connections between the two worlds to make it more obvious for you\\". It is amazing how a movie that pretends to have so many layers is actually so flat and dumb.<br /><br />The whole 2h are spent like that, alternating between poorly written/acted drama scenes, boring action sequences, and obvious scenario plots so that the 13 year old kid watching the movie can pretend that people who didn't like the movie just \\"didn't get how deep it is\\".<br /><br />In some interviews, director Zack Snyder claimed the movie was about girl-empowerment, which makes me question his sanity even more. Hopefully, the target audience of this movie (13~20 year old males with serious hormone issues) understands that when a girl tries to run away from her terrible reality through her dreams, she doesn't dream that she is a prostitute, or the hyper-sexualized-heroin of a console FPS...<br /><br />Let me add a 4th level of reality here. The lobotomy announced at the beginning of the movie is actually a message for the audience: it's going to take 2 hours and you'll be brainless after watching Sucker Punch.<br /><br />Terrible, Terrible movie, I'm so sad I gave Hollywood my money for that piece of trash.<br /><br />Pros<br />- The images are good. Zack Snyder plays well with the 3 levels of reality when it comes to colors, etc...<br /><br />Cons<br /> - basically everything else. The scenario is lame, acting is sub-par, action sequences are boring, dialogs are terrible, there is no stake, no suspense, no emotion at all in this movie.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|I liked this movie when it first came and seeing it again made me like it even more thanks. great quality to be a used DVD.
0525953728|2.0|Pros: seals are awesome. Real life super heros.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Learn more about seals from national geographic. The CNN special on the footsteps of bin laudin was much More interesting, by far.<br />2. Author says he is not an egomaniac, but the irony is that his book makes him look that way.  The big bad guns, the special treatment, the prompt and snobby disrespect toward an &#34;old&#34; plane that he only later discovered was a historical icon.<br />3. He dogs on politicians. This is disrespectful to the people who have to consider bigger issues than just when to fly In with guns blazing and killing people.<br />4. Book is self serving. He try's to say that the other seals are just as good as him, but I felt like he was trying to just win acceptance from his peers. Like they were talking trash on him and wondering why him and not me on the mission.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Purchased the cheaper version of McLintock and was unhappy with CD.  Was clearly an inferior copy.  The official copy is so much better, there is no comparison.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie started out a little slow.  I thought it was an overall good movie.  Lots of things to follow.  Good Sci-fi flick.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I downloaded this item on my kindle fire to scan for viruses.  You never know when downloading apps, games, music or videos whether you will contract a virus.  This product works great!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is my go-to game. It is 1 of the best ones that I have and everyone who plays it on my phone really enjoys it.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Played perfect, and tropic thunder is one of my favorite movies. It came right on time and was not damaged, very happy with my buy!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It's a little repetitive in the beginning. Once you hit halfway it gets interesting. I loved the whole trilogy and I miss the Greys!
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|So glad Amazon had this episode... I missed the first one.  Video very clear... sound quality was great!  Downloading on Kindle Fire takes some time... may be my internet service.. not sure!  But well worth the wait & price.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|So how big a portal fan are you?  If you are like me, pretty big. In fact, if you end up on this page, you are almost certainly a big portal fan, because let's face it, this music is not going to be burning up the top 40 charts any time soon.  So, Mr. or Mrs. Big Fan, here you go--four discs worth of portally goodness to listen to as you are testing (or doing anything else you want).  There's all the tunes you know and love, including some tracks from Portal 1, and some vocals from GLaDOS (you murdering fiend).  Please be aware that many of these tracks are available for free from the Official Portal site, but if you need to have a physical copy, then this will suit you just fine.  I give it five stars because I admire the obsessive completion that lets it span four discs, and the composition is all top notch--but you knew that, because you've played the game 15 times already.  Haven't you? Well haven't you?  SO, in summary, the music is good, and the cake is a lie.
B00866JLEG|5.0|Best-Selling author, Nicholas Sparks, has created an awesome, stirring, touching, sometimes \\"funny\\" and romantic movie featuring Zac Efron as U.S. Marine Sergeant Logan Thibault who is desparately searching for a woman, Beth (played by Taylor Schilling) whose photo served as a good-luck charm to the Sergeant and ultimately saved his life during the war. Through a series of circumstances the Sergeant finds himself in the employ of Beth's Grandmother (played by Blythe Danner) and through his employment the Sergeant comes face to face with the woman whose face graces the photo. Each character plays a pivotal part in determining their own personal destiny. As Logan, Beth and Nana embark upon this journey together each are forced to face their own demons and to once again find a new purpose in life, as well as an understanding of the loss they have each suffered....most importantly, the ability to forgive and to love again. Zac and Taylor show great on-screen chemistry together...red-hot chemistry! This movie runs the gamut of emotions.....devastating loss during war, the budding romance of new love, personal inspiration and a lot of down-right fun! I loved it and know that this is a movie I will enjoy watching over and over!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was lost in the beginning, but once I caught on it was interesting. If you like shockers read this book. The ending could have been better. I would read this again, it seems like a book that once you read it you could reread it and find more details.
B009LH1WLO|5.0|Missed this episode.. someone skipped it on the dvr.  So I decided to download the video & watch on my kindle fire.  Great quality in sound & picture.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|Some excellent reviews of this album that cover all you need to know about the music ... so all I can do is agree! Truly, as others have noted, this was a daring, revolutionary album when it was released. Innovative production and puutting out songs that took up the whole side of an album? Insane ... and brilliant. This was a true immersion in soul magic, hot buttered, funky, and silky smooth. My only knock against this \\"Anniversary\\" edition is the fact that the \\"Bonus\\" tracks are simply two single edits of tracks already on the album. Come on, record company weasels, give us something truly special or rare! If you make us buy an album/CD we already own, at least justify another purchase with something really extra. That gripe aside, this remains a wonderful listening experience.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Still drying my eyes. Devoured this in two evenings, ever so well written, and manages to question your own morals while reading. Bravo.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first book doesn't reveal everything so I was thrilled as the books progressed, questions were answered, and new plot twists were developed. I will buy more books by Mr. Howdy and can't wait for more stories about the silos. I'm a loyal fan.
B005FJ7EIC|4.0|If you liked 28 Days Later, and I Am Legend then you will like Stake Land. Quite good end-of-the-world, over-run by vampire-zombie-beasts journey. Good action, great mood, good story, good acting.
B002TVQ4GW|4.0|This is a gem of a film that most people don't know about. I won't go into spoilers, but suffice to say it has a multi-layered plot and it takes some thinking after it's over to figure out what happened. The less you know going in the better. A second viewing is almost essential to really appreciate and enjoy it. There are clues and symbols cleverly scattered througout. The movie follows an internal logic and does indeed make sense. I think that the few one star reviews are from people who didn't get it or didn't like having to use their brains a little bit. The photography is good and the performances are mostly good. I have seen this film 3 times now and have noticed something new each time. Highly recommended for people who are sick of brainless, formulaic hollywood horror films.
B008RC72G8|3.0|With a cast of actors & actresses I have enjoyed previously I had high hopes for this movie.  They were not met.  The movie had some interesting moments, but ultimately it didn't work for me (or my spouse).
B002BWP49M|5.0|I will say only this. FINALLY one that wasn't exactly like the book. I guess that is why i felt that this is the BEST one so far. The second part looks good. At least in the movie it looks like they fight the evil Vamps in THE PREVIEW IT LOOKS LIKE BellA KICKS Dakota Fanning IN THE FACE. hahahaha! In the book they just stood there and stared at each other it was kind of boring. I am actually looking forward to part two.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm on my fire for reminders and to get up each day. I like the variety of alert sounds and there are MANY options for each alarm.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This free app works really well on my Kindle Fire. Before I only looked at Pinterest under the web tab and it would become so frustrating trying to navigate the site and I was unable to pin easily. This app has made it so much easier!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|do you like this game because I love it so much that I want to marry it.That is how much I like this game.aaaaaaah I cant stop talking about how much I love this game.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book, for me, is like a \\"how to\\" to rev up your marriage. I found it very interesting and helpful in many aspects of my own sex life. I really enjoyed it. There are a few things that you really begin to learn about Grey that makes his character much more vulnerable than originally anticipated, which makes the book all the better. I'm impressed with these books, especially when this is not the type of books I typically read.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|While I enjoyed the characters and the overall plot I often found myself skimming over pages of inane details. I'm torn as to whether I'd like to invest the time in the sequel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love the large clear display. Using it on my kindle fire. The feature of displaying last calculation performed is also nice.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I love puzzles and anything that is mentally challenging.  I loved the PC game 11th hour from years ago and this game reminds me a lot of that.  You have to find things that will help you solve other puzzles all through the game.  I love it!! =D
B009NQKXYK|5.0|This movie provided a great explanation of \\"Alien's\\" origins, with superb special effects and a reasonable story line. Still, none of these could ever hope to match the original!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It is A very nice alarm system. I work different shifts and I am able to set all of them at the.same time and just.check the.one I want for that day.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like the app,  but its kind of slow natured. I Wodehouse rate a 5 if they picked up the speed a little. also,  why didn't all the graphics download when the game downloaded on kindle fire?
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I guess you have to be a fan of the Alien movies, and a big science fiction fan. This movie has elements of both. I loved it. Parts of it were predictable, but it is a fun ride! I saw the movie in the theater before I bought it, which is the best way to go. I seldom buy movies I haven't already seen. Prometheus has an interesting story line and I can't wait to see where the sequel(s) go.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Bought this after ordering Superman II.  My son and I have enjoyed these two movies.  Disc came exactly as described.  Like the 5.1 surround sound,etc.  Couldn't be happier.
0689853637|5.0|I wanted to purchase a pop up book for my granddaughter. After looking in book stores I thought none were available.  Then I thought I would try Amazon.  This is the most amazing pop up book I have ever seen.  I also bought 4 more books.  I'm saving them for Christmas and I know she will be thrilled!
0425263908|3.0|The relationship between Gideon and Eva moved entirely too fast and I was not able to connect with them at all.  Ana from 50 shades was much more relatable and the development of the relationship was more believeable. It was somewhere between the cheesiest of erotica and 50 Shades.  If you are looking for a good book that has the romance of 50 shades although less sex, I would recommend Gariel's Inferno.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|The book is very well writing and easy to red. The author shosws a particular way to accept the facts of life.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Great movie from start to finish. Cinematography and acting was great. Must see movie. To bad Snow White wasn't prettier
0812992784|3.0|Excellent writting, but I found the book did not hold my interest.  It is not one of those \\"I can't put the book down\\" type.  Maybe too much time has passed since his ordeal.  I am half way through the book, and will finish it.  I am a Salman Rushdie admirer.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It's a little bit dissapointing. I got it thinking it would be like dragon vale, but it isn't. i would mucn rather be playing dragon vale!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Best series I've read in a long time! Even if you're watching the show you should still read the books!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I found this game by accident and love it. It's easy to follow and has many different challenges so it keeps you busy and entertained.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|After waiting so long for update, finally out today. However, after installing, now app won't open. Beware! This could happen to you. Never had a problem before. Very disappointed, Amazon!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I wanted something that would capture my imagination and keep me engrossed. I had never heard of George R. R. Martin and only ordered the first Fire and Ice book because it had so many good reviews. I figured that many people couldn't be wrong or bought.  I wasn't disappointed. I waited a while to before ordering A Clash of Kings because I didn't want to be disappointed. I needn't have worried. This second book is just as entertaining and I like the fact that he is introducing new characters who offer a more expansive view of the social strata of each kingdom. I gave it a four because I'm waiting until the end to come to a final conclusion.
0385342063|4.0|Ok,the story was unrealistic - but which of Sophie Kinsella's isn't?? So I cant quite understand peoples' complaints about that particular matter, esp. if they claim to be big Kinsella fans. I mean, how are funny plots supposed to develop anyway if it is totally realistic. Also, who hasn't behaved totally irrational in one or the other situation?! I have to admit that it wasn't quite as funny as the Shopaholic series and some other books I read from the author, though. So probably not her best work but for me a page-turner nonetheless. However, I totally agree with some folks opinion that Kinsella's character seem to follow a particular scheme. Sam seemed to be the same mysterious man like Luke is and Poppy has a lot of similarities to Becky...maybe Sophie Kinsella should try something new. And btw: I don't really understand wny Poppy was so attracted to Sam...a man who uses the f-word in every sentence and looks at his smartphone constantly...who needs that?!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I wanted to like the film more, but just couldn't get into it very much. It was well shot and visually looked very good. Characters were a little weak in my eyes. Not a bad rental. Not even close to the original films, minus Alien3, perhaps.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Amazing CD, different from their last CD but both are awesome. Hoping to buy more of their CDs when I get paid.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|pretty fun nice app not like the original computer game but still fun for an old timmer I reccomend giving it a try
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm very hapy with this app!!  The game is fun, the app has no bugs or issues.  My only suggestion would be to simplify the types of games (I always pick &quot;Winning&quot; because I'm not sure what the other ones mean).  Other than that, it's perfect!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I Love it!! Bless the creators of this App!!! It is so Convenient and it works off line too... I love the bookmarks feature too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. It keeps me pre occupied and it keeps my little cousins busy too. Great fun!! I would recommend. it to anyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I first started reading these books, I wasn't sure I could get into them, but I found them so intriguing and well written.  I read Book II in two weeks, which was a record for me.  I found myself questioning my own sexuallity, and what I would do, if confronted with the same scenario, and I enjoyed that.<br />  I am now reading Book III, and loving that too.  I wish it could go on and on.  Too bad this is the last book!!!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie and nice extra features.  I am really looking forward to the release of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One-Avengers Assembled Collection which is what I ordered but did not receive yet.  However, this set will do just fine for now.
B0089BSM70|5.0|To me the extras was the best part going to the locations and to see where they filmed halloween fans love that stuff!!!!
B0087JTAKW|1.0|Bought because recommended by NYT, hover after read half of it I decided to stop .  This book didn't click on me. I think the style and the story are the culprit .
1606995359|5.0|This lovely hardcover collection of Carl Barks stories is a joy to behold.  Clear printing with lovely colour, and interesting essays that discuss each story with a quick analysis, this book truly does justice to Barks' brilliant story construction and visual flair.  I am pleased to have to this book in my collection, and have no doubt that it will provide years of pleasure to myself and my family.<br /><br />Wonderful!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|A great book but I am not discovering anything... Highly recommended , the best book of Ken Follet, a must read for the lovers of this thrilled spy books
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Gawande once again gets it right. Medicine is such a crazy discipline (and I use the word with a small amount of irony, given the subject matter). To really be effective at all the information coming at health care providers and teams, we need much better systems to help with what he calls \\"the stupid stuff\\" ie the things that should always happen but which forgetting can greatly impact health negatively in some cases, such as forgetting antibiotics or giving them at the wrong time before surgery, not knowing the other members of a surgery team, or simply having too rigid a heirarchy that discourages people not at the high end of the power curve from contributing to the total care of patients. I found this book incredibly relatable as a health care provider, and it helped me organize my thoughts about how I might tackle similar issues in my own environment (primary care) just as we start grappling with health care reform. The enjoyable beauty of this nicely written and fascinating little book is that he (like in his other books) uses anecdotes and research to illustrate his points. In this case, they are about what makes a useful checklist and what makes an unwieldy (useless) one, and that the main point of a checklist is to remember simple things that are likely to be forgotten in complex tasks, as well as to harness all team members to truly do better and more coordinated work. With his engaging writing style, typical humble approach to how he applies lessons to his own sphere, and clear logical path to solutions of the problems he describes in medicine and other disciplines (he learned a lot from aviation checklists!), he cements his place in my estimation as my favorite nonfiction writer of contemporary relevance.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love it, I found it a good way to learn about the politics  in Europe during the second world war  I love the story and the way the events are unfolded and connected
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This is an incredibly interesting and motivating (and cautiously optimistic) summary of research as it relates to education reform, and the stories of groups and individuals who are trying something different to educate kids in poverty informed by that research. Paul Tough takes a broader take than his previous book (Whatever it Takes) but with the same integrative approach, to allow both a positive and yet hard-nosed, pragmatic understanding of what some education reformers and researchers are discovering that kids in poverty need to help close educational gaps to improve chances of success eventually getting to college, excelling while there, and staying until graduation and on to fulfilling work beyond. What I love about his writing is the way he interweaves stories of individuals with summaries of relevant new research in neuroscience and other related disciplines to come up with a cohesive narrative that is energizing and sheds light on a subject that many in the middle and upper classes flinch away from and have trouble grappling with. We all know that we have huge disparities in our educational systems, but this is a clear and well-written way to help understand what that means and offers a practical way to start the conversation while also jumping in and getting research-tested approaches to the kids who need help the most. Kids in poverty deserve better, and writing about some rays of hope such as are in this book helps energize people into supporting reforms that actually work without being punitive to teachers or other unhelpful distractions from the work at hand. If you believe, as many do (including myself) that education is a key component to improve one's lot in life, then this will be something worth reading. If you like to read books by people like Jonathan Kozol and Malcolm Gladwell, you'll appreciate this book and author too.
B005ILYWN2|4.0|Pretty unique it was like anything I had seen previously. We need more movies like this. All this big budget garbage
B007X4ECMI|3.0|I was looking forward to the release of this movie and I enjoyed watching it.  I was disappointed with the ending, however and I think it couldn've been much better.  The rest of the movie was pretty good though.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Slow to start, characters hard to follow,unnecessary foul language. Disappointing after the reviews it got. I did plow through it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like the way the objects move each time to keep it entertaining. The only drawback is the number of badguys and trying to get weapons to defeat them.

B0086213XW|1.0|Woman has a great marriage and loves her husband. Woman leaves her husband to pursue deviant sex. Woman tires of deviant sex after destroying her life. There, now you don't have to sit through this monstrosity.
B0086WQNZ0|5.0|While Glenn Gould was a pianist who performed the works of many composers, his name is inextricably linked to that of Johann Sebastian Bach. More than any other composer, Bach was Gould's speciality. From his first recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations in 1955 to his final recording, again of the Goldberg Variations in 1981, Gould recorded nearly all of Bach's keyboard music.<br /><br />This set groups all of Gould's Bach recordings; not only those released on LP and CD, but also a number of previously unreleased recordings: outtakes from the 1955 Goldbergs recording session; a stereo mix of the 1955 Goldbergs; some preludes and fugues from the Well-Tempered Clavier, from 1952 and 1954; and two live recordings, from 1957 and 1959, of the Goldbergs (Salzburg Festival, August, 1959) and the Sinfonias (Moscow, May, 1957). There are two discs of interviews with Gould - one with Tim Page, and another with John McClure - and a disc of Gould speaking about Bach in German. There are a total of 38 CDs.<br /><br />This set also includes DVDs; 6 of them. Three of these are directed by Bruno Monsaigneon, featuring the Goldbergs on one, and two others with a variety of works. And three others are from the CBC, from 1957 to 1970, featuring Gould (and others) playing a variety of Bach's works. Many Gould fans are familiar with the Monsaigneon films, as they have been widely circulated - especially the Goldberg Variations video, which was my first introduction to seeing Glenn Gould perform. The CBC videos are less common, though they have been released in a 10-DVD set Glenn Gould on Television. What we have in the Bach set is, naturally, the Bach performances taken from that set. If you're a die-hard Gould fan, you'll want to get the full DVD set as well.<br /><br />Together with all these discs is a 192-page hardcover book, with some introductory essays, and with notes for each disc. Unfortunately, the notes are very succinct, and while the disc covers reproduce original LPs, the notes on them are too small to read without a microscope. (Is it that hard to include a CD or DVD with PDFs of these things?)<br /><br />If you're a fan of Glenn Gould, you may already have the Complete Original Jacket Collection, on 80 CDs, which contains most of what's in this set, but you won't have the outtakes, live recordings and DVDs. This set, at a not-quite-bargain price, is worth getting for these extras alone, if you appreciate Gould. Especially since Bach is what Gould did best.<br /><br />Nice packaging, a fair price, and a bunch of previously unreleased material makes this a good purchase for any fan of Glenn Gould. If you're not familiar with his admittedly idiosyncratic recordings of Bach's keyboard works, this would be a good chance to discover one of the most original of performers. You may love Gould or hate him, but you can't deny that, when he played Bach, he was channelling something transcendent.
0345803493|5.0|Another great book, makes you want to read the next one. I don't normally read books like this but they definitely captivated me. Forwarded them to my sister and she is so excited.

B002NXPTDK|4.0|some of the songs miss a little for me but over all its a good solid album. good beats and flow, you learn a lot about cudi from some of these tracks.
159315724X|5.0|I found this book so inspiring and wanted to make sure that I used at least some of the principles, that I have instituded a \\"Family Book Club\\" on it. That way my 3 twenty-something sons will at least read and we can talk about it and hopefully all implement at least part.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I only had this app on my kindle fire for like 5 hrs. and it uninstalled itself. like wtf. anyway its a great addicting app. sooooo much fun I like that its all manual not manual and tilt like temple run. I wood recommend this app. ;))))

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is worth the wait. It is really nice and I read it about 3 times already. It has the best ending ever. This makes up for the previous books horror ending.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very good. It tells you all the time you have left for browsing,  reading, music, app playing, videos, and many more. Plus it's free. If you like checking up on your system stats. I advise you get this free app.
B004NELBPC|4.0|really like Huffington Post.It has so many different aspects to read and I always find something interesting to read whether it be top stories or home or soul gps
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I knew many people who had read this book and loved it so I knew I had wanted to read it for a long time. I finally went ahead and bought the kindle edition. I thought it was going to be Chris's actual journal. However, it is just some pieces of his journal and the author trying to piece together what happened by visiting places and people that Chris did. Yes, it's not a book that has a real story line and nothing ever really happens. You are told what the ending is right away in the beginning of the book. I think this is more of a book that makes you think. Chris had so many ideas about how to live and he was so determined. It makes you look at your own life and compare your own ideas against his.<br />For me, I loved it. I love books such as this that introduce a love for nature and simplicity. I could've done without Krakeur's personal experience, but I didn't hate it.<br />Overall, wonderful book with wonderful ideas.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had lots of fun playing this very challenging game of Angry Birds...each level challenges your skills. If you explore your different direction of shots, I find that you can also redirect your shots at a certain point to have harder hits as well as redirect shots.
B000CNESU8|5.0|Paid &#60;10$ for 30+ dollar Item, and that's if you can even find this premium quality pressing, I rate NIB , probably released to big fanfare in 06' as collectible.....not blu- ray,, but not bluray cost....in fact, i AVOID paying extra for blu- ray, instead i look for standard resolutation, Because here is a dirty secret that nobody talks about: We all have the up- convert feature on our blu-ray players , TV's are 1080p at 120 or  even 240 hrtz., are top of the line now, but soon to be garden variety.......,..... That said: my set-up is nice, but not too costly, and I have yet to find a single person who , under controlled conditions, can tell ' which is blu-ray vs. which is standard DVD.,..... ..comments cont****...So, in this purchase through Amazon, I have a brand new, unopened, 2 disc collectors edition of a '100 best' classic, that is blu- ray or better quality, with all the bells & whistles. But here is the kicker: this was never pressed in Blu-ray......and the 'martini shot' as they say in Hollywood: the totality of my investment was a few taps on my IPAD, a stroll out to my mailbox & 9 bucks landed. rjg  *footnote*  I don't even know if a soul will ever read my little essay, but if anybody is, or if anyone is not fully convinced, consider this: irrespective of time, how much gas would it take for you to get in your car and drive to Best Buy & back? At 4 bucks a gallon and my guzzling Escalade, well I think ya'all get my point.
0345803507|4.0|I started reading these books back in early June of this year. At first I thought E. L . James was a man but it's a woman....Shocking. The books kept me captivated cover to cover. The sexual portion is strong so it's not for the prude in heart. The storyline is quite interesting as well. What I will say about the third book is that it was a little slow at first and I even took a break, read another book and got back to it. I wasn't disappointed though. I also didn't care for the \\"Mr Grey this and Mrs Grey that\\" or the \\"My Fifty, Oh my Fifty Shades\\"....I thought they had accidentally slid in a portion of \\"Gone With the Wind\\". Some times there are cheesy moments but the book overall was enjoyable.<br /><br />You will see a mix of reviews, some good some bad but you have to see for yourself and not just take another's word.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The Weather Channel has great features and is so easy to use and read,,love the weather alerts, allergy alerts, and different locations too,,
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I had never heard of this book until the movie came out, but I had some questions after watching it and decided to read it. Normally, I find the books are better than the movies, with very few exceptions. Had I not known that Charlie was 15 and going to high school, I would have thought the main character was 10, since he writes in short, simple sentences. It reminded me a bit of reading Steinbeck. There seemed to be big difference in characters, even though Chbosky wrote both the book and the movie; however, I felt that taking it as an entity all on its own, the Perks of Being a Wallflower was a sweet book that made me happy and sad and also glad I read it. I wish there were more to the epilogue, but don't we always...
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I didn't know what to expect out of this independently published book. After the first few chapters however I knew that I had found a gem. This book is hard to put down and very enjoyable.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Big Bang puts out another great season of laughs. This is by far the best series on TV now or from any time. The blu ray is essentially everything you would expect.
0345803493|5.0|I really enjoyed book two, even more than the first one.  I was not disappointed at all.  Buy it, you won't be either.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|It's my favorite movie and I love the camera angles and strange dreamlike monsters in the movie. The fog in the air. The crazy witch burning baptists.
0345803507|5.0|Loved this whole series.  And I love how the author gives you soooo much story on every book.  This was an awesome read.  And I loved every bit of Christian Grey.  I wish there was a part 4. Buy the series, each book is just as good as the one before it.  Don't listen to the negative feedback.  I was very skeptical at first, but glad I read all three.  I am not disappointed.  Would read them again! Great job E.L James.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|This is a nice comfortable case to carry my Kindle in. I can take it with me anywhere and know that it is safe from breakage.  Easy zipper action and pop it out.

He's in construction and at alot of different job sites so versatility is a must. They look good and wear well. They do run large so go down a size from your normal shoe size. We would definetely purchase these again. Worth every penny!

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I got this book on sale for $0.99 and read it the same day all at once because I could not put it down, it was a great way to spend my day off of work and more satisfying than the half cup of coffee I could have bought for the same price, I loved this and if you like vampires and witches and ghosts and fun characters you will love this too!
034580404X|1.0|I bought into the hype and what a waste of money. The story line is completely taken from bits in pieces of movies!!!! Ordering a little of everything for breakfast, the piano scene and the fact that Christian Grey buys companies in trouble to break them apart is from pretty woman! Blind folding her and feeding her everything in the fridge was from 9 1/2 weeks, she even scooped up names from beauty and the beast Philipe and Gaston!!! What complete and utter garbage. Not to mention boring. She just repeats the same crap over and over. Want real erotica... try The Happy Hooker. This here, not worth time and money!
B009FKZ9AM|4.0|Come of age is a great album although I do not think it can live up to their first album
B000FCKRDI|2.0|Unfortunately, I could not get past Lord St. Vincent's previous vile acts.  I find it far fetched and unbelievable that Lord St. Vincent would change so radically after falling in love with Evie. A leopard can not change his spots so quickly!  I still enjoy the series but was disappointed by this particular love story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|To start off I read a lot of different types of books I purchase through Amazon Kindle for my Ipad and I am not a big fan of science fiction! But I loved this book(s) from the beginning and it only got better as I read more! I told friends and family about it while I was reading it! The whole story about the characters, Jule, Lukas and all the rest grabbed my attention and kept me reading!! I can't wait for the next book and hopefully more to follow!!
0802473156|5.0|This is a really fun self help book. It explores the 5 types of needs we all have. It showed me some great ways to really connect better with my wife.  I have also started using the 5 languages to see how I can improve my everyday relationships as well.<br />I would recommend this to anyone wanting or in need of a new perspective on how people work, interact, and react to situations.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book has been on my iPad for months.  Why I haven't read it until now I don't know. I started reading this book yesterday and could not put it down.  I loved, loved, loved it.  Such an excellent read.  I'd definitely read other books by this author.
0224093975|4.0|I have only a few words left to add to the reviews of \\"Joseph Anton\\" already  presented here.The publication of his earlier book, \\"Satanic Verses\\", resulted in Iran's Ayatollah Kohmeni issuing a fatwa for Rushdie's assasination. He and his family have had to live underground, moving from house to house in Great Britain. I tried, but couldn't read \\"Satanic Verses\\" earlier but from the memoir, I can see that Rushdie is an atheist and critical of all organized religions. His memoir is filled with literary and philosophical references and the author is, at times, surprisingly funny. The book's title is taken from Rushdie's undercover name, \\"Joseph Anton\\", from Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekov. While intelluctually fascinating, Rushdie is not very likeable. The biggest surprise and most interesting to me was the global political maneuvering by so many people, politicians, state governments, authors, publishers, \\"friends\\", caused by the announced fatwa. The book is evocative of the recent riots over Qu'ran burnings, derogatory videos and cartoons. Do we have to kill each other to show support of our deity?

B004U52VPS|2.0|Bought this for my kids last christmas, found it a few months before christmas and was so excited they were going to love it! But after playing one round I was easily annoyed and dissappointed by it. Don't get me wrong, its a great idea for a game. But it has a lot of pieces, and you have to set them up according to the card you flip over. It takes awhile to set up, and then if we want to go to the next player, we have to re-set the 1st players pieces first. The catapult barely works, i think you are suppose to shoot it 12\\" back from your display, and it only shoots about 1-2\\", most of the time misfires. Packing up the game back in the box is annoying and frustrating too - so many pieces and they dont all go back together. My kids are always asking me to put it away because they cant figure out where the pieces go, and it seems like a puzzle for me to put it together as well. I would have returned this game the day after christmas if i hadn't bought it so early. It's a waste honestly, just play this game on a computer, its a lot more fun! This one is a fail to me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest has found my lost creative hands. I am forever grateful. except when the tricking page wont load... but still five star worthy. :)
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Morally ambiguous and violent, The Mechanic has a lot of really effective action set pieces. Statham is consistently somber as the lead character.  His assassin is methodical, economical and deadly. Some of the character's motivations fail to materialize, leaving some plot elements not fully realized, but for an actioner, this one has plenty of firepower, crashes, explosions and bone crunching punches to satisfy.<br />The Blu-ray presentation looked crisp and sounded great.
0062009540|2.0|I so wanted to like this! I did, I really did.<br /><br />But I didn't.<br /><br />I picked this up because of the TV series - I'm not ashamed to admit that. My younger sister raved about the show and because of the person that I am, I had to read the books before I started Hollywood's adaptation. Mentally, if I know there's a book of a show/movie, I have to read the book first. I have to know the true back stories or else I feel left out in the cold. It's a sickness, but I'll admit to it. No shame.<br /><br />Anway, the book was blah. Nothing was shocking and nothing was surprising. I was able to read it in a car ride to Niagara Falls (about 4 hours) - but only because it was an easy read, not because I couldn't stop, and I was stuck in the car.<br /><br />Back in the eighth grade, Alison, one of the most popular girls in school and \\"leader\\" of the group of friends mysteriously disappears. Now, in their junior year of high school, the girls have drifted apart. Only \\"The Jenna Thing\\" keeps them relatively connected.<br /><br />They have their own secrets now: Aria has a crush on her English teacher, Spencer falls for her sister's boyfriend, Emily falls for another girl, Hannah struggles to stay thin. However, the girls are thrown together when a mysterious \\"A\\" starts sending each girl messages about something from their pasts - things only Alison knew.<br /><br />I liked Emily. She tells Alison she loves her - yes, love loves her - and Alison continues to hold this over Emily's head like it's something she be ashamed of. After meeting Maya, her new neighbor, Emily realizes she has feelings for this girl and maybe she doesn't want to be on the swimming team and date her boyfriend anymore. Her parents are conservative are not thrilled.<br /><br />I really liked Aria, too. It was interesting to see her coming back to the US after being in Iceland for so long. She blossomed in Iceland and is now struggling to fit back at her old school - doesn't help that her past best friends aren't really friends anymore. And then she falls in love with her English teacher! Oops. Of all the stories, hers was probably my favorite.<br /><br />As for Spencer and Hannah, I'm pretty sure I've read their stories before. Spencer falls for her older sister's boyfriend. Shocking! The little sister has a crush on her sister's boyfriend. Not a huge secret. Same deal for Hanna. The past \\"chubby\\" girl is now gorgeous, popular, kicked a bulimia habit, and steals. Blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />After reading the book, I checked out the first episode of the show on Netflix. Just FYI, the first books IS the first episode. That's how little plot this book contains.<br /><br />I thought about reading the next few books, that maybe the series will pick up, but this just didn't hold my interest enough. If I'm really interested in continuing this saga, I'll most like just tune in to ABC Family.friends aren't really friends anymore. And then she falls in love with her English teacher! Oops.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game soo much. Ever since I installed it on my Kindle fire I have been playing it. I had to install on my Phone (LG Viper). I haven't had any major problems I notice it stall a lilttle but nothing major. My problem is I just want to play it all the time. It is an intense game, but I love it...I would recommend this to the thrill seeker and those who just want a change of pace.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|I loved both The Da Vinci Code and Digital Fortress. This book was a little too predictable for me. The advanced science jargon used to describe the meteorite and sea, etc made it to where I was looking up every other word on my Kindle. I think this book would be perfect for someone that has a science background though.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie was really good. I love that it portrays real tactics that our special forces use, and puts it in perspective on how dedicated our military is.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the second book to the Crossfire triogy and it did not let me down. I had a lot of questions after reading the first book and they were answered in this book. I cannot wait to read the last book. I read this after I read the Fifty Shades trilogy and it kept me intrigued as to what was going to happen next. I can't wait until the third book is out. I will have to read the first two again just to make sure that I didn't miss anything! There were times that I was upset and then it would all work out! A great read!
034580404X|5.0|As stated by many reviews, either you hate this writing or become<br />completely immersed in the story, characters, emotions and get caught<br />up in the ongoing happenings.  To me it was a story of life, love,<br />compromise, self doubt, learning of strenghs, compassion, and empathy. Then just when you thought things were finally going to be resolved a mystery happens.<br />Having to put down the book to finish my work was not my wish.  The author certainly has taken every possible emotions in life and displayed them in her characters, with taste,reverence and sensitivity and creativity.<br />As for the explicite sex, well what couple does everything<br />like others think they do, or should do.<br />IN reading, I felt the characters learned about each other as well as themselves and ulitmately formed a deeper respect and love for each other and the world around them.<br />I certainly would give this triology a 5 Gold Star review.

B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I was seeking a good way to light a small closet with no AC. I didn't want to have to switch it on and off, so motion sensing seemed like my solution. This product does exactly what I needed. I like the fact that it takes 4 AA batteries. Some units use expensive, low-capacity button (hearing aid) cells or AAA cells. This guy should run for a long time on 4 AAs, unless it wastes too much on the motion sensor. I hope I won't find that out for a year. The product is VERY cheaply made. I was afraid I might crack the case removing the battery cover and putting in the cells. But that shouldn't be a problem if I only need to touch it once a year.<br />The delay on the auto shutoff is about 10 seconds. I was expecting 30 seconds, but it is very sensitive and comes on or stays on when I'm anywhere in or near the closet, so I am happy not to waste more energy and drain the battery sooner. This is bright enough to pick the right color shirt on the top rack, but can't light the bottom rack, so I will probably get another one. But it is NOT bright enough to light a larger six-foot closet. It would be bright enough to light up a hallway for a few feet and avoid tripping over things.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I guess I was worried a bit about the singer change but worry no more. I saw the band first in San Fransisco and they were amazing live. The new singer Tommy Karevik owned the stage and I felt a bit sorry for Nightwish after Kamelot crushed it. Now the album, not 1 filler song on the whole album. 11/10 Rating if that was a possible!!! The limited edition is first class and full of great items for the fans. Buy it now before they are all gone!!!
0920668372|5.0|I received this book as a gift when my first child was a baby fifteen years ago.  Like so many others, it made me cry every time I read it.  I love this book!  I was getting ready to purchase it as a baby shower gift when I stumbled upon the negative reviews.  My main comment is how can someone read so much \\"creepiness\\" into such an innocently written book?  Many comments took the picture of the mother crawling across the floor and driving across town to her son's home as being obsessive and disturbing.  THIS IS A FICTITIOUS CHILDREN'S book about the amazing love of a mother for her son and the cycle repeats with the son and his daughter.  How is there anything creepy about that?  One has to wonder if there are traumatic incidents in the lives of these people who find this book so disturbing and this book somehow triggers those negative feelings and/or memories.<br /><br />For anyone who has not read this book, I highly recommend it.  There is nothing creepy or disturbing about it unless you find loving your child into your old age until the day you die disturbing. I think we mothers will always somehow see our children, no matter how old they are, as little ones because of the wonderful memories we have of their childhood.  This is a precious gift of God, one that I cherish.  It doesn't mean that we don't admire and respect the independent successful people they will hopefully grow up to be.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book came highly recommended by a friend.  She thought it was one of the best books she has ever read.  Although I didn't think it was the \\"best\\" book I was impressed at how easy it was to get lost in the book and the story.  When I started the book I was looking for something that didn't require my full attention to become lost in it.  This book delivered an easy read and good characters that I could easily visualize.  Quick easy read and I would suggest it when your looking for that type of book.  I think it took me 3 -4 days to read during a very busy time.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was skeptical about a show about zombies because I was never really big into that stuff. I saw all the excitement behind season three from friends so I gave it a try and I am so happy I did.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever felt so much for the characters. It is a show that you love some of the characters and hate the other ones so bad you hope something happens to them.<br /><br />It is very brutal and the show does an amazing job at realism, the story is wrapped around something that \\"could\\" happen in real life in a way. It just feels so real.<br /><br />Acting is top notch, special effects are perfect, plot is perfect. Best show on TV right now.<br /><br />Highly suggest people give it a try, you will be hooked after 1 or 2 episodes guaranteed.

Anyways, it's not a big challenge for quiller who like to explore & be more patience.<br />Overall, i am satisfied with this book & the book presentation is perfect. The designs are so beautiful & can combine together for big projects. At the end of the book introduces quilled butterflies & pictures that are good for reference.

0446580848|1.0|I was I had bought this book on Amazon so that I could have returned it!  Instead got it at COSTCO, with great expectations.  This LONG book, where you caN SKIP 50 PAGES and still miss NOTHING is boring.  I expected MORE from Mr. DeMille, or at least entertaining.  Mr. Corey, wife Kate, and the rest of the \\"in Yemn gang, were pages of dribble.  In fact, I didn't even care if they caught The Panther ..  I love The Charm School...where is the Demille of days gone past?  this book was racist, bias, and condemned a whole race of people! Didn't the author realize that there are at least \\"some good people\\" everywhere on this planet?  Trying to \\"scare the public\\" into submission is Demille's coming off as head of the Tea Party!!!  enough said about this book that will go in the fireplace!!!

I've tested both my 58 and this 8500 with identical EQing and I experienced no feedback even while blasting my PA in a tiny bedroom and beatboxing my brain to a mushy mass of membranes.

0515149489|5.0|A romantic suspense involving a dog trainer and a woodworker just outside Seattle.<br /><br />My Take<br />I want to be here! Well, not the serial killer parts, but I have fallen in love with Simon's property and his workshop. I can smell the sawdust and the varnish, the brine of the ocean outside his door, the smell of the forest where he and Fiona walk with the dogs. Yup, I can smell the dogs after they've chased those balls into the ocean as well!<br /><br />This is an amazing story. Well, yeahhh, it's a Nora Roberts. Just because we expect her to be good doesn't mean we can't appreciate how she sets the scene and creates her characters.<br /><br />I love that Simon is so abrupt and brutally honest. I appreciate even more that Fiona handles it all so well. There are no games between them. The suspense of the serial killer stalking Fiona is not the primary plot; it's simply there to make this romance more interesting. The romance is probably the most tense and dramatic aspect of this story. I won't say there aren't moments with the serial killer, but it's not horrific. Well, it is to his victims, but Roberts doesn't write to this.<br /><br />The underlying plot is the dogs. Training them (and their owners!) properly. All the work that goes into schooling a rescue dog and its handler. The knowledge that Fiona brings to the hunt for the serial killer, likening the profiling aspect to analyzing dogs with behavioral problems. A skill she makes excellent use of near the end! Whew...I was so worried for her!<br /><br />Excellent suggestion about dogs obsessing over digging holes!<br /><br />You can't help but appreciate Simon, even his frustration with Jaws, LOL! Neither of them wants this and it's baby steps all the way as they fight the need, the want.<br /><br />I like that her friends have ethical lines they will not cross.<br /><br />It's nice that there are people in the world who want to believe the best of others. Just don't take that gullibility into a prison.<br /><br />There is lots of human interest in this. People are living their lives. Stressing, being happy. Worrying, working There are truths throughout. And I want that damned sink!!! At least a chance to wash my hands in it...sigh...<br /><br />The Story<br />The story opens with an introduction to Fiona and her Canine Search and Rescue crew and continues into another introduction---to Simon and Jaws.<br /><br />To a romance built between a frustrated puppy owner and a woman who appreciates his frustration and patience, and his forthright approach. Snapshots of Simon in his studio, walks with Jaws along the beach and in the woods.<br /><br />A ridealong with Fiona as she trains and plays with dogs, interacts with her friends, and worries about the active serial killer. Who it can be. Is she a part of his plan.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Fiona Bristow hadn't had a purpose eight years ago, but events helped her to focus, to realize she wanted to work with dogs. And she is amazing. You may well want to read this for the dog-handling tips alone! Sylvia is her stepmother, widowed. She runs a shop on Orcas that sells beauty, including work by Simon Doyle. Bogart, Peck, and Newman are her own dogs and all are trained in search and rescue. They're amazingly well-behaved and Fiona has a nice life with caring friends. Greg is the cop, the man Fiona was going to marry, who was murdered.<br /><br />The great pleasure of a dog is that you may make a fool of yourself with him and not only will he not scold you, but he will make a fool of himself too. --Samuel Butler<br /><br />Simon Doyle is a taciturn man who enjoys his solitude. He crafts the most gorgeous pieces in wood and has recently moved to Orcas, buying a house with enough land that he has his woodworking shop next to the house. His mother, Julie Doyle, in her wisdom (I do like her!), has sent him a puppy. One badly in need of training. His name is Jaws and he's true to his film namesake!<br /><br />Deputy Davey Englewood keeps a close eye on Fiona. Mai is the local vet and one of Fee's best friends. Seems Sheriff Ben Tyson from San Juan might be interested.<br /><br />Special Agents Tawney and Mantz. Tawney was the agent who helped Fiona through Perry's trial all those years ago.<br /><br />On the Canine Search and Rescue team:<br />James is an old, old friend of Fiona's and he's fascinated with Lori. Meg and Chuck Greene have been married for decades and are still so in love.<br /><br />George Allen Perry is the serial killer Fiona helped put away. And get away from. He may be locked up forever, but he can still maneuver. Francis X. Eckle is finally free and he intends to make the most of it.<br /><br />Kati Starr is an unscrupulous reporter who doesn't care whom she hurts to make her way up the ladder.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is a fog-enshrouded forest, a black Lab standing in profile, waiting for his mistress. A woman who might never arrive if the red scarf draped over the last few letters in the title delivers what it promises.<br /><br />The title is too apt and encompasses so many possibilities: the Search and Rescue team that Fiona trains, the FBI's search for a serial killer, and Fiona's own search for peace of mind.glewood keeps a close eye on Fiona.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|\\"Le miserables\\" is a such a good book, that I had a hard time putting it aside for my duties!!!
1936608898|5.0|I only just recently discovered the \\"Whole30\\" program, despite an interest in the Paleo diet for most of a decade.  This book is an excellent introduction to that program, as well as a lucid explanation of many of the reasons behind Paleo dieting.  I don't agree with everything in the book (I don't think it's a good idea to eat something right before you exercise), but most of it I whole-heartedly agree with--and it's well-documented.  Whether you're curious about Paleo diet, interested in the Whole30 program, or want to learn some of the most cutting-edge nutritional available (admittedly, not in biochemical jargon), this book is an excellent resource.  They also have website full of free resource which I recommend as well.
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Memento is a perfect film. Take out one shot, one scene, and it falls apart.<br />Guy Pearce gives a most underrated performance as Leonard Shelby - a man who cannot make new memories, and who is searching for his wife's killer.<br /><br />5 Stars!
B000FC10MU|3.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman book.  It was imaginative and refreshing. He developed numerous scenarios and a pantheon of characters--but his development was so natural that it was easy to track the moving plot and keep everyone straight.  Importantly, the plot resolved nicely yet with surprise.  I like his approach to science fiction and I will definitely read more of his work.

B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Amazon still hasn't rolled out the Halloween update for this.

0062011847|4.0|\\"Snuff\\" is the thiry-ninth novel in Terry Pratchett's hugely popular Discworld series, was first published in 2005 and sees Sam Vimes, Commander of Ankh-Morpork's City Watch, in the lead role. \\"Snuff\\" was nominated for the 2012 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel as well as the Prometheus Award.<br /><br />Sam is the Commander of the City Guard, and - having married Lady Ramkin - has risen from the gutters to become a member of the nobility and a devoted father. He has no intention of taking it easy, though : Sam is every bit as cynical as he ever was, and his life as a copper is something he can't just step away from. He does detest the paperwork, admittedly, and will only sign it when he's been backed into a corner. However, what he really dreads are the holidays....and he's now being forced to spend a fortnight at Crundells, the Ramkin family's Country Estate. Devastated doesn't even begin to cover it; he'd rather have been going to the seaside, where there'd have been a chance of the odd drowning or even some smuggling to investigate. Mingling with nobby people in the countryside, though ? That's bound to be tedious. (Vetinari, on the other hand, knows a little better : he's expecting Vimes to be up to his armpits in trouble, investigating all the nobby people who have - hurrah ! - gotten themselves involved in a spot of smuggling. However, their smuggling masks a much bigger crime, and the victims are the Discworld's goblins : \\"an entire race,\\" remarks Vetinari, \\"reduced to vermin.\\")<br /><br />Another cracking book from Pratchett - as usual there's plenty of humour, with a great storyline 'underneath' it all...and a few serious points to be made as well. With Sam out of his usual environment, and without the City Watch to help him out, Willikins - his valet - provided a great deal of help. (I hesitate to use the phrase \\"gentleman's gentleman\\", as Willikins is even less of a gentleman than Vimes. He's a useful sort to have on your side in a tight spot : unlike Vimes, he doesn't have to worry about legal and getting on his wrong side can be terminal). Excellent stuff, highly recommended.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I cheated and basically watched Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings on HBO's series. I've read storm of swords, feast for crows and I'm 1/2 way through Dances with Dragons. Storm of swords was excellent and feast for crows was a nice change of pace but now I must confess that either I'm losing interest or the story line is getting tiresome. George Martin is a brilliant writer - very detailed and descriptive, a little too descriptive in my mind. There are some very exciting events that take place in the book but it takes 100 pages of background information and descriptions of characters and scenery to get to it.

B0013YM0YQ|5.0|Just looking at the cover of \\"The Allman Brothers Band\\" dredges up nostalgia of years gone by. I recall listening to this in the dorm room of a friend at Vanderbilt University. He said, \\"Hey, got an album of a band that I think will knock you out.\\" He slid the vinyl out of the cover, carefully laid it on the turntable, cranked up the volume knob, and as if preparing to taste a bottle of fine wine, he lowered the arm down and ignited the sound of a band that I continue to rave about.<br /><br />Gregg Allman confessed in his recent autobiography/memoirs, \\"Gregg Allman [[ASIN:0062112031 My Cross to Bear] that he felt that the recording was rushed, songs written poorly, barely road-tested some of the tunes and everything else you can think could go wrong. This was a group of five young men, barely out of their teens, two untested in a recording studio and Dickey Betts storming out because the studio scene was just too weird for him.<br /><br />But you see, that's part of what makes this raw recording so great. Aretha Franklin didn't start off with a hit like \\"Respect.\\" Shoot, she too started out with Capricorn/Atlantic with a jazz band that failed to do her ferocious voice justice. It was the same scene for the Allman Brothers Band recording their very first album with only two weeks and in a studio where Ray Charles cut his earlier records-and the sound board looked just like that.<br /><br />That album and its cover reminds me the first time I saw a 1968 Pearl White Thunderbird. Man, it blew me away. Today, the nostalgia for both wax in my mind every time I see them. Sure, \\"Beginnings\\" will give you the first two albums, if the recordings is all you want to experience. Album covers have their own mystique. The original vinyl without the original cover isn't just, well, right. It doesn't look right, it doesn't feel right. But, no matter what, get the original vinyl and, yes, get the CD all remastered. Listen to the difference. Which one takes you back to 1969? You know what I'm talkin' about.what I'm talkin' about.
0385535147|4.0|Like most Grisham works, it's definitely fiction (which he fully embraces in the acknowledgments), but the unbelievable plot and unreal situations is what I've come to expect and love from Grisham, and as fiction it's no worse than any tv show or other novels.<br /><br />The first two thirds of the book are very entertaining, but the last third is very predictable, and the ending is a little boring. Not nearly as suspenseful or thrilling as other Grisham novels, but still a good story and definitely worth reading if you're a Grisham fan.<br /><br />The underlying attitude of the book casts a tone of general suspicion regarding the reality of how power is abused by both Federal agencies (i.e., FBI, DEA, DOJ, etc) and Federal courts. And while it's clear that Grisham disdains actual corruption in the real federal government, the overall feel of the book is not a soapbox rant against such corruption. If you read The Confession you'll get the consistent impression that Grisham wrote that one with the purpose of taking every opportunity to give harsh criticism against capital punishment, but he has no such major axe to grind in The Rackateer. Grisham's genuine criticisms of federal corruption inspire and flavor to this book, but his purpose in this one wasn't super-politically motivated. I almost wish he would've been harder on the Feds, but their portrayal certainly wasn't exactly flattering either. Anyone interested in learning more about how the Feds work and re-work the system should read Three Felonies a Day by Harvey Silverglate.
1451629184|2.0|The book came in a good time. But the book had not a cover and this was disapointing, because in the cover are also many informations to read. this was the first time  this did occur, also was the book not in the best condition, it was kind of squeezed or pressed.
3836503050|3.0|I love vintage pin-ups and pattern much of my own artwork after them. This is a great book, but I was a bit disappointed that it is printed in China. I guess that is why it was such a good buy. It was pretty difficult to find where this book was printed. I looked at the Copyright page and book jacket and didn't find that info there. Seems like it was purposely hidden. I try to avoid buying wood and paper items manufactured in China as the trees used for such things often come from Asian rain forests that should be protected. I also live in a paper-making town in the U.S., so this gets a bit personal. One big complaint I have about reprints in general these days is that many are printed in China. It is a shame. We need the jobs here, for one thing. Another reason to avoid outsourcing such work is from a human rights perspective. Many companies operating in China treat workers horribly. I feel kind of guilty I even made this purchase because of that, but I honestly didn't know it was printed in China, and I do love the book.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|I stand with the other fans who refuse to pay for this edited, badly cut version of this great film. Disney, stop pushing these amazing films out just as silly fare for children and consider the adults who pay top dollar for them.(We want complete, unedited, beautiful transfers). You now own Jim Henson's Muppets, show his memory, and we fans some proper respect by making every new Blu-ray release the best that it can possibly be.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Light and entertaining read. Rick Riordan has the ability to be comical and tell a great story at the same time. His characters are built, the plot is set. Percy Jackson and his friends never fail to deliver a knock out story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was so much better than even this first.  If that is even possible, the story line increased and the involvement in the history of the characters was brought out more.  It left you just hanging on until the next book is released!
B009CPES4I|3.0|Decent movie.  For those who would like to know a little more about India this movie will amply provide.  Good time pass.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Saw this at the theater and wanted to see it again at home.  Love the adventure, like the heroes!  In a time that heroes are belittled and sameness is deified, movies like this give a sense of gratitude that there are those who care enough to risk everything to fight evil.  It is just a movie, but it reminds us that there really are heroes in this world.

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I'm not a huge Kid Rock fan until I heard this album. It's just great song writing and good rock in roll music. I would have to say it was my favorite album in 2010 by far. Pick this up if you want to feel good and sing along to some great music. I hope the next album is going to stay in this direction.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game can be easily sold for $1<br />This is a really nice, good ,and challenging game<br />I would really recommend people to get it
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Yes, Martin has gotten very descriptive and has really delved into many story lines, but this book returns us to all of the characters we were missing and is great. Don't listen to all the naysayers.
B005OZE9SA|1.0|UPDATED 3/16/2014<br /><br />After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.<br /><br />The 2i2 is a simple set-up. Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a \\"low-headroom\\" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters. It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless. (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!<br /><br />I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed \\"Ballsdogit!!!\\", and purchased a license for Reaper. After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer \\"lock up\\", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!<br /><br />I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers. Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time.<br /><br />Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that \\"you should not use this setup to record electric guitar..\\", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should \\"get something with more headroom like the 2i4.\\" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!<br /><br />I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!<br /><br />This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????<br /><br />The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.<br /><br />Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here.\\" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!<br /><br />I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle?

B0086DBE62|4.0|As an 80 year old, soon to be 81,<br />I have a long fondness for Julia<br />Roberts, going back to Mystic<br />Seaport.  Even though I have seen<br />the purchased version,I have<br />requested the Netflix as well.<br />The Kindle Fire is something of<br />a juugling act !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I choose this number of stars because it was a very exciting book that added more to the first two books.
0553801473|5.0|I really don't understand the negative reviews. This book is much better than the previous one in my mind. If you read (and enjoyed) the previous books then this one continues with good characters, a fully imagined world (maybe more so than allows a quick read), and interesting plot.<br /><br />I can only imagine that some people are mad that the story isn't finished at the end.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|First, let me say, I am a HUGE Kiss fan.  I have seen them every time they have been in Atlanta since the Georgia Tech show, as well as Tokyo Dome and Fuji Speedway.  I was an original member of the Kiss Army, and I could go on and on here.  I just wanted to preface with this so no one would think I was being a Kiss basher, because I hate those people.  I think Kiss is the greatest band in the world.<br />As for the Monster Album, I was so excited.  Everything I had heard made me think I was going to be blown away.  Now, I truly believe the songs could be great, I just can't feel it.  When I kept reading and hearing about the old school recording methods, I was not really concerned, because the 70's Kiss albums sounded great.  Man, was I ever mistaken!! \\"Let down\\" is an understatement.<br />I rushed out and bought it the day it was released, put into the CD player, and I thought I was going to explode, but not in a good way.  The sound was HORRIBLE! I have a new Maxima with the top of the line Bose system, so please don't assume it was the stereo.  If you turn this CD up to feel the music with any volume it gets muddy.  The licks are so bland and dead due to such horrible production, that it made me almost angry.  I thought, wow! this could be great if it were re-recorded and re-produced!  Now when I read all the \\"positive\\" comments about the analog recording, I can't help but think, Hey, this is great use of technology!  I think I will go get me a telephone with a cord on it so I can't leave the wall while I'm talking, and maybe put a big dial on it so it will take forever to call someone.  I could make many references here, but I think you get my sarcasm.  The point I would like to make is, there is a reason that all the new and great qualities of recording took over the industry.  There is a reason NO ONE uses the old crappy sounding stuff anymore.  It's because the new stuff makes a much better sounding, higher quality record!  The only song the even comes closeto a feeling of \\"punch\\" or \\"hit\\" to the guitar is Out of This World, but it doesn't even begin to come into the ballpark of the quality of recording that the first three albums have.  I actually put on one of my Dresed to Kill albums with the original blue labels, that pops and scratches away and the Monster CD in and switched back and forth, and was blown away at how much better, clearer, and cleaner the DTK album sounded.<br />That takes me to another point I wanted to make with this album.  I am an avid Kiss defender and some of my friends and I saw Kiss and Aerosmith this summer, and it has been a constant battle of words ever since.  The one ace in the hole I have always had is that Aerosmith albums have always had a couple of good to great songs and a bunch of crap on them, and almost always have a horrible production and sound (Draw the Line), while Kiss has always had GREAT production. Well, now I am getting laughed at.  Even Draw the Line album has as good or better sound than this record.<br />To sum it up in a nut shell.  A CD that could truly be great, but you can't turn it up and get any feeling.  The guitars sound flat, with no \\"hit\\".  Any volume gives you a muddy mess, you know, like an old 70's turntable on a box that you used to buy at the 5 and dime store.  In today's time, people are used to QUALITY.  They want to turn it up and ROCK!  That is impossible with this CD. To the old timer that wants to reminisce, it will do just fine, but if Kiss wants to impress the new guy, or wants anyone to enjoy this as a butt-kickin, rockin CD, they need to re-record it.  Great potential.... Terrible miss....<br />All I can do as (as I feel) the world's biggest Kiss fan, is just sit and wait for a new Kiss album to come in a few years.  I know, there is no way they would record two albums with this poor quality of sound.  That is something that needs to be left for Aerosmith to do, because they do it so well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it had all those fun games and the way you have to earn points is so much fun
B007SGM084|2.0|I was disappointed. There's not much to this book other than just S & M sexual encounters.  The characters are not well evolved and the author leaves many unanswered questions. Overrated.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book keep you reading but the end will leave you hanging and make you start reading the next book immediately!!
B009DJB9HC|4.0|Now, this is what I am talking about. Best effort yet. Glad to see these guys moving forward. When they first came out, I thought it was just gonna be a one off deal. I was hoping they would work together more. So this is there third effort. While I liked there first two efforts, they just never left the mark for me. I knew that these heavyweight players hard more to offer. Afterglow puts them over the edge.<br />I have been following Glen Hughes since the early 80's. Jason, was first introduced to me through his band Bonham and the song Wait For You. Joe I have been following for the last few years, and while he has never took me by storm, he has always captured my attention. This last year has been very good for Joe musician wise.<br />Afterglow, to me, has captured the element they have been chasing. By that, I mean all these artists these days are wanting create that 70's atmosphere. To be able to do that in this modern age and get fans (new and old) to be able to buy into it, is tuff.<br />If I could give this 4 1/2 stars I would. Again, Joe's vocals are missed. The guys has a great voice and compliments Glenn very well. As can be heard on Cry Freedom. On the second effort we heard more of Joe. Would have liked to again, but to be fair, Joe probably likes just being able to focus on playing guitar. I would give a breakdown of the songs, but I am not. I seem to favor the later half of this release. There playing as individuals shine on this all over the place and will be jamming this out in the truck for abit. Again, best effort yet and excited to keep listening.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This movie is about the evils against Jews in Hitler's concentration camps. It is very sobering. I consider it one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The evil committed against Jewish people is very powerfully portrayed. This movie should not be shown to young kids, but should be a must see for older students learning about Nazi Germany.
B000SEGSB8|5.0|The book covers in minute detail the Europe Central and environs in microscopic detail from the end of WWII to 2005. An amazing accomplishment. Focused and factual.  If you didn't live through the period covered by this volume you will have after you've read it.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a fun free unending game. imangi studios has made one of the best games ever! but it takes awhile to get used to at first
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|My daughter heard this was different than the Disney movie and thought she would give it a try.  She couldn't put it down.  It is wonderful to find something different than what is the current trend...she has now found other classics that she is interested in reading.  A great turn on to the classics.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|I wanted to learn what all the fuss is about, especially because it's now in its 5th season. I was not disappointed. Not only was there plenty of suspense/action but also well crafted character development containing keen observations of conditions leading to and explaining his fateful decision to break bad. Problem with instant streaming: occasionally the action paused to allow more video to load. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, so will investigate before purchasing more.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bared to you was great the 2nd reflected into you even better cant wait for the 3rd entwined to you
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Could not put it down...cant wait till the next! This series is my guilty pleasure its so yummy and rich.
B0073ODRKG|5.0|I wish I had found this earlier, it would have saved me a lot of money. It is great and for the price you would get 2 cd's and this way I got 11. I absolutely love it. I only wish it had all the new ones too!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00065GX64|5.0|A wonderful foreign film that will put a lot of people off because of the language and subtitles but is still a very engrossing watch. The story even now is fresh and inventive and Peter Lorre is amazing in the kangaroo court scene alone. This one will stay with you awhile.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|First of all i start by saying that i waited to see it after buying it because i felt it would be great but i was wrong. If you are a true fan of Alien then you would know certain details dont add up and it wasnt much of a prequel. Lance Henriksen was the actor who owned the company and in ALIEN VS PREDATOR was a great detail of his death and way in Alien 3 he was found out as a robot. See Predator 2 at the end as u can see the skeleton trophies. one of them was Alien related so as u watch Alien vs Predator you get the full picture of details that this movie failed to display.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|In my opinion this album is their best release after 'Epica' and 'The Black Halo'. The new singer Tommy Karevik is the best replacement you can wish for Kamelot, he is truly an amazing singer and like me a lot of Kamelot fans will be satisfied with his voice. Silverthorn is great from start to finish, your ears will be pleased with every single song. This album is truly worth getting and it lived up to my expectations!<br /><br />1. Manus Dei<br />2. Sacrimony 4/5<br />3. Ashes To Ashes 5/5<br />4. Torn 5/5<br />5. Song For Jolee 4/5<br />6. Veritas 5/5<br />7. My Confession 5/5<br />8. Silverthorn 4/5<br />9.

B0091THRCU|5.0|I always kept my former phones in pouches so finding this one was great.  I like the thin design of the iPhone 5 and prefer not to bulk it up with an Otterbox or some such devise.  The Snugg is a tight fitting pouch that doesn't pinch the phone in it, but the phone won't slip out on it's own either.  The materials and craftsmanship are of high quality.  I do not think that leather is necessarily superior to what Snugg has chosen to use.  I have concerns about how long the elastic strap used to eject the phone will last, but with a lifetime warranty that shouldn't be an issue.  I suppose that will all depend on how Snugg honors their warranties.  We'll see.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|The blending of their voices and instruments with the words to the songs is soothing, heartfelt, and emotionally compelling. At times it feels as though they're frolicking through fields of tall grasses while laying their souls bare for all to see. Definitely a CD you can let play from start to finish. I highly recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it, worth money for this pe and the one on Pc. I have the one on Pc, and ma server .com is mcpvp.com, check it out, it's awesome! its got hunger games, capture the flag, call of duty(sponcerd server), and more! also mojang, make more games like this! make 5.0 update!
B008NABUU8|3.0|The game is very good to test your creativity and thinking skills but not the best choice if your looking for just a simple casual game that you don't want to put too much time into.
B00932HCG6|5.0|Homeland is a great new series on Showtime.  If you like intrigue and drama, this is worth taking a look at.  The characters are well developed and each episode will leave you wanting more.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After the first book, this one was disappointing. Repetitive. Plus, Christian lost his edge in my opinion. Almost a role reversal in the emotional part.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|OK so I'm a Van the Man Fan! Been a fan since he originally recorded \\"Gloria\\".<br /><br />This album is great. It lives up to it's sub title No Plan B. Van is a real professional who was certainly \\"Born To Sing\\". I can't say I have a favorite cut as I like all of them. On certain cuts you can really hear the impression \\"John Lee Hooke\\"r made on him. Sax solos are great too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series! A book for all. A must to read.  Start with book number one. Why make everyone require words that do not have any meaning? enough to say it was a great book.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I have a kindle fire and whenever I am in the car on a trip it annoys me that I can never get a signal to go online. If I download this app, would I be able to get a signal and go on youtube in a car or a place with no wifi??? Can someone please ANSWER ME! PLEASE :-o
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Was an awesome movie hopefully they make another one. If you like a good movie then I would recommend this one.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Don't get me wrong...I like this game but its alot like temple run. I downloaded this thinking I would love it and be addicted to it like everyones reveiws were talking about but I didn't. Well, not until the first week or so. Its just like every other game...you love it for the first few days then you just forget about it. It gets old. /:<br />that's the truth.
B002NZK5VY|3.0|The movie was mislabeled. I ordered the widescreen version but got the fullscreen. It's not worth the trouble of sending back to get the correct version to me.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|... I love fairy tales and this is a sexy fairytale a modern one a lovely one and very easy-to-read
B00992CF6W|3.0|I have only seen videos on youtube about it but I have not bought it yet I really really hope its good :)
B00005JLEU|3.0|Fast shipping but the disc looked used because it had scratches. I would have requested a refund since it did not look 'new' to me, but since the DVD was working fine and I needed this to give as a gift, and i did not want to go through the hassle of going to the post office,I just kept it. But please, be honest with the conditions of your items next time. It is a rip off to pay full price expecting the item to be in 'new' condition, when the item received was actually full on 'used!'
B007MDB548|5.0|Out of all the Disney characters Tinker Bell is my favorite .When I received his package, I opened it right away and watched it with my family what an excellent movie. I' going to collect the first three and get the fifth one when it comes out. :)
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The Raid is the story that British Judge Dredd just took away.<br /><br />But the Judge needed guns, back ups and a psychic to survive, The Raid just needed a couple of guys (brothers themselves in the story) to make this film explodes!<br /><br />The Raid is a violence anthem, a martial arts tribute, a feast of absurd non stop action.<br /><br />Watching it I remembered Tony Jaa's first appearance and Carpenter's Escape from New York and Assault on Precinct 13... not bad at all.<br /><br />But (always a but), I felt resentful for Judge Dredd with Karl Urban... that movie was a total remake, or should I say plagiarism...<br /><br />The Raid is only for Asian film lovers, you know what I mean in cinema and violence standards!
B004JMY312|5.0|Typical Disney fun and a great family Halloween movie. This is one that even younger children can enjoy with their parents.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love....Love....Love. I can't stay off this app!  I have found this app so helpful in my day to day life.
B005EGXTHG|3.0|Although I enjoyed this 2nd book in the series and thought it was just as well written as The Hunger Games I only give it 3 stars.<br /><br />This is partly because the 1st Hunger Games Katniss took part in was described in great detail in the 1st book and I found the 140 pages devoted to revisiting the games for the 2nd time, even though the environment and contestants were different, was too much and anti-climactic. Having said that I enjoyed the twist at the end of these games.<br /><br />However, it also annoyed me when towards the end Brutus and Enobaria leave Katniss with Brutus saying \\"She's as good as dead!\\". Why? If I'd been them I'd have made 100% sure and had it confirmed by the sound of the cannon!<br /><br />Although I understand why Haymitch didn't want Katniss and Peeta to be in on his plan at the start, I did find it a stretch to believe that its success depended on Katniss putting together a couple of clues when one of the other contestants could simply have told her what she needed to do at the end.<br /><br />I'd also like to know a bit more about what's going on in Gale's head... but perhaps that's being kept back for the 3rd book in the trilogy.<br /><br />J M Leitch, author of futuristic thriller The Zul Enigma
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I read the first book, this one is definitely better. well written, interesting story, strong characters, good paste book, but still didn't quite make it for me.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I don't think I've read a book in the YA genre before, so I did wonder how much I'd enjoy The Hunger Games, but I should not have worried. It's well written, well plotted, with believable characters and just the right amount of horror and gore. It's also a great hypothesis for a story. I definitely want to read the other 2 books in the series and find out what happens regarding Katniss, Gale and Peeta.<br /><br />J M Leitch author of futuristic thriller The Zul Enigma
B00280LYIC|3.0|I can across Rick Riordan when i was picking a book for my kids, we started with Lost Hero, which kids absolutely loved, and i enjoyed very much. about 1/3 in the book we discovered that it's actually a follow up series to Percy Jackson, and that's how i picked up The Lightning Thief. My 11 year old loved this book, my 9 year old found it a bit boring, as for myself, it's a bit slow paste, but non the less really good book, with great references to Greek Methodologies. I would highly recommend it for kids 11 and up, maybe not all of the adults would enjoy it that much.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game all together its<br />worth it.I love the gravity puzzles its fun 5 out of 5.If you dont have this get or ill make you get it
0143038583|5.0|Highly recommend.. A must read. You don't know what you don't know, so one must explore and learn! Well written and comprehensible.
B009FZFONO|3.0|Short, but interesting preview of upcoming new season... Some special effects inside view of how all those zombies are built and used in show.. Lot more blood promised for season-3 if you can believe it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book... Couldn't put it down and finished in a day and a half (only took that long cause I had to work a 10 hour shift. You immediately get caught up in the storyline and want to know what's gonna happen next.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I like reading on my Android phone, but it's the 2nd LARGEST app on my phone at 24 MB, which is LUDICROUS.<br /><br />It'll prevent you from being able to have a decent amount of apps on your phone, and it's almost as big as the FACEBOOK app. I had to delete it, but would love to have another option.<br /><br />By the way, to add to my credibility here, I'm an Amazon author with 6 books available ONLY on kindle!
0451169514|5.0|One of the scariest books I have ever read.  I will never look at clowns the same way.  So many other authors try to do the coming of age story, but King's It and The Body from Different Seasons are still the best
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The movie was a ridiculous remake/rehash of Alien.  Same story, different planet.  Nothing new here.  Not worth the $$$.  Plus the movie stopped and I had to restart it a couple of times.
B007HU7NBK|3.0|If you're looking for a \\"tell all\\" book that names names and throws people under the bus, then this is not the book for you.<br /><br />In his book, John simply tells his story from his perspective.  As a recovering addict, the tone he takes with this book is that of accountability, never the blame game.  He acknowledges the decisions he's made in his life, the effects (for better or for worse) of those decisions and takes ownership of that.<br /><br />The book begins and ends with family written in the format of short stories.  Every chapter tells a short story from periods in his life.  From his birth, to growing up an only child, to the devoted parents who raised him, forming Duran with Nick, the ups and downs with Duran, the fame, the girls, the drugs, rehab and the death of his parents.  He writes about his parents so often in this book that their story is a subplot that makes the book stronger and more grounded.<br /><br />The Duran years like others have said here are glossed over.  If you're looking for dirt, you won't find it here.  John takes the high road and merely states there was a \\"disagreement\\" or \\"tension\\" whenever something doesn't work out with Duran.  The only time he truly points the finger is in regard to Sterling Campbell's time in the band and when after leaving the band the second time, Andy isn't mentioned in the \\"thank you's\\".<br /><br />Instead John tells how he always felt akward and insecure.  How becoming the \\"heartthrob\\" teen idol at the age of 22 only intensified his insecurities while slowly becoming immersed in the party scene that gradually lead to him becoming a coke addict.<br /><br />While Duran is a huge part of his life, it's not the only part of it.  And this book covers his views on his life.  Not just 1980-1985 when Duran's fame was at it's peak.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie was very good. We enjoyed it immensely. I think all the actors/actress, etc did their characters justice. Great job!
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Anybody familiar with Motley Crue knows about their penchant for excess.  This diary fully details the struggle of an addict at the height of his addiction.  And Nikki doesn't hold back.<br /><br />Written entry by entry style, then followed by commentary by the people in his life at that time (Vanity, family members, the rest of Motley Crue, agents and the like), it gives a clear picture of how far gone Nikki was during the Girls, Girls, Girls period of 1987.  His struggles to stop, his struggles to get his habit under control, the haluncinations caused by his habit paint a clear picture of a man dealing with an addition that was taking over everything.<br /><br />That he kept a diary is simply mindblowing.  It's a cautionary tale that is definitely a must read.
B004D1CK32|5.0|Must view it. I enjoyed this better than Magnificent 7. After watching this you'll appreciate life more.  This is a movie about inspiration and accepting death to live life to the fullest.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This movie tried to recreate a masterpiece of a book. Well it failed. They took out parts of the story that made it interesting and underdeveloped Eragon as a character. Read the book you wont regret it!!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|If you have missed new music from Stevie Nicks like I have, you won't be disappointed in this cd. It has something for everyone. Rocking songs like The Ghosts Are Gone and In Your Dreams, soft and sweet music like Italian Summer and Cheaper Than Free (sounds like something she would have written in the early 70's in one of her country moods), sexy like Wide Sargasso Sea, and classic Stevie like Secret Love and Moonlight. There is even a song using Edgar Allen Poe's poem, Annabel Lee, which you will find yourself humming or singing all the time, \\"...I lie down, by the side, of my darling, my life, my life and my bride...\\"  There is another really catchy song called Everybody Loves You, one of her collaborations with Dave Stewar. And I must also mention the very awesome, sort of blues/longing song, You May Be the One.<br /><br />She also wrote the very touching Soldier's Angel, asking Lindsey Buckingham to work on the track with her. It is very stark in contrast to the rest of the songs on the cd. It has an eerily hanuting sound to it which gives me the feeling of alarm, or terror ~ which is probably the inspired and intended tone considering it was written for all the soldiers out there, fighting in war, risking their lives for us. Stevie Nicks visits the Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital at times and also has an organization that sends song-filled ipods to injured soldiers to help keep their spirits going with the aid of music. I can't help but think this song would have been better if it was released on its own, maybe a cd single or EP, with also a live version on it or something. I just personally have trouble listening to it in the midst of this cd because it makes me emotional. I skip it most of the time when playing the whole cd. I only play it when in the mood for that tone and that message, that story. It is a story definitely worth her telling and worth all of us hearing, but I just can't handle it every day, right in the middle of the rest of the cd. But Ihave heard others say they love it, so it's just how it affects you personally. I am glad she wrote it and that she cares so much about our military. It is just one more way in which we see a peak into her wild, yet very loving heart.<br /><br />She also wrote a song about the stormy devastation and tragedy in New Orleans from Hurrican Katrina. She keeps us remembering the beauty and magic of the city. \\"I see a sea of smiles, I see a haunted city reaching out, I see hope in all their faces, behind the mask of Mardi Gras... I want to get a room in New Orleans, I want to sing in the streets of the French Quarter, I want to dress up, I want to wear beads, I want to wear feathers and lace, I want to brush by Anne Rice, and go down Bourbon Street...\\"<br /><br />If you are lucky, you will find a copy of this cd with a bonus track called My Heart, a song with quintessential Stevie love-song lyrics, \\"...And the first sign of light, well it lifted my heart, as if some kind of wings came and lifted me up, and so became your face, your name ... Well my heart still stops when I stand before you, and my heart still breaks when you take my hand, and my eyes still close when someone speaks your name, and you understand...\\"<br /><br />Full of emotion and music that keeps you going, inspiring your days, this is right up there with Bella Donna and Wild Heart. I am thankful she put this album out. Each song she gives us is a blessing. Whether it helps move the world, like Soldier's Angel, or helps us not stress over the dead economy and reminds us you can't put a price on love by singing along to Cheaper Than Free, or whisking us away to a dream vacation in Italian Summer, you can almost feel like you are there, picturing it, soaking it in ~ the cd perks me up every time I listen to it.<br /><br />This is definitely worth adding to your cd collection. Sometime in late 2012 or early 2013 there is suppose to be a dvd documentary being released from the making of this cd (and posssibly the tour?) so be sure to keep your eye out for that! If you go to Stevie Nick's you tube site, she has some music videos from this cd which will give you a small sneak-peek into the style of the documentary.

B008RTE066|4.0|I first saw MMT as a Biafra benefit showing in January of '69 in Santa Rosa, CA.  It think it was only one of two American screenings at the time. The other was at a now defunct and torn down Haight Street theater in San Francisco. I was into it at the time because it WAS The Beatles and it was rare.  Later on I saw MMT on video and it did seem amateurish and dated.  No wonder it was considered The Beatles first \\"flop\\" in '67.<br /><br />I like that the reissue is with dual vinyl EP's, just like the imports we used to see in the record stores alongside \\"With The Beatles\\" & \\"Beatles For Sale\\". The Capitol LP we had in The States also included the two singles that bookended Sgt. Pepper and were not included in the movie. That's the way they repackaged The Fabs for the American audience back then.<br /><br />This reissue is for die hard psychedelic Beatle fans and should not be the initial introduction of The Beatles to younger, innocent, and curious viewers. Start with \\"Please Please Me\\" and work your way forward to MMT.<br /><br />Trivia (and semi-spoiler) Alert: The under-appreciated Bonzo Dog Band plays a song titled \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\" in the tent scene. Yes dear fans, now you can actually see the origin of the name of that very contemporary band.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is really fun to play. the ads dont come  up very much and this game has awesome graphics. if you like this game try fish ninga. lots of slicing in both games.
0691152640|4.0|Highly technical, and tough going for someone who has never even had an Econ 101 course. But important stuff. Am getting through it slowly.  Most important point is that which the title suggests, namely this time is NO different and those handling world finances make the same errors over and over.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am annoyed that people are giving this a bad review for the Kindle Fire. I never had a problem. Sometimes I think its the User and they blame the app. I call them a id10t error!!!!!!For those of you that don't get it,  (IDIOT) !!!!!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|All the first season with dialogs of the director, extras,  with great image in three blu ray disks. Nice package.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|If you thought that the 1st Sherlock Holmes was good then your in for a treat. This movie has everything I wanted. It had me thinking, entertained, wide-eyed, and waiting for whats next. I totally forgot about life and its problems, I was zoned in. When it ended I kept watching the credits role hoping some more would start playing. The story is even more well thought than the 1st and the action scenes are similar to the 1st but again, better. It is also pretty funny too. Overall this movie was a great choice by me and anything with Robert Downey Jr. in it is sure to be awesome. I recommend this movie 100 percent.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Muse never ceases to amaze me. Without a doubt madness is my new favorite song.perfect blend of styles in all their songs

0345803485|5.0|awesome book. Can't wait to read the next two! Boring at first though, but it did eventually get a lot better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This author has a lot of promise. The story is a little long in explaining some parts, but a good read over all. Easily worth 5 stars.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Though sometimes it's frustrating to maneuver to the actual item I want, it has been such a helpful app. I first started using it on my Kindle Fire. I love being able to easily access it that way! There are so many helpful &amp; interesting ideas being shared! I absolutely recommend this app.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Totally devoured this book in less than 1 day. Then reread it again, and again. Makes you remember young love, and how it does not always come in a convient wrapped package. The authors writing style is easy to read and the characters are well developed. I am really glad there is a new book coming out from Travis's point of view, because I would love to see when he decides he is in love with Abby and she just isnt a long term conquest to him.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that it is not lending enabled.
0679411585|5.0|A VERY GOOD READ ON THE WAR IN NAM[[ASIN:B009S33I68 We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young: Ia Drang-The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam]]
B00979CS50|4.0|2012 has seen Neil very busy - writing a book, makin a covers record, touring the US with Crazy Horse (fantastic reviews), inventing Pono & still finding time for his Bridge concerts. His latest outing with the Horse sees Neil and his cohorts threshing out some extended solos with three songs taking up over an hour. Two songs 'Walk Like A Giant' & 'Ramada Inn' are classic Neil & Crazy Horse songs BUT someone in the control room should have said after 10 minutes 'ok guys enough'. The record sees Neil looking back on the halcyon days of the 60s and asking what was achieved. In reality Neil never bought into the 60s idealism remember he didn't want to be filmed at Woodstock. The questions are asked but I'm not sure what conclusions he made from these songs.<br />The shorter songs work better but lyrically some of these are rather lightweight. I would have loved to give this 5 stars because it is a very good record and trimmed down to 60 minutes may have done the job. Compare this to the classic Zuma record with 'Dangerbird' & Cortez' and we can hear the benefits the 6-8 minute songs compared with the 25 minutes plus song (Driftin' Back or Driftin' Off!) we have here. Don't get me wrong it's still vintage Neil Young & Crazy Horse but just misses 2-3 killer songs.They set the bar very high many years ago so after all these years we should treasure every record.<br /><br />The Blue Ray version is due on Nov 19th & has an addiitonal track 'Horse Back'.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I really like the first three movies in the saga ! This other 3 movies  just complete the whole story.

1416914293|5.0|Clary, Jace, Alex, Iz, Magnus... Love this bunch and a few others who I can't spell (ha ha ha.) Great book that picks up were book 1 ended. We delve into the same problems and pick up new ones.<br /><br />The world of shadow hunters, magicians and all things that go bump in the night.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game for the whole family. new quest all the time keep it interesting. great graphics too.cant get enough of this game.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|First off: Great Price at Amazon...Thanks for the deal!!!<br /><br />Second: Great Action Movie!<br /><br />I didn't want to see the movie in 3D in theaters due to the sometimes blurry focus on-screen. But seeing it in 3D on my HDTV is another matter entirely. The title of this review says it all...WOW!!!
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Always being an avid reader, I had read and liked Hemingway's novels many years ago when I was still in school.  After more years than I care to admit, I decided to read him again since I couldn't even remember most of his books.<br /><br />To tell the truth, the book seemed entirely different when read by older eyes.  I really couldn't relate to the expatriates in them now.  And even though I'm not a teetotaler, I was a little turned off by the characters constant drinking.  It was an era I'm glad I didn't live in.  Times change I guess.<br /><br />I'll be rereading more of his novels and hope I'll relate to them a little more than I did his first.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Simply loved it ! An intrigue well tied up around a township feud. Several well pulled characters. Intricate personnalities ... seems to be a real story. Bravo.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I'm a FAN of the AMC series.  Both are excellent.  For some reason the TV show doesn't always follow the book, but for me that's OK I intend to keep reading the book as well as watch the TV series.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|I bought this to cut the bottom off of wine bottles and I was honestly a little skeptical that it would actually work. Putting the pieces together wasn't too hard...the directions are easy enough to follow.  My first try came out a little uneven, but that was my own fault...as I went over the score more than once and I think I made it too thick. It really seems to require a gentle, but visible score (practice makes perfect!).  To get the bottom off..I boiled water in a tea kettle, and put cold water, with ice, in another cup. I took the bottle and slowly poured the boiling water (from the tea kettle) over the score..and turned the bottle as I poured. I immediately switched to the ice water and did the same thing. I kept going back and forth (quickly) between the boiling water and the ice water....and the bottom just fell right off!!!<br /><br />Worth the buy...if you have some patience to try a few before you get it to cut perfectly even.
1451648537|5.0|Riveting read that informs and intrigues.  Really interesting learning about Job's personality and the birth and growth of Apple, Pixar and other companies.
B00913DPW2|1.0|can't even get past the porch. I've tapped on every square inch and after the map and keys there's nothing
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I opened this book, maybe a fluffy piece about an orphanage in WWII, but I was pleasantly surprised. At the heart of this book is the relationship between a boy and his grandfather. Its about the thing we believe versus the things we know and how far we are willing to go for love.<br /><br />Jake grew up with his grandfathers fantastical childhood stories about a home for peculiar children on a remote island where every day was beautiful. The stories couldn't possibly be real, but, when his grandfather is murdered, Jake begins a journey to find the truth behind the tales, though he is not prepared for what he encounters.<br /><br />Brilliant writing and characters. A must read and certainly a must love.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Loved book. Well writen and such a man: Steve.<br />We re going to miss him for so long...he was a real genius!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you have only read Fifty Shades of Grey (the first in the trilogy), you are missing out on the other two great reads.  In this final book there is a combination of romance, drama, dreams, mystery and a bit of eroticism.  I would highly recommend that you read this after reading the first 2 books in the trilogy.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use Adobe Reader for studying. It is very simple to use. Loads everything very fast. Good tools. Very usefull.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I have read the book and seen this movie multiple time, it never gets old.  It follows the book exactly.  To think people in the 20's had such a odd sense of value and regard for each other.  Especially the upper class.  It is a must see!
B000YAA68C|5.0|Instant classic that didn't get near enough attention when it was released. Highly recommend for any man, woman, couple, young or old. Very well done, very well written.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Loved this movie! Smart, witty, action packed and fun! Can't wait for #2!  Love Robert Downt Jr.  Iron Man 3 is right around the corner!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Spectacular movie with great action and even better audio and video quality from amazon instant video.Love how convenient was just to download a movie without having to wait for the disc to arrive several days after.
B0098460O4|5.0|Don't listen to those that say that they can't hear just Jonathan - this is a CD by a singing DUO, not a solo project. The music, arrangements, and song selections are superb. The voices are out of this world! The young man dubbed \\"The British Pavarotti\\" and his singing partner, Charlotte, are truly coming into their own on this debut effort. Their voices soar on the classics Canto Della Tera, Ave Maria, and Caruso and the covers of more modern songs like Muse's UnIntended and Take That's Rule the World show the teens growth as vocal artists. The only slight disappointment I have - there were only 10 songs on the album. Looking forward to the pair's future releases and performances!
1616202416|4.0|Must say that for a \\"first novel\\", this was brilliant, if deadly serious and \\"grey\\" in mood....I found myself grimacing quite a bit what with all the pain, humiliation and struggle, but what a solid classic this is. I am proud that this is part of my own library - Now where's that Jollof rice?!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter World is an exciting read.  It connects this dynamic family with a historical time when the world was reeling from WW Two and the horrors of Hitler's regime.  It shines a light on humanity and reminds us this can happen again.  Be  vigilant.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is highly addictive!  Ease of gameplay makes this game fun tor everyone and I'm very glad I found this app!<br />-
B008EZVNO0|5.0|After years of tepid  releases,(with the exception of \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\",Van is now back with a brand new set of some of the best music in years.<br />Got his R&B and Jazz groove back.<br />If you are a true Van fan, then this is a must.<br />Whatever floats your boat,whether it's in a NYC loft at 2:00am or cruising down a Pacific Coast highway with the top down or every other place in between the two coasts,<br />this is for you.<br />Rave on,Rave on Rave on.<br />Thank you Van,and thank you Amazon. Got it the same day as released,and was well worth the speedy delivery cost.
B0035VFLI2|5.0|My timing sucks as usual, leave it to me to find a new favorite artist after he passes away. So worth it!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Really enjoyed this and it held my attention. Looking forward to reading the next one.  Hope there is a happy ending.
0316228532|5.0|Go get the book , awesome ! Great gift for your family members ....mom , dad, sister, brother, everyone will enjoy this book! Very unexpected read ! Worth It!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|After slogging through several Jane Austin novels, I found the first Walt Longmire book thouroughly enjoyable. I absolutely loved the quirky Wyoming humor.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all the Fity Shades of Grey books!! They are sexy, exciting, and suspencful!! I couldn't put them down!!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This app is great and fun! but.... its stole 6 of my dollars. I kept trying to buy in game money but it said it worked but I never got the cash....... o well
B002AWX6UM|5.0|A wonderfully written book. Filled with a great deal of insight and a view of a tragic situation that is hard to imagine. My heart broke to read of the experiences and loss that is brought on by war and conflict.
B006LSZECO|5.0|when there is only one, really......amazing.  One of the most incredible books I have ever read out of 60 some years of reading.  No flaws......none.  Just pure literary perfection, like sweet creme on fresh berry words.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Fantastic, I finished last night and the Brothers are still with me.<br />One of those books that just flow, it grabs you and you just want to keep on going.<br />But of course you fall asleep and that is exactly what I want in a book.<br />Where is book 2 ??
B00913P6G0|5.0|This is the best hip hop album I have heard in a long time! Hell one of the few best albums I have heard as of recent. I love the stories, the beat, everything! He takes us on a journey with him when he raps about events from back in the day. I can't get enough of this cd. I am getting the deluxe album payday. Support real hip hop!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a really fun puzzle game that keeps your mind working I was hesitant at first but it is actually pretty addicting
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read all of DeMille's books and this one was nothing new, nothing exciting.  It was obvious where the plot was going but it didn't get there very fast or with any surprises.  I think perhaps the flip John Corey has reached his fictional end.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is one of the best games I've purchased.  There are a lot of puzzles, many very challenging.  If you enjoy puzzles of all kinds, this is for you.  It's the best I've come across.  I believe there is a sequel, can't wait to get it!
1476712042|3.0|I am not sure what to think of this book.  The story is enjoyable, and it's an easy read, but once you look a little deeper into the relationship between Travis and Abby, you will see co-dependence, emotional manipulation and anger issues.  Travis loses his temper if another guy even so much as looks at Abby.  He constantly needs to have her around and doesn't let her do anything on her own. These are traits of possessive, jealous boyfriends - the exact sort of thing a modern woman must avoid if she wants to be happy. I don't get why all of these women authors write about women who have no lives outside of their boyfriends, or as if being in a relationship is the only reason for living.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />If you take the novel for what it is - just a story and not a model for your life - you will enjoy reading it.
B00013RC8O|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 19 years old and loved it then (a long time ago).  Although it has nudity in it, it is still an exciting movie to watch.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Wonderful cinematography.  The movie exceeded my expectation.  Best viewed in large format.  Turn up the sound. You will be entranced.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game is great!!! Plus, I got it for free! For anyone wondering, this is a must get app and definitely would be worth the $1.99
B0009HAHD4|5.0|I bought this as a replacement to my torn off eyecup on my D60. The Eyecup fits perfectly. The rubber is a little stiff though, nevertheless it meets my expectations for the price I paid. so Why NOT??
B007L24T52|4.0|The story line was clever and intresting. He kept momentum with the plot and had a few surprises. You want to keep on reading.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! THE ACTING IS GREAT, THE CGI IS GREAT, AND EVERYTHING IS GREAT AND PERFECT IN THIS MOVIE.
0030565812|1.0|People are fascinated with characters who appear after a long and serious study of their carreers to be fictious - persons people used to be told in history classes back in the Old Days are for real but later on turn out to apparently be not.<br />In an early version of this review I entertained my notion as of then that Mandela was being a mythical character played by actors.

1432794426|5.0|Defending the king is like no other book about Michael Jackson. The book reveals many things about MJ that are behind the scenes and not what the press had delivered to the public. The author used over 200 sources including people that knew the private MJ and portray him as they knew him.<br />Dr. Moriarty chose to take the high road in her story about MJ. There have been detractors that claim she did not write about the allegations concerning MJ's trial in 2005. She wrote a story about the man that anyone (young or old)  especially teenagers would be comfortable reading her book.  One can read other books about MJ if they are looking for dirty details-not this one.  Dr M did it right. GG
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Prometheus is well directed in the unique taste of the original Alien movie, the story-line is cohesive and true to the Alien saga, and in the end it leaves you begging to know what happens next. The product came well protected without defect or damage to neither the box or the discs. For those that are fanatics over home theater, this is one of the best choices since every frame of the movie is 1080p and 7.1 surround sound, and the movie looks true-to-life on 120Hz televisions.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love jigsaw puzzles and this is a great app for my Kindle Fire HD, the pictures are great and they have options for difficulty - I would highly recommend
B00913DPW2|2.0|Not user friendly at all. A lot of time is wasted trying to figure out basic operations. When I get a game I just want to pick it up and play. I don't want a hidden manual that may or may not be there if you can figure or where there is and figure out how to get there.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun, relaxing, not overly easy or overly challenging. Just enough of each to keep you entertained. Hours of fun. Thanx for the great game!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Interesting, thought provoking felt like the last thirty minutes would have been a great start point for the film, still enjoyed it though.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|I watched this film with my 21 year old son who is taking a college film class.  Surprising to me, we both enjoyed it.  The noir quality of the lighting and shadows is excellent and the story is compelling.  Joan Crawford is a sympathetic character and her acting is excellent.  Enjoyable and thoughtfful.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Really this is a replacement item as my original USB cable has disappeared. It works great, just as the original one did. Purchasing items from Amazon is fast and easy and they come quickly.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love the game but it wont allow me to login to facebook and compete against friends. Overall its a good app tho just that one problem
B000NY12CI|5.0|Very moving book. It gives a great insight on the Muslim religion and explains a lot about the culture in Muslim countries.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|This book realy makes you stop and think about just how much we depend on computers. The release of one trojan could disrupt transportation, the electrical system even the water supply. Mark has done an excellent job of bring this to light with an awesome fictional story!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i was very glad to get this book. it shows the evolving relationship between this couple. i hesitated to read the first one as i heard it was full of weird sex, but finally read it and ended up enjoying the story inspite of some of the scenes.  hope to get book three soon.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Alot of action, suspense, and a little drama. Makes you think what could happen. I recommend it to anyone who loves aliens.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest and was excited when the app was released. I've been using it for several weeks now on my 1st generation Kindle Fire, and it works pretty well most of the time.<br /><br />I have had issues with force closes. Sometimes, it freezes up and refuses to respond. Other than that, it has worked well. It is easy to use, and much easier to use than trying to browse Pinterest on the Internet browser. If you try to use the browser, however, it will always ask if you want to complete an action using the app or browser, which can be tedious.<br /><br />EDIT: With the app updates, the force closes have mostly stopped. There are a few hiccups every now and then, but not any more than I have experienced on the Website.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It was a decent story line with lots of action and special effects. All in all it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the first hour and I am addicted to the game already. It is really fun and I wish this game came out earlier.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This is a work of art by Mr Michael Jackson; the most genius man to ever walk this planet.<br />I had expected nothing less than perfection from the master and perfection is what I got.<br />For those who enjoy works of art, I can only encourage everyone to buy tickets to<br />Cirque du Soleil Immortal World Tour... it is awesome and in the beautiful spirit of Michael.<br />We love you Michael. Be safe.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|The game cut the rope was one I learned about while viewing CNBC one morning.  It is fun and addicting and what is even better my grandchildren(ages 5 and 3) are getting really good at it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone was talking about this book so I had to find out for myself if it could possibly be that good. Needless to say it was soooo much better than I thought it would be. I am now reading Fifty Shades Darker - book 2 of the trilogy.

B00004SPVE|1.0|The dvd is a UK version. It wont play on my dvd player. It was a complete waste of time and money on my part. Otherwise, it is in good shape and came on time.
B000HF0KXU|5.0|Awesome movie. John Travolta played a awesome role. A renegade fighting the good fight, freedom for all. Sure, he was portrayed as a bad guy, but any one willing to have the balls to knock out evil terrorism is a hero in my book.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I loved this movie. Johnny Depp was fantastic. Tim Burton has done it again. This film was entertaining from start to finish.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really had fun playing this game. I love playing hidden object games and this was a really good one. I would recommend this one for sure.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This movie sucked. From beginning to end. They butchered each and every song. What a waste of my money and my time.
1451695195|1.0|40 pages into the book is a lot of background.  The book jumps back and forth from what's happening around him while he is in a coma and his experience while in the coma.  There was a lot of filler in the book at the beginning - the middle and the end.  Not much substance.
0316228532|4.0|This was book good. Definitely not Harry Potter but that's not a bad thing. It's just totally different. The interaction between the kids and their parents was a difficult read at times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it. This is a fantastic book that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's been a while since I have read a story that was this captivating. To think I was not going to read it, I'm glad I did.
B008XX6J92|5.0|I love hearing Kismet recordings by Barbra -- the quirky, unique songs that don't quite \\"fit\\" a project at the time. This album is a wonderful bit of time-travel, and reminds us why we fell in love with Barbra! A real treasure -- looking forward to Vol. II and the DVD. I can't get enough!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|A fantastic read so deep and gripping couldn't put it down can't waite for the next book next year is to far for book 3 :( cross is one of my top 5 book crush hot hot hot
1616960922|5.0|Though known for his epic fantasy, Brandon Sanderson has now released The Emperor's Soul, the second of two novellas scheduled for late 2012.  While the first, Legion, was fun, it was too short - at 88 pages - to let Sanderson really develop the story as well as he usually does.  In The Emperor's Soul, Sanderson takes a more robust but still quick 176 pages to tell a fantastic story that really gets you into the protagonist's head, while also giving fans of his previous works some fun ties to his first novel, Elantris.  Sanderson seems to have found his novella \\"sweet spot\\" with The Emperor's Soul, and it's well worth reading.<br /><br />Our protagonist is Shai, a master Forger who is caught by the palace guards during a heist.  Fortunately for her, instead of being executed outright, the Emperor was recently seriously wounded in an assassination attempt, leaving him alive but a vegetable.  The Emperor's closest advisers, despite their repugnance at her skills, are desperate enough to ask Shai to Forge the Emperor a new soul.  Shai takes the job because it's better than a short drop an a sudden stop, hoping to find a way to escape while working on the impossible task before her.<br /><br />Instead, the challenge consumes Shai, and we learn a lot about who she is, why she does what she does, and how her talents work as she works away at the problem.  No simple thief or charlatan, Shai considers herself an artist, and we see just how accurate that appraisal can be as she approaches the Forging of the Emperor's soul.<br /><br />Shai is the focus of the book, but the secondary characters are well-rounded, especially considering the space Sanderson has to work.  We learn as Shai does just who the Emperor really was, and we get a lot of interesting interaction between Shai and Gaotona, on of the Emperor's advisor's, and Gaotona himself is very compelling, given his personality and role.  The other characters are less of a focus, but Sanderson still develops them well, giving the reader a good view of everything from the politics of the Empire to why the guard captain especially doesn't like Shai.<br /><br />As I mentioned, there are ties to Sanderson's first novel, Elantris.  If you haven't read Elantris, don't worry, that won't slow you down at all.  If you have, you'll appreciate the little touches that show the Empire is part of the same world, even if far away, and you'll have fun puzzling out how Shai's Forging ties into the magic system seen in the parts of the world depicted in Elantris.  Sanderson always delivers great magic systems in his fantasy books, and the magic here is different enough from Elantris to be interesting while still be consistent with the logic of the other book.<br /><br />Sanderson has done an amazing job with The Emperor's Soul.  It retains the brevity and speed of a good novella, while also delivering deep characters, an interesting plot, and great world-building.  Sanderson manages to get a lot more of his usual talents to come through in this novella than his first attempt at the shorter format in Legion.  Maybe it's a matter of size, with this book being twice as long, or that it's fantasy, which Sanderson does more of than the science fiction / thriller genre of Legion.  In any case, Sanderson knocks another one out of the park with The Emperor's Soul, and I'm much more excited about the idea of novellas from Sanderson now than I was after Legion, which was fun but just felt too short and not quite as deep as I'm used to from Sanderson.<br /><br />If you're a Sanderson fan, you'll enjoy The Emperor's Soul, and if you're not, it's a good way to give him a try without committing to one of his longer epic novels or trilogies.  Either way, I highly recommend The Emperor's Soul.ing the reader a good view of everything from the politics of the Empire to why the guard captain especially doesn't like Shai.<br /><br />As I mentioned, there are ties to Sanderson's first novel, Elantris.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Such a great movie, loved it, love bill nye all the time. Love the scenery and the odd and moving subplots.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just loved this book and am looking forward to the last one. I know some people can't relate to these books but to me they are a lot of fun and my imagination runs away. I don't know how it's going to end but I'm sure I will be reading them all over again. Thank you E L James for some GREAT reading!!!

B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is amazing.  The use of instruments and vocals create a unusual and distinct sound that make Alt-J a new band to keep your eye on.  I am very glad to have purchased this album.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|better than the last album, but some of the songs are out of place.  I don't mind Linkin Park's range,  but it times it seems like it's not the same band
B004WR125O|5.0|I received this for free during a recent promotion when purchasing with an Onkyo receiver. Easy to use, just plug in and it works. Enables Pandora radio and other Internet radio stations. Worth the purchase price if you want these features.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|i rarely spend $9.99 in the kindle store for a book but i am so glad i did. it was well written, and a amazing story.. at times it was disturbing and other times it was inspiring.<br />i decided to buy the book because i was happy to hear that part of the money goes to the jayc foundation..<br />it is also something i remember in the news 2 years back... i find it eerie when she mentions the van in the book that phillip had.... back in 2009 there was actually footage of the white van following the google street view car just as it passed garridos house it shows the white van come out of the driveway and follow the google car.. a very rusty, old looking van.. (not surprised jaycee stated in the book it was noisy)  you can find it on youtube by doing a simple search.. now the street view has been updated and it just shows a boarded up house with no tresspassing signs, if interested you can find that on google maps.
B000002KOY|5.0|Amazing Album!!! Danny Whitten is one of the most influential singer/songwriters with the group.  Smell the Horse on this one!!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling, famous for her Harry Potter series, has written a book about small town England and its citizens and it is definitely an adult read; the intrigue and goings-on in a place where everybody knows each other, usually quite surfacy, and in a sense doesn't know each other at all. It is quite vulgar at times especcialy when the teens are talking and also remarkably spitefull; bullying, ethnic problems and especially the bad relationships between parents and their off-spring is documented with a great deal of detail. Politics even in this small town and people chosing sides are the leitmotiv, but the relationships between teens and their surroundings, school-parents-classmates is written well and the book is not easily put down. Sofar I like it!
1401322786|2.0|The moral of Mitch Albom's latest novelette The Time Keeper is: don't commit suicide because you might end up discovering the cure for cancer. Also, don't cryogenically freeze yourself because that's not a good way to go either. No really, Albom's take home message is spelled out for readers who make it to the end and goes along the lines of \\"God limits our days in order to make each one precious, so carpe diem.\\" A laudable message, but one that's poorly served by an abbreviated book that reads more like a badly written children's story than one with adults in mind.<br /><br />Never having previously read this author, I didn't really know what to expect from the pocket-sized book currently on the New York Times' best seller list. It's vaguely reminiscent of Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist--ironically the author even refers to the book halfway through--in that it's a fable that preaches a life philosophy. The book tries to do what A Christmas Carol and movies like It's a Wonderful Life did so well. They played with elements of the fantastic to offer compelling \\"what if\\" stories that resonate with audiences and leave them with a warm feeling that cloaks the fact that they've just been delivered a sermon in disguise. Albom's didactic agenda, however, is audible on every page.<br /><br />Characters are flat, unrealistic, and unsympathetic, from the title character who invents time-keeping to the millionaire anxious to avoid the death sentence his cancer diagnosis represents. The teenage girl's experiences with a high school crush are mindlessly predictable and infuriatingly developed. (Stop texting the really good looking guy at school! He's not that into you!) There's also a jarring disconnect between the central characters' stories. It was disconcerting to follow plots that bounced from the story of the Tower of Babel to a suicidal teenager's exploits on Facebook.<br /><br />There's a scene near the end of the book where the millionaire who's spent boatloads of money tohave himself frozen so he can be revived in the future gets to actually see his future. Imagine the scene in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, when the future world is about to discover the answer to life, the universe and everything after millennia of waiting. Remove all the humor and add a desperate plug for some emotion and that's how this book ultimately ends.<br /><br />Maybe fables are not Albom's forte, or I'm not his intended audience. I might give Tuesday's with Morrie a try before I write off the author completely.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Words can't describe how good this album makes me feel.  Of the 14 tracks about 11 of them are standout, but there are so many moments when my heart just wants to cry out in tears of joy.  Music this good makes time stand still and gives one but fleeting glimpses of a much more beautiful and perfect world.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|I saw this advertised and some women at work said they watched it and had a good laugh.  OK so its cool today and I am off so I dedided to curl up on the sofa and have a girly afternoon.  Good grief this was the dullest, most monotonous, dreary movie ever.  The acting was sloppy the plot predictable.  The whole thing was second rate and pointless.  Talk about mis advertising - I feel like I got suckered into checking this out with the promise of light hearted fun, like an updated Full Monty.  In Monty the characters were real and believable - this movie is so plastic and phoney.  Horrible horrible horrible
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Better story interesting totally different than anything I have ever read would be something to think about for sure different
B000SVZIGC|5.0|I loved this as a teen, and so does my 2 yo daughter. I had a study group over the other day, and one of my friends heard the music and said \\"Is that Anastasia\\"? and asked to borrow it. My girls dvd is very scratched up because she takes it out and looks at the cover, but I let my friend borrow it. All weekend...my baby girl has been asking \\"Stasia? Stasia?\\" So... I might have to get a new copy XD. I do not understand how anyone cannot LOVE this movie!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Being a huge fan of the Alien series Prometheus accentuates the best si-fi collection of all time (in my opinion). The visual and sound effects were stunning, the story line is exactly what I wanted to see and more. Though Prometheus isn't the typical slice-em and dice-em Alien movie it brings a whole new twist to the series not to mention it takes a whole new direction. I can only hope that there's a Prometheus II in the future. There is so much still to be discovered why stop, hint! hint! Mr. Scott.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Woo Hoo A new Jeff Lynne Album!  Thank You!  It came today, while I'm still cleaning up from hurricane Sandy here in South Jersey.  I'm not a Jeff Lynne nut . . . but at this point I would buy anything he does . . . even \\"Happy Birthday.\\"  As usual his voice just soars with that combination of Beatles and Roy Orbison and even on a low key cover album like this you might say to yourself \\"I think I like this version better than the original . . . \\"<br /><br />Inside the cd is a promo for re-release of \\"Armchair Theater (with 2 new song) and re-relases of ELO material.<br /><br />Jeff I'm gonna need another solo album from you before too long . . . preferably before the next hurricane . . .
0486274268|4.0|I'm glad I bought it. It's a pretty cheap book to come by here, and worth it to have a quick reference of basic anatomy for several animals. Plus the illustrations (759 of them, says the cover) are lovely and offer some wonderful inspiration for dynamic poses. They convey weight and sense of motion very well. There are more pages dedicated to horses than to the other animals, but there's a nice variety in the rest. Plenty of deer, cats (domestic and a few different big cats) cattle, foxes, rabbits, bear, and more \\"odd fauna\\" like kangaroos and giraffes get a few pages too. The dogs included are nice but with all the vast differences in breeds the selection is limited to a few extreme types. This book is not heavy in text but the advice it does provide is helpful.
B008I2OAEE|5.0|I first heard these guys back in about 2000, when every metal fan seemed to have Mandylion on their short list of recommendations.  Since then I've listened to every album they released, and followed their ups and downs.  When Anneke left after \\"Home,\\" I figured they might be done for, and the somewhat lackluster \\"West Pole\\" (their first album with Silje, their new singer) only enhanced this fear.  While \\"West Pole\\" is certainly not a bad album, it was not an equal to their previous output and seemed to be a half-hearted return to the sound of Nighttime Birds.  So when I heard they had another album out, I wasn't in a big rush to hear it.  I bought it on a whim after seeing it at a local CD store and I've got to say it's the best surprise of the year so far.<br /><br />This is easily their best album since \\"How to Measure a Planet,\\" at least.  By the time the chorus started on \\"Paper Waves,\\" I was already in love with the album.  I haven't gotten chills like this from anything this band has done since the title track on \\"HTMAP.\\"  Nearly every song here is excellent, with \\"Heroes for Ghosts\\" possibly my favorite song that they've ever done.  Silje's vocals are astounding, and while I'm listening to the album I feel like I might even prefer her work to Anneke's.  The songs are very much in the vein of \\"How to Measure a Planet\\" - they're mainly bass-driven and have a ton of spacy guitars and synths.  It feels more like prog rock than \\"If_Then_Else,\\" \\"Souvenirs\\" or \\"Home,\\" with three of the songs timing in at around 8 minutes.  \\"I Can See Four Miles\\" seems to be the other main centerpiece of the album - the second half of the song turns into an instrumental and features some of the best walls of guitar sound I've ever heard.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone who was a fan of this band at any point after \\"Mandylion\\" not loving this album.  Do not be scared off by the lack of Anneke - this new singer is just as good and the music absolutely does not suffer.  This is the most stunning comeback I've heard since Anathema's \\"We're Here Because We're Here.\\"  5 stars all the way, this is probably the best album I've heard this year.
0307716546|5.0|When the school explodes into a fiery inferno on that summer day, Grace does what any mother would do.  She runs into the building to find the one child who isn't on the outside.  Her seventeen-year-old daughter Jenny, who is upstairs, where she was working as a teaching assistant.<br /><br />It is in the aftermath that we learn the fates of Jenny, of Grace, and why Adam stopped speaking.  And we learn that the fire has been labeled an arson.<br /><br />Our narrator in this captivating story is Grace, whose body is unconscious and supposedly without cognitive function.  She tells the story as if addressing her husband Michael; she refers to him as \\"you.\\"  She communicates with her unconscious and desperately ill daughter Jenny, and can hear and observe what others are saying and doing.  But she cannot speak or communicate with anyone but Jenny.<br /><br />When the police focus their investigation onto her eight-year-old son Adam because of an anonymous \\"witness,\\" she \\"floats\\" around to listen in on conversations and try to figure out what happened.  She has a mission.  To save her daughter Jenny and to find out who started the fire and why, so she can save her son.<br /><br />What, if anything, does the teacher fired three months before have to do with this disaster?  How is Maisie's husband Donald connected to the school and what is happening?  And who else might have been involved?<br /><br />Through various twists and turns, a bit of misdirection through the lies of witnesses, we finally find ourselves on the tangled pathway to the truth.  But just when we think we know what happened, there is still another piece of the story that comes to light.<br /><br />What will happen to Grace and Jenny?  Will there be a happily ever after for them?  Will there be an afterwards?<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down.  I felt so invested in Grace's story and her quest, and in turn, I disliked many of the characters who each had done something wrong and put others at risk.  The lies, the hidden motivations--all combined to reveal the blacks, the whites, and how the two seldom merge.  Like separate aspects of the same person, sometimes the good wins out, and other times it does not.  A riveting, engaging story, [[ASIN:0307716546 Afterwards: A Novel]] earned five stars.The lies, the hidden motivations--all combined to reveal the blacks, the whites, and how the two seldom merge.

B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I was enjoying the game until it deleted my progress.  That is a fairly annoying glitch.  not much fun anymore
B0058YPL66|5.0|People that live in Storybrooke, stay in Storybrooke unless they want something bad to happen to them.  Strangers never come to Storybrooke, that is until Emma arrives.  Emma is reluctantly brought to Storybrooke by Henry, the son she gave up for adoption at birth.  Henry believes that all the inhabitants of Storybrooke are characters of fairy tales and that they are stuck in Storybrooke/in time unless Emma stays in Storybrooke and breaks the curse.  He believes that Emma is the daughter of Snow White and that his adoptive mother who is also the Mayor of Storybrooke is actually the evil witch AKA Snow White's stepmother.  He convinces Emma to stay and that's when things begin to happen in Storybrooke.<br /><br />Now many may make comparison to this show with Grimm because they both deal with fairy tales but whereas Grimm deals with monsters, Once Upon A Time deals with good versus evil.  I think that the creator of this show is brilliant because in each episode, the stories correlate the past with the present.  At first it might be difficult to get a feel for this series and how it works but stick with a couple of episodes and you will see how creative this show is.  You will want to watch the show and root for Emma to bring down the wicked witch, for Snow White to find Prince Charming, etc...I think for me the biggest reason to watch this show is not to see if Emma will break the curse.  Of course we all know that good will always triumph over evil.  The main reason I watch the show is because I want to know who is the bigger villain.  Is it the Mayor or the mysterious Mr. Gold.  What's his role in the curse?<br /><br />I was getting tired of watching shows about cops, doctors, lawyers (no offense to those professions) and I refuse to watch reality TV so I was glad when I stumbled upon this show and came on Amazon and bought the Season 1 DVD.  Great investment, many hours of entertainment so far.  I am zipping through the first season so I can start watching the second season episodes on my DVR.cond season episodes on my DVR.

0345803485|5.0|This book, and its sequels are page-turning, to say the least. I laughed, cried, cringed, and starting biting my lip. I would refer this book to any mature adult.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Fun to read about &#34;the way it was&#34; back in the 60s.  Time travel poses many questions including the &#34;butterfly effect&#34; whereby any tinkering with the past could change the future.  Steven King's details do get mired in details at times.  The logic of the story works.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book so much! It's thought provoking, emotionally compelling, and beautifully written. I'll definitely be reading more from John Green.

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Wild was an interesting story about hiking on the PCT but the more important theme was the journey that Cheryl made in her life. It was interesting to see the transformation that she made through the book. I liked the fact that she filled in the background of her life as the story of the hike was told. That weaving together of the past and present made the story more captivating. The book is an easy read. If you like hiking and/or like the idea of pushing yourself beyond what you think you can do, this is a good story. While I couldn't or wouldn't do what Cheryl did to \\"figure herself out\\", it was an inspiring way to work out demons. It probably saved her life.

B002NNA9N0|5.0|I've seen this movie three times since it came out because it's, well...timeless. It's also a hoot to see a much younger Pacino, Baldwin, Spacey, Arkin and Harris - and Jack Lemmon is the best of the lot. It will also make you appreciate your job (and if not, perhaps time to consider a career change...)  Enjoy it!
B008IYR2BA|4.0|The season was good. But I don't think it was the best season. It was a little slow at times. I think Dexter should have had more \\"side\\" projects, in addition to the DDK case. He really did not have many kills during the season. I don't want to see a gentler, kinder Dexter. And what is this non-sense with his sister having feelings for him. Don't even go there, that's crazy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one well-written, well-woven yarn. There was more than one OH MY GOSH moments.  Highly recommended, fast read as well, will keep you very absorbed.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Being into medieval type stories, this series is right down my alley.  When I started reading the first book, I admit that I had to bear with it for a while.  Too many characters for me to keep track of in my feeble brain.  But along about 1/2 way through, many of them got killed off.  LOL!  So I began to know \\"who is who\\", and every one of these characters have developed into mega-interesting folk.  If you are into medieval lives, the things that people endured, the mystery of magic and ancient arts...I would think you would enjoy this book very much.
B002DOSBMK|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. I have read Salvatore before and enjoyed what I read but I was barely able to finish this one. The characters were not believable and I was unable to relate to any of them. If this is what Forgotten Realms is all about, I will not read any more under that heading. I fail to see how such a civilization (and I use the term loosely)could even survive much less thrive.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|The more I listen, the more I like. Monster has not disapointed. It's hard to believe the band still have the energy and musical chops to deliver an album such as this..<br />Compared to Sonic Bomb, the band seem tighter, and hungrier<br />Come to NZ fellas! One,More.Time..

B000QCS8TW|4.0|Must admit I was a little sceptic when a friend recommended sword play fantasy fiction, bought ahard copy and found the book too heavy to comfortably hold so I bought it on kindle and have really enjoyed it so far, I must also say that the HBO tv series is excellent viewing too.

0765348276|5.0|The book is set in a universe where humans have had faster than light travel for about two centuries and have started colonizing other planets. Earth is kept in the dark about what goes on in outer space, leaving the Colonial Defense Forces in control. To go into outer space, you have to serve in the CDF's army for 10 years. You can't do that until you're 75, at which point they make you into a (young) super soldier. Thus, a lot of folks join the CDF to avoid death from old age. John Perry, the protagonist, is one such person.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. It has good action. The world is different enough to be interesting, but Scalzi keeps the focus on few enough elements of his world to avoid lots of boring descriptions. He grounds his science fictions in enough science fact that his descriptions seem like a plausible technological future (well, much of it), which is cool.<br /><br />The book touches on a lot of interesting topics, too. The protagonist was anti-war on earth, but now he's a soldier. There are lots of discussions of the sci-fi physics. The question of what a person would be like if they were born as an adult and already with their job.<br /><br />Overall, a very strong book.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This series about the adventures of a woman living in 18th century Scotland, and beyond, is truly fascinating!  Ms. Gabaldon has obviously done painstaking research about the era, and her story rings true.  This is so well written that it has actually stirred up an interest in Scottish history, which I've never been much interested in!<br />At first, I was a bit put off by the graphic nature of the sex scenes, however, I came to realize that what I was reading about was \\"making love\\", not just sex.  This is so rare in entertainment today, that I didn't recognize it for what it was!  Very refreshing to read about the sexual love between married partners.  (And, the scenes are very hot, as well!).<br />Changing the venue of Claire and Jamie's love story to the colonies makes for a really interesting read on the beginnings of our country.  I look forward to the next book!  I recommend this series highly to anyone who loves a good romance, and great history.

B00979CS50|5.0|I have no shame at all in admitting the following: I just love Canadians. I think Canada kicks buttocks because they have such amazing and talented performers who always seem to trickle down into the U.S. and enrich themselves in ways that just wouldn't be possible in their socialist, liberal native land. I mean, c'mon! Canada has some of the best actors in the world, like Tom Green, for one. It also has amazing singers that are not overhyped or way overrated at all, like Celine Dion! It also has amazing entertainers, like that p/or/n actor who dismembered his lover and mailed his body parts all over Canada. In the great tradition of these noteworthy Canadians, Neil Young naturally follows suit, and I was so overjoyed to come into possession of an advance copy of Psychedelic Pill.<br /><br />Okay, for those of you who have the gall to criticize Neil Young for only including nine songs on two discs, I have this powerful message of awesomeness for you: Stop it! Just friggin stop it...right now! Neil Young is not even on your mortal level, okay. He is immortal, musically, as far as I am concerned so if he wishes to charge $13 bucks for just nine songs, then you have no right to complain about that!<br /><br />Since this disc is a reunion between Neil Young and Insane Pony, it is no surprise that Neil goes back to his grunge roots for this CD. I especially love how he turned up the feedback to mind-numbing levels and including heavy doses of drop D tuning on this offering. While listening to the songs, I just couldn't decide if I was listening to Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Creed, Puddle of Mudd, Staind or Bush (the band, not the awesome president). I also particularly love how a lot of the lyrics on this CD are very nihilistic and full of introspective self-hatred and bleakness. I suppose that Neil was wearing a lot of flannel shirts while coming up with the songs on this record.<br /><br />Born In Ontario is probably my most favorite song here because it is all about Neil's early regret and woe about being born Canadian, when it was clear to him even way back then that all the prosperity was located just down south from him, in the good old U.S. of A. Ramada Inn is the perfect grunge song because it captures Neil's bleak, nihilistic frustrations about having to constantly stay in the Ramada Inn when his number one choice for awesome road motel was the Motel 6. Finally, She's Always Dancing seems to be Neil's love-letter tribute to post-grunge savior Scott Stapp and his sweeter-than-sweet band Creed. She's Always Dancing is a clear reference and copy of the Creed song Don't Stop Dancing.<br /><br />Folks, I'll give it to you straight, the only way I know how: If you love canucks and everything they stand for (socialism, liberalism, anti-capitalism, abortions up to nine months of pregnancy), then please buy this CD. I know I did because I truly love Neil and his Canadian awesomeness. Even if this Obama economy is hitting you hard and you can't find work because Obama's spent all your taxpayer dollars on Solyndra, get a loan so that you can afford this CD.

0385535147|4.0|Like many reviewers I've been disappointed with most recent Grisham novels. Too often I find that commercially successful authors lose their edge (no one worse than James Patterson), knowing maybe that anything they publish will sell well. Grisham seems to have fallen into that mode.  Plus, for me, not only has he never duplicated his best, early works (including The Firm and A Time To Kill) he seems to envelop his novels in social messages.  We've seen him take on insurance and tobacco companies, tort reform and homelessness among other issues.  I'd prefer a novel with less message and more content.<br /><br />That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with The Racketeer, a novel about an unjustly imprisoned, disbarred attorney who decides to rat out a fellow prisoner in exchange for his own freedom.  Of course there's more to the story than wanting out of prison and these hidden motivations make up the gist of the story.  A positive:  I liked that the majority of the book is from a first person perspective.  It effectively pulls the reader more into the story.  Some caveats:  you do have to wade through some messages (for ex., the dollar cost of imprisoning inmates, the unjust convictions and the deplorable conditions in prison) but they are not the focus of the novel. And you also have to suspend reality at times if you're to believe some of the plot twists.  But given all that it's still an entertaining read.<br /><br />There are times when you want a book to challenge you and there are times when you just want to enjoy a good story.  This is for the latter times.  In summary, it's a somewhat implausible plot with a main character who could use a bit more development and who isn't the most empathetic figure.  But this is still a fun read and one of Griaham's better recent efforts.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Disappointing and dull reading with many abbreviations adding to confusion of time and place. Typical military writing. Cannot recommend. Bad purchase, tough to even finish.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I have been a fan for over 36 years through the ups and downs of thier career. This effort is well worth the KISS legacy, straight forward hard rock, no excuses, no ballads, just in your face, crank it up rock and roll. If you are on the fence about buying it, don't hesitate, buy it. You won't be sorry. I have been listening to it every day during my daily commute and have been really enjoying it. It grows on you!!
B001NIA27E|3.0|I finally got a copy of this movie, the first one sent to me was damaged. The photography was the reason I purchased it. It shows Mt St. Helen's photos that are suppose to be Dante's Peak. Story line is OK, believable.

B009POCG2C|4.0|Your one surviving parent is slowly losing his sight. You have a very difficult relationship and, at the same time, are coming to a turning point in your own career. What do you do tend to, your career or your family?<br /><br />  Gus Lobel (played by Clint Eastwood) is a scout for the Atlanta Braves and has resisted the change occurring in his business and the world around him with every fiber of his being. While his immediate superior and longtime friend Pete (played by John Goodman) values Gus's opinion and defends him against his detractors, one of them is Pete's boss and Gus's ultimate superior. That man, Pete Silver (played by Matthew Lillard) is determined to fire Gus even though he is completely unaware of Gus's failing eyesight. To Silver, a man who relies on statistics and equations over experience and first-hand observation, Gus is a relic of a time gone by. Gus is given one chance, scouting a highly-coveted player in North Carolina, to prove his value to the organization. Pete worries about his friend and so, behind his back, he contacts Gus's daughter Mickey (played by Amy Adams). Mickey is a lawyer on a partnership track in a prestigious firm with a pressing case on the horizon. She's been told that her handling of this case will determine the outcome of the upcoming partnership vote. Still, despite a strained relationship between the two of them, she chooses to go to her father's aide in rural North Carolina and work in her hotel room and over the internet. When Gus informs Mickey that his eyes are starting to fail him, she begins taking an active role in her father's scouting trip. A task she is well-suited for, after a spending a large portion of her formative years by her father's side on scouting trips. In addition to colleagues Gus has known for many years, there is Johnny Flanagan, a relatively inexperienced scout who Gus recruited into the major leagues and who later suffered a career-ending injury. Johnny (played by Justin Timberlake) thinks of Gus as a mentor and, separately, takes an immediate romantic interest in Mickey.<br /><br />  Now, many believed that 2008's Gran Torino would be the end of Eastwood's career, both as a director and an actor. Some who thought little of the film even took great joy in the very idea of Eastwood's retirement. I was not among them. I won't say this is better than Gran Torino or Million Dollar Baby, it isn't. Still, it's an enjoyable film about the endurance of family that also manages to incorporate some timeless wisdom regarding the quintessential American sport. The budding relationship between Mickey and Johnny isn't given as much time, though that's probably for the best.f Gus as a mentor and, separately, takes an immediate romantic interest in Mickey.<br /><br />  Now, many believed that 2008's Gran Torino would be the end of Eastwood's career, both as a director and an actor.
