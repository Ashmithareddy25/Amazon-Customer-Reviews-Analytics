B000002KDS|5.0|This album is the epitomy of 70's hard rock. My favorite Alice cds are Billion Dollar Babies, and Killer. I was 9 years old when Killer hit the streets and this album changed my life.     Ted Templeman produced this, and there are alot of really cool sounds that make this album very creepy and cool. \\"Halo of Flies\\"...etc.      If I was going to live on a deserted island, and could only take 100 cd's with me, this one would definately go.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This is my first serious exposure to Kelly's music.  I've heard her hits on the radio, and liked most of them, but I was never drawn to her enough to buy a CD until an unusual string of events led me to this one.  I'm glad, because what I heard from the previous albums didn't come close to this.  We all know she has a good voice - that's why she is where she is today - but it's what she can do with it that counts.  For one thing, she's the first singer I've heard in a long time to actually ROCK in the classic rock tradition, like Pat Benatar and Ann Wilson of Heart.  At the same time, her musicians, on the \\"harder\\" tracks, are doing modern (as in Linkin Park), sometimes grunge-like rock, with some decorative sounds thrown in by production, and Kelly's voice fits it like a glove.  Examples:  \\"Never Again\\", \\"One Minute\\", \\"Hole\\" and \\"How I Feel\\".  Of course, there's more on this CD than hard rock, but even the ballad \\"Sober\\" is more like a power ballad than a pop ballad.  Her lyrics show a strength associated with rock icons.  In some songs, she lets her hurt show but also confronts and accuses the cad that is hurting her.  Compare this to Pat's \\"Stop Using Sex As a Weapon\\", Heart's \\"Barracuda\\", and \\"You Oughta Know\\" by Alanis.  For a complete change of pace, in \\"Be Still\\" Kelly is gentle and assuring, fair and reasonable.  The soft music reflects this quiet confidence.  Then there's \\"Maybe\\", which begins quietly with \\"I'm strong, but I break...\\", but develops into another song of hope and power.  \\"Yeah\\" is a very interesting track in which she uses both high-pitched urgings and softer whispers to make her lover see things her way.  Same for \\"Can I Have a Kiss\\".  These 2 songs have something else in common:  both stress the details of physicality, touching, kissing.  The final track \\"Irvine\\" showcases Kelly's voice in a very intimate way, a moving song very much like a folk cabaret song, with acoustic guitar and subtle production.  It also has a quality of cosmic pathos, as she wearily ponders, \\"Are you there, are you watching me...will you stay, stay till the darkness leaves...Can you feel how cold I am, do you cry as I do?\\"  She sounds as \\"Torn\\" as Natalie Imbruglia was.  More than any other, this track shows how Kelly has matured in her writing and in her performance.  It is followed by a \\"hidden\\" track, similar in style but not as spiritual (not even close!).  Taken as a whole, this CD is a rainbow of artistic statement, and I'm happy to say, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Kelly Clarkson has arrived!\\"s, as she wearily ponders, \\"Are you there, are you watching me...will you stay, stay till the darkness leaves...Can you feel how cold I am, do you cry as I do?\\"  She sounds as \\"Torn\\" as Natalie Imbruglia was.  More than any other, this track shows how Kelly has matured in her writing and in her performance.  It is followed by a \\"hidden\\" track, similar in style but not as spiritual (not even close!).

B0000A98ZP|5.0|Possibly believed to be the most quintessential film, encompassing the 80's teen genre;  The Breakfast Club is a classic piece of what John Hughes did for the 80's.(Which is everything right, really.)<br /><br />A tale about five very different teens all from different clicks ( Andrew(Emilio Estevez) the jock, Brian(Anthony Michael Hall) the geek, Bender(Judd Nelson) the rebel, Claire(Molly Ringwald) the prep and Allison(Ally Sheedy) the outcast ) get stuck in the longest detention ever, with possibly the most idiotic educator in film to date.<br /><br />Brilliant performances by all, with so many quotes I could fill a notebook. Who doesn't love telling an authority figure to 'EAT MY SHORTS'!<br /><br />A classic theme song( Don't you forget about me, don't  don't don't DON'T! ) with a winning soundtrack to follow.<br /><br />I have no complaints, not my favorite John Hughes film(I prefer Sixteen Candles) but a classic none-the-less.<br /><br />Even if you weren't born yet in the 80's!

0385340567|1.0|This book is unbelievable.  I've read all of the Reacher novels.  Lee Child has completely lost his way.  First of all, the incredibly convoluted plot, the plodding pace, the ridiculousnous of the Town of Despair were challenges enough.  But when he completely changes the Reacher character to insert his opposition to the war in Iraq--way over the top.  Don't buy this book.
B00005JMX6|3.0|Matthew Kidman(Emile Hirsch) is a senior in high school, accepted by Georgetown, ready to embark on the life he's worked so hard for. That is until he realizes  he hasn't made any memories, taken many chances; he hasn't done anything crazy lately. That is until Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert) shows up next door, and Matthew gets a sneak peak of her undressing. (subtle, I know)<br /><br />Danielle teaches Matt how to do important things like ditch classes and sneak into and swim in his principle's pool. Together they are completely blissful, that is until Matt's friend Eli(Chris Marquette) shows him a pornographic film which seems to be starring Danielle.<br /><br />Of course the idea of his sweet girlfriend being a porn star is just unbearable, and when he lets the secret that he found out, there's a speed bump in their 'relationship'.(which is followed by a very awkward strip club scene, where Matthew gets a lap dance next to his dad's best friend)<br /><br />\\"I thought you liked to rock\\"<br /><br />Now comes Kelly(Timothy Olyphant) Danielle's sexy and gutter-mouthed friend from the 'adult industry', who's decided to be Matthew's mentor.(\\"to make sure everything is up to par.\\")<br /><br />This film isn't everything you'd expect to see from a film with such a focus on pornography, it's no more explicit then an American Pie film, but it does have some cute elements.<br /><br />Girl Next Door does some things right; Matthew's perverted friends, portrayal of how the non in-crowd high school kids feel, maybe the downside of being a porn star?<br /><br />Don't watch it with your kids, or at least wait till High School. (There are worse movies out there.)
B000008M1P|4.0|Robin Zander, in the Cheap Trick song \\"I Want You,\\" sings: \\"I'll search the world for a girl exactly you.\\"  Maybe I'm taking my music too seriously, but why would he want a girl exactly like the one who doesn't want him?  Yes, a broken heart hurts.  But you can't be a wimp, either.  That's why I like Vixen's point of view: \\"I'll find someone else who's nothing like you.\\"  Exactly!  When your man or woman has done you wrong, replace him or her with someone new, different, and better.  Vixen, four gals who could actually play, released a second album in 1990 and then disappeared from the mainstream, a victim of radio's move toward the new rock sounds coming out of Seattle.  \\"Edge of a Broken Heart\\" was written by Richard Marx and the Tubes' Fee Waybill, an unlikely songwriting duo if ever there was one.
B001BGTWXI|2.0|I have now listened to this cd 4 times and can't come to any other conclusion. It borders on unlistenable. It is very hard to hear commentaries on war and politics from guys wearing clown masks. Slipknot even performs a ballad on this cd. This isn't a case of a band growing but one struggling to find its way and really lacking in anything to be angry about. If you want a hard rocking cd buy Shinedown. Much better!

B00008438V|4.0|In that classic 80's fashion,  only John Hughes can create such a madcap, crazy film such as 'Weird Science'.<br /><br />Social outcasts Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt(IIan Mitchell-Smith) have a little too much time on their hands, with the lack of friends, hobbies, or even jobs. They spend most of their time concocting what they would do if the sun smiled on them and they could attend parties and date the girls they adore; And that's when the brilliant idea strikes!<br /><br />They must create their perfect woman! With the help of a computer,  a barbie doll, and a little magic (I've yet to test this method myself...) she appears, perfect as a picture, willing to do anything they ask of her!<br /><br />Lisa(Kelly LeBrock), although just created knows just what to do to help bring these boys into their popularity, and she doesn't take no for an answer!<br /><br />A classic, un-conventional, crazy film that reminds me of all the great things that were the 80's.<br /><br />It's no history channel documentary(obviously) but it's a whole lot of fun!
B00000JQFM|5.0|Shortly after Surfing with the Alien took off in early 1988, I heard Satriani say that the time was ripe for instrumental music, which seems to find popular acceptance every 20 years or so.  Looking back now it's easy to see he was right: Jazz-pop groups like Spyro Gyra, the Yellowjackets, Special EFX, and Fattburger sold more records than ever before; work by instrumentalists Jean-Luc Ponty and Andreas Vollenweider (inventors of the electric violin and harp, respectively) was heard next to work by jazz players like Pat Metheny and Joe Beck; and rock artists such as Steve Via, Eric Johnson, Neal Schon, and Stevie Ray Vaughan included incredible instrumental tracks on their current LPs.  (It's a shame that a lot of the instrumental music from this period is now heard only as bumper music for radio talk shows and news, weather, and sports programs.)  In spite of the unimaginative rhythm tracks that back most of his songs, Satriani's material remains impressive; he's one hell of a player.

031606792X|3.0|Breking Dawn is not my favorite in the series, but it deffintley is a good book.
0312427999|2.0|Naomi Klein is trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.   She tries to claim free market economic policies can only be imposed undemocratically and makes a not very compelling argument linking proponents of free market economics and physical torture.   The book is only convincing if one is largely ignorant of the real facts surrounding Klien's case study analyses.    The book is so full of holes, it is difficult to know where to begin.  It focuses on examples of economic policy decisions by various nations around the globe.  Since many of her examples suffer from the same flaws, I'll focus on one.   In Klein's discussion of the new post-apartheid government of South Africa in the mid-1990s, she lambastes it for not embarking on radical reforms she favors.   According to Klein, it should have repudiated debts, nationalized industries, given politicians the power to run the central bank and printed money to meet spending demands above what taxes or borrowing might have brought in, among other things.   The new government was dominated by the Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, which was hardly the right-wing entity but it did adopt a pragmatic program and a decade and half later it is one of the most prosperous countries in Africa, but Klein judges its record as \\"scandalous.\\"   Curiously, another country that borders South Africa did adopt many of her recommendations.  Yet the name \\"Zimbabwe\\" appears nowhere in the text of the book.   Perhaps it if had, Klein would have had to explain how hyperinflation and a collapsed economy are good things.  It isn't that Klien's analysis is always wrong, but rather the evidence used is so selective, it is clear that she arrives a conclusion and looks for evidence to support it and ignores anything that might contradict it, rather than determining a conclusion based on available evidence.    Klein simply doesn't care about or doesn't understand the trade offs in economic policy.  In the 1980s, governments in Latin America were hit by bouts of hyperinflation as governments printed money to finance spending.   She admits the hyperinflation is a bad thing but acts as though it occurred spontaneously in a vacuum and then attacks the successful measures that were taken to tame it.   As an alternative of the actual strategy to combat hyperinflation in the case of Bolivia, she offers a vapid alternative that seeks \\"mobilize support and share the burden through a negotiated process involving key stakeholders.\\"   Well, that sounds well and good, but she offers no examples of that approach taming hyperinflation.  What is more, the mobilization and strikes in opposition to the anti-inflation polices suggest some stakeholders weren't exactly willing to cooperate, thus, what she really offers is no alternative at all.   Which gets to one of central weaknesses in Klein's argument, trade offs can't just be wished away.   State-owned industries may be fine and dandy but if the government is going bankrupt trying to keep them afloat, refusing to alter the status quo isn't an option.   Klein has an almost religious faith in the state to wave a wand and do good (which is not to say it does do no good, just it isn't as capable a Klein would have her readers believe).    Rather than acknowledging real world choices, Klein deems every rollback of state power is some hidden corporate conspiracy.    A more realistic look at developmental policies is provided \\"In Defense of Globalization\\" by Jagdish Bhagwati.
B000OVLBGC|2.0|Selective sub-titles drove me mad. I wanted to enjoy this after all the hype but afraid it just didn't do it for me. I have no criticism of the acting but there was a huge communication gap and it merely drove me to sleep.
B0017VG66I|4.0|The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance<br />*This one was a pretty good, mostly engaging story.  It had some great acting by Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, and Lee Marvin.  Photography is great (even if it is black and white), and the DVD's video/sound quality do it good justice.  Unfortunately, it has no special features to speak of.  It is in widescreen (enhanced for 16:9 TVs), English subtitles, and your choice of Dolby Digital, 5.0 surround, or mono.<br /><br />Shane<br />*Although it can be seen as dull or dumb, it is really a good classic with very excellent photography, a simple story, and phenomenal characters.  The DVD has good video quality in general; it's not very sharp, but the colors are brilliant.  The sound is not bad.  It has only a commentary as a special feature.  It's only in fullscreen.  It has English subtitles, and your choice of Dolby Digital, 2.0 surround, or French mono.<br /><br />Both films are classy and good.  Some modern audiences may find them outdated, but most western fans should enjoy them (and it's not a bad price either).
0452289963|5.0|Eckart Tolle is a great teacher! He puts into words what many teachers have tought before, but the way he explains it is very well suited to make rational Western people get a glimpse of Reality beyond thinking.
0792844890|4.0|What a great parody on a lot of different movies.  I enjoy watching it just to get a good laugh.  It's simply hilarious, but it's not for those who take Star Wars religiously.  They'll undoubtedly be offended at it.  I'd cut out a couple of obscene scenes, but other than that, it's pretty clean and simply funny.
031606792X|1.0|I own and have read all the books in the Twilight saga and have this to say: Let's just pretend it was a trilogy. Out of all the books, Breaking Dawn disappointed me with how Stephenie Meyer dealt with her characters.    Twilight was an amazing book thats descriptions made people believe they were there. I thought what Meyer did was very very good, and also hard to duplicate. New Moon proved that hypothesis for me, as I was happy that she gave other characters time to grow a little bit before getting Edward back in the story. Eclipse was the one book I seriously considered burning as I thought the love triangle idea was so overdone and was sad Meyer used it in such a lame way.    I had low expectations for Breaking Dawn to begin with and it was more then I imagined it to be, but it was nowhere near my opinion for Twilight. All the pre-conceived notions that Meyer let us make were blown out of the water. It was an utter crackfic.    I didn't like it but I don't hate it. I also do NOT recommend this book to ANYONE.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Finally available in the anamorphic widescreen format in sparkling Blu Ray!!! The picture is crisp and smooth almost 3-D!!! The same goes for the sound,simply amazing!!! It looks and sounds even better than the 2001 remastered DVD which looked incredible as well,but this one is even better in every way!!! There are a 3 new featurettes and the classic Making Of The Shining documentary(this was included on the original DVD's as well!) that was direced by Kubricks daughter Vivian(there is also a optional audio commentary by her as well,actually her commentary is much more enjoyable than the new feature commentary included with this new release!!!) The classic \\"blood from the elevator\\" teaser trailer is also included!!! A very recomended Blu Ray Disc!!! A Clockwork Orange is also another great Blu-Ray from Warner!!!,Blu's of 2001 and Full Metal Jacket are next on my wish list!!! Lets hope that other Kubrick classics Dr. Strangelove,Paths Of Glory,The Killing,Sparticus(it did get a HD DVD release no Blu,that was a real bummer!),etc will get the royal \\"Blu\\" treatment!!! A+
B001BR5F4C|3.0|This may seem a trivial complaint to some, but I for one won't be rushing out to buy this simply because it's lacking in what should be standard audio for this release. Granted, it will be nice to see the Kill Bill saga (such as it is until TWBA is released) in 1080P, but as an audiophile I'm disappointed to see PCM 5.1 as included with this release. The SD releases of Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 included DTS tracks, and I would have liked to have seen some DTS-HDMA offered for the BD releases of Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2. A poor choice on Disney's part, IMO.

B0019MLVEM|3.0|This Irish Trio have certainly taken flight with this No. 1 album in the UK and Ireland. The hit singles 'We Cry' and 'The Man Who Can't Be Moved' are certainly well-crafted pop ditties and if you like these, you will like the album. Nice melodies, nice production and that for me is the problem. Everything is too nice and clean. A more 'live' feel to the rockier numbers like 'Talk You Down' might have given the album more 'edge'. Nevertheless, a fine debut and suggests that there is more to come from this talented trio.

015206396X|3.0|Kristin Cashore's \\"Graceling\\" is a novel about Katsa, a woman with what's known as a Grace -- a special talent, which is announced to the world by her eyes (which are two different colors; one's blue, one's green).  Katsa is talented at killing, and this has set her apart from a very young age.    Because of how Katsa's been set apart, she's much more cynical than most young women (she's approximately eighteen) and doesn't believe a marriage or family is for her.  She hasn't had a romance and wants none; all she wants is to be treated fairly, and to be left alone.    Her uncle is the King, and he uses her shamelessly to intimidate others; he uses her like a brutal thug.  However, she's already found a way to strike back at him by forming an underground movement known as \\"the Council,\\" which does their best to mitigate truly bad treatment in their kingdom.    Into all this comes a noble from another kingdom, Po.  He's looking for his grandfather, who was one of those Katsa's Council recently helped.    Of course, that's not all that happens; along the way, Katsa learns what it is to be a woman and have a full-fledged love affair without sacrificing any of her beliefs, while various action plots unfold around the two of them.    To my mind, the romance was good but somewhat truncated, and the writing was fast-paced and enjoyable.  I think this is a good novel for teens of about age twelve and up, though there is a lot of violence; I also think Katsa's coming of age story is meaningful and valuable.    So with all that being said, you might be wondering why I only gave this novel three stars.      Here goes: I liked this novel, and intend to read the sequel, but I just felt it should be more than it was.  The action was fast-paced, but disposable; I wanted to know a lot more about Po than I got, and a whole lot more about the minor characters Katsa interacts with than I got, also.    At any rate, I'd recommend this novel, but I think it's better for those between the ages of twelve and sixteen who haven't read a lot of fantasy but enjoy a lot of action-adventure; there just isn't enough for most adult readers, I'm afraid, as anything other than a quick beach read.  And really, Ms. Cashore has a lot more potential than that.    Three stars, recommended for ages twelve to sixteen.
B00166QJRU|4.0|I second most reviews about this famous and important live recording by Bowie & Spiders.    Just a note: Some Bowie talking between songs are cut out, compared to the Golden Years release some years ago. Compare for instance the intro to \\"Andy Warhol\\".
0385340990|5.0|\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a rare gem of a book; in its epistolary (letters written back and forth) fashion, it illuminates a vanished time (World War II under the Germans) in a place very few people know much about, the Channel Islands off of the United Kingdom proper.<br /><br />This novel has it all -- the historical research is spot on, the characters are interesting and well-developed, and I truly believed in both the \\"present\\" of this novel (1946) and the recent \\"past\\" occupation under the Germans.<br /><br />I firmly recommend this novel and will be looking for whatever Mary Ann Shaffer and her writing partner author next.<br /><br />Five stars, highly recommended.
0930289234|5.0|Whats ironic about re-reading this book now is the fact that the world is where it is. Poverty, homelessness, lack of tolerance, invasions, corrupt people and government, the human heart and our need to be loved and understood. Of course these aren't new things, BUT Watchmen does it in such a brilliant way. Can't wait to see if the movie does it justice.
B00005JKGO|1.0|I wasted three hours of my birthday watching this film, having read time and again what a masterpiece it was. Well, it isn't.    How was I supposed to relate to any of the self-absorbed and superficial characters? If this is supposed to be a social polemic or some kind of lifestyle study, I'm damned if I could figure out what mattered in any scene. Jesus, I was so bored. When Anita Ekberg put the cat on her head near the Trevi fountain, I hoped that the feline would embed its claws in her peroxide. That might have injected some meaning into the film    Don't waste your time or money. This is utterly tedious tosh.
0765360969|5.0|Great Novel. Brandon Sanderson is a great choice for the author to finish Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series. Mistborn: The Final Empire is a well written and takes place in a well thought out world. The magic system that Brandon created for this wold is one of the best and most unique that I've seen. The sequel novel, Mistborn: The Well of Ascension is just as good, if not better.

B001BKXUOQ|1.0|This is bad.  It sounds like part of the album is slipknot and the other half is pussy sour.  Even mid way through some of the decent songs taylor starts wimping out with his vomit indicing crap sour style ballading. WTF.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Excellent story of time travel, Einstein theory apply to this film, remarcable a nice challenge audio and video super also the drama like allways stargate works.
B0015519VS|4.0|The first thing I wanna say is that this album is not Confessions. Confessions was a classic and no artist makes a classic record every time out, as a matter of fact I don't know any that make a classic back to back but with that being said, Here I Stand is classic Usher.<br /><br />The thing people should have figured out about Usher is that most of the times his albums reflect whats going on in his life at the time. With My Way, it was him coming into his own and trying to become a man, with Confessions it was him going through a lot of turmoil and the ups and downs that come with being young, rich, and a sex symbol. Now with his new album, Here I Stand, you hear a much more grown up Usher dealing with all the things that come with being grown up, having kids, a wife, and major responsibility.<br /><br />With that being said this album is NOT as good as Confessions but it is an excellent album. The first great song is a song called \\"Trading Places\\", this is a hot track that has Usher and his lady switching roles where she is doing all the things that normally the man would do like picking him up and taking him to dinner. The song is just a real smooth. Before this you will have heard \\" Love In This Club\\" and after \\"Moving Mountains\\". The next track that I really like is \\"Something Special\\", a song about the great connection that two people have. The song has a very sixties kind of sound to it, something very different and as soon as you hear it you are hooked.<br /><br />A few tracks later you hear \\"Best Thing f/ Jay Z\\", with him and Jigga basically talking about the best things or should I say people in their lives. This is the song they recorded while in the studio in Atlanta that is alluded to in this video on YouTube but you never hear the song. I mean Usher and Hov on a track man I aint even gotta say no more.<br /><br />Now there is one very Confessions like track on the album that does make you think, hey maybe Usher will be making a Confessions 2 and its called \\"What's A Man To Do\\", on this track Usher basically asks the question of what happens when you fall in love with two people but you know that you have to make a choice but you just don't know how. I am definitely sure that a lot of people will relate to that one, especially the fellas.<br /><br />The album is rounded out with the \\"Love In This Club Remix f/Beyonce and Lil Weezy\\" and the title track \\"Here I Stand\\". Compared to most everything that is out right now, Ush is killing them. I gotta give \\"Here I Stand\\" 4.0 out of 5 stars and that is just because after Confessions he has set the bar so high. In listening to this album you can see that Usher is finally coming into his own both personally and professionally and learning that there are consequences for your actions. Definitely go out and grab this joint.his track Usher basically asks the question of what happens when you fall in love with two people but you know that you have to make a choice but you just don't know how.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|It is just a great movie.  Love it, Love it, Love it.  It has an ending that Hollywood would NEVER, NEVER, EVER touch.  It is just so unique.  Sorry I'm being so vague, I just don't want to spoil it.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Iron Man The best reviewed film of the year. the Visual Effects are amazing, Robert Downey Jr. is very good as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the cast is pretty wonderful in this first film financed by Marvel Studios. The movie made over $317 million at the box office as the second biggest hit of 2008 way behind The Dark Knight at $507 million and counting as also the year's biggest hit.

6305078564|4.0|You can always trust BBC in excellence in costume drama, both the 1975 and this version are the most authentic adoptation I've seen.    What I particularly liked about this production is that unlike the 1975 production, the '96 Mr. Darcy is no longer just Elizabeth's beau - but a character with substance, commending its own place in the story.    ......and to the skeptical men readin this review, I AM preferring to the famous Colin-Firth-walks-out-of-the-lake scene..............      Before Elizabeth's visit to Pemberly, Mr. Darcy was just one of her suitors, created to give Austin a chance to show off Elizabeth's quick wit and acid tonge.  Pemberly is the real entrance for Mr. Darcy.  From here on, the author began to concentrate on him, giving him life, voice and presence.    So what's wrong with emphasising this grand entrance by making a bit of splash?!  ^_^
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|this movie is fantastic. it truly touches the heart and is particularly appealing to music aficionados. it is a great film to watch with your boyfriend or girlfriend.
031606792X|4.0|Meyers fourth and final book of Bella and Edward's love story. She promised it would be a happy ending and would wrap up the story line with a big red bow. I thought she delivered, however, this book did seem a wee bit risque for YA.
031606792X|2.0|Okay, if you are a Twilight fan you should read this. However, I think that she completely ruined the series. It wasn't completely terrible, but the book just doesn't fit in with the rest of the series. She spent the last three books on Bella and Edwards cute teenage romance and then suddenly this book is supposed to end the series and what do you read??? Well I won't spoil it for you but it just wasn't that great. I'm still a big fan of Stephenie Meyer and the Twilight Saga but she really screwed up with this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you spent any time online at all, you've probably come across references to Firefly, or even if you didn't know it, someone was quoting the show to you in conversation.    I had avoided the show completely the few times I would see it on television or when Serenity, the movie was released I knew I had to watch the entire series before checking it out.  When I saw the price for the complete series on DVD was less than $25 on Amazon I knew it was time to check it out.    Honestly, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The combination of western and scifi works better than I'd even expected and this show has pulled in both myself and my wife who doesn't know Star Trek from Star Wars.    Absolutely worth the purchase, and at the price at Amazon can't be beat! Thumbs up!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This superbly directed film by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck which clearly demonstrates the abominable lack of freedom which was the stark reality in 1984 behind the 'former' Moscow controlled, communist, Iron Curtain satellite of East Germany.<br /><br />The very accomplished, but regretfully now deceased actor Ulrich M&uuml;he , himself born in the former East Germany, rivetingly plays the role of Gerd Wiesler, a East German secret police (Stasi) captain, eavesdropping on a celebrated playwright Georg Dreyman played by the wonderful actor Sebastian Koch, of 'Black Book' fame, and his live in girlfriend, portraying an accomplished GDR actress Christa-Maria Sieland, expertly delivered by Martina Gedeck.<br /><br />This movie should not be missed!<br /><br />The East Germany in this movie was where the current dictator of Russian was previously stationed as a KGB colonel, and now this neo-Soviet butcher is attempting to forcible reestablish his precious Soviet totalitarian empire by initially invading the small independent Caucasus country of Georgia. Which nation is next on the Kremlin's invasion list?<br /><br />If Western leadership does not quickly awaken from its self-inflicted slumber and confront Moscow & their cohorts, many of us in the Free World shall be languishing in the very nightmare depicted in 'The Lives of Others', except this time the 'others' shall be 'us'!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I was a K-12 student with good attendance, who never fell asleep in class.  Nevertheless, \\"John Adams\\" was a revelation for me.  It's not just that it contains information about one person's life and career.  The little known facts and stories around our 2nd president, as well as many of his contemporaries [Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Hancock, etc] bring the birth of our nation to life.  \\"John Adams\\" also debunks some of our nations 'cherry tree type' myths, while bringing the realities of real sacrifice for the sake of freedom to the screen.  I recommend \\"John Adams\\" to teachers for their classrooms, to history buffs, and to anyone who wants to watch an honest-to-gosh 'reality show.'
B000002I25|4.0|4 1/2    Undoubtedly one of the all-time classic rock debut albums, The Doors '67 self-titled release set the bar for their own specially formulated psychedelic blues awfully high, a level they were allowed to reach again, though arguably never surpass. Although I would be lying if I said all the songs hit me like the greatest ones do (maybe it would have also benefited from a different sequence) and also I'd be lying if I said I have not drained most of the emotional truths from their best work long ago, but after all the subjectivity, what is really not to like here? Rare is the album where each song can stand as a microcosm of it's brilliance- be it the longer, literate jams I personally gravitated towards or the more traditional verse-chorus keyboard driven bluesy numbers which in itself stood far apart from comparative kind. Credit Manzarek and company for ushering in a radio-ready rock synergy that has stood the tests of time like such few bands have.
B0017XOF5A|3.0|The movie was good plus different, but the blu-ray quality was no better than an upconverted dvd at best sees ya!
B000FVQYYK|3.0|3 1/2    Ever-slightly, the fab 3 begin what hopefully will not be a permanent creative decent. They excel at putting together dynamic albums showcasing their bombastic brilliance, pop-rock anguish, and heavy-hitting melodics with little throw-away, and their latest was no exception. Continuing to tweak a formula upward mainly from Absolution however, presents for the first time the band blatantly ripping themselves off. Although I initially thought it was the dance-floor disco vibe which fattened the disc up, they actually pull that off rather well, like anything the band really strives for. Instead, it is the subtle extinguishing of creativity which resides throughout the disc that brings it slightly down.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you haven't seen Firefly, you NEED to get this DVD box set.   It is the best series I have ever seen.  I have introduced it to all my friends, and many coworkers of all ages, and I have not found a single person who hasn't liked it.  A must have.    Rob O
031606792X|5.0|Going into this one, I couldn't imagine how it could end on any kind of a good note.  No matter which way it went, I thought our heros would take an unacceptable loss.  I guess that's why I'm not a writer!  Every chapter was a surprise, and it's amazing how it works out. Stephanie brought us down to the edge of the chasm of loss, and then gave us the fruits of sacrafice.  This is the capstone of the series.  Very Well Done.

0307346617|5.0|To be cliche this book is thought provoking.  I'll admit zombies are a far cry from reality, but then again you never know.  But the subject matter does bring into sharp clarity the fact that we as a civilization are too complacent, slow to act and to reliant on the poor information and sensationalist reporting of the local and national media.  But these are just a few of the examples that will make you think about what is not quite right with out society and world after reading this book.    The subject matter is as I said far fetched but extremely well thought out and Max Brooks really must had did his research on the subjects that he deals with in each little \\"interview.\\"  The format of the book is fantastic and it's a great zombie universe he's created.  I'd love to see more stories come out of this universe.    I whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone that is a zombie fanatic or anyone looking for a different and thought provoking read.  I won't be putting a zombie survival pack in my trunk anytime soon, but I will start to be more prepared for the other more realistic disasters that may come our way.
0385340990|4.0|I thought this book had an odd title but was attracted to it because of Guernsey Island. I have a cousin who was a child in Jersey ( a another island in the same group) who was living there with her father and brother during WW2. The Germans took their island over too and life was very hard. I remembered the talk about it in our family. I thought the book would be interesting and it was!<br />Told through the writing of letters it really spun a fascinating connection of events that all took place when the Germans were occupying Guernsey. The interrelationships that happened then gave a wonderful picture of people at their best dealing with the awful life that faced them on a daily basis. I was fascinated seeing these friendships grow and include outsiders. What a wonderful group of friends! The story draws the reader into the story and it becomes a real page turner at the end. I loved it!
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Those of you who like metal but are not familiar with Amon Amarth, do yourself a favor, give this album a chance.  They're hardcore, heavy, and intense.  A great find.  My favorite track from this album is track 3.  Heavy metal perfection.  But all the tracks are good.  If they had a separate genre for warrior metal, this would be included.  The \\"wall of sound\\" is present here.  There is a very \\"full\\" feel to the music, and in places, it's epic city.  All in all a very strong release that is worth your time.
031606792X|5.0|I have heard a lot of bad reviews for the latest book in this series. I, however, find it was the best of them all.<br /><br />I think the problem with people is that by the end of book three, most people already have it planned in their head how they want it to end. I feel this is the wrong tactic when anticipating for the fourth. Also, because most people started the series before the fourth book came out, I think people got this false sense of input, like their opinion was going to matter on how this last book came out.<br /><br />I believe I enjoyed this book so much because I never tried to guess how it was going to end, mostly becuase Meyers said this was the ending it was always meant to have (she knew how it was going to end since the beginning of the book's idea back in 2001). So I knew that anticipating the end is totally the wrong way to go about it and by the end of book three you just have to let the story of book four come to you like Bella's experiencing it of the first time.<br /><br />Now, about the book, I think it's the best ending because it ties up everything. Everything I was ever wondering about got answered. I love where she took Bella's character and how all the tension you get in book three and beginning in book two gets completely eased away since everything seems to fit and feels like it was always meant to be.<br /><br />I think Meyers is a very good read and for people of all ages even though the storyline is from a teenager's perspective; her style of writing keeps you hooked.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Metal is one of my favorite types of music and I have amassed a lot of it.  One of my favorite bands from the genre is Pantera.  I see some Pantera in Lamb of God.  That is a good thing.  Have no fear, they are not a copycat band.  After reading a lot about Lamb of God and listening to song samples, I decided on getting this album and Sacrament.  Really good bada** guitar riffs and vocals.  Both are excellent and worthwhile titles, and if you like Metal, you should probably add them your collection.  Enough said.

0151013047|4.0|Interesting view of the U.S. through a fictitious Pakistani's eyes as his spirit deteriorates due to the political and personal events he endures. Periodically, somewhat affected voice due to the style of narration, but a nonetheless quick and compelling read.    I think some reviewer have conflated the narrator's voice with the author's. I doubt very much that Mohsin Hamid agrees with every word he placed in the mouth his narrator's mouth. (This should go without saying, but we live in very literal and very divisive times.) Rather he was showing how the narrator's character change was precipitated by a number events (again both political and personal), which he weathered. In other words, the narrator's anger towards the United States was inextricably wound up with his pain at losing his lover. He was unable to tease these apart and it lead him into a different, more volatile state of mind. The fact that Hamid can demonstrate this unraveling makes him a sensitive writer and a keen observer of the human condition, not an advocate for terrorism. That said, the book does include some pointed and relevant criticism of the U.S. I just think it's an oversimplification to assume Hamid's giving the narrator's point of view a big thumbs up. It's a richer, more sophisticated narrative than that.
0553288105|5.0|It is blatantly obvious from reading other reviews here that being merely a reader, and being a writer one's self can make a difference in how one experiences a piece of writing. When I was but 12 years old, this book gave me my first real understanding of allegory. Asimov wasn't talking about exploring space and other dimensions- just as with \\"I,Robot,\\" he speaks here loudly of the human condition. I will say no more about the story, save that what is on the surface is not the meaning of the story.<br /><br />Perhaps the reader who comes to science fiction looking for mere entertainment should look for less intense writers to read....or go watch Babylon 5 again.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|How can you beat Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty and George Harrison all together as 1 group, each writing, playing and singing on every song?!!!.  This is the ultimate \\"super-group\\" and every song is owned distinctly by each artist either by vocals, lyrics, style or all of the above. I imagine this is what music will sound like in heaven.  This is not a new find for me, I have loved this work since it 1st came out in the late 80's but the digital remastering and the added songs are a bonus.  I think I will go listen to it again now, it always makes me smile and thankful to have the gift of music in my life.
0312965788|5.0|\\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" is the first of four books in this brilliantly written series.  The companion volumes are \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\", \\"All Things Wise and Wonderful\\", and \\"The Lord God Made Them All\\".  James Herriot (whose actual name was James Alfred Wight) began his veterinary practice in 1939 and continued serving his community for half a century.  Each story that he penned carries the reader deep into the Yorkshire countryside of England and into the lives of many colorful and entertaining characters, both people and animals.  You will be captured by the tales and find yourself laughing out loud at the antics of man and beast, relecting on the beauty of the close friendship of a pet, and weeping over losses that we all suffer when one of our animal friends pass.  These are books to read again and again because they show the depth of compassion that one man had for God's creatures through a life lived in simplicity, and yet his writings are a profound example to all who love and care for animals.
0061537934|5.0|I picked up this book without large hopes.  I read lots of books about dogs, but while I enjoy them, they are usually just light entertainment.  This book, however, still has me tearing up an hour after I finished it.  It is very touching in that it takes you through every emotion, sadness to happiness, anger to laughter.  It was very convincing that it was narrated by a dog, Enzo.  I fell in love with the main characters and think it would make a great movie.  I highly recommend this book.
B0000BWVCM|2.0|This movie is just as lame as the first one. Has hardly anything to do with the X Men and a whole lot to do with Wolverine. They should have just called this movie Wolverine 2, because that is all this movie is about. People that think these movies are good know nothing about the comics.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|This album was recorded in the 60s. So, what are the reasons for people who didn't hear it to buy it in the 21st century? There are two. First one-it is very good. If you like music of good quality, then you will be pleased. The lyrics and the sound are both top-notch. Second reason-even though the album is 40 years old, it is still very original, no one ever made anything like this still-a very unique thing!
B000005Z0E|5.0|This Album is a classic! It's old school, what more do u need? \\"Trapped\\" is not just a song, it's a story on how Police treated 2Pac And others in his neighborhood. The Whole album is a story, it isn't just music. I Highly recommend buying this album. it's worth the money!!
0743496728|5.0|Peter Houghton would hardly be considered a typical seventeen year old teenager. Because one morning, he loaded his backpack with four guns, went to school and killed nine students and a teacher. Jodi Picoult's enthralling best-selling novel \\"Nineteen Minutes\\", titled to portray the astonishingly brief period of time that Houghton took to complete his brutal spree, examines the genesis of that event and the people affected by it from every conceivable perspective - families, victims, survivors, witnesses, parents, friends, police and the law.<br /><br />Picoult expertly examines a myriad of issues - teenage angst; \\"in\\" crowds; drug use; bullying; teen sexuality; peer pressure; privacy; parenting - and creates a gripping fictionalized version of a tragic event that no thinking reader could possibly put down. At the end of this astonishing tale, many readers will actually feel sympathy for a convicted mass murderer. Certainly many also will not but, at the end of the day, all readers will realize that Picoult's amazing ability to present an issue from a wide variety of perspectives without herself being judgmental will at least give readers an understanding as to how such a horrific tragedy might come to pass!<br /><br />Many potential readers may have heard the criticism of the endings of Picoult's novels. Somewhat out of character and different in flavour than the entire novel that led up to it, the ending for \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is certainly not exempt from this criticism. While it is somewhat Hollywood in nature, it provides a twist ending that will snap the reader's eyelids wide open. Maybe it was a little too pat, maybe it wasn't ... but at the very least, it will provide a whole new layer of provocative thought that will keep the reader puzzling over the issues that Picoult raises for a long, long time after the last page closes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weiss

This book has everything and the sequel is even better.<br /> Also, when you're done with it you could probably give it to your little brother or sister---in fact i think you should, because if Harry Potter and Vin got in a fight guess who'd totally get their @ss kicked?
032147404X|4.0|If you want a completely non-technical approach to shooting better (great?) shots in various common senarios (eg outdoors, weddings, flowers, sports, etc), this is exactly the right book for  you. It's a short read, but you'll have a hard time remembering all the valuable things that are in this book!    One of the reviews mentions here mention how the author uses some weird humor in chapter intros, but don't let that distract you. The author admits he wrote most of those intros while smashed, and I believe it. If you want, just ignore the chapter infos. The tips are definitely very valuable.    As the cover suggests, this is mainly for people with dslr's, so you're not going to get the most out of this book unless you already have one (or are planning to purchase a new one). Those with lesser cameras will still benefit from this book, but as this book makes clear, (digital) photography can be a very expensive hobby.

0446401307|3.0|\\"The Overlook\\" is Michael Connelly's eighteenth novel, his thirteenth to feature Harry Bosch and was first published in 2007. Orphaned at twelve when his mother was murdered, Bosch's teenage years were spent in and out of orphanages. He enlisted in the army and served in Viet-Nam, before returning home and joining the police force. Once a member of the LAPD's elite RHD (Robbery-Homicide Division), he was demoted to the Hollywood Division after an Internal Affairs investigation. After more than ten years in Hollywood, he was notified of a 'promotion' back to RHD - however, he chose to quit the force instead. He left the LAPD with an armful of Hollywood 's open-unsolved cases, tool out a private investigator's licence and continued to 'speak for the dead'. However, a couple of persuasive phone calls from a former partner from his Hollywood days saw him return to the LAPD - working out of the Open Unsolved Unit, at the Parker Centre, rather than at Hollywood . Any cases that would have a high media prolife or would appear to be a time consuming, long running case get passed over to Homicide Special by the local police departments. \\"The Overlook\\" opens with Harry picking up a case from the Hollywood Department - Harry's old stomping ground.     Stanley Kent's body found was found close to Mulholland Dam, overlooking a house that once belonged to Madonna. He seems to have been the victim of an assassination - forced into a kneeling position, he was shot twice in the back of the head. However, Harry has barely arrived at the scene before the FBI also turn up - in the form of Rachel Walling. (Bosch isn't too upset - he's worked with her a couple of times before, and has also enjoyed her company on a more intimate setting). While Bosch has only been able to gather the most basic information about the victim, Walling knows a great deal more about him. Kent worked as a medical physicist, and had access to nearly every hospital in LA County - and all the radioactive material used in the treatment of cancer. Naturally, now that he's turned up executed, the automatic assumption is terrorism...    By Michael Connelly's standards, \\"The Overlook\\" was hugely disappointing. It first appeared in serial form in the New York Times, which may account for something - but it almost seemed that Connelly was trying to write the book equivalent of a Greatest Hits' package. The whole terrorism thing was ticked off with \\"Lost Light\\", while the \\"Echo Park\\" case was talked about far too often. Kent's body was found at Mulholland Dam - where Bosch's first case in \\"The Black Echo\\" began - while the opening is a sanitised version of a classic Bosch pose. (In the early books, Bosch suffered from insomnia and would have spent much of the night smoking, drinking and listening to jazz. Nowadays, he's quit smoking and there's no mention of any beer). There was an entirely pointless meeting with Jerry Edgar - one of Bosch's ex-partners at Hollywood - and several phone calls to Kiz Ryder, his other ex-partner. Even the 'swimming pool incident' - when Bosch heard of his mother's death - is wheeled out again for no real reason. Rachel Walling's appearance really stank of laziness : she and Bosch only met for the first time \\"The Narrows\\", but they have now teamed up so often Connelly should just have her transferred to LAPD. (The LAPD could do with her - even though that Bosch has no trouble in either reading or bluffing her, and that her interrogation technique is clearly on the wrong side of average. Bosch's actual partner - Ignacio \\"Iggy\\" Ferras - appears to be little more than an errand boy). Given the suspicions of terrorism, I'd have thought Bosch should have been kicked off the case the second Walling arrived. However, it's possible there wasn't time for the paperwork to come through - given that the whole thing was solved in only twelve hours. One of the book's genuinely 'new' characters - Captain Don Hadley - really made me shudder. I can only hope this guy wasjust a very bad caricature and that there aren't really cops like him in senior positions. Overall, hugely disappointing for a Bosch book - I can only hope the next instalment isn't serialised and that Connelly puts more effort into it.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Not even realizing the movie was true story I really enjoyed this flick, and when I found out it was a true story it made it even better.<br />One of Al Pacinos best movies !!
0930289234|5.0|This isn't really a review (what more can be said?), but more about how I became acquainted with this masterpiece.<br /><br />I've never been big on comics, but recently I began reading manga (already an anime fan). I discovered Watchmen on a forum that was questioning whether this or a manga called 20th Century Boys is better, which is a tough choice, but I choose Watchmen because of the symbolism, metafiction, and because Dr. Manhattan is a god. Anyway, I decided to buy it a week later, and then after three days or so of reading (decided to spread the 12 chapters over 12 days. It was very hard to do.) I discovered that a film version is basically done and coming out next year. My God! I'm glad that I was able to read this before the movie's release, and I respect the long-lasting fans that have been much more patient in waiting for the project to come to fruition.
0684830515|4.0|This is an old classic. The re-read was worth it. I noted interesting parallels with the author's (Hemingway's) real life. The descriptions of the fishing expedition in the Pyrenees was particularly good. It's still a worthwhile read, but that is the definition of a classic.

B000K15VSA|5.0|If you love Blade Runner like I do then this is a must have.  I waited outside the store the day it was coming in, bought it, and no disappointment here.  It's everything you can ask for from a box set (should I call it that?) and more.  I love it and it is worth every penny I paid.  If you are on the fence about purchasing this I say buy, buy, buy.
0312330871|5.0|Arguably Christie's masterpiece, and certainly her darkest tale, And Then There Were None takes you to Indian Island where 10 strangers have been lured to face the unspeakable crime each has committed and gotten away with....until now. As each of the 10 die one by one, the other realize the net is closing in and there's no way to discover their unknown avenger or escape his or her unerring execution of justice. Brilliantly written, you can feel the atmosphere of suspicion and dread growing with each death and a twist ending that only the most astute will see coming.
031606792X|5.0|I read all four books in this series in a week and read Breaking Dawn in two days. It was absolutely and wonderfully romantic and kept me on the edge of my seat during the entire read. Stephenie Meyer told a wonderful, satisfying story of how love creates and impacts our future and is always complicated. I won't give away any spoilers and I will keep it simple: this story absolutely takes you away and pulls you into every complicated but gratifying turn and twist. It is the stuff of classics. Congratulations, Stephenie on a wonderfully writtten saga - I loved every minute of it and mourned when it was all over. In a few weeks, I repeat it all over again.
B0007KVM32|5.0|This Italian-Russian film is an excellent masterpiece. The story, the picture and the music are beautiful but the performance made by S. Loren and M. Mastroianni are remarkable. It would be much better if the CD is released in NTSC system.
B0017XFBMG|5.0|So much to hear, The Pogues put together one very worthwhile box set. Many b-sides, out-takes, and rarities, that leave even the biggest fan wondering \\"why have i not heard this before?\\" Good sound quality on majority of tracks, some demo tracks are not of highest quality, but it's fine, because it's the Pogues!<br />5 disc set, in beautiful packaging with outstanding written history, and interesting facts about each recording.<br />Personal favorites include: the \\"nice\\" version of Boys From The County Hell, Haunted [lead vocals by Cait O'Riordan], Maggie Mae, and a slew of great instrumentals.<br />If Shane could stay on his feet, he too would dance all night long.
B0013NS6EU|3.0|I struggled with this book.  It has some great ideas, but it reminds me of the last hour of the film version of The Return of the King or the entire King Kong by Peter Jackson.  Where's the editor?    The good and the bad:  1. He gives concrete examples of how to use visual thinking and gives you tools to figure out what to do.  2.It's a 300 pages book talking about visual thinking.  Okay. I read it on the Kindle, so I don't know really how big the pictures are.  But the point remains - it is overly long.  A full third of the book is taken up by a case study on selling B2B software.    3. Which, by the way, made no sense whatsoever.  He starts by saying, \\"Let's map our customers.\\"  And then proceeds to put them all in a single company.  It's quite possibly the worst case of profiling a customer base I've seen.    All in all, it's a good book.  But focus on the SKIMMING, not the reading.

B0015DWLD0|5.0|A Man-Booker Prize nominated book by Aravind Adiga.  They remain slaves because they can't see what is beautiful in this world  -The Poet Iqbal, as quoted by Balram, the protagonist of the book.    To read this book is to leave with the impression that India is a mess.  It is 99% of the 2nd most populous nation on Earth being kept in chains of servitude by themselves.  Adiga has written a compelling first novel on the liberation of a man born to be a servant of the rich.  It describes the way that Balram, a boy born in the Darkness - small villages away from the coast, is sold into indentured servitude to pay off the dowry debts associated with marrying of a daughter.  Balram, told by a school inspector that he is a White Tiger - something born once a generation, rises through sheer ambition to become a driver for a local landlord.  Through his cunning, he is brought to Delhi to serve as driver for Ashok - the son of the landlord.    As a driver, he begins to understand the relation between master and servant in his culture.  The servant is nothing more than a throwaway item to be used and discarded.    A pivotal moment of the book occurs when Ashok's wife demands to drive after a wild night out with her husband.  On the way home, she hits and kills a young child.  No one saw the accident.  Yet, to be safe, the landlord's family arranges for Balram to confess to the hit-and-run accident.  It is a source of pride for Balram's family - that he would do this for the master!     From this point, Balram begins a series of rebellions leading up to the murder of Ashok and the theft of millions of rupees.  This is not a vicious murder of a hated landlord.  Rather, it is an amoral killing of the system that Ashok represents.  It is the death of the old system.  Yet the old system did not know it was dying.  Balram runs away to the southern coast - to Bangalore, the tech capital - and sets up a taxi system for tech companies with the help of bribery of the police.  When one of his drivers accidentally kills someone, he uses his connections in the police to sweep it under the rug. He protects his driver. Yet he insists on going to the family's house, paying his respects, giving them thousands of rupees, and hiring the killed boy's brother. The system is not dead, yet Adiga suggests it is changing as the few servants who free themselves change it from within.    This is not what westerners would call a morality story in the Western sense.  There is a man willing to kill to get ahead.  This is a man held up as honorable.  The beauty of Adiga's writing is it opens a window into the culture that lets you root for Balram, hold him as honorable, even as he does dishonorable things.    Good read.
B0016MJ6HY|2.0|this was really disappointing, great cast, could have been a great romantic comedy but the lines were off, slow and terrible photography.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie from the very first time I viewed it many years ago. I never get tired of this movie because it has so much to offer both male and female viewers. Richard Gere certainly fits the part of business man and reluctant lover while Julia Roberts is bright and bubbly through out and the romantic ending blows me away every time. I consider Prety Woman to be a clasic.
1602830452|5.0|This is THE comprehensive, all-inclusive, multi-cast audio edition from BBC Radio. Remember that these were radio shows of approximately 45-minutes (uninterrupted) or, in the case of the books such as The Hound of the Baskervilles, two 45-minute radio shows. This means that they are edited, abridgements to fit the format. Yet these are much more true to the original than the American radio shows of the forties (Basil Rathbone & others), which were limited to about 20 minutes (a 30-minute format interrupted by two long commercials and other announcements).

B000002JSN|5.0|I think every one of the original Zeppelin albums (and the live ones as well) has reviewers calling it \\"the best Led Zeppelin\\" album. I'm gonna go with the nameless one any day, followed closely by \\"Live at the BBC\\" and \\"How the West was Won\\".  But this big, sprawling double album is really a must-have as well, as are the vast majority of Zeppelin's 70s albums. It's the \\"usual\\" blend, I suppose, of blues, folk, rock n' roll and a little bit of funk and soul, generally heavy on the electric blues, but with a couple of utterly charming acoustic numbers as well.    There is perhaps nothing here as monumental as \\"Stairway\\" or as long-lasting as \\"Black Dog\\" or \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", even though the majestic 8½-minute \\"Kashmir\\" features a riff that will allow you get to rid of any other song that has gotten stuck in your head. But the overall quality of the material is very, very high.  It's hard, in fact, to think of another rock or blues record with this many distinctive guitar riffs; the entire first disc is dripping with heavy blues and rock n' roll riffs and thumping drums. And while the second disc may be a little less consistent, opening with two minutes of hideous synth, it nevertheless features plenty of terrific blues-rock and some lovely acoustic forays. Titles like \\"Night Flight\\", \\"Boogie with Stu\\" and \\"Black Country Woman\\" may not be the most immediately recognizable, but they're among Zep's most infectious blooze-n-boogie-grinds.   \\"Physical Graffiti\\" is a monument, one of the most epic double studio albums of the 70s, right up there with \\"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\\", and bested only, perhaps, by the Stones' unrivalled \\"Exile on Main Street\\".
B0017MO10U|5.0|As a SG-1 fan I enjoyed this movie very much. It was great to see \\"Jack\\" again but it does leave you wanting more of his \\"sense of humor\\" that was his trademark.  Ben Browder does add his own \\"spin\\" to the show but it just wasn't the same.  The movie gives you the best of both characters but still leaves you wanting to see more of Jack.  I hope they will continue to make movies for the fans to see and hopefully will continue to incorporate both characters into the story line.  This movie was good but a little hard to follow sometimes, but then it wouldn't be SG-1 if it wasn't now would it?  That is why you want to watch it 2 or 3 times to catch what you missed the first time.
0767020308|3.0|Not quite what I was expecting, but it's a cute movie.  Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility get 5 stars in my book.  But this is a good movie too.
B000063DIH|1.0|Never could get on with this album. I thought No Prayer For The Dying was average (a shock for a Maiden fan from the old days) but this one is downright awful. I was moderately hopeful when the single of Be Quick Or Be Dead was released, but this album crushed those hopes. Some of the vocals are okay (Childhood's End) and the title track finally made some kind of sense after seeing it live...but no thanks.
B00000IMTH|5.0|I've received my fair share of criticism allegedly being a person who only wants to listen to hard rock. Although that's not true, I certainly listen to my share of hard rock and heavy metal including Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and my favorite band, Black Sabbath. Rainbow is also a hard rock band and also one of my favorites. When I heard this album, Long Live Rock & Roll, I couldn't have agreed more! It's rock and roll at its best, and the tracks Lady of the Lake, Gates of Babylon, The Shed (Subtle) along with the title track are some of the best hard rock songs I've heard.    What a surprise when I heard the bewitching Rainbow Eyes! This song is musical magic. It's been more than twenty years since I first heard this song, and I still believe it's the finest piece of music I've ever heard. You don't get any anvil-chorus drums or screaming guitars on this song. What you do get is a kind of time warp in which a modern-day rock band somehow finds itself in medieval England playing as troubadours for a noble knight who has lost his lady love. At least that's what it says to me. It can say something else to you, I suppose, but the flute, guitar, violin, and Dio's vocals can really make you fall in love with this song. Check it out. If you're anything like me, you won't find anything better!

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I was a big fan of Ray of Light, American Life, Music, Confessions..., etc.   I was very excited to see Madonna coming out with a new album and figured she would continue with the more mature sound/less outrageous attitude she embraced starting with Ray of Light....I was mistaken.       I understand Madonna became famous thanks to her sexuality-injected early songs (Like a Virgin, etc) but was hoping that was all behind her.   Aside from the dumbed-down, unappealing lyrics and unappetizing 50+ year old in-your-face sexual Madonna, Timbaland is an overplayed hack and doesn't have half the talent of William Orbit or Mirwais...overall I am very dissatisfied with this album & it will stay on the shelf.
0789318121|2.0|Very disapointed about this book.  Not enough illustrations, roughs or sketches.  The pictures are for the most, too small and 90% of the book is about the script.
B00110K62U|5.0|A remarkable ensemble of the elite of the stage world deliver a brilliant performance at Royal Albert Hall in London.  Every element of this   production is balanced with pathos and humor making it a grand event for all ages.  This is a must see DVD. The time honored tale of the policeman chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread during the tumultuous years of the French Revolution unfolds with some of the greatest voices ever assembled on one stage.  You will never see a greater perfomance of this musical ever again.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Let me tell it straight: you'll find no better deal on an automatic diving watch than this. It has the DNA of all great Seiko diving watch of past (6105-8000) and present (Marinemaster), but a lot cheaper.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Construction quality<br />- Ruggedness<br />- 7S26 automatic Movement<br />- Dial legibility (day&night)<br />- Price<br /><br />I consider its size and weight to be a quality; but then again, I'm 1,90cm (6'3\\").<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Plain crown<br />- No band dive extension<br /><br />Seiko have a long standing tradition on diver's watches, and this watch does justice to it. If you're interested in learning more, look for \\"Seiko Divers Reference\\". And if you're considering buying it, go for it!<br /><br />## ADDENDUM 06-13-2012 ##<br /><br />Since writing this review, I bought a Seiko Marinemaster. It's a considerable pricier watch, and the quality and attention to detail show it. Even so, the SKX007 does hold its own. I think there's no higher praise than that!<br /><br />In hindsight, I see it now as a tool watch, rugged & reliable. I ended changing the original bracelet for a NATO strap, as the bracelet wasn't very good and a NATO strap is very resistant. Also, it best matches the style of the watch.<br /><br />My verdict is still a \\"Go for it\\"!
B000XVT7SW|5.0|These are two outstanding and spellbinding performances from the Italian repertory. Each of the major characters possesses the vocal and dramatic skills to capture the strong and violent emotions associated with verismo opera. The outstanding camera work, especially the close-ups, produce an intimacy and pathos that have a mesmerizing impact on the viewer. Both La Scala productions were filmed in Milan under the technical mastery of Herbert von Karajan.     In Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana, Fiorenza Cossotto delivers a deeply sympathetic portrayal of the aggrieved and betrayed Santuzza. It's easy to see why she was considered the greatest Italian mezzo-soprano of her time. Gianfranco Cecchele, as the adulterer Turiddu, performs admirably, both vocally and dramatically, and one wonders why he didn't achieve greater recognition in his day. In the role of Alfio, sung by Giangiacomo Guelfi, we see how anger and revenge consume his unsuspecting and gregarious nature. The religious choruses and famous intermezzo provide a temporary relief from the unceasing and escalating tension.    In Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, von Karajan also served as the artistic supervisor, and he demonstrates his fondness and sensitivity for Italian opera. Canio was one of Jon Vickers most celebrated roles. In his rendition of \\"Vesti la giubba,\\" he depends on his vocal expression and inward anguish to portray his growing rage rather than and outburst of tears. (Incidentally, don't miss his sensitive performance of the disturbed Don Jose, opposite the sensuous Grace Bumbry, in von Karajan's version of Carmen, also filmed in 1968.) Raina Kabaivanska, the Bulgarian soprano, combines her strong vocal and acting skills to portray Nedda. In the enclosed notes of Richard Osborne, her comedy play scene blends \\"poise and barely suppressed panic.\\" Peter Glossop, without the reserve often associated with British singers, offers a lively performance as the deformed and revengeful Tonio. He introduces thefamous prologue by holding up a Kabuki-style emotionless white mask. After Nedda whips and rejects him, his face becomes distorted with anger and humiliation.      In addition to the outstanding performances of the main characters in each opera, the Director of Photography, Ernst Wild, and his camera crew deserve to be saluted, especially for their intimate close-ups. For example, in \\"A voi tutti salute,\\" the viewer can almost taste the wine before Turiddu challenges Alfio to a duel. Even though there productions were filmed 40 years ago, the picture quality is very good and the original stereophonic recording has been converted to surround sound. Even a casual opera listener will find these performances absolutely spellbinding.

1569242739|5.0|I cannot get enough of these cupcakes!  I just made the simple chocolate cupcakes with the rich chocolate mousse topping last night.  I jazzed them up with a little layer of homemade raspberry jam.  There are not only plenty of unique and delicious (not to mention easy) recipes, they almost all have variations to try out.  The ingredients are easy to keep on hand, the variety has something for everyone, and the cream cheese frosting is to die for!    Also, the writing is funny and fun, like cooking with your best girlfriend.  My husband and I make these cupcakes together and in less than an hour we have cupcakes that are cooled and iced.  We always laugh about the commentary in the recipes, my favorite being, \\"use a double boiler to melt down the chocolate chips.  Of course, you don't have a double boiler, so use...\\"  I just love that feel of these cupcakes as something you do with family and friends, not in a formal kitchen.  Enjoy!
0452289963|1.0|As the title of my review indicates, this book is to philosophy what chicken nuggets are to fine dining.  Tolle is an egotistic flake and his book is a cheap rip-off of Eastern philosophy.  His dramatic pretenses at enlightenment, i.e. dead pan stare and drone-like speech, remind me of the scene inside a Buddhist monastery in Jim Carey's Ace Ventura.    What a joke.  Oprah has gone off the New Age deep end.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I first heard of Amy Winehouse like a lot of people in the US did. In the news with nothing but negative comments about her personal life. But when it came to the music I always heard praise on the album. I first heard the single \\"Rehab\\" and did not think to much of the song at first. After watching the VMA in Las Vegas I decided to give the album a chance. I was hooked instantly by the soulful sound of Amy Winehouse. It was a voice that I have not heard since the Motown days of music. It seemed like I listened to that album like everyday. Than I actually heard that Frank was her best and debut album. It took me a while to make the choice to purchase the album but when I finally did I could not believe what I was listening to. This was the Amy Winehouse that I felt was missing from the Back to Black album. Eveything worked for her in this album her soulful voice, the classic Motown/lounge style music and mixed with some great lyrics. Back to Black had everything just the music headed more pop than Frank. Her voice did not have as much control as Frank, but the music stuck to it's true form. I say if you listen to Back to Black and liked/loved the album. Frank will blow your socks off...
B000HF2NF8|5.0|Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \\"'Tis some visitor,\\" I muttered, \\"tapping at my chamber door, only this, and nothing more.\\"<br /><br />So I answered the door, and it was a messenger. He handed me a package, made me sign a paper, I hope I wasn't selling my soul or something (I don't have a soul to sell, it will be breach of contract and I may be sued) and he leave as fast as he arrived. So I entered my house, put the package on a coffee table, and forgot it 'till the very next day. And the very next day I remembered the package.<br /><br />Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,in there stepped a stately mask of the saintly days of yore; not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door, perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door, perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br /><br />It was V's mask. It is a small mask, just the appropriate size for the bust of Pallas I have in my library. So I made Pallas to wear V's mask, and then I enjoyed the movie. Apart from the mask and the movie, the package has a few mementos: four postcard sized posters of the movie, and V's symbol. The second disc includes the making of V, interviews and a lot of stuff, while the movie itself, widescreen, has three languages for audio and closed captioning (French, English and Spanish) allowing me to practice two languages and still enjoy it in my mother tongue. A nice touch. I've framed the lobby cards and they are hanging in my walls. I like them.<br /><br />And V's Mask, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted - nevermore!the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted - nevermore!
B0018AK9RA|1.0|What the heck is Judas Priest thinking? Are they trying to be the new Spinal Tap? I never ever thought that I would say anything bad about one of my all time favorite bands, but this album SUCKS. I tried listening to it several times and with each listening, I got more pissed. I want the $35.00 I spent on the \\"delux package\\" back. Where's the riffs? where's the melody lines? Where are the cool melodic solos Priest are known for. It sounds like Glenn and K.K. are trying to impress all of these new shred kids out there. Sure they can play fast, we already know that. But what I don't understand is why they didn't add the classic priest style. It makes no sense. I will never buy another Priest album until I hear it first. I always loved Priest for their originality. If this is them trying to be like Pink Floyd and The Who, they failed miserably. Get back to what you do best. Rock & Roll. If it aint broke, don't fix it. This Album SUCKS!!!!!
B000VBP38C|5.0|Many people didn't like this because it wasn't truly a \\"real\\" Pride & Prejudice remake, and because it really wasn't \\"period\\".<br /><br />I personally liked its airy, lighthearted feel. Extremely easy to follow and it isn't filled with things that shouldn't be there. It is perfectly shot.<br />It is the only version of Pride & Prejudice I like enough to where I don't have to fast forward through parts I don't like. I like it in its entirety and while Keira Knightley was, MAYBE, miscast, I adored Rosamund Pike (Jane). Maybe she would have made a better Elizabeth. I don't know.<br /><br />I also liked Matthew Macfadyen in the role of Mr. Darcy. Of course, I know him better from MI-5, but I was able to put that role aside. He played Mr. Darcy very well. I liked him a lot.<br /><br />I do believe that Jenna Malone's (Lydia) \\"British accent\\" was a very bad one. She was definitely miscast in this role.
031606792X|4.0|After reading the previous books I couldn't wait to read Breaking Dawn.  Overall, it was a very good read.  The story was captivating.  I loved how the characters developed and how the other vampires were incorporated into the story.  The only thing I didn't like is that the story in parts seemed a little rushed and the ending was somewhat anti-climatic for all the build up.  If not for that I would give it 5 stars.
031606792X|5.0|If I had to pick one statement that Stephenie Meyes was trying to convey in this last book of the Twilight series, I'd say that she was trying to suggest that our imaginations are nearly limitless; therefore, our potential is also infinite.  Her offbeat characters have exponentially heightened senses and immeasurable talents, some gifts that they weren't even aware they had, until they were challenged in such a way that failure could not be an option.  Even though her characters happened to be vampires and werewolves, I believe, and I think that the author believes that mere humans possess these same possibilities.<br /><br />I understand this series isn't for everybody. If you cannot remember ever having spontaneous unexplainable feelings for somebody of the opposite sex, then you'll probably hate, Twilight.  If you've never had your heart broken, you won't get, New Moon.  If you've never experienced or you don't remember the excitement of truly falling in love for the first time, you won't make it to the end of, Eclipse. Lastly, if you were not transcended to another place when reading such books as, A Wrinkle in Time, then you are probably lacking the imagination required to appreciate, Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />After reading some of the previous reviews, I was half expecting to be disappointed in this latest and last addition to the Twilight series.  Color me surprised when after I finished, I thought that this was probably the darkest and the most bizarre of the four books, but most likely my favorite. Not to mention that it was a brilliantly cool way to connect with a few of the favorite people in my life - my kids.<br /><br />I applaud Stephenie Meyers for this fun, fun, fun, series.
0790731940|5.0|...this movie is just plain fun. The characters are great and it was wonderful to see all the old actors/singers again who take part in the poker game on the ship. Pop some corn, pull out the blankets, and enjoy.
0374264260|5.0|IN The Silver Linings Playbook, Mr. Quick has done something very difficult for literature to do: inspire hope. As the unflinchingly and endearingly honest main character notes, many of the greatest classics in American literature end in despair, or are such thorough condemnations of life as it is that it is difficult sometimes to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The lives of the authors often mirror the grim reality of their novels. Hemingway shoots himself dead with a shotgun and Plath sticks her head into an oven. Pat Peoples' explanation? They never looked up at the clouds at sunset.     It is this simple kind of appreciation for beauty which distinguishes Pat not just from his literary contemporaries, but from all of the other characters in The Silver Linings Playbook itself. He appreciates characters like Hester Prynne and Holden Caulfield who, like himself, hold onto their values and nobility in a harsh world that seems bent on stripping them of everything they hold dear. Though Pat himself is slightly deluded - he is not just on 'apart time' with his wife, there is no 'inevitable reunion' as the first chapter title suggests - his honest, everyman's struggle, epitomized by the apt adage of 'practicing being kind rather than right', against all the forces in the world conspiring to break his hope is so convincing that the reader starts to believe in silver linings himself.    This book will make you happy, though, because of the way it is written. Most of the chapter titles will make you laugh in a different way than the next. Mr. Quick's apt use of detail, allusions, and brilliant comparisons bring the story to life. That a chapter should be called \\"Like he was Yoda and I was Luke Skywalker training on Dagobah\\" is a very precious thing. Meanwhile periodic interludes such as advice from Pat's 'black friend Danny', and even the whole introduction of the death of Veterans Stadium as a new thing, bring bits of humor just when the story may seem to be becoming sad. The author has an eye for quirks and intricacies of language and a gift for conveying them in a readable yet still emotional and romantic manner. More than just the ease of identifying with Pat, Mr. Quick's simple, declarative prose, highlighted by brief, nostalgic-filled, almost Hemingway-like sentences, reels in the reader.     Peoples seems to represent the Hemingway ideal of masculinity: courage as grace under pressure. Pat has much grace under pressure. Slips from this grace he deeply regrets, and is always molding himself into a good person, even when no one is watching and no one cares. His entire self-improvement program was aimed towards a person who would never know he had ever changed a bit.     But there is no tragic ending to match this altruistic ideal, as there is in many Hemingway stories. Though there is bad in life, there is good also, and Pat, like his author, knows where to find it.

B00028HBKM|4.0|I saw this movie and I was blown away. While I can understand the controversy, I never fully understood just what Jesus did for us until I saw this film. This was truly a great man. As a bible belt resident who spent 18 years in Sunday School, I already knew about Jesus dying for our sins so that we may enjoy eternal life, so I was not too impressed with this part of the story, no, what amaazed me was that Jesus was the inventor of the modern table. I have read the new testament and never knew that Jesus first had the idea for the modern table. I have two bad knees, so this really raised my opinion of Jesus. Eternal salvation is great, but not having to kneel down when i eat, wow, now that's something to worship a man over. Also I would like to thank the good people at AMC Theatres for reminding me that nothing goes better with incredibly graphic images of our Lord being crucified than popcorn, Diet Coke, and some penut butter M&Ms.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I took me a while to get into this album. It's confusing at first, but after weeks of listening, it gives me chills. It's a masterpiece like no other Judas Priest album before it, and I can't stop playing it, it's addictive with its haunting melodies and Halford's almost painfully emotional voice.
B000GFLAI0|2.0|After 4 spins, I've decided that this is not my favorite of Dylan's work.  The only track with which I somewhat connect is the final track \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" where the somber mood seems portend a revelation, \\"They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me mother; In the human heart an evil spirt does* dwell, I'm trying to love my neighbor & do good to others, but oh mother, things ain't going well.\\"  The rest of the songs have almost no melodies with arrangements that blend from one into another.  This week, Bob's son Jakob's \\"On Up the Mountain\\" is #1 in my personal top ten.  [[ASIN:B0016CGNZW Seeing Things]] is a far superior set to \\"Modern Times,\\" if it's fair to compare.  At this point, Dylan can of course do whatever he wants and it will be published; but this is his weakest set in quite awhile.  Because it is Bob Dylan, it will have an honored place on my shelf, which I will faithfully dust from time to time.  Taxi!<br /><br />*according to my ear
B000N4SHPS|3.0|Maybe it's because I was a little kid when the first Rocky came out but they do it for me for some reason. Most of them. Rocky 5 was awful. As I sit here I can't remember if I ever saw the entire movie. I think I always bailed out of it before it was over. I never thought that one was worthy of being the last Rocky movie so it was nice that this one came out. Whether it's because I feel like I know the core characters from all those times seeing the movies as a kid or not, they still have a way of getting to me.<br /><br />I didn't read about the movie, didn't talk with anyone about it, didn't look into it at all until I first saw it on HBO or Showtime or whoever aired it a couple months ago. Since #5 was so bad I didn't rush into this one. I have been happily surprised. The first (and one of the hardest) punch of the movie is seeing the name on the headstone. I had no idea Adrian was dead in this one before that moment, and no<br />intention of mentioning her death in my review but after 20 seconds on this page I saw it has been mentioned tons of times already so I don't think I'm letting a secret out.<br /><br />Adrian was always such a cutie pie sweety, and she was also sort of the Edith Bunker of the Rocky films. In many ways she was the strength and conscience. All the things that some reviewers have considered to be the slow, depressing stuff before the movie (aka the boxing) begins is the stuff I love. There's genuine feeling there. It's a drag that Talia Shire didn't get to be in this one but much of the movie is a fitting tribute to the strength of the character she brought to life. I like that.<br /><br />Also, this Rocky most imitates real life. There's no villain to conquer and there's no ascension to, nor fall from greatness. It's a story about the people, places and memories that make a life.<br /><br />My gripe about the movie is the training montage. Donning the same grey sweatshirt/sweatpants from the first movie, punching the meat, etc... was too obvious for me. I don't like things to be so blatant. Also, my favorite passage of the famous Rocky musics is only touched on for one small part as the credits are rolling. That was a bummer.<br /><br />Still, what really matters in this one is that Rocky has always been a good guy and he even delivers a street-corner speech that the USA could and should really take to heart. \\"It's not how hard you hit.\\" We'd be a better nation because of it. Rocky Balboa is a really touching way to wrap up the mythology of this pop-culture icon.to be so blatant.

B000002G87|5.0|While you can get a few of the tracks from LAYLA on \\"Best Of\\" albums of Clapton classics, this album contains a host of lesser-known gems, such as \\"Anyday\\" and \\"Why Does Love Got to Be so Sad\\" -- and that last one has got to be the most up-tempo sad love song in history. I've owned LAYLA since the original vinyl release back, like, a million years ago. As music technology advances, I keep on buying it in every new format, because even though the tech changes, this album is always fresh.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|...the studio had allowed Mr. Proyas to release THIS version (the Director's Cut) of Dark City to theaters, maybe it would have been better received. I will not do a laundry list of what has been added or removed but I will say I believe this version has more depth than the original theatrical release and, frankly, makes more sense without being obvious or losing the sense of the story unfolding for both the audience and John Murdoch at the same time. One thing I will give away is that they have removed the opening voice-over which, together with the music, makes for a tense, eerie opening atmosphere that I liked quite a lot. I also think they restored Jennifer Connelly's own voice to the scenes of her singing in the club but I can't be 100% sure. All in all, I much prefer this Director's Cut version to the theatrical release. Mr. Proyas says in the special features interview that this version represents more closely what his original vision was for the film and I think he did an excellent job. Just brilliant!
0596009208|3.0|This is a good beginners' book. It is, however, 3 years old and does not cover the latest version of Java, 6.0. According the publisher, O'Reilly Media, the authors consider Java 6.0 to be similar to version 5.0 and thus not worth a new edition. The next edition is scheduled for 2010, when Java 7.0 comes out. On the other hand, the authors did not really cover all the new 5.0 features in this second edition. In particular, enum is relegated to the appendix! I am not sure how much update one can realistically expect in the 3rd edition.
B00003CX96|5.0|This movie is known as a bike movie, but it's really a movie about growing up and leaving home.  It has funny dialogue, good acting and a good plot.
B00005JKTF|5.0|I purchased this movie to see Rupert Penry-Jones who I really like as an actor.  I thought he was very good but could understand why he has stated that he will no longer play the guy who doesn't get the girl.    Cate was great and it really is her film.  Billy Crudit (misspelled I am sure) really did a great job as the hero.  Michael Gambon is a great favorite of mine also.  This movie is done in the same way that Gambon did the Magret series for the BBC and PBS.    Really recommend this film for all ages.  My grandaughter and daughter enjoyed watching it as well as I did.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|Rented this to counter-balance wife's choice of \\"What Happens in Vegas\\" (that was better than expected). That the people who produced this \\"hit piece\\" were going to ignore facts and try to brow beat you into believing their \\"anti-America, anti-Republican\\" message.     SPOILERS: It begins with a sniper team (supposedly Marines) covering an extraction team. The spotter takes the time to gaze at a picture of his cute wife and ponder the ethics and purpose of their mission while they literally chew their cud. The action starts with Mark Wahlberg knocking off targets with casual ease but when a larger force \\"appears\\" they call for backup; especially when the bad guys manage to set up mortars ranged onto their position instantaneously. At the Army base, some civilian pulls the plug on the supposedly covert operation by saying that they will get out on their own and to break camp immediately. The spotter gets gunned down by a helicopter (Why are they always making runs rather than hovering?) Oh whoa is \\"Swagger\\" (why not just name the character Johnny Bigc*ck?). Suddenly it's three years later and Swagger has hair longer than my mother, living in the rugged Northwest. Danny Glover sets him up by telling him that he alone can help them counteract a threat against the president in a manner that'll leave your four year old scratching their head. Swagger is referred to as a Sgt., SSgt. and a Gunny, throughout the film; supposedly he \\"retired\\" right after he got back to the States. WTF? The movie quickly dissolves into a farce in which characters are made to do one thing one scene and another the next without any logical connection. Non-subtle digs at Republicans (Presidential portraits in Glover's \\"office\\"), the current administration (\\"They thought there were WMD's in Iraq!\\" one character quips), \\"Big Oil\\" (that first operation was to cover a group of \\"contractors\\" killing off a village that refused to move when \\"we\\" decided to run a pipeline through their location), corporations (\\"There's no head [of the bad guys] to cut off. It's a corporation.\\") and the military (I hope there wasn't any military advisor on this POS as they'd likely now be suicide candidate). The ridiculousness reaches higher and higher as the film goes on... Swagger easily evading capture from countless law enforcement types in broad daylight, running a straight line across open fields without getting hit by whithering gunfire (ala' Arnold in \\"Commando\\"), going MacGuyver in local supermarkets, repulsing two cops and their German Shepard like Jason Bourne but with the added kicker of sticking one cops' arm into the jaws of the attacking dog! A certain amount of belief needs to be suspended when watching any movie, I know, but we're supposed to buy into the notion that Swagger's dead partner's wife is a hot, young thing that is a single school teacher in fictitious Keen, KY after three years, wears skimpy clothes when answering the door and can perform surgery (despite the fact that becoming a nurse was her dead husband's dream, not hers due to a dislike of the sight of blood!). The \\"hero-done-wrong\\" in these type movies always receive supporting aid and in this one it's provided by an at first bumbling FBI agent who then is an authority on ancient battlefield medical remedies and later, with a quick flashbang lesson, is, Ta-Da! a sniper, too!!!    I could not stand the headache this garbage pile brought on, went to the head and promptly produced something better. Before this, \\"Independence Day\\" (which I walked out of the theater on) was one of the worst assaults upon my intelligence. \\"Enemy State\\" ranked right up there though fortunately that was rented and quickly returned. This puts everything this movie-lover has seen to shame. I can not explain how any enjoyment could be experienced from watching this but if there was, then the makers of this film were at least partly correct: the common American is stupid, gullible and easily lead around by the nose.
0061091480|5.0|This book has truly helped me identify what Dyer refers to as \\"erroneous zones\\" in my life. He discusses anger, dependency on others, success and failure, guilt, worry, blame and procrastination. Ways to identify behaviors that encompass these constructs, and suggestions on dealing with them are very helpful.<br /><br />Much of the book encourages introspection, and identifying our own behaviors that contribute to unhappiness or perceived failures in life. I really like how he states that you (the reader) are responsible for your own emotions and actions. What others do should not have the power to control or negatively effect our lives.<br /><br />It's tough reading at times, especially when I've come across an area that I know I need to address. This will be a book I'll read again and again, as the breadth of knowledge and suggestions Dyer has compiled cannot be completely absorbed through one reading.
0061122416|4.0|Very enjoyable. Easy read and easy to follow through the story. Nice twist at the end.
0385493622|3.0|While this book does make for an enjoyable read, it seems that the whole premise of the book is based on a false pretense. The magic of the quest to solve Fermat's Last Theorem is a direct result of him having written that he has discovered a proof for it. If he had written that he was unsure of a proof it is unlikely that it would have garnered much interest. While what Andrew Wiles has done is a remarkable piece of mathematics, it is most definitely not what Fermat had in mind when he scribbled on the margin of his Arithmetica. [Therefore it is difficult to understand why it should have made any difference to Wiles whether the attempted proof of Fermat by Yoichi Miyaoka in March 1988 was successful or not (as detailed in Chapter 6), as what Wiles was really working on proving was the Taniyama - Shimura Conjecture, and this was not touched upon by Miyaoka.] We are forced to assume that Fermat had erred in writing that he had a proof, which in turn removes the essential ingredient of the drama of this saga, namely figuring out what Fermat had discovered that eluded generations of mathematicians. Singh himself alludes to this in the end of his book, but I believe that this undermines the point of the book as a whole.   As to the book itself, the most interesting part for me were the brief presentations of landmark developments in number theory and mathematics of the course of the century. However, any with a strong background in math will already know much of what is covered in the first half, and anyone without a strong background in math will be lost by what is covered in the second half. Obviously, trying to condense the basic ideas of a one hundred page proof that only the top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. This is what Singh attempts to do and fails, although not any worse than any other author would.  Bottom line, if you have a healthy interest in math and/or number theory you will enjoy parts of this book, and if you have a degree in math and/or number theory you will enjoy the other parts.

0143038095|4.0|Even though this book can get confusing trying to match daughters to their mothers, the way it was written (a series of vignettes of the different lives of both Chinese mothers and daughters from youth to today where they all seem to melt together) was really poetic and beautiful.  The Joy Luck Club showcases the timeless ups and downs (mostly generationally and culturally) between mothers and daughters .  I loved how she shows that no matter what the daughters do to push their mothers away and shun their (cultural) indentities, that they cannot shake them from their bones.  As mother and daughter there is an undeniable connection.  This book did quite a fair share of man/marriage bashing, though, which comes off as an author's personal grudge (perhaps) because it is so repetitive throughout.  But bad relationships are not the center of this novel (thank goodness because that's not the only thing that can cause rifts in families).  It was a great book that can be appreciated by all mothers and daughters alike.
B0014BECF8|5.0|George Michael's newest release is a set of two CD's that contain enough hits songs and well written lyrics to satisfy even the mOst jaded music-scene habitue. Chart toppers such as \\"Fast Love\\" and \\"Freedom\\" are mixed in with some outstanding secondary hits and duets with Aretha Franklin and Elton John.  The theme is definitely high energy dance, dance, dance and this collection reminds us of what an amazing instrument Mr. Michael's voice can be when produced properly and given strong lyrics to dig his teeth and ever capable vocal chords upon. This set of CD's plays well for a party or in quieter, more reflective moments. Give George Michael a second look--revisit older hits and newer hits and never before heard B/flip sides. Time to seriously reevalulate Michael;s career and superb song writing skills--not mention some vocal performances worthy of worldwide critical and commercial success. George Michael is reborn!

0385338724|4.0|What happens if you wake up one morning and realize that all of your dreams have magically come true overnight? That's what happens to Lexi Smart. She wakes up in a hospital one to find that she doesn't recognize herself - literally. The frizzy hair is gone, replaced by a sleek, shiny mane, and the lifelong nickname \\"Snaggletooth\\" just doesn't apply anymore...and why do her lips look suspiciously plumper? She doesn't even believe the Louis Vuitton handbag that the nurse hands her is actually hers. Why? Because Lexi has no memory of the past three years. In her mind, she's a struggling assistant manager at a flooring company who just had a typical crazy night out with her girlfriends in 2004. In reality, she's actually a member of the Board of Directors of that flooring company and is waking up from a minor car accident in 2007.<br /><br />Lexi finds that she has everything she has ever wanted: she is beautiful, married to a ridiculously good-looking guy, makes a lot of money, and lives in the most beautiful loft she has ever seen. So what if everyone at the office not-so-secretly wishes she hadn't recovered from the car accident? And so what if her oldest friends don't want anything to do with her anymore? And does it really matter if her new husband scolds her like a child for not putting her shoes away properly? Remember Me? is the tale of Lexi's quest to discover what happened to her during those three years to turn her into a person whom she doesn't physically or emotionally recognize, and what she does when she finds out that her new life may not be as picture perfect as it seems.<br /><br />Remember Me? is funny, witty, and absolutely charming; it is perhaps Kinsella's best work yet. The characters are extremely well written and appealing. Like all of Kinsella's protagonists, Lexi is quirky and a bit off-center. What makes this book fresh and unique, however, is that when she wakes, Lexi is the woman that every chick lit heroine loves to hate: sleek and polished, beautiful, refined, and very unpleasant in the workplace. It's interesting to see what Kinsella does with that role reversal, how the reader sympathizes with the snooty boss in charge instead of condemning her. The most interesting parts of the book come when Lexi is trying to discover what drove her to this complete personality change. She looks at what her husband and friends demonstrate that her life has become and searches for some fragment of the Lexi she knows within it.<br /><br />Ironically, it is not with her husband that Lexi finds remnants of the woman she used to be, but with his architect partner, Jon. Jon delivers startling news to her soon after their first meeting and, unsure of whether to trust him, she holds him at arm's length while trying to decipher the puzzle of the last three years.<br /><br />Remember Me? is a fresh look at what might happen if that fairy-tale wish comes true: \\"I wish I could wake up to find a new me, someone completely different than I am now.\\" Its hilarious situations and witty humor make it a real force to be reckoned with in the chick-lit genre. The fact that it comes with some definite introspection makes it that much better. It is an absolutely enjoyable experience; readers will race through the pages to find out what happens to Lexi as they try to discover the secrets of her past together. Kinsella has really outdone herself with this work.

I found myself sitting here on the edge of my seat biting my nails when it was a tight spot and clapping my hands when I was delighted with how something turned out. If you love magical tales with great characters and romance alongside, please watch this movie! I'm going to try to read the book now. Because surely if I thought the movie was so good, the book must be ten times better!

She won't let me get even half way through it before grabbing for another book. The bunny that came with it was cute! Maybe she'll enjoy it more when she gets older?? As of right now, though, it's not one of our favorites. I know it's a classic, but I really don't see what all of the hype is about.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|Emmylou Harris' new CD is a lovely folk set.  Four of the tracks have caught my ear at this point.  \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\" is a Tracy Chapman song that Harris remakes with great result, \\"Hunger only for a taste of justice; Hunger only for a word of truth 'cause all that you have is your soul.\\"  For me, the album is backloaded with my very favorites coming right at the end.  \\"Not Enough\\" is an Emmylou penned tune about loss, \\"I still have your memory, one or two pictures of you & me, Life is long & life is tough, but when you love someone, life's not long enough.\\"  What wisdom!  \\"Sailing Round the Room\\" was written by Emmylou with Kate & Anna McGarrigle.  Its lovely melody shines with the McGarrigles' backup vocals, \\"From the tall pines of Carolina all the way to the wall of China.\\"  The set ends with the lovely harmonies of Mike Auldridge & John Starling on \\"Beyond the Great Divide.\\"  \\"All I Intended to Be\\" is a quiet set that is like deep waters.  Enjoy!

B001DJ7PR8|4.0|People have been waiting for years for Woody Allen to make another \\"Annie Hall\\" but it is not going to happen. Allen has moved on and sometimes up from that classic: the benchmark of the 30+ years of his making films.<br />Without putting too much effort into it, I can think of a number of very fine films that Allen has made since \\"AH\\": \\"Another Woman,\\" \\"Hannah and her Sisters,\\" \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\\" \\"Manhattan,\\" \\"Broadway Danny Rose\\" and on and on. But he has also made some clunkers like \\"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion\\" and \\"Small Time Crooks.\\" All in all a great career: one made up of hits and misses, par for the course with someone who has been making films for a long time.<br />Now comes his newest: \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" made in Barcelona and redolent of that beautiful city: hot dusty, passionate, sultry, crazy, always bursting forth with life and love...a city in which all is possible, everyone is open to experience everything...or should be.<br />Into this milieu comes two American women: Vicky (Rebecca Hall: pretty yet bland) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson: beautiful and luscious) both looking for something: but what?<br />Vicky is the more realistic of the friends.

031606792X|5.0|I have read all of the books leading up to this spectacular ending and I have loved them. The author provided multiple twists in the story that kept me reading until the end. Throughout these books I have laughed, cried, become frustrated, and etc. right along with the characters. These books were amazingly written. I just wish that the series would have lasted longer!

B0012OQZWA|4.0|...just give this a listen. If you're one of those people who think metal is nothing but a bunch of hairy guys wailing away on their instruments, this album will change your mind.<br /><br />I'm not normally into this kind of technical death metal. There comes a time when the band just starts to focus too much on speed and not enough on originality or soul (I'm looking at you, Braindrill). But Origin are a band who seem to know where to draw the line.<br /><br />There's all kinds of crazy time shifts and ridiculously fast playing all around (even from the bassist!). But there's also a surprising amount of melody in these songs, which helps the listener to distinguish one from another. The biggest complaint most people have with death metal is how monotonous it is. This is something Origin seem to have worked on, because every song sounds like them, but they don't all sound exactly the same. There's not any Between the Buried and Me-esque experimentation, it's just precise and speedy playing. I think it's also worth noting that the production is pretty much perfect for this kind of music. The vocals are back far enough in the mix so that they don't dominate the songs, and every instrument is audible and balanced.<br /><br />If you don't like tech-death, you might be a little wary. But otherwise, this is some quality music.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is an imaginative tale about a little girl named Chihiro who becomes trapped in the spirit world after her parents are turned into pigs for eating the spirit's food.  There, she must work in a bath house for the spirits until she can think of a way to escape.  In many ways, this film is excellent.  The animation is beautiful, the setting is strange and entertaining, the story is full of twists, and the characters posess alot of depth.  What I love most about this movie is the depth of the characters- no one is one dimensionally \\"evil\\" or \\"good\\".  Every character posesses good and bad qualities to varying degrees.  Even Chihiro starts off as an unlikeably whiny girl at the beginning, but by the end, has developed courage and self-reliance.  I just love the departure from black-and-white moral categories to a more morally ambigous characters, because the real world is morally ambigous.  On another note, the setting of Spirited Away is strange and colorful.  I was very entertained by the bizarre array of bath-house guests, the strange twisting layout of the bath-house itself, and the haunting and beatiful scenery viewed from the train.  Also, anyone who's seen Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro might recognize the return of the soot gremlins.  I had actually seen Spirited Away first, then My Neighbor Totoro a year later, so imagine my surprise when I recently rewatched Spirited Away and saw them.  Soot gremlins!  Compared to his other films, this is one of Miyazaki's more energetic and action-packed films.  So, if you've seen some of his other films and couldn't stand the slow pacing of the story, then Spirited Away may be just the thing for you.  Well anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough!  Please watch it at least once!    P.S. There's some excellent bonus features available on this dvd.  First of all, there's a nice \\"making-of\\" feature, a feature on the art of Spirited Away, and an interview with some of the voice actors.  There's also an introductionby John Lasseter (pretty pointless), alot of trailers (seriously?!), and the storyboards (who watches those?).  Overall, though, the making-of is quite lengthy and excellent.  So, enjoy!

B000LC55F2|5.0|There have been many movies devoted to the misdirection, sleight of hand crowd.  Magic is a favorite theme of writers, actors, and film makers for the obvious reason that this craft so closely parallels their own, the spinning of illusion to make audiences forget for a moment what a dull, hard place the world can be by believing, however briefly, in something that is patently false.  It is a very participatory act, the engagement of the audience in the implausible construct is essential - indeed; that is where the \\"magic\\" resides.<br /><br />Almost without fail these movies make great sport of showing how performers fool their audiences, and one another; and their directors like to demonstrate that they too are magicians.  All this can lead to layer upon layer of falsehood, deception, trickery, and even confusion.  The Prestige is no exception.  At times one wishes for a scorecard, and the plodding of the plot gets a bit murky in the middle.  But there's enough intrigue to hold you for the big finish, and The Prestige keeps you guessing literally until the final seconds.<br /><br />One look at the cast tells you that somebody spent some serious money to put together a quality film.  Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson lead the way - all are excellent although Bale struggles with his Cockney accent.  London in the late 1800's is masterfully recreated, no small trick in its own right.  But what fuels this wonderful film is rivalry and hate, a grudge between two former friends and colleagues that just keeps going and going until it is no longer mere antagonism but the very reason for living - for them both.  For us, living over a century later, it may be hard to identify with two performers who would stop at nothing to claim the title of, \\"England's Greatest Magician\\".  Seems like wanting to be Denmark's Greatest Mime.  But magic is power, and a century ago, it was possible to hold an entire audience in the palm of your hand, if you had the right Prestige.<br /><br />Worth watching more than once, just so you can try to figure out how they did it.tige.

0143112589|4.0|When the character of Rumpole was first created in the mid-1970s, he was described as being on the cusp of retirement.  The television series and the books detailing Rumpole's subsequent adventures have continued for over three decades, but the character has remained about the same age while the world and society alters around him.  Keeping a static, stable and unchanging known-quantity as his main character allows author John Mortimer to give us an old-fashioned outlook into an increasingly changing world.    In the past few books this was used mostly for comic effect: Rumpole dealing with political correctness and smoking bans, the revelation of Sam Ballard's punk-rock youth, the need for his legal chambers to possess a modern and engaging website.  However, in RUMPOLE AND THE REIGN OF TERROR we see Rumpole's values and principles challenged in a world of post-9/11 laws and procedures.    Fortunately for Rumpole, he isn't having to deal with the indignity of pointless shoe-removal at airport security lines; instead he's looking at the impact on the British justice system, the weakening of habeas corpus and the decline of the presumption of innocence.    In the story, a Pakistani doctor is being held without charge on terrorism suspicions.  Of course, given the level of coincidence that's endearingly present in most Rumpole stories, it won't be a shock to reveal that the connection to Rumpole is not because of his stellar legal reputation.  Rather it is because of the fact that the doctor's in-laws happen to be the Timson clan, a family of minor criminals who pop up frequently in the Rumpole stories.    In any event, the thought of someone held in custody without charge or explanation rattles the core of Rumpole's principles, regardless of whether the suspected crime is terrorism or not (although Rumpole does begin to have the glimmerings of doubt when he finds some disturbing correspondence which the accused supposedly had in his possession).  Defending such an person leaves Rumpole out on his own, and not for the first time in his career.  Not only is the press skeptical and unconvinced that terror suspects require access to the judicial system, She Who Must Be Obeyed cannot understand Rumpole's insistence that even accused terrorists are innocent until proven guilty.    Speaking of Rumpole's wife, a fun subplot involves Hilda Rumpole beginning to write her own memoirs as a balance to Rumpole's own writings, which she assumes will paint a less than flattering portrait of herself.  As with many of the previous stories, the Hilda subplot is amusing and entertaining.  And not for the first time, this seemingly unrelated storyline ends up having a major impact on Rumpole's success in the courtroom.    The tone of THE REIGN OF TERROR is light and comfortable, as is now traditional in Mortimer's Rumpole series.  While there are important topics raised and discussed, they never overwhelm the narrative.  The story is fun and never overly serious.    It says something about the power of Leo McKern's performance in the television version of the Rumpole stories that reading dialog written over four years after his death and fourteen years after his final performance as the character, I can easily imagine  McKern reciting lines from THE REIGN OF TERROR.  John Mortimer is still utterly consistent in his writing, so fans of his earlier work should enjoy this.  As for myself, I'm sure I'll be reading the Rumpole stories for as long as Mortimer can keep turning them out.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|Dispite what many have written, this movie is authentic and great pains went into the details. The death machine itself cost millions to make and is accurate down to the last detail. The depravity in Nero's court is right on spot, as is the \\"Royal Bordello\\" that Calligula created. I read articles on this detail when it was first released. This authenticity is the only reason such well respected actors partook of it. They felt the message was most important. Yes, there is some porn and a lot of nudity. Absolutely tame when compared to what's available free on the Internet today. Hard to believe it was actually banned at X rated \\"art\\" houses.<br /><br />I've always felt this movie should be required viewing for high school seniors as a great way to illustrate the depravity of man, (just like the Bible says) and how low he will go when left unchecked. A great primer for American politics, if you will...<br /><br />The DVD itself is really good. The video is pretty good, but the sound is awesome! Crank up the home theatre for this one. I highly recommend it.
0374264260|5.0|Excellent book that both men and women would enjoy. Very fast read and one that I could not put down. I was late for a lot of appointments and stayed up late because I had to finish just one more chapter. Although Pat Peoples has just been released from a psychiatric hospital, he appears to be the only \\"sane\\" character in the book compared to his family and friends. The book weaves the reader through the Eagles 2006 season as Pat struggles to fit in and resolve many of his personal issues. Pat always tries to \\"be kind rather than right\\" and is confident that with hard work, on his part, that his life will lead to a happy ending. I would highly recommend this book and can't wait to read Mr. Quick's next novel.

B000ZLFALI|4.0|This film is such a discovery and so unique.  Someone decided to take a chance and go into new territory and it more than succeeded.  A film that manages to show all the emotions and reality of what the late 60s was and to do it with very believable characters and Beatles music to boot.<br /><br />This film is more than a musical.  All emotions are expressed in song and having the characters sing them is amazingly effective.  I must say that you do not have to be a Beatles fan to admire this film.  The songs are used so expertly and so perfectly placed speaking such emotion that it's as if you are hearing them for the first time.  Also, the songs you know may take on a new meaning for they are so well interpreted here.  You also see the depth there really was to the Beatles songs, early in their career and later, for all carry an emotional wallop here.<br /><br />I found the male lead Jim Sturges as Jude the true revelation here.  His acting was superb.  His singing was amazing.  He not only had a great voice but he maneaged to evoke such sincere emotion and feelings into each song.  Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy was superb as well and seeing her here made me realize how many excellent films I have seen her in and what a great quality collection of work she is establishing. (Also, don't you love it - Jude and Lucy !! )<br /><br />The 60's defintitely live here and again the music runs the show.  Some are production numbers, some are solo pieces and some have action in the background.  ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE and HEY JUDE are both amazing.  This film will grab you and you will have an amzing experience.  Even Selma Hayek appeares in a very unique cameo and I was really wowed.  I had to give the film 4 stars for I found a few of the experimental song scenarios did not work well.  Very few, mind you.  So is this a masterpiece?  Not quite, but it is definitely one of the best films of the year and deserves a place in film history.  Excellent acting all around, great vocal interpretation with the great music selections.  And a plot that will grab you.  It shows the late 60's in a very unique way.<br /><br />I highly recomend this.  It is a must see.music selections.  And a plot that will grab you.

B001BKXUOQ|2.0|I loved every single slipknot album to come out, even the \\"sophomore slump\\" as many called IOWA to be.  So I heard the Psychosocial single and could not possibly wait for Slipknot to put some energy back into the metal of day that has gone soft and emo.  God, I was so wrong.  You'll probably love this album if you're a stone sour fan, but I do not like them, and this could easily have been a stone sour album and I wouldn't have known the difference.  Like I said, they tried to fool the maggots with a couple of heavy tracks in the begenning, but you'll go...\\"huh?\\" as they continue to give soft lyrics to a hardcore band. Dont even bother listening to track 12 unless you want to hear how bad Slipknot can be.      I hope they don't go out with this album.  Guess I'll probably have to wait another 4 years for metal to come back.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I've never been a big Bruce Willis fan, but my goodness, does he ever deliver in this one.      From beginning to end, you get the right amount of suspense, action, and nonstop excitement.  Lots of creative ways the bad guys die too, such as Bruce driving a truck through an elevator and watching them fall from way up high.  You get plenty of action scenes like those throughout the film.       The shooting segments were very well done, and the helicopter scenes involving even MORE guns shooting were done spectacularly.  Great job.

Having said that, all of the CDs she's released since then haven't been quite as good. That has now changed with the release of Flavors of Entanglement. This is easily one of the best CDs from Alanis in a long time. I like each and every one of them. An excellent choice.

B000PA9Q6E|5.0|What a concert CD! \\"Breakin' it Up, Breakin' it Down\\" features the vocals of three pretty good bluesmen--Muddy Waters, James Cotton, and Johnny Winter.  Waters and Winter also play guitar, and James Cotton is referred to as \\"Superharp\\" in the notes accompanying the CD. Also in the group: Bob Margolin (guitar and vocals), Pinetop Perkins (vocals and piano), Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith (drum), and Charles Calmese (Bass). They play awfully well together. . . .<br /><br />Bob Margolin wrote to notes.

This is a rocking version of this song!  There is fine guitar work, good keyboards, and terrific harmonica. It is taken at a rollicking pace.  The three central vocalists take turns in vocals--to good effect.<br /><br />\\"Can't Be Satisfied.\\" One of Muddy Waters' hits, covered by many others, including the Rolling Stones. There is cool guitar work at the outset, and Waters' singing does justice to this song. There is a sense of improvisation and spontaneity, as the three central players interact with one another.  Lots of fun.<br /><br />\\"Rocket 88\\" is one of Cotton's songs, about his car. It starts up with some great harmonica work. This work is taken at the quick pace and there is a sense of joy to Cotton's vocalizations.<br /><br />Another Waters' classic closes out this concert CD--\\"Got My Mojo Workin.'\\"  The three principal artists share in the vocals, but this is Muddy Waters' song.  Love the lyrics!<br /><br />\\"Got my mojo workin',<br />Just don't work on you.<br />So bad I just don't<br />Know what to do.\\"<br /><br />A real lively version, with the crowd getting involved. Harp, drums, guitars work well together. There is some nice jamming among the musicians in the middle.  What a way to close out this CD.<br /><br />So, my judgment?

0515141429|5.0|This is my second Jack Reacher read. I think the author does a great job creating page turning excitement.  Even though many of Reacher's exploits may seem over the top. They are achieved in a plausible way. Reacher's brother was a top level treasury department boss who was the top expert in money counterfitting. He came to a small town in Georgia to meet with a former bank executive who was having second thoughts about participating in the conspiracy.  He was assassinated and brutally mutilated beyond recognition.  Reacher, a former military officer and investigator, at the time, was basically a drifter. Coincidently, he decided to stop off in the town to find information about a long time favorite blues player of his who had been murdered years ago. The excitement begins and flows non stop until Reacher solves the case of his brothers murder as well as brings down the whole criminal operation which had corrupted much of the town. Top Notch.

B00125WAWS|5.0|This movie takes us back to an ugly time in U.S. history -- the Jim Crow era. In a segregated little town in Texas, the African American teachers and students of tiny Wiley College pursue excellence in education and recruit a world-class debate team, good enough to take on the debaters of Harvard and win.<br />  I'm not sure how much of this movie is fact and how much fiction but it pushed all the right buttons with me. Denzel Washington, who directed, plays the debate coach Melvin Tolson. He is fiercely intelligent, proud, politically active, angry, fearless and demanding. Washington makes him truly convincing. His debate team includes a 14-year-old budding genius and a brave young woman breaking gender and race barriers as well as a philanderer with a roving eye. Forest Whitaker plays the 14 year-old's father, a preacher with an angry exterior but a  soft heart.<br />  The movie explicitly shows the humiliations blacks suffered living in the South, including a horrific lynching. It portrays the self-hatred such scenes inspired in blacks who had to suffer them without the power to do anything about them.<br />  One interesting aspect for me is the movie's constant refrain that education is the way out of this poverty and humiliation. By training their intellects, African Americans can reclaim their autonomy, confront their oppressors and build a better life, the movie argues.<br />  I am afraid this lesson has been lost somewhere along the way. In those days, people paid good money to watch colleges debates and they were even boradcast on national radio. Today, we're all about glorifying rap singers and basketball players. All our communities, but especially the African American community, are the poorer because of it.<br />  The documentary accompanying this movie shows some of the real-life characters who inspired it. You listen to those fierce, passionate, articulate, educated voices and you not only are filled with admiration for them but you also bemoan the state we've reached now.<br />  This movie isn't perfect. It's a little formulaic perhaps. But its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It's good entertainment that also carries a message we need to hear.reached now.      This movie isn't perfect.

B0000CE0JH|5.0|Rufus Wainwright has discovered that he likes the mantle of quasi-stardom; on \\"Want One,\\" he finally lets his inner opera diva/drama queen loose across his music. His lyrics are quintessential Rufus, tinged with the psychic echoes of his recovery from methamphetamine addiction, and his songs go from the bittersweet but celebratory, Bolero-backed \\"Oh What a World\\" to the frighteningly falsetto, fawning, and finally freeing \\"Vibrate\\" with no jarring transitions between the various styles and genres he prances through and around. Definitely my personal favorite album of his; if you'd like to hear what happens when the aforementioned diva/drama queen gets far too comfortable being large and in charge, check out Rufus' sequel to Want One, the creatively named \\"[[ASIN:B0007TURAW Want Two]].\\" The only songs justifying a purchase of the follow-up album were put together on a \\"teaser\\" compilation, \\"Waiting for a Want,\\" released between the two albums (but I believe only available on iTunes--at least it's no longer on Amazon). Things definitely calm down somewhat for his latest album, \\"[[ASIN:B000O78LH8 Release the Stars]],\\" which seems more in tune with what initially attracted me to this album.

He gets a little carried away with the new technology, connecting the computer to every electrical appliance in the house, and when he attempts a massive upload, he gets way too much information, and a lot more than he bargained for.<br /><br />His new neighbor Madeline (Madsen, looking young and gorgeous) is a cellist, and in the best musical duet of all time, she shares a special moment through the heating duct.<br /><br />Soon there's a little rivalry going on between man and machine, making for a most unusual and enjoyable romantic comedy for the ages.  Look for ever-so-cute Maxwell Caulfield in a small part, and enjoy the soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder, Jeff Lynne, Culture Club and Philip Oakley, among others.<br /><br />One small note - although most of the movie is fine for kids from 10 and up, there's one scene where the computer repeats an expletive a few times that you'll need to watch out for.<br /><br />I'd like to join the universal call to release this classic on DVD for a new generation to enjoy.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 7, 2008
B0000024PC|5.0|The additional, unexpected tracks of music are fun.  Such as a foxtrot and the stipclub music scene from the film.  Dated in a charmingly retro way.  The affair of it's day (young man-olderwoman)is perhaps even more relevent or comon today.  The tongue-in-cheek humor of the title track ,Mrs. Robinson, is kinda campy and fun. The folk-rock style from the eras well known artists is easy on the ear and to sing along with as one drives etc. Overall I got more than I thought I'd get due to the tracks from the film that I hadn't expected. It's a fun collection of music.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|[[VIDEOID:26551231]]<br />To tell the truth, the spider wasn't a very good choice for the lead role in this movie clip. He refused to walk on anything else but a perfectly smooth floor, so you can imagine the problems filming in an apocalyptic world.  He wanted nothing but batteries at the buffet, demanding 2 AA AND 2 AAA batteries for each meal - and he insisted on eating every 30 minutes.  He also wanted his own Creature Handler.<br /><br />It was a Director's nightmare!<br /><br />Fortunately, the Creature Handler exercised tact and patience, and we were able to shoot this movie with minimal delays, even with a spider-diva.  Finding the remote to push his buttons was a snap. The remote is clearly marked, and is oval-shaped (like a spider egg, they tell us), and has only two buttons - Go and Rotate.  Of course this means he can't go backwards, and to get him to back up, he has to spin all the way around. We were even considering filming him walking and then running the clip backwards.<br /><br />With regard to stealthy attacks, forget it!  This guy is as subtle as a bulldozer, and you'll hear him coming a mile off.  However, he is realistically hairy and moves like a real (really BIG) tarantula and he's got these glowing red eyes to creep you out.  I guess we hired him for his looks and not his personality.<br /><br />Anyway, in summary, this spider looks great (if you're into hairy, ugly things), walks great (but with too much noise) and is somewhat limited in terms of mobility. On a smooth floor he can walk and spin with the best of them, but that's about it.  Entertaining for a while, and a pain in the tail if you want him to star in your horror movie.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 7, 2008
031606792X|3.0|unlike most readers, i started the entire saga just as she released \\"Breaking dawn\\", so reading from twilight to the last one was a seamless transition. most people reading the reviews aren't reading to see if this book is worth purchasing; it's to see what other people think. so instead of a lengthy and verbose review with a grip of spoilers, i'll just state my opinion on this saga.    i don't think this is the end of bella and edward. or rather, the cullens. i think meyers will write more about the olympic coven - or even some of the other covens she introduced in this series. this was just the start of all the many stories (and fans and pay checks and movies and endorsements) to come.    she had and has the potential to create more stories because the characters she created can be possibly interesting. if she makes them two dimensional, maybe not. for an example, i felt that she overly simplified rosalie and jasper's stories. and there's also the mystery of alice that can be further explored. and emmett can't be all brawny jock-vamp. carlisle. esme. there's more... and jacob and his imprint on nessie... how nessie reacts to this as she matures. (though i thought if jacob imprinted on tanya or some other vampire, it would've been much funnier. nessie was just too expected.)    reading things from jacob's perspective in this book was interesting. he's different from bella. his sarcastic and cynical perspective on everything is refreshing, since i was getting nauseous toward the end of \\"Eclipse\\" when she was hiding away with jacob and edward and later seth and her view on all of this. his voice in this book initially made me a bit weary, as i hoped to read the entire book from her perspective, but i have to say, i appreciated his thoughts.    somehow, and i don't know if it's because bella suddenly became an immortal teenage vampire mother/wife, but the dynamics and intensity of her relationship with edward just became distant from the reader. it suddenly felt likewe're not supposed to know the inner workings of married couples or something. sorta a downer, after three previous books of \\"omg, i can't live without him/her!\\" and because it just felt goopy and sloppy at the end, i can't exactly find myself feeling like the series has come to an end. there's too much potential she's letting go of.    oh well. who knows? she might just go and add on and create the cullens chronicle, where the twilight saga - about bella and edward - is just one saga of many. that'd be nice. i can live with that...    ...because i'm reading the host right now and i keep falling asleep. as simple as the whole twilight saga was, it was easy to read and be absorbed in. in some way, a female, regardless of age, will want a man who loves her that much and has that much mystery about him. if meyers establishes something for many readers out there, it's that it's possible that most men in this day and age are just dull/boring. or at least, that's what she makes it sound. heck, i'd like myself a volvo driving vampire that blings out in sunlight. i'll take two to go, with a side of fries, thanks.    but for now, i'll wait. i wish this book ended with a stronger note. the whole face-off with the volturi seemed weak - what, suddenly bella is wonder woman? good grief. for all the fear that meyer was trying to establish about the italian coven, it was just a hollow bark.    i'm not exactly sure why she's coming out with the official guide (was this saga THAT difficult to comprehend???), but she might just want to spend that time starting on a new saga based on the cullens. ok, i'm done for now. :)
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Duffy (originating from Wales) has seemingly come out of nowhere with this album, inviting obvious comparisons to other recent Brit-girl invasions of the US like Amy Winehouse and Adele.<br /><br />\\"Rockferry\\" (10 tracks. 38 min.) starts off with the Motown-sounding title track (and first UK single) and the album rolls on from there, with \\"Warwick Avenue\\" (3rd UK single), a very nice tune. The girl has the singing chops, no question about it, check out the almost a-cappella \\"Syrup & Honey\\". One of the highlights of the album is of course \\"Mercy\\" (2nd UK single), which is finding airplay on US mainstream radio stations. In all, the album flows by effortlessly and sounds great from start to finish. Other highlights include a great \\"Serious\\" and the pensive but beautiful closer \\"Distant Closer\\".<br /><br />I saw Duffy at Coachella earlier this year, her first concert appearance in the US. She acknowledged as much, and she was visibly nervous, but put on a nice set anyway, bringing pretty much all of the songs of this album, although when I compare her set to Amy Winehouse's set last year at Coachella, it paled (Amy Winehouse had major stage presence, Duffy is still learning). That said, \\"Rockferry\\" is a pleasant debut album, and I will keep an eye on her.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|Great movie for the family.  Would have been nicer not to have a few \\"colorful\\" words in it but overall a good family flik.  But most folks already knew that.  What I'm quite impressed about is the BluRay transfer.  Not bad at all!  For a movie of this age the picture is very sharp.  I've seen more recent movies that aren't this sharp.    To me, the BluRay version is definitely worth buying over the \\"regular\\" DVD and at current prices quite a bargain!
B0017MO10U|4.0|\\"Continuum\\" is a to-be-expected episodic continuation of the SG-1 series.  It doesn't fill in any gaps or danglers left from the series as did the DVD-only release for \\"The Ark of Truth.\\" The quality and story is top-notch as always although it's more of a small-screen episode. The extra features certainly make it worth watching (Amanda Tapping and submarines... by way of e.g.), if not purchasing for a home library.    The biggest thing about SG-1 is that it was such a compelling episodic piece that TV without it is bland... just as when the Star Trek serials were killed off by the bean counters, or BSG by it's regenerators... at least there's \\"Stargate Atlantis\\" for now... and the hopefully continuing DVD-only pieces like \\"The Ark of Truth\\" and \\"Continuum.\\"  If you like SciFi, \\"Continuum\\" is a collector or SG-1 fan's must-have.
B001934SOG|1.0|i ordered this twice and both dvds had problems breaking up and stopping i tried 2 different dvd players and two pc and they both did the same.i dont want dvds like this.
B000WCDI64|5.0|I cannot get enough of Amy Winehouse. Thank you for sending this DVD so quickly. It is a wonderful DVD. I absolutely LOVE Amy's brutely honest ways.It would be nice if everyone would be so honest.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Very violent, hence the name of the movie, but it is excellent.  A work of art in its own right.

0262731541|5.0|Way more information than a casual reader needs, but chock full of engineering and design information for a bike builder. Also a good reference to refer to for evaluating performance and design claims by bike retailers. Before you plonk down $2000 for that special road bike, check the stats against this book. Oddly, steel frame bikes are pretty darn good when designed and built right. Do you need carbon fiber? Hmm.
6305428042|5.0|Bette Midler really shines in this movie. If your looking for a laugh on Holloween this movie will give you that. I think it is a well done movie that the family can enjoy. I absolutely love Bettes singing in the movie.
B000EWBKKI|3.0|This Blu-Ray disk is unimpressive.  The output from my PS3 was similar to that produced by the old DVD that I have of the same movie.  There was some improvement in the sound quality, but not significantly.  The Blu-Ray disk includes no interesting new features.<br /><br />If you already own Terminator 2 on DVD, I would not bother purchasing this version.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I first saw this mini series in bits and pieces. I knew it was good, but seeing it from beging to end, I believe it is absolutely great. It is a great tribute to the veterans of World War II. This series is well worth the time spent watching.
B001EN71HC|2.0|Unless I missed it, there are NO outtakes,gag reel,bloopers on any of the 3 dvd's. You would think New Line, Jay Roach,or Mike Myers would have thought to add this to this set. What a shame.!! I was really hoping for some outtakes.
B00188KD1Y|5.0|You should see this movie. Not really boring. Most action and no stop! Its same since the transporter! Jason is great action and look very serious guy!  You better watch it !
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie makes me wanna cry. I love the actors and Black Jack is totally different in this movie. Worth to watch with boyfriend or husband, haha.
6305127697|5.0|Wonderful, quick and easy transaction. Quality product received in perfect condition, and very quickly. I'm totally satisfied with this transaction and would not hesitate to buy from this seller again.
B0015519VS|5.0|I love this man and I also love this CD. The songs are great and the music is so sensual. My husband and I listen to it all the time! A real turn on =)
B000T9OP7G|5.0|When I heard about this show, I was both excited and angry.  I always thought the Terminator COULD make a decent television show, but i don't trust Fox.  They tend to create great shows and then cancel them before they can find their audience.  They canceled Firefly, Dark Angel, Point Pleasant, Space Above and Beyond, and Drive (an amazingly addictive show that they didn't let reach the fourth episode).  They even tried to cancel Family Guy.    I knew it would be a decent show, but i was afraid to invest myself in anything remotely related to Fox and have it taken away AGAIN.  I'm still worried (Dark Angel was given a Second Season), but I'm glad I gave it a chance.    This show does everything right. I'd heard it was taking place after T2 and before Judgement Day.  So i was afraid they'd write themselves into a corner with the set future of the rather awful T3.  A quick time travel jump in the first episode immediately erases T3 from the Timeline.  \\"There is no fate but what we make.\\"    The whole cast is about as good as Television can get.  Summer Glau is especially amazing as John Conner's new protector.  But it is when Kyle Reese's brother is introduced that the show really takes off.  Yes Brian Austin Greene is a strange choice for the part, but he really pulls it off.      We see how a terminator goes about regenerating it's living tissue when it has been overly damaged.  We see more of the future (including a couple of the rubber skinned terminator models mentioned in the original film).  We meet some of Sarah Conner's gun running connections from before her time in the institution. And we see plenty of Terminator on Terminator violence.  What a great show.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I like this movie because one of my favorite actresses gets to show her mean side.  She usually place the heroin or nice girl and it was great to see her twisted.  Other than that I love movies that reflect what happened in history and Henry VIII was in one of those time periods that makes you want to find out more and watch more movies. My interest started with the first season of the TUDORS.
0312427999|1.0|A less-than-stunning and and under-researched, or better yet NOT RESEARCH misinterpretation of M. Friedman's contributions to a free-market society, perhaps, fallacious would be a apt descriptor.  Or is it that I missed the point, that this is a work of fiction?  Since Naomi obviously failed to read any of Friedman's writings those interested in the book should consider \\"The Klein Doctrine, The Rise of Disaster Polemics\\" (see CATO).
B0017HRCQU|3.0|I'm looking forward to see the visual quality the same like as \\"Casino Royal\\". But, this film has fallen short of my expectations. The qulity of visual is so little bit better than DVD. But,\\"Dark Night\\" trailer would be help soothe my nerves. This trailer has a very shrpness and excellent visual side. So, I look forward to wait the release of \\"Dark Night\\".  Anyway, This film has a ordinary sound, visual and so on.  If you would be a crazy BATMAN fan, you must be purchase this title. But, If you were not, I would not recommand to buy this disc.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Selling this without the cable you need to use it is insulting. If you're paying $50 for this this you can afford the cable, but getting it out of the box and having to go back and find a cable is an annoyance. Be warned.
B00013RC8O|4.0|Excellant car film. Great car chase and driving.  Also a hint of sadness and lost hope.
0756404746|5.0|I loved this book, I read everything and in this genre and this is as good as it gets. Having read it just a few weeks ago, my only disappointment was finding out the sequel wasn't out yet!
0321544080|5.0|Really great book on how Joe McNally achieves his photowork. Great for developing a view on creating great photo's yourself. Written in small chunks. Every page dscribes a photo. Fun to read due to easy to read language. Professional terms explained.
1572816112|5.0|Valenza's highly stylized drawings are evocative, provocative, and fabulously unique. Each card is painstakingly illustrated but lacks the glitzy clutter of so many over-fluffed decks out there that lose themselves in dumbed-down beauty. This deck demands that you pay attention to the meaning of the card, not just how lovely the pictures are. As the author mentions in one of his interviews, there are no \\"filler\\" cards in this deck... and it shows.<br /><br />The physical cards themselves are rather slippery, making them a tad difficult to handle without spilling them. But this made me pay attention to how I shuffle them, and I'm sure with further use it will be easier-- but just something to note.<br /><br />So far, the readings I've done using these cards have been full of wry humour and straightforward truth. This deck has a crystal clear \\"personality\\" that refuses to compromise. Absolutely no fluff here, just an unabashed and incisive approach to \\"traditional\\" Tarot reading.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I ended up getting this deck a bit wet when I dropped my bag into a snow bank. The glossy sheen that I mentioned before made the cards feel slippery actually saved them (thank goodness) from total ruin! There was minor edge damage to the two cards on either end of the deck, but other than that, it's perfectly fine. I still love this deck and use it regularly, both for myself and others. I find people respond to the images strongly-- for better or worse-- and that seems to help make the readings memorable and poignant for everyone involved.
0618680004|2.0|I admit openly and before everyone now: I did not read the entire book. Whatever that means to you, to disregard this post or not is certainly up to you. But doesn't everyone read a little bit before purchasing a book? I sat down at the local bookstore and cracked this book for 30 minutes and since I speed-read well enough was able to digest enough of the book to know it wasn't going to get any better. I skipped around to other chapters and wasn't any more enthused.     From what I gathered, I won't say the man is uneducated because he seems to be well aware of world history and at least an overview of the Bible. Yet I could not find any real strength in any of his arguments. I did find a man strongly opposed to God and perhaps if I had read longer I would have understood why. I imagine he has some sort of chip on his shoulder.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have used other workout DVDs, but love Jillian's work out because it lasts for 30 minutes and you see results. Sometimes there is not enough time in the day to try and squeeze in a workout and this makes it possible. I would recommend this for other people to use.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I would highly recommend this CD!  The songs are so upbeat, I can't stop singing them!  Jeanne
B000N4SHOE|4.0|Though I usually don't like Americans faking accents, instead of the other option - actually hiring one of the many fine Brit actresses (Rachel Weisz, maybe) - still, Renee Zellweger did a believable job.  Well, at least for us yanks.       The brief animation sequences were perfect.  If you are an illustrator, you'll know what I mean, since most of us talk to our characters, imagining what they might say or do in response.       Ewan McGregor was a good choice for Renee (Beatrix) to cozy up to.  McGregor showed that he is actually a better dramatic actor than an action-adventure hero, though I blame the stiltedness of his Star Wars character mainly on bad directing and monotone writing.  Too much focus on CG and after-market merchandising and not enough on quality story telling has made Lucas a mediocre moviemaker.  Still, Ewan's subtle physical comedy and period- appropriate inhibitions elevated the entire [Miss Potter] work.       Since I don't know much of the true history of Beatrix Potter, I'm not sure how much artistic license they took in portraying her life and personality, but I know Renee is usually spot-on in her character work.       As for the title, I got the feeling they were trying to draw attention to a film that the producers may not have had much confidence in, thereby, leaning on the modern popularity of the Potter name (Harry Potter).  One may believe, based on her independent nature that the title was chosen appropriately, but why not then call the movie, \\"Beatrix,\\" which would have been much more compelling and, by the way, my choice.  Face it, Beatrix, in contrast to her family, was as un-Potter like as her warm, earthy characters.  Undeniably, you will agree she was the quintessential Beatrix.     Despite average marks for the title choice, I think, this film nobly meets the expectations of most PG moviegoers and is entirely worth seeing.  Parents might pick up a couple Beatrix Potter books for their children to read prior to viewing themovie, so they can better relate to the person, Beatrix Potter.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|2006 was a good year for me when it came to music; alot of my favorite bands at the time were coming out with great albums. But the best one came from a band that was not one of my favorite bands at the time; and that album was Black Holes and Revelations by Muse. At this time, I was just a casual fan of the singles, but after eventually hearing this album, I am a devout fan (in fact, Muse are now my second favorite band).<br /><br />1.Take a Bow<br />An intro that sounds a bit like something out of Origin of Symmetry, and I think it's just as compelling as some of the highlight tracks of that album (New Born, Bliss, etc.). Quite an epic intro, and much darker and more mysterious than most of the rest of the album.<br />4.5/5<br /><br />2.Starlight<br />Here's a nice little turn; this is of course one of my favorite songs on the album. The poppiness doesn't bug me at all, and this is just a very enjoyable song.<br />5/5<br /><br />3.Supermassive Black Hole<br />If this song doesn't convince you that Muse is not binded by any genre, then no Muse song will. This is an odd turn, but that odd turn made into a great song.<br />5/5<br /><br />4.Map of the Problematique<br />This song is simply amazing. Besides track 11, this is definitely the most epic song on the album, and boy does it deserve that title. It's like 2001: A Space Odyssey in song form. Its just far too great to describe. Probably my favorite song on the album, and it might be my favorite Muse song. I'd like to give it more than 5 stars.<br />5.5/5<br /><br />5.Soldier's Poem<br />Now we're given some significant room to breathe. This is a light, quiet song, which is a definite change from the previous songs. This is pretty nice, nothing that will amaze you like the previous song, but it's a nice song to listen to when you want to relax. Also, let me point out that Matt doesn't use that much falsetto on this album; basically this song and Supermassive Black Hole are where most of the falsetto on this album is.<br />4/5<br /><br />6.Invincible<br />Another ballad, but a better and more engaging ballad, I think, than Soldier's Poem. Very good song. It almost makes 5 star status, but it's not quite there.<br />4.5/5<br /><br />7.Assassin<br />Definitely the loudest, most unchained song on the album. Sounds almost like something off Absolution, but it fits here nicely. Some moments of this song, I have to say, achieve greatness.<br />4.5/5<br /><br />8.Exo-Politics<br />Here we might find one of the more \\"catchy\\" guitar riffs of the album. Well, no problem with that, because it's a great riff in a great song. Does it bump the insanely-creative factor as much the first 4 or so songs? No, but it's still great fun to listen to.<br />5/5<br /><br />9.City of Delusion<br />Ah, here's a wonderfully epic and complex song. The string and horn instrumentals are just far too good to resist; it's just a really, really great song.<br />5/5<br /><br />10.Hoodoo<br />This is the best ballad on the album. The instant tempo changes in the beginning and piano interlude here are just genius. I love it.<br />5/5<br /><br />11.Knights of Cydonia<br />Now we reach the infamous Knights of Cydonia. This is bar none an amazing song. It's arguably the band's most notable, and for good reason. The epic-notch of this song is turned up to 11, and I dare you to resist its power. It's quite amazing stuff.<br />5/5<br /><br />12.Glorious<br />A lot of people won't be hearing this song, since it unfortunately does not come on the U.S. release of the album; sad but true, because this would've made an excellent close for the album. As a previous reviewer noted, it's like a Glorious celebration after the final battle of the Knights of Cydonia. Try to find this song any way possible.<br />5/5<br /><br />So far, this is my favorite Muse CD. If you don't have it, and you love music, then by all means necessary, get it, cause you won't regret it.lad, I think, than Soldier's Poem. Very good song.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|BOTH versions of the movie are on this blu-ray disc. The sound and picture are great even if the people seem soft in a few scenes. The extra features are nothing to write home about, but there are more here than on the standard DVD version (non Director's Cut). It also comes with a free download of the movie in standard format. Overall, I'm very pleased.
0385334206|5.0|Vonnegut has one of the most original writing styles out there...and Breakfast of Champions is one of his best. This book is worth it for the drawings alone - which make it utterly unique and playfully genius.    If you're a Vonnegut fan and haven't read this yet, you're in for a treat.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|I love the old Judas Priest but am also pleased to hear that this new album is a serious effort to try to break new ground. These guy have lot of albums and it would be easy to just spit out some \\"formula\\" trracks that worked for them before,but here they are really breaking new ground and for an \\"old\\" band, that says alot.It's still Judas Priest and it great to hear that they still have great ideas and arent afraid to try them out and still have their signature sound as well.
0743298039|5.0|Get comfortable - make your self cocoa and plump up the pillows - its going to be a long night!  I started to read the book the beginning of the weekend.  Put it down.  Woke up at 4 a.m. and finished it at about 10 a.m. I'm tired, but happy.      Thrilling and mysterious it weaves its spell, making you think you know what is going to happen next, and happy about it, only to find out it twists in another direction.  And what satisfaction at the end, to find that every question you have gets answered!    The prose is beautiful and haunting.  This is a book to pass on to friends and to re-read.  A great gift for the winter holidays.  I can't believe this is a first-time author and hope she has more than one tale to tell - at least thirteen!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I figured that people would either love or hate this series. For the non historian who just loves historical movies represented on the big screen for their lavish costumes, and well acted script this series delivers. This series does very well at depicting a long forgotten way of life and the hardships that people had to deal with without the luxury of dentists, and modern vaccinations.  To me as long as a historical movie doesn't have something that is so unreasonably possible, ie. a spaceship in the background or an actor holding a starbucks coffee then I can appreciate it for what it is.  This move is great Hollywood entertainment and something that I would feel safe for my kids (at an approriate age) to see.  I say that any movie that can encourage a love and an interst in History gets my vote and this series deffinitely delivers.
B000002LRX|5.0|For me, this is the best Faith no More album. I had this one when it was in fashion almost 16 years ago but I had to sell it...I did not know what I was doing at this time. Happily, I found it in Amazon and I don't miss the chance to have this jewell in my collection again. Thanks Amazon!
1400032717|4.0|Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone, an autistic boy with a talent for math and logic, resolves to unravel the mystery behind the murder of a neighbor's dog.  This leads to a series of events that will turn his life upside-down and solve a few mysteries that he didn't even know existed.    Mark Haddon has succeeded admirably at a most difficult narrative challenge--telling a story completely from the perspective of a child with Asberger's Syndrome.  As a public school teacher, I've had some contact with such a child and recognized many of the behaviors described in this book.  However, Haddon goes deeper with a plausible presentation of the thought processes behind them.  Christopher's inability to interpret commonplace daily interactions and emotions is effectively dramatized by the reader's ability to infer with perfect clarity what the people around Christopher are thinking and feeling from his detailed descriptions, despite his own inability to decipher their behavior.  This leads to one of the most heartbreaking aspects of the book; his father's love and the sacrifices made on Christopher's behalf are painfully apparent to the reader, even though Christopher himself is not equipped to recognize them.  A lengthy trip to London toward the end of the novel results in a significant dead spot when the pace should be picking up, but otherwise this is a note-perfect performance.

B0017MO10U|5.0|If you are a die hard SG-1 fan, this movie is a must. Period. Cast, story and plot are great and like some of the best SG-1 episodes. Take if from a longtime and active gateworld.com member. You will not be disappointed.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I'm gonna be honest and say that I;m giving this movie 4 stars because of the performance of Marketa Irglova. Take this novice actress away and replace her with someone else, and the movie will be worth less than half a star.<br />I didn't think the music was that great. I only find Falling Away and Marketa's piano piece about her husband passable. All the songs have too much angst to interest me much. Music aside, Irglova pretty much stole the movie with the scenes she was in. Her sincerity and occasional goofiness makes her shine through her dull male co-star.
B000O5AYCA|2.0|I bought this on a punt, it was in the supposedly personalized Amazon recommends for you section. If memory serves me the review said it was moody and atmospheric and it's true I'm a moody, melancholic girl when it comes to music but if this is moody and atmospheric then who can tell because it's almost impossible to hear anything other than the relentless, irritating ratter-tat-tat of the generic sounding, very uninspiring drums which are on almost every track. I do suspect there is a fairly beautiful album under them somewhere and I do mean under because for some unfathomable reason the drums are at the front of the mix. On the few tracks where this is not the case the relief is palpable, the music good. I suspect that if someone could strip the drums off this album entirely there would be a gorgeous, sparse yet rich album, did they just get scared by their potential for beauty?
0515141429|4.0|I'm not sure how to explain this other than to say that the loner guy with a toothbrush in his pocket is an unbelievably sexy character.  Maybe it's because you know that you'll never have to do his laundry or wash his dishes.  Maybe it's because you know he doesn't snore (the guy hardly sleeps!).  Who knows.  But this is a thrilling, fast, fantasy book.  It's not something you read for a college lit. course.  It's not something you'd even read for a book club.  It's a secret, private, sexy thrill.  You just read it.  And ENJOY.

0375423966|4.0|Persepolis as a whole is part of a not-so-new wave of comics that bring true, accessible life stories into the format of comics/sequential art.  It seems that now, when I talk to \\"serious literature\\" people about comics, they immediately mention Persepolis (just had a movie out) and Art Spiegleman's Maus (done in the 80's with no movie likely to ever come out).  I'm still waiting for mention of Optic Nerve and it looks like following this summer's Dark Knight movie, a lot more people will be watching the Watchmen.<br /><br />Persepolis is definitely more Maus than Watchmen.  Satrapi's sometimes magical-looking visual choices provide a device similar to Spiegelman's choice to cast Jews as mice and Nazis as cats in his major work.  Persepolois also does an excellent job of humanizing another socio-political event.  It is perhaps an excellent piece to read currently with the various tensions with Iran/Persia and the nations surrounding it.  Satrapi's story has brilliant intersections of the personal and political and does an excellent job of giving appropriate attention to both.<br /><br />In thinking about what audiences might best benefit from this, I'd say that most adults could find both volumes accessible and perhaps enjoyable.  The second volume might be a bit more PG-13 or R, so if anyone's looking to get this onto a high school curriculum, that might be a bit difficult with mentions of sex, drugs, & rock n' roll.  I'd think that most high school audiences could deal with it well, as Satrapi's presentation of those issues, as with all others in both volumes, is well-contextualized as a real human experience rather than given a shallow glamour treatment.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|This one has rich review, documentary and two versions of each films. However, on the 20th anni. set, there was isolated Jerry Goldsmith score for Alien, now ommited on this one. That shadows this set.     Anyway, if you've got the chance to own it, you won't regret it.

B00000J7SS|5.0|I wouldn't say this is Miles best Album, but I think the experiment as some would call it was successful. If this is nothing more than an experiment in heaping dimished and minor chords on top of each other with tape loops...if people want to reduce it to that I don't object. However I have to say this is Phenomenal. As an experiment it works 100% - I've been listening to it regularly for a long time and have not tired of it. It is magestically apocalyptic with no regrets.

0553296981|5.0|As a young adult I had read articles on the book.  I knew the story.  I saw the movie made from the book.  However, I had never read the book itself.<br />The experience of reading the words of Anne as she lived for two year in hiding with her family, and others in hiding, was entirely different than just knowing the story.  Reading another persons personal words as they were living the life that inspired them to write is a most intimate experience.<br />In my adult life I am glad to have had the experience of actually reading Anne Frank's words.  I recommend the reading of this book to young and mature persons who wish to understand what transpired in our world history on an intimate level.
B000001E18|5.0|This is actually U2's BEST album...it is a scathing commentary on Europe and the world...the musicality of it is top-notch, the experimentation meshed well together, and the topicality of it still rings true to this day as Europe continues to slide into oblivion (partying the night away as Islam gathers strength in the heart of Europe), even as they appear so wonderful and united on the surface...oh, and the WANDERER is the PERFECT song to cap this album, a condemnation...Mr. Cash (and by proxy, the people of the United States) hits the nail on the head with a SLEDGEHAMMER...this album sounds better today than it did when it came out 15 (fifteen!) years ago...most people then were not ready for ZOOROPA and many still are not...the title track, Numb, Lemon, Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car and the Wanderer are highlights...more than worth your dollar (or Euro!)

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Let me just say that after watching the last episode, I had tears in my eyes and it made me feel sad for the entire day...that's not a bad thing.  This show can be so emotional sometimes, but no one would expect that from a sci-fi show. David Tennant is probably the best Doctor Who there has been and ever will be and his charm and compassion continue on throughout this series.  There is also some stellar cameos from the enchanting Captain Jack, but most importantly, what the fans wanted to see most, the return of Rose Tyler.  The best series yet.
B001AUKUTU|2.0|This is not a very good Dio album.  Vivian Campbell left/was fired after the Sacred Heart album and Dio's solo work has never been quite the same.  Pretty mediocre songwriting throughout and it once again has that horrible high treble mix just like Sacred Heart.  This one is strictly for Dio die-hards.
B001BYBAQC|5.0|The Fleet Foxes are a rock band that sounds like no other -- imagine a pastoral choir overwhelming a sweeping folk-rock band, in the middle of a sunlit forest in the spring.<br /><br />That's about the sound of the Fleet Foxes' self-titled debut album -- it's a stream of lush, jangly folk pop, edged with a touch of baroque and country-rock. While their \\"Sun Giant\\" EP serves as an excellent prologue (and is included as a bonus disc in the \\"Special Edition\\"), it's nothing compared to the rough-edged grandeur of the full-length album, with its glorious instrumentation and vivid lyricism. It's a stunning little composition.<br /><br />The only really offputting part of the album is the opening five seconds, when an off-key chorale sings, \\"Reeeeed squirrel in the morning/Reeeeeeeed squirrel in the evening...\\"<br /><br />Then the song suddenly melts into a gentle acoustic guitar shimmering with keyboard. \\"The sun rises, over my head/Hold me dear, into the night/Sun it will rise soon in the morn...\\" Robin Pecknold sings with all the solemnity of a choirboy. His voice soars over the steelier riffs and thumping drums, only to settle down with, \\"The sun rising, dangling there/Golden and fair, in the sky...\\"<br /><br />Wow. When an intro is that lovely, just imagine what the songs that follow are going to be like.<br /><br />In this case, it's the shifting folky \\"White Winter Hymnal,\\" with its kettle drums and beautiful campfire harmonies (\\"I was following... I was following... I was following the pack/all swallowed in their coats/with scarves of red tied 'round their throats\\"), followed by the endearingly energetic rocker \\"Ragged Wood\\" (\\"You should come back home/back on your own now!\\").<br /><br />It gets no less endearing after that: Gentle bluesy ballads, jangly folk-pop with lots of squiggly mellotron, sweeping pop chorales, bouncy countryish rockers with lots of intertwined guitars. Things get quieter near the end -- the Fleet Foxes end the album with a trio of lower-key, folkier ballads, sometimes with nothing more than Pecknold's voice and a guitar.<br /><br />And the Special Edition includes what every Fleet Foxes fan should have -- their debut album \\"Sun Giant.\\" It opens witha solemn harmony of choir-like vocals accompanied only by a plucked mandolin. \\"What a life I lead when the sun breaks free/as a giant torn from the clouds/what a life indeed when that ancient seed/is a berry watered and plowed,\\" the Fleet Foxes intone, sounding very innocent and awestruck.<br /><br />Then the tone shifts with the eerie, sort-of--medieval \\"Drops in the River,\\"  the catchy folkpop \\"English House\\" with its woobly synth and countryish riffs (think a folksier Grizzly Bear). The rock sound becomes a bit more organic after that, with the smooth, tight pop melody of \\"Mykonos,\\" but it's still punctuated with jangly guitars and soaring harmonies. And \\"Innocent Son\\" rounds the EP off with a subtle, wistful little folk melody that laments, \\"some twisted thorn tells me you saw me in the night with another...\\"<br /><br />There's something very warm and welcoming about the Fleet Foxes' music -- a blend of jangly rock, folk and electronica -- and there's hardly a song on their self-titled album that doesn't contain that sunniness. And though the bittersweet songs focus on the usual topics -- family, love, lost friends -- there's a strong feeling of pastoral beauty, especially since they're sprinkled with meadowlarks, wood-women, \\"quivering forests,\\" Tennessee and grassy graves.<br /><br />In fact, the lyrics are crammed with vivid (\\"And, Michael, you would fall/and turn the white snow red as strawberries\\") and striking language (\\"I hold a cornucopia and a golden crown\\"). At times, the band's lyrics are pure poetry (\\"Wanderers this morning came by/Where did they go?/Graceful in the morning light/To banner fair/To follow you softly/In the cold mountain air...\\"), but tinged with sorrow (\\"Rust suddenly falling beside me on a ghost of a morning/riding in sorrowto the harbor/far behind me, the bodies of my friends...\\").<br /><br />These songs are wrapped in lush melodies of striking music, which happily swirl together folk, classic earthy rock, pop, baroque and a bit of country. And an acoustic guitar is the lead instrument here; sometimes it's all by itself, and sometimes it's intertwined with a smooth mix of other instruments -- hollow drums, rippling mellotron, steely guitar, and a hint of harp being plucked somewhere.<br /><br />And finally there's Robin Pecknold. He sounds a little off-key in the spare ballads, but in the more complex songs he sounds sweet, strong and truly beautiful, especially when he does that soaring thing. And I have to say, I'm a sucker for the band's sunny chorale sound -- the harmonies really make those melodies sound exquisite, and gives them a more transcendent sound than most folk-rock bands.<br /><br />The Fleet Foxes' self-titled debut is one of the best albums I've heard all year, with its blend of styles and bittersweetly lovely songs.

B000002L7V|3.0|This was the last album featuring the original lineup and started the decline of Dio's solo material.  I have to say the commercialism of this album doesn't bother me as much as most people.  There are a lot of pretty good songs but not really any classics on here.  Vivian Campbell is being pushed in the background on this one as Dio's electing to use more keyboards, I guess to get that \\"Rainbow in the Dark\\" hit, making the album not as heavy as the first two.  My main issue with this album is the horrible high treble mix that was prevalent at the time.  Maiden's \\"Piece of Mind\\" also suffered from this.  I would love to have this record remixed at some point to correct this.
0756404746|5.0|This was a vastly entertaining novel.  In thinking about it, I think I've identified one of the elements that makes it so good.  Yes, the hero is shaped in part by an early tragedy, an almost-necessary component of any epic story.  But part of its enormous charm as a story is how little weight is given to mere coincidence.  Almost all of the trouble Kvothe, the hero, gets into come as a result of his own actions.  Come to that, most of the trouble the other characters find is a result of their actions as well.  Certainly, not all of their problems were foreseeable, but they arose out of the choices people made.  It's more fun than any novel of a character Pressed Into Heroism By Forces Out Of His Control.  If Kvothe is a bit of a blockhead when it comes to romance, well, I sympathize.
B000002L61|4.0|You can tell Dio was trying to use Holy Diver as a template for this album and for the most part he succeeded.  It starts off with a good up-tempo track \\"We Rock\\" and then leads into the title track which is one of Dio's best songs.  There are a few missteps like \\"Breathless\\" and \\"Mystery\\" which keep it a notch below Holy Diver but it's still a fine 80's metal album.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Tarsem Singh zwrocil przed kilku laty moja niepodzielna uwage swoim filmem \\"The Cell\\" (Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vince Vaughan), w ktorym na kanwie horroru maluje  dramatycznie wysyconymi farbami zagadnienia z dziedziny \\"pop-psychologii\\". Tarsem calkiem umiejetnie wykorzystuje gleboko ukryte nastroje sado-masochizmu, aby oprowadzic nas po wykrzywionej jazni ludzkiej, produkujacej koszmarne wizje. Hieronymous B. sciga sie tu z Salvadorem D. Czy wspominalem juz, ze wizje te sa bardzo kolorowe?

W tej historii melodramatycznie dziarski, ale tez szykowny Black Bandit (Pace), w asyscie niewolnika, mistyka, anarchisty, oraz Charlesa Darwina (postac niczym z uciekinier z wyobrazni Rene Margritte'a), zmagaja sie diabolicznym Gubernatorem Odiousem. Dziewczynka, podobnie jak personel szpitalny oraz pacjenci, sa zamieszani w kolorowa (znowu!!) przygode, calkiem w kanonach teatralnej stylistyki Svankmajer'a czy Jodorowsky'ego.

0061537934|5.0|This book was fantastic!  I was a little hesitant when it started out being narrated by the dog but it really worked.  The main (human) character goes through such sad and emotional experiences but with the dog narrating it you are allowed to feel those emotions for yourself and not how the main character tells you to feel them, which makes it all the more personal and emotionally charged.  The other thing I wasn't sure I would like at first was the 'race car' talk interjected from time to time, that seems to draw a parallel to the character's lives, but again, as I got further into the book the racing descriptions were a nice relief from the heartbreaking events and gave a little perspective on looking at life.  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time!

B001EOQWFI|5.0|After learning the majority of this film contained no dialogue, I had reservations about seeing Wall *E. Other than 1926's Norsteafu and Mel Brook's Silent Movie, I never been a fan of silent movies. However, Wall *E is a different kind of film and with no dialogue; the film paints an amazing picture of devoted love, friendship that easily ranks with P.S. I Love You as one of the best romantic films I've seen in the past six months. While the film isn't really for young kids who grow fidgety this is one of favorite Pixar movies along with The Incredibles and the Toy Story films. Wall *E may not be the best animated movie of the summer (that title belongs to Kung Fu Panda); it does contain the most heart.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|Not since The Simpson's Movie, have I enjoyed an animated movie as much as Kung Fu Panda. Jack Black was the perfect choice to voice PO a loveable Panda who longs to be a Kung Fu Panda. The rest of the voice cast including Ian McShane as the bad guy and Dustin Hoffman as the wise sensei are both in top form. The film plays it smart by having the most dialogue come from Black and Hoffman as it's their movie and for a PG rated film the action sequences were quite impressive. All in all a great film that I can't wait to own on DVD and watch with my own son bring on the sequel!

The camera angles are one of the many things that make the film scary.

B0013J30W2|5.0|I've been a fan of Timur Barkoustnyv since seeing his Russian films DayWatch and Nightwatch. After seeing countless previews for Wanted over the past six months, expectations were very high and I must admit while sitting in the theater, my mouth dropped open on numerous occasions at the amazing action sequences. While the film may draw some comparisons to The Matrix (which always over rated to me), Wanted easily knocks out  The Matrix film with more elaborate set pieces and action sequences.  The casting directors were perfect in casting James Mcavoy an unknown (save for The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe and The Last King Of Scotland) to most action junkies in the role of Wesley. Wesley is a loser plain and simple until Fox (Angelina Jolie) walks into his life. I won't give away any more of the plot as the trailers pretty much explain all you need to know. However, I will say this though, Wanted is easily the best movie of the summer thus far and one of the best action movies of the 21st century
0061191981|4.0|I have to admit; I'm not much of a reader.  I tend to read books in order to learn something, rather than reading fiction or autobiographies.<br /><br />I discovered Gordon Ramsey quite by accident.  I saw clips of him on The Soup doing Hell's Kitchen, and I thought it looked interesting.  So then I watched him on Hell's Kitchen, and later on Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares (both the US and British version), and really enjoyed the shows.  Hell's Kitchen was along the lines of the Apprentice.  And Nightmares was fascinating as he worked to turn ailing businesses around.  Despite his in your face bluntness, he seemed to genuinely care about what he was doing.  His passion, and work ethic was extraordinary.<br /><br />So I became curious about this man, having heard some of his comments on a talk show.  I purchased the book, and in a rare move for me, read the entire thing in a weekend.<br /><br />The story of his rise to the top of his game is incredible.  His writing style is as blunt and hard hitting as his on screen persona.  He appears to be telling it how it is.  The writing style is not the best I've seen, but the book is incredibly compelling.<br /><br />He started with nothing, failed in a career in professional soccer, and then worked his way up to the absolute top of his profession as a chef.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Gordon Ramsey, I think you will be fascinated by this interesting read.  I would have given it five stars, but had to deduct one for the occasionally muddled writing style.  However really, this book is worth 4.5 stars easily.

I guess what they meant is a \\"comedy of errors\\" where unlikely-event-follows-unlikely-event to the point of compounded absurdity.  The film doesn't feel like Frank Oz either, but more like a second- (or third-)rate BBC television programme.  Characters enter hysterics, stereotypes are overplayed, and everyone talks in a stage whisper.  I'm giving it two stars primarily for the gorgeous chateau in which it was filmed -- I want to live there.<br /><br />After I kick everyone out.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|The CD was awesome! It arrived a day early and I was so excited that I ripped the package open to get to it...Every song is amazing. You can tell that the Jonas Brothers really put some hard work and effort into the CD, A Little Bit Longer, and certainly did not disappoint!
0307276902|5.0|I first ready Frey's Bright Shiny Morning. I took in all 500+ pages as fast as I could. I gulped them down. I've never encountered such a modern voice. A voice of our time. I picked up A Million Little Pieces knowing full well that components of it were made up. I'm torn as to whether it is a high crime to embellish a memoir. Oprah's indignation is a bunch of show business hype. I feel for those who have turned to the book for some kind of guidance or help. All that said I have two messages for the author. The first is profound thanks for sharing your considerable talents with the world. You are a supremely gifted writer. The second is from Shakespeare's Hamlet... \\"this above all, to thine own self be true...\\"
B000002C1W|3.0|Yes, yes, everyone knows this is not part of the \\"golden era\\" of Pink Floyd, which really runs from Dark Side through to The Wall.  This album is a bit gimmicky and of course it only sold as well as it did because it was issued under the name Pink Floyd, rather than David Gilmour.  All of this is very true.    On the other hand, the critics absolutely panned this album as being nothing more than watered-down dreck.  I think this was a bit much, because this is not a \\"bad\\" album.  In fact, I think it is FAR better than \\"The Final Cut\\" (that one was really a stinker).    I just listened to this today while I made dinner.  It was pleasant background music, and \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"Dogs of War\\" do sort of rock when played loud.  The rest of the album is basically one long and inoffensive, high-tech (for 1987) piece of music which is divided into approximately 5 minute tracks to create the illusion of a proper album.    However, I cannot say this is a \\"bad\\" album.  It is just not one you are going to find yourself playing very often.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Visually stunning.  While the plot might seem a little strange to some people, anyone familiar with Gaiman won't be surprised.  And like I said, visually, it's incredible.  I love this movie.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|One of Jane Austen's novels done to it's best.  The acting and the characters were true to the novel and added a nice vision of what occurs in the novel.  A real \\"must have\\" for the romantic also for the individual that would like to step back into a simpler time.
B000NXP8AG|4.0|Not bad for a police procedural. The setting for the story really sets this book apart from others in this genre - The author does an excellent job of moving the action through Soviet-era Moscow. The oppresiveness is palatable, the politicians corrupt, and the weather so bad you may need to get out your winter coat before the story ends.<br /><br />Martin Cruz Smith brings home the bacon with this story - two frostbitten thumbs up.
0800141660|5.0|Lovely movie that has adapted the novel to perfection.  The characters are portrayed in such a way that you can't help but feel that you are there amongst them.  One of the movies that you could watch time and again - comparing it to the actual novel has been a real pleasure.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|If you've read the novel this movie is based upon ('The Other Boleyn Girl,' by Phillipa Gregory), you'll probably be a bit disappointed in the movie.  Natalie Portman does give a good performance as Anne Boleyn, but Scarlett Johansson is less than stellar as Anne's sister, Mary.  The script focuses too heavily on Anne and her relationship with Henry VIII, ignoring the other characters that made the book so interesting: the Duke of Norfolk, Anne and Mary's brother George and the role he played in Anne's downfall are largely ignored.<br /><br />Those of you who are familiar with Henry VIII are likely to be left scratching their heads over the choice of Eric Bana in the role of Henry.  While I'm sure Mr. Bana is a fine actor, he bears no physical resemblance to Henry at all.  Furthermore, the script writers left his quite one dimensional.  In their efforts to showcase the hold Anne Boleyn had over Henry, he's left appearing like a dog on a leash, rather than besotted.<br /><br />Great time periods are compressed as if events that, in reality, occurred over years and years appear to have happened in just days.  This leaves the film with a disjointed feeling.<br /><br />The role of Henry Percy, Anne's first husband, provides unintentional comic relief.  While he appears in several scenes (and is quite important in Anne Boleyn's life story), the poor character has no lines whatsoever and the actor is left resorting to over-dramatic facial expressions. Very funny to watch.<br /><br />The one bright star in the production is the performance of Ana Torrent as Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife.  Not only are her physical attributes perfect for the role, but her performance is utterly believable and left me wishing her role had been larger.<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with the original novel or Anne Boleyn's story, you may very well enjoy this film.  Do not, however, believe this film is in any way historically accurate.  If you loved the novel and are a history buff, you might want to skip this one altogether and go rent a copy of \\"The Lion in Winter\\" for a great retelling of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine....much more accurate and a good history lesson, too.gether and go rent a copy of \\"The Lion in Winter\\" for a great retelling of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine....much more accurate and a good history lesson, too.
031606792X|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a story that has a lot of twists and they can escape into. It made me laugh, cry, everything. I loved it. At first I was a little iffy because I was just so surprised. I guessed that Bella would end up deciding the fight against the Volturi with her shields since the second book but Nessie came as a surprise, but a good one. I also thought Bella's reaction to being pregnant was very Bella. She's such a selfless person and she loves so completely. I also liked seeing Edward and her through Jake's eyes. They're flawed and i liked seeing it, I liked getting annoyed with them and I liked that this book had a satisfying ending.<br /><br />I seriously don't get what everyone's problem is with this book. It's fiction. Stephenie never said that she was writing to send good messages to teens so if you want a book for your kid that does that then pick up a Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul and get over it. She is writing a fictional story, the story that she had in mind since the beginning, and I thought she did it very well. Who cares if she got everything. Some people actually do so you can't say that NO ONE gets a happy ending. And didn't she go through hell and back to get it? I thought she did.<br /><br />For the most part I'm satisfied with this story because this was a story that Stephenie said that she had written for herself. That's all that I can ask of her. Nessie, Bella's marriage, Jacob imprinting on Nessie... that was all planned since the beginning. This is a book you either love or you hate. I ended up in love.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This is the second copy that I have purchased...unfortunately my daughter loved the DVD so well that I was forced to relinquish my copy.  The acting and production reminds me of the Broadway presentation.  Fortunately, I now can be reminded of the Broadway performance at my convenience with this rendition.

B000YXMMAE|4.0|This is the first Radiohead CD I've bought.  Someone mentioned to me their sound was close to Coldplay and U2 so I picked up the CD.  This is a great CD.  It took be five full listens before I started to really enjoy it but all the tracks are good and the music flows well from one song to the next.  Strong tracks include \\"Bodysnatchers\\", \\"All I Need\\" and \\"House of Cards\\".  Being the first time I've listened to their music, I would compare Radiohead more to the sound of Pink Floyd than Coldplay or U2 but I can see the comparisons with all these bands.
B0016NF06O|3.0|An absolutely wonderful product and combination of two superb talents but unfortunately, Willie's voice is apparantly gone. I have an old vinyl of Willie doing \\"Stardust\\" many years ago and the comparison is saddening.  I wish these two had done this before all Willie could do is talk the song because his timing and touch has not withered.  Robin
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan comes through with another excellent book to trace food from the ground to the dinner table. I appreciated his conversational style and narrative that started from step 1 and ended with a dinner with his friends and family. Pollan muddies the waters about how we should be eating - sustainable, not, organic, not, \\"natural\\", not - it is certainly complex to figure out what we should be purchasing and eating, and what we should not.<br /><br />I did appreciate that Pollan calls out a number of shady practices in the organic food world. Free range chicken is not always as described, industrial egg production isn't sustainable, and you probably would not be interested in eating beef from Wal-Mart after finishing the book.<br /><br />It does not, however, push people to go vegetarian, organic, vegan, or anything outside of our omnivore heritage. In fact, Mr. Pollan goes through a number of excellent arguments about why to eat meat, or not eat meat, depending on the reader's perception. An excellent book that kept my attention straight through.
0790734850|4.0|\\"L.A. Confidential\\" - a classic modern Film Noir - depicts a 1950s Los Angeles riddled with corruption and vice, where no-one can be trusted. Bud White (Russell Crowe) and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) two \\"clean\\" cops with totally contrasting approaches to their work take a stand. Writer/Director Curtis Hanson and Co-Screenwriter Brian Helgeland superbly capture the flavour of the period. The casting is perfect right down to the small roles - and it is ironic that two Australian actors playing the \\"good\\" cops should work so well in this most American of genres.

B001BPJJ82|5.0|The wordsmiths of Amazon have enlightened us all much better than I could at what a masterpiece this film is, so the obvious question for me was how the transfer would sustain. Without any hesitation this BD and film mandate ownership; I feel comfortable in saying that no other film (as a whole presentation) comes close in color, detail, clarity or saturation - than Tarsem's preserved vision here.<br /><br />I have been playing it in the store for several days on the HD display, and without exception it captivates the attention of everyone, even at the slower scenes.<br /><br />The two documentaries on the BD (directed by Tarsem patriot Nico Soultanakis) prove there is something to be said for no talking heads or glossed over narrations in making behind the scenes films. Both are 30 minutes long and are produced identically to the main film, so expect lots of jumping around (literally) and heartfelt moments. The picture gallery is exclusive to the BD and contains 71 beautiful pictures of the cast and filming locations. The two deleted scenes were amazing (only a minute long) in scope and would have been great to see in the film.<br /><br />The quality of the transfer is superb, and even the \\"night\\" shots on the island sequences looked perfect. Outside of the black and white intro, the heroes traveling through the badlands-style mountains tested the contrast/clarity the best (especially the deleted sequence of the same scene).<br /><br />I hope the small volume of negative reviews and other detractors on the Net and elsewhere do not keep one from seeing this incredible film.
0671799320|5.0|I learned a great deal from this book, from the rise of Standard Oil, it's dissolution, wildcatters, and the rise of the Middle East.  I now have a better understanding of the economics of oil. The knowledge this book covers is still applicable today, including Saudi Arabia's continued role in attempting to regulate oil prices, and the risks/rewards of offshore oil drilling, and why too low price of oil is bad (too high is obvious, as we all know with the summer-2008 gasoline prices). It should be required reading for all politicians and also should be read by anyone who voices an opinion (left or right-wing) on energy-related topics.    Highly recommended.
B000000W94|5.0|This is well played and well sung too.Good selection of songs too with Supernatural of course beeing there.The tone of Peter's Les Paul is almost totally there.Indispensable with the Live at The Shrine of the Peter Green Fleetwood Mac.
B0000714BP|5.0|I have treasured this movie for years. I own the vhs version, but rarely want to take the time and trouble ( all that rewinding) to get it out. With the new and used option at Amazon it is very simple to find your favorites at great prices with just a few clicks of a button. Who can imagine those three hansome guys posing as women? Hard to believe but they do it well. Even with those bulging muscles they all are great at portraying elegant \\"Drag Queens\\". This movie is wonderful, funny, and setimental. I never tire of watching it. At the time this movie came out there seemed to be an era of \\"Drag Queen\\" movies. This one, by far, is the best. The others are entertaining as well however; I believe this one tops them all. While watching you can Laugh, cry, and relate to the personal growth of each of the characters as they try to help \\"the little boy in drag\\" reach \\"her\\" true potential. These amazing \\"career girls\\" also give the entire tired and dowdy town a great makeover. I would highley recommend this movie to anyone for a great evening's entertainment.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book, only thing I didn't like was that it was the final book and I wish this saga would never end.  I see a lot of people complaining about the \\"message\\"- I didn't read the book for a message, I read it for entertainment. Yes, some things were quite bizarre, but it is called fiction for a reason.
B00015YVD6|3.0|20th Anniversary Edition!.......Well it's got a good transfer and a few interesting extras, but what it is missing is the actual movie! The DVD has a altered version that removed  the fact that Madison only changes back to a mermaid if she comes in contact with 'SALT' water! It doesn't destroy the film, but it does leave a sour taste in the mouth's of the people who saw the original theatrical version. The film is a very good romantic comedy/fantasy film, I would have given it a better rating if the DVD would have given both version of the film! BOOOOOOOOOOO :-(
0064407667|5.0|It is sad to read some of the pathetic one star reviews here on Amazon. These adults seem to not understand the book at all. Which does not mean it is not a great crossover book to be enjoyed by adults and kids alike.    First of all the entire premise is delightfully original. You get hooked in knowing all the misfortune that haunts the Baudelaire children. Lemony Snicket tells you it is not something you want to read if you like sugary happy endings which makes me wonder why the idiots who gave it one star wouldn't heed this good advice.    Compared to the dull snoozefest that is Harry Potter, this is very much more entertaining, engaging and well written.    He has a way with words and with every book in the series using alliteration in the title and every one with 13 chapters to form the 13 books in the series, makes you more curious about it all. I especially enjoyed his way with explaining some words and phrases to the young reader - noteworthy being - difference between \\"literally\\" and \\"figuratively\\" and the word \\"standoffish\\".    Bad things indeed happen to these young ones and as in all children's book the adults don't seem to understand the evil plot until it is too late. All children's book from Enid Blyton to any book of today shows kids as the brave, enterprising, adventurous and witty ones. It is sad that some adults find this insulting but these protagonists are the \\"heroes\\" of the novel and if there is an adult hero in some novel, no one complains about the kids being portrayed as stupid.    The Bad Beginning starts with very bad news indeed. And the orphans now seek peace of mind in various ways. Children could learn humility, kindness, adventurousness, being polite and also grace & modesty in adversity. These kids are resourceful and stick together and know how to deal with negative and positive influences. There is a lot to learn here for kids and adults alike (especially the one-star rating adults).    The movie version is a very different story from the book but Jim Carey plays Count Olaf by the book.    You will enjoy this book and like me probably collect the entire series. I got all 13 on a Sale at USD 2 each at a local bookstore chain. All hardcover printed in Italy it is a bargain of a lifetime I pulled off.     The wonderful Baudelaire kids with the pretty inventor Violet and the thoughtful all reading Klaus and the cutest baby in literature - Sunny, make for wonderful light reading and I bought these 13 books yesterday and am already into book 2.    Buy the first one and give it a try. Unless you are one of those parents who thinks their kids will become Devil worshippers through something as lame as Harry Potter or are overprotective enough of your kids to bar them from going to a regular school, preferring home education under lock and key - unless you are that type of person - your kids will surely enjoy it very much.    An inspiring story. Better than Dicken's orphans but not as thrilling as Mark Twain's orphans.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|I had a previous review here in which I blasted Ernster and Dermota for their weak voices and Della Casa for her tepid performance, as well as expressing my dislike of the final sextet which for me ruins the drama of the opera.    So what changed? Well I watched it again on a small screen rather than trying to get mono sound out of a 6 speaker home theater system. This doesn't change the fact that Della Casa is a \\"run of the mill Elvira\\" as I said. Nor does it make me like the silly sextet, but it does equalize the voices somewhat. This gives new life and drama to the important parts of Don Ottavio and the Commendatore played by Anton Dermota and Deszo Ernster. The dress rehearsal type atmosphere(no audience) and 50's costumes and sets cease to be noticable after awhile.     Not much need be said about Cesare Siepi who I believe more and more is the greatest Don ever. Same for  Elisabeth Grummer, who again in my opinion was the best Donna Anna ever. Edelmann is a treat as Leporello despite a bad hair stylist.Erna Berger as Zerlina is easy on the ears if not the eyes and Walter Berry is still my favorite Masetto.     Furtwangler has to do little more than be there with a cast like this. Where his genius shows is that he keeps the music moving and doesn't try to make the opera his own when it belongs to Mozart, a mistake too many conductors make.    Taken with all the singers on equal terms this may just be the best Don Giovanni on DVD.
031606792X|1.0|Wow. I have to agree with what everyone else has said who rated this one star. It was way too long, and boring. The first three books took me only a day or two to finish they were so good. This one took me a week! I hope they don't make this book into a movie too, because it will be really, really cheesy. I expected so much more.
B00005JO9J|5.0|\\"Grey's Anatomy\\" is a great series. And here you can watch the beginning of everything! We are the witnesses for the stories of the new interns of Seattle's Grace Hospital which mix drama and at certain point, comedy, why not? Life is like this, sometimes we laught and sometimes we cry. Highlights: Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey, she is a promising brilliant surgeon, and he is her superior and mentor and much more... Lovely couple! Watch it over and over again!
031606792X|5.0|I know alot of people are upset with the book, but I loved it! It's called fiction for a reason people, lighten up. I think if you were team Edward, you'll love the book.
031606792X|5.0|i honestly dont know why ppl say this isn't a good book!!! i mean its really good and of course it's different from the other three books.   **SPOILERS**    Twilight: edward and bella fall in love. james, victoria, and laurent come to kill bella.    New Moon: edward leaves and bella is depressed. she meets jacob and become bffs but then jacob becomes a werewolf. laurent tries to kill bella. towards the end edward tries to get himself killed.     Eclipse: victoria comes back to kill bella.    so...  the 1st 3 books have someone coming after bella to kill her. AND bella is human. in breaking dawn there can't be the SAME story because then the saga would never end! and bella would never be a vampire. and some ppl r saying that she has no sacrifices. but she does! when the volturi r coming bella is ready to send her daughter with jacob. don't u think thats sacrificing? and some ppl said that how can jacob forget that he loves bella? well... its like sam and leah. sam loves leah (as does jacob loves bella) but when sam met emily it didn't matter any more. (same with jacob and bella and reneesme).     and yeah renneesme is a weird name but think about it... a half human, half vampire is unique. so steph picked a unique name.     so really... breaking dawn is a really good book!!!!! i have to agree with stephenie meyer, im really happy with how she ended the book. it ties all the loose ends together.  **GREAT JOB STEPHENIE**    and noooo im not a super crazed fan who thinks all of her books r great... which they r... but still. u get my point.     SO PLZ READ BREAKING DAWN!!!!!!!   ITS REALLY GOOD AND A PERFECT WAY TO END THE BOOK!!!!!!!!  COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER!!!!!!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the second wonderful series Fox had the poor taste to cancel.  The cast is wonderful with powerful roles for women.  All the characters show their flaws and their antics put them not only in great peril but in temporary conflict with each other but the jobs get done, the relationships are strengthened, and you root for the crew of the Firefly.    You just might catch yourself singing along to the theme song.  I'm still free.  You can't take the sky from me.  Oh, that other series you may want to check out is Wonderfalls
B000VDDDY6|5.0|This product is a must have for any Star Trek fan.  The remastered episodes are great and give the orignal series a whole new life.  The price was also suprising low.

015206396X|4.0|The book was recommended by a friend of mine who picked it up on a whim, but had not read it yet and asked me to read it and give her a review.    I'm trying to steer away from spoilers here because nothing annoys me more than reading a book review of a book I haven't read that is littered with spoilers.    I was kind of apprehensive about reading this book.  I started the first couple pages and I didn't fall in love with in.  In fact, I thought it was confusing.  The names were overwhelming.   Plus the concept of the book is that in this world, characters can be \\"Graced\\" with special abilities, which can be supernatural.  Graced sounds too much like a synonym for blessed and I'm not religious at all, so I was afraid this would be a preachy book about ethics, morals and faith.    Once I got a handful of pages in, I was hooked.  I started reading it at 3:00AM and had the first three hundred pages read by 6:34AM.  I had to stop reading because I was beginning to get dizzy.  As soon as I woke up though I started reading it again until I was finished.  I enjoy books with strong female characters.  Katsa is Graced with the ability to kill.  She has speed and agility, has great stamina, has amazing fighting skills, etc.  She is stubborn, yet kind (think Robin Hood).    The romance was every bit as enjoyable as the action. Although keep in mind, if this book were a movie it would be rated PG-13 for sexual content.  There was nothing sappy about the love story, nor was it the main focus of the story.    A lot of the other reviews are knocking the fact that it's anti-marriage.  I don't think of it as anti-marriage.  It doesn't bother me, nor is it going to keep me from recommending the book to others.  I don't think a teenager is going to read this and change his/her mind about marriage.    The only thing I didn't like about it was the names.  I understand that the author didn't want to create a world full of Marys and Johns, but they could have added a family tree or something similar on the inside cover (and what kind of name is Bitterblue anyway?).    I've read the author's blog and I'm quite happy that there is going to be a sequel (because the ending didn't seem finished), although there's going to be a prequel published in October of 2009 first.  I can't wait!!!    I wasn't aware they made trailers for books (as seen on its Amazon page), but I'm glad I read the book before watching the trailer because the trailer was kind of a turn-off.
0440241413|5.0|This book is like watching one of those extreme sports shows. You know that the skate boarder is going to crash and break his arm, but you can't turn away. It was so entertaining to listen to all of Becky's justifications for buying what she thought she needed. Becky Bloomwood is hilarious and one of the most entertaining characters I have ever encountered. I think most everyone can relate to Becky and her spending, I know I could. Even with all her faults I couldn't help but root for her, and I think you will too. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|Long overdue, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" finally gets some respect. Watching the prior version on DVD was akin to looking at a masterpiece of art with the sides ripped off, and the remainder of the canvas smeared with vaseline. It was a most disappointing experiance. No More. This version is razor sharp, and provides a \\"first time\\" experiance. The sunset over the Rio Grande as the Hat Creek boys head to Mexico for some cattle, the Llano, where Gus determines the accurate range of his Winchester; these and other scenes now accurately rendered reinforce the sound argument this is one of the top five westerns ever filmed, and unarguably the best TV miniseries ever produced. Simply put, this long overdue remaster brings out the best in the best. A must for any collection.

ITS HOT TONIGHT,ROAD RATS and even the title track LACE and WHISKEY resemble the older alice.YOU AND ME the hit single was geared towards the elton john,billy joel type audience,still a good song.LOVE AT YOUR CONVENIENCE is almost danceable.the rest is on the pop side with some ballads(I NEVER WROTE THAT SONG)and some church organs and choir thrown in(MY GOD)great variety of songs great album.

B00000K31V|3.0|At first sight, the pod looks horrible and squeashy.  At the end of the show, I am left baffled by the character asking whether they are still in the game or not.  That's the general feeling of this movie.  One just doesn't know whether the game is still on or off, and if still on, on which dimension and how far advanced the players are in the game.  It is an eerie thought that someday, maybe, those gamers out there might just slip into the gaming world and never ever return to the real world.  Splendid performances from Jennifer and Jude.  I find the movie a little too gory and violent, without a clear sense of direction or purpose.  Plugging the pod to the spine is both horrifying and scary.

B0009MDPYM|5.0|I'm not a particular fan of Keanu Reeves's acting (exceptions include, mainly, THE MATRIX, in which I enjoyed his work very much).    I'm an admirer of the original DC-universe comic character Constantine only to the extent that I enjoyed his appearance in the first Sandman graphic novel. Constantine's stand-alone adventures are not so much gritty in a noir kind of way as they are graphically uninspiring, and that, perhaps with some dialogue issues, is why I've never found them engaging, despite their premise.    The film version departs radically from the comic, and, for me, that was a sound approach. Visually, it's far more arresting than the graphic novels and much more noir in flavor--although, obviously, it's a supernatural noir. Although critics weren't especially found of this movie,the script is more than solid, the cast and acting very fine, and the ancillaries (soundtrack, special effects, editing, etc.) all terrific.    You might consider giving it a try.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|*Spoiler Warning*    Premise: A marginally big nerd guides the watcher through Lower and Middle Manhatton without the use of a steady cam while \\"something\\" (a computer generated monster and its spawns) attacks the city. The narrator (previously mentioned nerd) provides awkward, inarticulate commentary on what is going on while the watcher sees the entire cast, one by one, being killed by either the \\"somethings\\" or a result of the \\"somethings\\".    Negatives include: The movie in general lacking any substance, No suspense, Inability to attach to any of the characters, I was never convinced of the reality of the situation as the psychology of the characters (reactions, motivations, behavior) wasn't believable, The previously mentioned big nerd.    Highlights include: Watching one of the female characters miraculously walk around the city in high heels the entire time, Seeing the head of the statue of liberty (as the \\"somethings\\" had broken it off), Seeing another female character live even though she has been impaled, The two characters in the underlying love-story profess love for each other before being blown up by the US military, And my favorite, the death of previously mentioned nerd.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I know people say \\"Snorah Jones.\\" But I like her music - I think it's mature in a good way: music that begs to be listened to, music that's firmly based in craft (she's a very fine pianist) and sung with a clear, expressive voice. Yes, it's subdued and acoustic and, as such, has been embraced by dinner party hosts and easy listening FM stations everywhere. I also like her selections; it's music that occupies the space vacated by Aretha Franklin (when Aretha lost her bluesy grit sometime in the mid 1970s) as much as it addresses the listening public's need for a less austere, horsy (dare I say, less `white'?) Diana Krall. And all of it is delivered with more than a small helping of country twang because - despite the fact that her dad's an Indian classical music superstar and world music hero - Norah's really from Texas.

B0014WSX2K|5.0|John Coltrane regarded himself as one who ceaselessly searched for the next stage in his musical development. He transitioned through various jazz forms from fifties hard bop to the new music of the sixties. He is therefore an influential touchstone in jazz. Along the way, he touched Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, McCoy Tyner, Eric Dolphy and Miles Davies as well as a bevy of talented sidesmen. As his career progressed, he developed a strong three-octave sound on tenor sax, and in the sixties, a soulful lyricism on soprano sax as well.     Complex improvisations and ventures into other musical forms were groundbreaking at the time and deserve to be recognised as such now. The hard-driving tenor sax style we have grown used to since owes a debt to that period.    This 10 CD set amply traces the musical transitioning, and provides a detailed sound, allowing the majestic John Coltrane tone to shine through the mix. However, some interpretive sleeve notes would have assisted in providing a better appreciation of what was a significant jazz career.
B00005JPY0|5.0|The Dark Knight    First of all, The Dark Knight/Batman is not a super hero.  He is very human who can do super hero feats. He gets hurt, and he feels real pain-physical and emotional.    Secondly, there is a love triangle-Bruce, Rachel and Harvey.  Rachel is torn between her love for Bruce, her childhood sweetheart, who she knows is Batman, and Harvey who is every woman's White Knight who is fighting for truth and justice in the judicial halls of Gotham with danger and enemies on every side.  Harvey is as pure as they come in true comic book lore.    Thirdly, every hero needs their personal entourage.  Batman has Alfred and Lucius. Harvey has Rachel and Jim Gordon.    Fourthly, every hero needs a nemesis.  The usual assortment of 30's type gangsters are for comic relief.  The real nemesis, antagonist, for both Batman and Harvey Dent is the Joker, a psychotic rogue.  The Joker's insanity is his genius, a pure sociopath who was abused by his father.    Fifthly, you have the citizens of Gotham who both Batman and Harvey are pledged to protect, even though, there are moments when you wonder why since truth and justice to the citizenry is great as long as they don't have to sacrifice themselves for it. This film shows human nature at its worst and its best.     Sixthly, the noble elements of morality, friendship, love, and sacrifice have their part in a saga which plays out in the lives projected on the screen before us. Like a Greek tragedy we are shocked and silently weep for the heroes as they march to their fate, predestined by the gods for their own amusements.    The Dark Knight is a dark, disturbing piece of film fiction.  Children would find the images haunting their sub consciences for decades to come.  It is an intense film which brings a number of motifs together in a cohesive script.    All great stories share elements of triumph and tragedy.  A hero's personal lost can take many forms.  Both Batman and Harvey react differently to their mutual lost.    Theideal hero is not always the hero presented to the public.  One classic example of this is THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE. Sometimes, the lie is more important than the truth.    In the end Batman makes an unalterable decision like Harvey Dent.  Batman's ultimate sacrifice for Gotham City is a testament that sometimes a hero must become the villain for the greater good.    Jim Gordon becomes the bridge between the truth and the lie of these two true human heroes.

The movie was 4 wonderful hours itself, and had so many special features that gave me a couple more hours to enjoy.   I watched it first from the rental store, but after seeing it, I had to own it.  Tom Berenger and Jeff Daniels were fantastic in their roles.  I have watched it three times alone and a couple more with friends and family.  This is a four-star movie!

0312962118|4.0|[[ASIN:0312962118 Snow Wolf]]<br /><br />My favorite James Bond novel is Casino Royale, which shares only a title with the very silly film by the same name. The character's in Glenn Meade's Snow Wolf are not the exaggerated heroes and villains we all adore in Fleming's thrillers but the novel is a true thriller just the same. What I enjoy most about both is the way the authors capture the chilly air of the early days of the Cold War at its chilliest - and Snow Wolf is not lacking in heroes or villains. This is a book that deserves to be back in print.
B000WOXVJQ|5.0|I've been listening to songs by Bob Marley most of my life, but was unaware of it as they were often covered by others.  Just recently, though, I've rediscovered his music and started listening seriously, and now I can't stop; almost everything I've heard is simply amazing.  It's rare to find an artist who can mix politics, personal stories, love songs and ballads, and do all of them equally well.  Bob writes and sings so beautifully, and I am so grateful his music has come back into my life.
B0007O38XU|5.0|This isn't as good as his earlier films IMO, but that doesn't mean its not a good movie. Nothing academy award winning, but its not bad. Sure there are some corny jokes..ok, a lot of corny jokes, but if you don't find at least one part funny there is something wrong with you. If you liked Robin Hood: Men In Tights you will definitely like this one.
B0018M6J90|5.0|A great period piece.  Terrific acting, especially by Frances McDormand.  Her facial expressions, however subtle, are the best part.  She can act without saying a thing.  The story is lovely and sweet, with a wonderful ending.  I love how she shows the people around her how to listen to their hearts and do the right thing.  One of my favorite scenes is with the cigar; it's priceless!
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|Listen, I actually had a friend give me a free copy of the album and I am STILL Buying my own copy just to support this young lady! This is one of the best albums I have purchased in a long time! Listening to Adele's album makes you so upset with commercial radio! People complain that they want to hear better music and here it is! There are talented individuals out there, however we only hear the same 10 songs on the radio! I encourage anyone reading this review questioning whether or not they should buy the album TO BUY IT!!! I am actually offended that the price is set so low at $9.99! It should be higher!! I pray that she comes to Chicago for a concert! I know I am rambling now but I even searched her out on YouTube, Myspace, Adele.TV and she sounds just as good Live as she does on the CD! When was the last time you could say that! In closing I just would like to say I judge a cd's quality by whether or not I put it on repeat! Well \\"19\\" has been on repeat for 3 weeks for me! Truly Blue-Eyed Soul Lives!!!    I'm from America...we need to step our game up and stop making music into a modeling contest and bring back the real soul singers like Adele!!
B000065BPB|5.0|These headphones are wonderful. Very comfortable and they sound great. You will not be disappointed.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Besides a few songs that I did not like, I would have given this 5 stars. It stars off with Candy Shop which has a hip hop feeling to it in the beginning and Madonna starts singing \\"See which flavor I Like And I'll Have For You\\". This song is basically relating to the Hard Candy title with a lot of lyrics referrring to candy not too many interesting or new sounds or danceable. She has a in your face \\"my sugar is raw\\" which I loved. It's a good song opener, I give it a 5. 4 Minutes, which was the first single released, is a great track, very danceable featuring a duet with Justin Timberlake and Timberland singing in the back. She and Justin sing we only got 4 minutes to save the world with Madonna singing tick tock over again and time is waiting no hesitating. The lyrics with the music incorporated in it is awesome. I give it a 5. The remixes are great too. Give It 2 Me, which was the 2 single released is my favorite song. It's full of energy and some use of  the synthesizer is incorported.  This song is absolutley amazing!! I give it 5+. The remixes are ever better OMG. Hearbeat, starts out with a hearbeating and the use of electric synthesizer throughout the whole song is great.  It's a slow song and Madonna sings about feeling free when you dance and it's a stunning song. I give it a 5 +. Miles Away, the third single to be released, is another absolutely beautiful slow song which is mostly played by the acoustic guitar which also makes it great.  It's song about being so far away from your loved ones, 5+. She's Not Me is a midtemp song about someone copying someone else's looks in anyway to be like her and the other person does not like it. It's more of a song someone from high school may relate too. I give it a 5. Incredible is an incredible song no pun intended. She sings about wanting to go back when to certain times because they were so good. This songs has in a few parts a good excercise feel to it with the synthesizers going back and forth which is great andshe sings \\"it's time to get your body moving\\" during that time. Both of these incorported tell you to move your body. I give it a 5+. Now for the down fall for the next 3. I did not like. The Beat Goes On, is a mediocre songs. It's not that great but it's not that bad either.  It has a couple of good sounds and good lines throughout by Madonna when she sings \\"Say what you like do what you feel you you know exactly who you are\\" among other lines, but it has too much rapping in it by one of the rappers and it's too hip hop. I give it a 3. Dance Tonight sounds like it would be great danceable track it's not. Its another duet with Madonna and Justin Timberlake. This one sounds like Madonna just doesn't even wanna sing it and didn't care about the song at all. There's little music overshadowed by them talking back and forth. It could have been a totally different song or a better version of this if Madonna really wanted it to be perfect and put her usual originality with good sounds and some great lyrics. This just sounds like a J.T song. I think that's what she intended. I give it a 1. Spanish Lesson starts with a good guitar beginning that's about and then hip hop?? and all these different sounds put together makes the song a mess. The song basically says she just wants to fall in love and yo do our home work, not a good song and the lyrics arent that great. I give it a 2.  The Devil Wouldn't Recognize You finally we hear the real Madonna apart from the ones I did not like. It sounds with some very powerful emotional sounds and she sings about a relationship being over but she still comes back to him. Even though the devil does not recognize him and she doesn't either. In the middle you hear a rain sounds and thuder which are beautiful and it ends with the acoustic guitar. I give it a 5+. Voices isn't that great either. The sounds are very lame and nothing interesting at all.  I give it a 2. Over great album -3 the songs I did not like and the medicore one; I highly recommend it!

B001DJ7PR8|4.0|In \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona,\\" Woody Allen begs to contradict another pundit of his age, Mick Jagger. Woody demonstrates in his latest movie that you can't EVER get what you want, and you also can't get what you need. He demonstrates this in the story of how Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), two lovely young Americans staying in Barcelona for a few months, react to the romantic overtures of the dashing, primally sexy artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Vicky--a master's candidate in \\"Catalan identity,\\" although she is not Catalan and barely speaks Catalan or even Spanish--finds that sex with Juan Antonio shakes up her previously solid feelings for her dullish American fiance, Doug (Chris Messina). Cristina--a dilettantish photographer/filmmaker who is defined by the fact that she only knows what she DOESN'T want in a relationship with a man--finds greater satisfaction with Juan Antonio, at least until Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), Juan Antonio's volatile, insanely jealous ex-wife, shows up.<br /><br />Some critics have opined that \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is a hackneyed blast at naive Americans left at sea by European sexual sophistication. However, I think it's more a delineation of Woody's basic belief that happiness in love is transitory at best. How can you possibly hold up Juan Antonio and Maria Elena--who are constantly at each other's throats, to the point that Maria Elena brandishes knives and guns--as an example of sexual sophistication? They can't live with each other, they can't live without each other, but she may end up killing him, herself, and a few innocent bystanders. As enacted in a scintillating performance by Cruz, Maria Elena embodies the eternal irrationality of love, a blind craziness that--at least in Woody's view--stamps an irrevocable expiration date on even the tenderest, most ardent love.<br /><br />Not quite a comedy but certainly not a tragedy, \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is a rueful commentary on the constant dissatisfactions of love and life, made all the more bittersweet by the heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of Barcelona and Catalunya wrapped in golden light by photographer Javier Aguirresarobe. The film offers us multiple pleasures--not least the excellent performances--yet, in the end, it feels slight. There are too many of Woody's familiar tropes for us to take the film at face value, especially the overly familiar characters; personally, I'm tired of the gorgeous, nubile young \\"Woody women\\" who are drawn vaguely toward a career in the arts yet are completely confused about everything except their need for hot sex. And, yes, Woody, we got the point decades ago that you consider life and the Universe meaningless; why do you always have to have one character in every movie (in this case, Juan Antonio) declare that belief baldly? \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is worth seeing, but it falls short of being one of Woody's masterpieces.love and life, made all the more bittersweet by the heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of Barcelona and Catalunya wrapped in golden light by photographer Javier Aguirresarobe.

B000001FO4|4.0|It used to be fashionable to rip on fashionably conscious, 1980s-era bands like Cinderella, whose star was mightily crushed when Nirvana took over the music world in 1991. But strangely enough, despite all the decadent excess that occurred in the rock `n' roll world back in the `80s, today's music \\"scene\\" (if the Internet counts as a music scene) is sorely lacking talented, in-your-face bands like Cinderella. Laugh snidely if you want, but Cinderella and their enthusiastic, hard-touring brethren from back in the day were actual rock stars who regularly sold out arenas, churned out hit songs with ease, sold millions of albums and, most importantly, created some memorable music that has persistently survived. As Tom Keifer, the leader singer of Cinderella, would sagely say: You don't know what you got 'til it's gone.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Long Cold Winter\\" is nothing short of masterful. \\"Bad Seamstress Blues\\"/\\"Fallin' Apart at the Seams\\" combines the gritty world of blues with the slick sound of great `80s heavy metal. Like many lead singers from the `80s, Keifer screams with a been-knocked-around vengeance that's endearing; and to say his voice is raspy is an understatement: it's almost a constant strain that would be painful if it weren't so cool amid the great music he writes. Guitarist Jeff LaBar employs memorable hooks and solos on greats like \\"Gypsy Road\\" and \\"The Last Mile,\\" and like RATT and Def Leppard, Cinderella knew the value of top-notch backing vocals to enhance songs. Additionally, as the times required, a ballad was included on \\"Long Cold Winter\\" -- but thankfully one with substance. \\"Don't Know What You Got (Till it's Gone)\\" is, in my opinion, a genuine rock `n' roll heart-tugger that displays true soul and talent, despite its seemingly cliched theme.<br /><br />Keifer's lyrics are at times defiant. One memorable line on the song \\"Gypsy Road\\" goes, \\"And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky!\\" It's a cool rebuke to the '80s metal critics who scoffed at the teased-up look that surrounded this music, and Kiefer's bold defense in that single line stands up well even today. At other times his words paint a portrait of a rock 'n' roll vagabond who doesn't know the meaning of the word \\"home,\\" perhaps because of the incessant touring his band used to do. And though a few tunes stray toward the generic (\\"If You Don't Like It,\\" \\"Fire and Ice\\"), it took guts to write a total blues song like \\"Long Cold Winter,\\" which, like some of the other tunes, contains a homey, warm feel that make this CD, as its title would suggest, a perfect complement for the wintertime blues.at the teased-up look that surrounded this music, and Kiefer's bold defense in that single line stands up well even today.

B000G8NXYQ|4.0|Federico Fellini's 1973 Amarcord is a film that has often been linked with Ingmar Bergman's Fanny & Alexander as films by old men looking back on their youth. While this is true, in the main, the fact is that Amarcord has a loose narrative structure, in which the lives of many characters are detailed in comic vignettes, whereas Fanny & Alexander is a straight drama. The film that Amarcord shares a deeper affinity with is one which was obviously influenced by it; Woody Allen's grossly underrated and terrific Radio Days. Which of those two films is better is debatable, although Allen's film is tighter, shorter, and a bit deeper in characterization. Allen's opening classroom scenes in Annie Hall also owe a debt to this film's school-based scenes. Amarcord is not a masterpiece, on par with earlier Fellini classics like Nights Of Cabiria, La Dolce Vita, nor 8½, but it is a very good and enjoyable romp, which opened the 1974 Cannes Film Festival and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film that same year.<br />  Reportedly, the proper Italian for `I remember' is `mi ricordo', but Fellini used his own native Romagnolo dialect's version of the term a m'arc&ograve;rd, to limn his lost boyhood in the coastal town of Rimini- which is the central character of the film. Regardless, the film he constructed is a very good one, which follows a year in the life of a town and its citizenry- from one spring to the next, although it heralded the weaker and even more loosely constructed films that ended his career. This is the last film that most cineastes even to bother arguing the greatness of. Yet, many of the labels applied to it simply are not correct- it is not surreal, for it is grounded in reality, even as flights of fancy take place; it is not a satire, even though there are satirical elements. The very impulse to always definitively characterize something as this or that, without allowing comfortable straddling of boundaries says more of the flaws of the critic than they do of the film. Also, despite the picaresque nature of the film it does not move too quickly. Most of the famed scenes plat out in seven to ten minute stretches where small details filter into the subconscious without even knowing it....The musical soundtrack, by Nino Rota, is stellar, and the best thing in the film, although the cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno is not far behind, especially in the sunset scene where Uncle Teo is coaxed down from the apple tree and back to the asylum. Yet, Amarcord succeeds because its totality is greater than any of its great to mediocre parts. It may not be a great film, but it is a great display of artistic excellence to marshal such disparate elements into a film that succeeds far more often than it doesn't.

Interestingly, the LP's credits contain the following note: \\"This album is dedicated to the memory of Richard Mason Blakemore,\\" an obvious jab at guitarist Richie Blackmore, who disbanded the successful Rainbow in order to reform Deep Purple.  Turner joined Yngwie J. Malmsteen's Rising Force in 1988 and sang on the hit \\"Heaven Tonight.\\"  Turner again worked with Blackmore in Deep Purple when vocalist Ian Gillan left the group in 1990; but after one album together, Masters & Slaves, both left the band.

B00006DEFA|2.0|I found that the film was not at all as I expected- a staid Merchant-Ivory type production mixed with a hint of Masterpiece Theater. This was both good and bad. On the positive side is the very dramatic structure of the film, being told from Mozart's inferior rival's, Antonio Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham), point of view. On the down side is the over the top performance by Tom Hulce, as Mozart, especially with that pointlessly distracting guffaw. Also, as the DVD delineates which scenes were altered, extended, or added in toto, it becomes obvious that director Milos Forman's original cut was the superior, as none of the added scenes adds palpably to the thrust of the film. Yes, I liked the added scene of Mozart's wife, Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), getting naked to try to sexually please Salieri, to advance her husband's career, for Berridge was certainly a major hotty with the body back then, but, despite my prurient interest, the scene is pointless.... Unfortunately, in either version, this is nowhere near a great film. It's a fun, solid romp, but the American accents and slang that infiltrate Eighteenth Century Viennese society are just too much, as is Hulce as Mozart. No, a staid portrayal of the man would have been dull, but a genius as idiot savant, or a step above, is not worthy of this dramatic treatment, either. That it only heightens Salieri's frustration is dramatically defensible, but since the whole notion of Salieri's envy and hatred of Mozart is a historical fiction, there really was no reason to go so over the top in the first place.<br />  The rest of the cast does fairly well. Berridge as the clueless wife, Jeffrey Jones, as Emperor Joseph, is a dolt with a heart, who doesn't understand how to run his own life, much less a nation....All in all, I would recommend the film, but as a light diversion, not a serious inquiry in to art nor the artistic mindset. That film has yet to be made.

B000ICL3KG|2.0|Let me state, up front, I have never been a fan of former Vice President Al Gore. He was a right of center Democrat who worked in an administration whose environmental record was considered, by most ecological groups, worse than the two Republican administrations that preceded his, and held that office at a time when the earliest stages of global warming, which he now decries, were first becoming known. As the second most visible politician in the country, did he sound the alarums then? Well, no. He wrote a book or two, but did nothing of any real consequence with the power he had. However, his Johnny Come lately status as an environmentalist, which led to his winning of the Nobel Peace Prize, as well as an Oscar for the 94 minute 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, has nothing to do why it's a bad film. That's due solely to the film's director Davis Guggenheim, most noted as a network television director.... The film is basically two thirds of Gore preaching to the public about global warming by giving a slide show with some neat graphics. Again, the vast majority of what he states is incontrovertible, and the few areas where he exaggerates are minor disagreements between the scientific community where he chooses the worst scenario for dramatic effect. This is forgivable on Gore's part, and even the filmmaker's. It is also quite effective. But, where the film tanks, and also goes way beyond any reasonable standard for calling itself a documentary, is in the interspersed other third of the film, where we get the fetishistic close-ups of Gore as saint aborning, and in the hamhanded voiceovers. Putting aside the fact that the writing of the voiceovers is cringe-inducing (see above), Guggenheim could have at least put on a patina of objectivity by having the voiceovers done by someone else- perhaps another Left Winger like Tim Robbins. Instead, we are left with the unseemly deification of Al Gore....by Al Gore!<br />  Even worse we get a parade of Oprah Winfrey-level sob stories about how tough a life Al Gore has- being born with a silver spoon, political power, and the disappointment of being out-scioned by George W. Bush for the Presidency. There are some genuine bad things that the film inexplicably digresses to, such as his sister's death from lung cancer and his son's near-fatal car crash. So? I mean, what is the point of the film- to act as a documentary about the global warming crisis, or about Al Gore's `indomitable courage'? Such courage which propels him to `walk alone' in airports- as if he's just a `regular person.' Or to spend hours on his laptop computer monkeying with graphs. Ooh, he's deep. Yup. Yes he is. Yessirreebob! But, if Guggenheim could only stop with the up the nostrils viewpoint so many of his shots have. I mean, even if Al Gore is the greatest man in the history of our species, do we really need to be able to count his nose hairs?....Overall, An Inconvenient Truth has important ideas, but is a bad film precisely because those ideas are made secondary to the ego of Al Gore. That is not Gore's fault, but Guggenheim's, yet is precisely why An Inconvenient Truth is a bad film, and not even remotely a `documentary.'l sob stories about how tough a life Al Gore has- being born with a silver spoon, political power, and the disappointment of being out-scioned by George W.

0060899190|2.0|I love PostSecret and I love what Frank has done with the project.  In a world where people are hated and looked down upon for being different, the website makes you realize that there's others out there just like you.  With the same secrets as you.  You feel connected to others.<br /><br />With that said, I think Frank could have done a better job with his first book.  I opened it thinking it was going to be full of secrets I haven't seen before but instead it was secrets that had already been posted on the site.  95% of them were repeats for me.  For Frank to take something that I already saw for free and try to charge me to read them again I thought was a rip off.  I'm glad I read it while sitting in a big comfy chair at Barnes and Noble.  Don't buy the book but I urge others to keep visiting the website.
B000000W5L|3.0|For classic rock bands, the double live album was an essential part of their discography. The double STUDIO album on the other hand was a different animal altogether. Keeping an audience's attention over the course of 4 LP (now 1-2 CD) sides isn't always easy. And the few that worked (The White Album, Physical Graffiti, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Blonde on Blonde, Electric Ladyland) are rock and roll classics. The Who actually accomplished this feat not once, but TWICE (Tommy and Quadrophenia). Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones \\"Exile on Main Street\\" isn't one of them. \\"Exile\\" has always been a difficult album not only for fans, but the band themselves. In the book \\"According to the Rolling Stones\\", Mick Jagger says that Exile is not one of his favorite albums, admitting that while the atmosphere of the album is good, he'd love to remix it as it has some of the worst recorded vocals. And he's right. Half the vocal tracks sound like their buried under a combination of backing vocals and sonic sludge. It sometimes sounds like a badly recorded bootleg. And as gritty as they sound, they don't work well in a live setting either. So other than \\"Tumbling Dice\\", \\"Happy\\" and maybe \\"All Down the Line\\", tracks from Exile don't always figure highly when the Stones choose their set list. I resisted buying \\"Exile\\" for many years because of this, but also because ½ the songs aren't all that great in the first place. If the band had wised up a little and sliced off about half of them they would've had the knockout punch to finish off the classic series of albums that started in 1968 with Beggars Banquet and through 1971's Sticky Fingers (with the live Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out thrown in as a bonus).  If this was possible, Exile would've been a much different (and better) album with only the following songs;   Rocks Off             Tumbling Dice  Shake Your Hips  Happy  Loving Cup  All Down the Line  Sweet Virginia  Casino Boogie  Rip This Joint  Torn and Frayed            So Exile isn'tnecessarily a bad album, it's just one of those Stones albums that should've been much better given the time it was recorded and their previous album (Sticky Fingers). It's also one that now benefits from the \\"skip\\" button on your CD player or IPod.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Seen as one of the greatest musicals of all time, Singin' in the Rain is a great example of the high-time of Hollywood; the evolution of silent film to talking pictures.<br /><br />Starring screen legend Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood, silent picture hero who is trying his hardest not to be stifled by his not-so-intelligent female co-star Lina Lamont(Jean Hagen). With the help of his best friend since childhood the comedic Cosmo(Donald O'Connor) and the new girl in his life, talented Kathy Selden(Debbie Reynolds) they try to tackle the oncoming difficulties of making a talking picture.<br /><br />When their newest film becomes a musical Don is ecstatic to sing and dance, only  Lina's inability to speak with diction, and the fact she can't sing at all causes quite a problem, which ends in her voice being dubbed by Kathy Selden! Only Lina isn't going to take this all sitting down!<br /><br />\\"People\\"? I ain't \\"people.\\" I am a - \\"a shimmering, glowing star in the cinema firmament.\\"<br /><br />I personally adore Donald O'Connor's Cosmo more then much else in the picture his song 'Make 'em laugh' is one of the greatest solo performances of physical comedy and dancing ability I've seen.<br /><br />Yes, there are some mistakes in this film, bad dubbing in the beginning, a few things to complain upon, and I don't believe I'd put it in my personal top ten musicals list, but it is a classic none-the-less. It's not as romantic as West Side Story, and not as visually spectacular as Fiddler on the Roof, but for what it offers, it does well.<br /><br />If for nothing more, Gene Kelly dancing in the street singing Singin' in the Rain is worth the watch.

0743454537|5.0|I have to say this is definately one of the best books that Jodie Picoult has ever written. Any amazing heart renching story from different points of view. She has managed to not only tell a story, and tell in she does, but holds her audiences heart whilst captivating them. A truly unmissable story for those who wish to embark on a tale of the heart.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I watched the little Q&A session on this page, and it hit me that Chuck Lorre said they really like their characters.   I think that's one of the primary reasons that I find it to be so good.      I love any story: movie, book, TV series; where the characters really come alive.  I like Numb3rs for just that reason as well.      There are no (or few) dead stereotypical characters here.  They truly are unique.  And what better fantasy to work out:  The \\"geek\\" gets the really hot girl, because he's a person with heart, and she recognizes it, and may eventually give in to it.  As a 56-year old \\"partial-geek\\", this is the fantasy that all non-buff, non-jock, non-rich guys love; to root for the underdog, especially when we're just like the underdog.     I love this series and am thankful that they've brought it to us.

0446402389|5.0|This book is set in the Soviet Union, around the 1950's during the end of Stalin's regime. I am not conversant with Russia's history, hence, the reason why the book did not catch my interest at first.    During this time, paranoia reigned the streets. Imagine a world where instead of presumption of innocence is the order of the game presumption of guilt becomes the norm. No matter what a citizen does, once the State thinks that he did something bad, he will be arrested and forced (meaning tortured by any means possible) to admit a crime (any crime, it does not matter what). That citizen would then be sentenced to up to 25 years in the Gulag or to face execution. Even when a citizen is innocent, the torture would be too much and eventually, he would break.    This is the backdrop of this novel. The main character, Leo, is a war hero for the State. He is a high-ranking official of the MGB and his first order of business was to convince a family that their child, Arkady, was killed in an accident. The family, however, believed that he was murdered. If the family continues their belief, all of them would be executed. No one disagrees with the State.    Because of his position, Leo's family lives in luxury - meaning they get an entire apartment to themselves and they have hot water. He has a wife and a very promising career. But things start turning around when Leo suddenly grows a conscience. Instead of arresting a man the State thinks did something bad, he investigated the person and allowed him to escape. He was eventually captured, but still, this mistake cost Leo not only his life, but his family, as well.    (Spoiler Alert - stop reading if you intend to read the book)    Leo was asked by the State to denounce his wife saying she was a spy. To this he refused and because of this, they were sent to exile in an unknown town. His parents were removed from their apartment and transferred to an apartment where 2 other families lived. In this apartment, there was no plumbing, no hot water and no toilet (only a bucket).    When Leo arrived in that town, he was alerted about a murder that took place days earlier. The murder involved a girl whose belly was slashed open and her stomach cut out. She was completely naked. Her clothes were filed neatly 20 paces away from her body. Her mouth was filled with loose soil or bark or some kind of material and a string was attached to her ankle. Suddenly, Leo remembered what the family of Arkady told him. The murders were similar.    He then starts to investigate these murders, which the State had already solved and covered up. If he did this, he would be tried for treason. This is where his journey starts. This is also the moment where he and his wife start seeing each other as human beings and not just a way to protect themselves to survive.    After much investigation, he finds out that the killer has killed at least 44 children all over south Russia. But what he was not prepared for was to find out who the killer was.    It turns out that the killer was his own brother. And the task was to kill the murderer, his brother. His brother's only motive in killing was to make Leo come to him. Leo now had a very hard choice to make. But in the end, he killed his brother.    He was called a hero once again (this time, however, Stalin had died and Kruschev was the new leader). He got a promotion to which he declined and requested that he head a homicide division instead.    (spoilers end here)    The entire book was filled with suspense and thrillers. There was a part where they had to hide from the MGB and Leo knew how the MGB operated. So what they did was to attach themselves underneath the MGB's trucks and hold on until they were past the village.    There was also a part where they worked on escaping from the train. However, the train itself was built so that anyone who escaped would die. Apparently, at the endmost of the train, hooks were attached. Several hundreds of hooks, protruding at different angles in order to snatch any person's body sneaking underneath the train.    In the beginning, when Leo tried to catch someone, and that person, instead of giving up, drowned himself in ice-cold water (literally, the river was frozen but he managed to break a part of the ice and let himself be dragged). Leo followed suit and was about to lose oxygen when he was able to get hold of the prisoner, break the ice and get out.    The book is a must-read. I can't wait for the movie. Ridley Scott (director of American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator and many more) is going to be directing this film. This should be something to look forward to. 
B000001ZS4|5.0|The title pretty much says it all. After listening to some audio clips of Equinoxe I decided I wanted to add it to my CD collection along with Oxygene. So far it's been the best $21.96 I've ever spent. Each of these two CD's has its own theme. Whereas I often think of Oxygene as a journey from an old world in search of a new one, I think of Equinoxe as telling the story of life on the new world. From the grand, I would even say triumphant opening of Equinoxe part 1 to the end, this album will take you places barely even imagined. My personal favorite is Equinoxe part 3, which puts me in mind of early spring and the urgency of flowers just waiting to bloom. It's the sort of music that will definitely shape your dreams if you fall asleep while listening to it. I had such an experience while listening to Oxygene and Equinoxe shows promise of being even better. True I have a track or two that I like less than the others but none that I actually dislike. Every track on this album gets equal listening. It sounds best either on a diskman with a good set of headphones or, in my case, on my sixty-disk stereo at home. Jarre did another excellent job on this album, which features a much more rhythmic element than Oxygene. Quite apart from the almost waltzy rhythm of Equinoxe 3, other tracks have a more upbeat rhythm. They're all fitting to the album's theme, however. As another reviewer commented, Oxygene was the tune of air, but Equinoxe is the tune of water. So now, let's go through the tracks, shall we?    The album opens with Equinoxe part 1, which begins quietly bt quickly grows into a triumphant crescendo, perhaps symbolizing a snrise on a new day. It's probably one of my favorite tracks.      Track 2, Equinoxe 2, is much qieter, the early part of the morning just after the sunrise, perhaps with a gentle rain falling. Much like Oxygene, Equinoxe features Theremins, though perhaps not as extensively as the prior album. Equinoxe 2 features one later in the track.    Next comes Equinoxe 3, which is probably one of my favorites. This oe has an almost waltzy rhythm as I said earlier, and features the high-pitched electronic tones that will subsequently represent water on Jarre's later albums. It also has a bright, cheery yet urgent melody that puts one in mind of either flowers blooming or birds in flight.    Track 4 is much more uptempo and features another cool melody that, in its own way is just as cheery as Equinoxe 3. The best way I can think of to describe it is running through a forest with the wind at your back.    Equinoxe 5 starts with the crash of thunder but continues the same cheery trend started back in Equinoxe 3. Like part 4 it features synthetic percussion which gives it its catchy rhythm.   Track 6 picks up where 5 left off and is, in my opinion, jst as danceable as the prior track.    Track seven is a bit quieter but the thunder heard through out the last few tracks is still present. The melody is also cool.    Unlike Oxygene, which still closed on a rather uptempo note, Equinoe ends much more quietly, with the sound of rain overlaying first a tiny bit of French folk, then a reflective piece that seems to symbolize the surrenity of a summer sunset after the storm abates. It's short but still excellent.    All in all this is an excellent album that, despite having two more tracks than Oxygene somehow manages to come up a minute or two shorter. But the quality remains excellent. My recommendation is simple. If you haven't yet heard either Oxygene or Equinoxe, you might just do yourself a favor by giving them both a good listen. As I said in my review of Oxygene, I'm no fan of electronica, but Jean Michel Jarre's earlier works are definitely an exception to that rule. Next on my list of albums to own? Les Chants Magnetiques Magnetic Fields, Revolutions, Rendez-Vous, Oxygene 7-13 and Chronologie.
0743496736|5.0|First off, I would like to comment on the way the book was written - in flashbacks - but ones that are clear and really have a way of letting you understand the story in bits and pieces. It does not deviate from the entire flow of the story but lets you sneak a peek at the reasons why the things happened.    This book starts out with the relationship of Alex Cormier, a judge and single mother, and her teenage daughter, Josie. About how Alex fails at being a mother to Josie but is a terrific judge and how Josie no longer feels as close to her mom as she did when she was younger.    The story revolves around a shooting in Josie's high school. This is the reason why I gave the book 4 stars - because I find that this sort of plot - one with shooters inside schools - is pretty lame. I see it in the news all the time so why bother to write it down in a novel, right?    Well, the difference here is that the shooter lives and someone actually loves the shooter. He gets prosecuted and a trial ensues. The entire length of the novel revolves around the reasons why the shooter - Peter - did what he did and what made him do it. The defense raised a syndrome similar to a battered wife syndrome - the bullied syndrome or something like that.    Anyway, if you want to read the book, stop reading from this point on. The book contains a very important twist in the last few pages that will leave you shocked. :) For me, it was worth the read, the writer has a gift for writing - although, the main story could have been much better. I write a summary below that is chronological in order and not how it was written in the book.    The shooter here was Josie's elementary school best friend, Peter. Ever since they were young, Josie and Peter were very close. On the very first day Peter was sent to school, his was already bullied (his lunch box was thrown out of the school bus) and Josie would always be there to protect him. They were close because their parents were also very close.    However, things started to change when they were in high school, Josie became a member of the popular kids in school and Peter was still bullied. So in front of the entire school, Josie had to pretend that she didn't like Peter and this made Peter think that Josie was no longer her friend.    However, there was one instance in the book that made Peter realize that Josie was still his friend. They were stuck in an elevator in the library and Josie confessed to him that her boyfriend, Matt, beat her up and that's why she was holding crutches. This was also the place where Josie told Peter that she still considered him her friend but just that, not to mention it to the entire school.    So the day came when Peter snapped and went into school and started shooting everybody who bullied him and some other random people. Thing is, before he was able to shoot himself, a detective (who later has a love story with Alex, Josie's mom and they end up together) stopped Peter.    Peter was then given a very good defense attorney who came up with the bully syndrome as a defense. (very good defense, I think so myself :) However, even after a very good defense, Peter was still convicted.    The twist comes now - Josie was very hung up that one of the people who Peter killed was her boyfriend. Even though she knew that he was not good for her because he hurt her physically, still she missed him. On the day of the shooting, she could not remember much and kept saying this. But, a day before the last day of the trial, she said she remembered exactly what happened and she revealed this on the witness stand. That she shot her boyfriend Matt and it wasn't Peter who shot him.    Til the end, since Peter considered Josie his friend, she never ratted him out. Instead, she confessed this crime herself. She got a 5 year sentence in jail and Peter killed himself on the way to prison.    Again, I highly recommend this book. It is a very good read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

031606792X|5.0|This was an excellent end to the Twlight series.  While at times I tired of the details that I didn't feel necessary to move the story along, I loved the overall story.  Everything was tied up in a neat little package.  I do feel however, that this book should have been touted as her \\"adult novel\\" and not The Host.  This book had scenes that I feel were inappropriate for the young adult audiences for which it was targeted.
B000EAT246|5.0|I am a big Roy Scheider fan and next to Jaws this may be his best movie.<br />Chopper movies are always great and original along the cover up/conspiracy<br />storyline it makes one entertaining movie.<br />Loved watching Roy in his Trans Am !!
B000001FMX|5.0|I'd heard talk about a band from the 70's named New York Dolls, referred to as the seminal punk glam band, also credited as a major influence for Slash and Izzy of Guns N' Roses, one of my favorite bands. I first ordered their 2nd album, \\"Too Much Too Soon\\" having never heard any of their music, only knowing of David Johansen as the 80's Buster Poindexter and the cab driver in the movie Scrooged.     After listening to it for a couple of days, I knew I had to have more Dolls! This album, their first, is every bit as good as \\"Too Much Too Soon\\". I've heard comments that this one is not as good, but I couldn't disagree more. There's not a track on this album I don't like. \\"Personality Crisis\\", \\"Looking For a Kiss\\", \\"Trash\\", \\"Subway Train\\", and \\"Pills\\" jumped right out as great rockers, but after listening to the album a few times, the tracks that didn't jump right out to me at first started to get their hooks into me. I found myself singing \\"Jet Boy\\" in the shower and humming \\"Lonely Planet Boy\\" on the way to work.    This is raw, three to five chord, two guitar, music with blistering quick guitar leads and driving drum beat. The subjects covered by the music range from loneliness to addiction to heartbreak, all the basics of great rock & roll.    I would whole heartedly recommend this album to any New York Dolls fan who doesn't already have it (is that even possible?) or to anyone interested in discovering who the New York Dolls are and how they influenced rock & roll as we know it today.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I have only seen this movie once and enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />I normally do not like digitally enhanced movies but this once worked out fine.<br />Great acting job, great story by a great actor !
B000KWZ7VU|4.0|First off Im not a musician, what I say is like 90% of the reviews, just plain old subjective opinions based on individual taste. I do however have several recordings that I listen to quite often by the major interpreters and I find Barenboims in the middle of the pack on most of my favorites. Im not 100 positive but many times it sounds like he hits wrong notes in the harder sonatas and is unsure of himself at times also as can be expected as it seems he conducts more than he does virtuoso work. (I almost feel stupid saying anything bad about a performer of this caliber when I struggle with chop stix) That being said there is nothing that should stop you from buying these they are done well, a lot of camera angles although sometimes I wish they'd show the hands more. The sound is more than adequate, the tone of the steinway is very nice.  Many times while listening on CD I wonder what the hands are doing so this is so great to see live, however Im sometimes dissapointed when they show Daniels face while playing a part that I wanted to see, oh well can't have everything I guess.  This is so great to have that it makes the bad seem almost irrelevant. The thing that I do appreciate is that each concert has early, mid and late works so you can hear your faves through out each DVD.  Overall you most likely won't be dissapointed, I'm a happy Beethoven fan right now.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Juno is important.<br /><br />That might sound like an overstatment.  Given all the rediculous hype surrounding this movie, I'd be likely to agree.  But, just the same, this movie is important.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because it got a lot of people talking.  A lot of people stand against this movie because of it's subject matter; teen pregnancy.  While Juno's initial reaction to have an abortion further shocked many people, these were the confused actions of a young woman who, after realizing that she cannot go through with an abortion, goes through the rest of the movie making the best possible decisions from the baby's perspective.<br /><br />A lot of people think this movie promotes teen pregnancy. This is due, in part, by a number of teen girls who've seen and responded to the film. Others feel (wrongly) that it promotes abortion.  But the movie makes no clear stance on abortion (much like we, as a whole, have not) and teen girls are always going to say stupid things.  They're teens for crying out loud.<br /><br />This film is a snippet of real life.  Teens really do get pregnant because a late teen's body is the best suited for the job of procreation. The hormones drive them to it.  They (teens) have been doing it sicne the very first humans andit was not until recent (very recent) times that our culture decreed that the teenage years are a part of childhood, and that teen should not be having sex.  Yet, at the same time, we live in a culture that places sex into every aspect of life.  The highest grossing models are underage girls... Kids have sex.  Culturally, we encourage it while at the same time telling them not to.  Getting pregnant is a risk, but why is it that we only blame the youths who get pregnant?  Because I can assure you that most all of them are having sex.<br /><br />Juno is important because it's an honest LOOK (not praise, not judgement) on an issue that happens, regardless of preceeding morals.  What's more, being under forty, I found this is one of the few films that accurately depicted adolesence as I lived it.

B0002KPHXS|4.0|This movie is a remake of a Swedish film which introduced Ingrid Bergman to American audiences. Selznick Studios liked her so much, they brought her to Hollywood to make Intermezzo in English. The story is about a middle aged musician (Leslie Howard) who falls in love with his daughter's piano teacher (Bergman). He leaves his wife to be with her and the two share happy but fleeting moments together in France. There are times when the story becomes overly dramatic, but what it lacks in believability it makes up for in visual opulence.<br /><br />Not only does Intermezzo benefit from a beautiful cast and beautiful music, director Gregory Ratoff does an excellent job of making each frame look artistic. Both of the stars are give many gorgeous close-ups and their beauty helps the love story seem believable. The two just glow when they are with each other.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This CD doesn't have a bad track. On top of that, the first song, Beachcombing, is great to sing along with! I like to think I do a pretty good Mark Knopfler impression, and to be able to harmonize with Emmy Lou at the same time is awesome. Buy it!

B000H5V8DG|5.0|Warning!  Spoilers are littered throughout this review!<br /><br />First, am I reviewing the series or the product?  My five-star review is for the series, not the product.  I watched ALIAS on TV when it first came out and having wanted to see various bits over the past two years, I decided I would buy the whole thing on DVD.  I was very tempted by the complete set (with the Rambaldi artifact box), but after getting a good look at it I realized it would not mesh well with other DVD box sets that I owned, so I decided that I would pay a bit more money and get each season individually.  I'm glad that I did.  I was able to get three seasons used off Amazon and bought the other two seasons new.<br /><br />I became interested in rewatching ALIAS for two reasons.  First, I watched earlier this summer FELICITY for the first time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the show and realized that many of the actors on FELICITY would later appear on ALIAS, like the romantically paired (on FELICITY) Greg Gunberg and Amanda Foreman (interestingly, the guy who played the hipster friend of Amanda Foreman's FELICITY character was Kevin Weis, with whom she was romantically linked on ALIAS as Marshall Flinkman's wife).  Besides, I once heard an interview with J. J. Abrams in which he said he came up with the idea of ALIAS by thinking, \\"Felicity Porter in the CIA.\\"  The second major reason I wanted to rewatch the show was the impending (actually, only two days from now) debut of J. J. Abrams fourth major TV series (yes, he's been involved with others, but FELICITY, ALIAS, LOST, and THE FRINGE have gotten the big push others have not) THE FRINGE.  After DOLLHOUSE (Joss Whedon's new series, due out this winter), this is the show I'm most anticipating this year, along with Alan Ball's new series TRUE BLOOD (and if Ron Moore's two series CAPRICA and/or VIRTUALITY make it to production by the end of the 2008-2009 season, those two as well).<br /><br />When I was first watching ALIAS, my impression was that Seasons One and Two were the best, with a very slight dip in quality in Season Three, a sharper drop in Season Four, and further drop in early Season Five before getting very good again at the end.  This largely corresponds with my reviewing.  Season Three was a bit better than I remembered and Season Five even more enjoyable at the end than I recalled.  Season Four still disappoints, however.<br /><br />There are so many great things about this show.  There are also a couple of things you simply have to learn to ignore, things that fall into the \\"Willing suspension of disbelief\\" category.  For instance, the world is a very, very big place.  But if anyone on the show needs to get to any spot on the globe, it doesn't seem to take more than a few hours.  But short of an SR-71 (or presumably the super secret Aurora spy plane) this simply isn't possible.  Plus, all the airplanes shown as transport o the show are subsonic.  Nonetheless, international logistics never seems to be a problem for Sydney and Company.  Still, the show as a whole is so much fun and so compelling, that as a viewer I have no trouble cutting them slack on this, unlike, say, PRISON BREAK, where you have to cut them slack on a few dozen things every episode (in my opinion, you can't call for a suspension of disbelief on everything that happens on a show).<br /><br />Though we are introduced to a large number of characters over the seasons, the core cast is Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), initially working for what she takes to be a black ops section of the CIA, SD6, but in reality part of an international criminal organization known as the Alliance.  Though allegiances change over the years, on the side of the angels with Sydney are Michael Vaughan (Michael Vartan) of the CIA, her father Jack Bristow (the brilliant Victor Garber), her field partner Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbley), and technical genius Marshall Flinkman.  On the side of the devils are Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and recurring charactersIrina Derevko (played by the beautiful and talented Lena Olin) and Julian Sark (David Anders).  The thread that runs through the show are the artifacts of an unknown Renaissance genius named Milo Rambaldi, someone so brilliant that he makes DaVinci look slow witted.  Arvin Sloane's driving obsession with Rambaldi along with Sydney's prophesied role in the culmination of Rambaldi's work remain unifying elements in each season of the series.  One didn't have to be a Rambaldi to realize that the series, if allowed to end on its own terms (and while it was cancelled earlier than many of us would have liked, they were allowed to wrap up the series as they wished), that it would only end when the mysteries of Rambaldi and Sydney's role in them were resolved.<br /><br />Along the way through the five seasons ALIAS helped establish TV as a medium in which movie stars were free to appear as guest stars.  Few if any shows have had more remarkable guest stars than ALIAS.  Faye Dunaway, Christian Slater, Isabella Rosselini, the aforementioned Lena Olin, Sonia Braga (the last three playing the Derevki sisters), Quentin Tarantino, David Cronenberg, Amy Irving, Joel Grey, Ethan Hawke, Peter Berg, Lindsay Crouse, Roger Moore, Rutger Hauer, and Djimon Hounsou, not to ignore series regular Victor Garber, were some of the actors better known for their work on stage and screen than TV, though the series also had some great TV veterans like Terry O'Quinn (before becoming famous as Locke on LOST) and Ricky Gervais.  The casting from beginning to end was simply impeccable on the show.<br /><br />One of the most important aspects of the show was its role in promoting female heroes on TV.  My own reading of TV over that time is that Buffy had made TV irreparably safe for heroic female characters.  Xena and Dana Scully had anticipated what was about to happen with empowered females on TV, but without Buffy they would perhaps have been remembered as exceptions.  Buffy was the character that changed all the roles.  Xena was too much of a cartoon to make people accept females kicking butt as something not to be taken as exceptional.  But after Buffy it has been a commonplace.  But there had to be actual instances of heroic females as evidence that the rules had changed.  Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max on DARK ANGEL, and Sydney Bristow were the first -- and along with Veronica Mars and Starbuck from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, still the best.  When someone writes the history of heroic women on TV, there will be a pre-Buffy section mentioning characters like the 1950s Annie Oakley, Emma Peel of THE AVENGERS, Dana Scully, and Xena, then a section on Buffy, and finally the next wave.  Sydney Bristow should and will get her own chapter.  And what a great job Jennifer Garner did!  Though not trained in martial arts, she used her considerable athleticism (and early dance training -- indeed, dance seems to be a wonderful training ground for cinematic martial artists, further proof being the absolutely astonishing fight scenes by Summer Glau in SERENITY, showing that for a prima ballerina it is just choreography) to bring Sydney Bristow to life more believable than any other female hero.  In fact, to this day I've seen no TV female hero (and yes, I'm avoiding the word \\"heroine\\" intentionally -- \\"heroines\\" traditionally are anything but heroic) more physically convincing than Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow.  On top of this she brought acting chops that should have earned her a string of Emmys.  At least she got some nominations, unlike Lauren Graham, who astonishingly never got a single nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy when she should have won seven straight times.<br /><br />I strongly recommend anyone interested in quality TV getting acquainted with ALIAS.  Few shows have had higher production values or better casts.  And while the overall story flagged a bit in Season Four and early in Season Five, the show took risks and kept striving to tell well an ambitiousstory.  It is bound to remain one of the touchstones of great television.on to make people accept females kicking butt as something not to be taken as exceptional.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well produced, well thought-out series will have you sitting on the edge of your ejection seat; very, very few dropped stitches and a couple of the plot twists are quite possibly unique to the series.
B0009HARUW|4.0|I have received and reviewed the book \\"The Very Busy Spider\\".  It is a very good book and nicely illustrated.
0765356139|5.0|The Well of Ascension is the 2nd book in the Mistborn trilogy.  The book begins about a year after Mistborn: The Final Empire left off.  Elend has taken over the government and Vin is his bodyguard/love interest.  Two major problems present themselves at the onset of the book: first, the mists are harming people and second, Elend's city is under seige by two different army's.  The first problem is put on the back burner for most of the book.  The political situation becomes more and tenser until it gets out of hand and death, destruction, and carnage are inevitable.  Also going on, the skaa (peasant class) have started forming a religion around Kelsier.<br /><br />This book in the trilogy is much more political in nature than the first.  Happily, the politics are eventually well balanced with action.  Like the first book, the Mistborn battle scenes can seem extremely tedious.  Especially in the beginning.  I think the tedious nature of these scenes is the biggest problem in the book.  That said, once the story action reaches full snowball, the Mistborn passages are extremely well executed and greatly add to the flow, urgency, and awesomeness of the story.<br /><br />The story is once again in 3rd person shifting between characters.  Every now and then Sanderson uses a completely random and (in my opinion) unimportant character's viewpoint to show the story from.  This was really weird.  I'm not sure why he did it, and I'm not sure that it added anything to the story.  The predominant viewpoints in the story are from Vin and Elend and Sazed.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with awesomeness of the plot in the final 2 parts of the book.  Vin's character has become something amazing.  Her growth over this book was well done.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the final installment of the series, [[ASIN:0765316897 The Hero of Ages: Book Three of Mistborn]], which is due to release on Oct 14, 2008.
1600610234|4.0|This book is an insightful look into how to do mech type artwork as done by an amazing professional. He goes over his process and tools of the trade step by step. I bought one for myself and one for my up and coming nephew and we both loved it.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Unlike a previous after series movie, this one was great.  Excellent plot, well played.  It rounded things out nicely.  If they never did another SG1 movie, we'd live.  It was great.
B00133MKVK|2.0|I'm, very disappointed with the orchestra who performed at this latest CD of Ms. Shirley Bassey compared to her old CDs.
0345495004|4.0|Very good book. I would have been more connected to it if there was deeper character development. It gave good insight into the views of marriage and women in the early 1900s as well as the early career of Frank Lloyd Wright. Mamah and Frank were two people who lived before their times. The decisions that Mamah made were extremely difficult and I'm not sure what I would have done. I very much believe in being in a true, fulfilling, passionate relationship, but having to achieve that at the expense of your children... not so sure. I want to read more about FLW because although he was brilliant and very compelling he seemed like a real narcissist!! I mean, he was FLW, but everything was definitely about him!   But I definitely enjoyed the book and it's definitely worth reading--especially if you like learning while reading fiction which is my favorite.
B00005JLFC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The acting is wonderful -- I love Mandy Patinkin as Avigdor and, of course, Barbra is great!!!  The music is beautiful and the photography is great.  I have wanted to get this movie on DVD for a long time, but it is only available overseas.  I would definitely buy it if it were released in the US.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|\\"State of Play\\" is a wonderful political thriller that crosses a group of newspaper reporters, members of Parliament and the police. It is directed in six one-hour parts by David Yates who directed the most recent Harry Potter films.<br /><br />\\"State of Play\\" has a superb cast including many familiar faces: Bill Nighy, James McAvoy and Kelly Macdonald (Carla Jean from \\"No Country for Old Men\\" with a very different accent), and Polly Walker (Atia from ROME) among others.<br /><br />There's to be an all-star Americanized movie version of \\"State of Play\\" in 2009 staring Russell Crow, Ben Affleck, Helen Miren and Jeff Daniels directed by Kevin Macdonald (\\"Last King of Scotland\\"). That may end up being good, but condensing this story down to a two-hour movie will be challenging and will certainly require leaving a lot of the characters behind. Plus it will require extricating the story from its compelling backdrop that is the inner-workings of the British press and government, and that's one of the more fascinating aspects of the mini-series.
B000021Y77|5.0|this is a movie you can watch again and again and discover new things every time. I use it in my German high school classroom and the students like the fast pace and the music. The actress, Franka Potente, went on to play in several well known hollywood productions after Run Lola Run. She's the girlfriend in Bourne Identity. She's great in this movie!
0316143472|5.0|Sedaris is Sedaris in this wonderful collection of stories. One thing I like about this collection is that the author, who is about my age, is aging in his writing. As hilarious as his stories about his childhood and young adulthood are, he has become more introspective and quirky, just like the rest of us. His ability to look at and experience the world in everyday life, and present it to us through his eyes is as appealing as ever.

0784011710|4.0|I won't belabor too much on \\"Sophie's Choice\\".  It has a number of haunting scenes and the preformance of Meryl Streep was certainly deserving of an Oscar.  Kevin Kline was alright and I came to understand that his role was fairly essential to give us the overview of a woman defeated years before by a macabre experience.  However, I found the role of the writer/narrator to be extraneous and annoying.  If the book is like the movie (and I suspect it is) I won't bother with it.  I would have assumed that the script writer and the director (if not one and the same) would have filtered out the writer's egotistical efforts to make himself the story.  Stingo?!?  Give me a break.  There was too much to be shared to have to include him.  Sorry about that but this was a 2 hour movies that was expanded unnecessarily.

0385340990|5.0|Wonderful. I ordered this book because the title fascinated me. I had no idea who the writer was or in what style it would be written. I had once visited Guernsey and thought a book about that small island would be interesting. It was, and more. It completely enveloped me.  As a writer, I was so intrigued by her style of writing, which is completely composed of letters from her to some of the occupants of the island, and their replies to her. Deep friendships evolve from this letter-exchange Wonderful book. I will read it again and again.

B0017MO10U|4.0|This is the second movie after the conclusion of SG-1. It is a little more like a movie (rather than a long episode) because they are not finishing a story arc from the series.  Admitedly, they're still dealing with pre-established characters and situations.     It starts off with the team (and Jack O'Neill--hooray!) going to watch Baal, the last of the system lords, being forcibly removed from his host.  Baal tells the team that he is actually the last clone of Baal and that the real Baal has something special planned now that the final cloned symbiote is about to die.  Now the team, used to this sort of nonsense from Baal, don't believe him (I wouldn't either).  But then Teal'c disappears into thin air (casting darker doubts upon Vala's sudden absence from moments before).    Now, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I'm just going to tell you what you ought to know from the cover anyway.  It involves time travel and an alternate timeline. We see many familiar faces too, including some of the other system lords and Hammond. And, as always, there is lots of typical stargate comedy.    Having said this much, I assume that those who have seen the series (seasons one through ten) will be able to imagine what sorts of events go on (even if the particulars aren't all laid out for them).  Those who have not will be surprised (if perhaps a little confused).  As always, it helps in the watching of this film if you have a solid background with the characters and the events of the TV series.    I must say that I enjoyed it very much and would suspect that many sci-fi fans would be able to jump right in and see it.  Hope you like it too.

B0000057C5|5.0|This is an epic album. It has a driving beat in all of the songs. Till's vocals always sound crisp. The best tracks on this are: Stripped (the version you get may not have this on it), Sehnsucht, Du Haßt (probably the best known Rammstein song, Fellfrosh (amazing grinding guitars), Bueck Dich (great for headbanging) Engel, (amazing vocals) Spiel Mit Mir (nice, slow heavy guitars, scary lyrics), and Eifersucht (best song for headbanging). Overall its just a great CD. I would recommend it to any metal fan.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|This review is for the regular version, NOT the Director's Cut.    I love this movie, even though I don't get it worth a squirrel's nuts.  I read this whole recap of the plot, bit by bit, at Salon.com, and I was TOTALLY wrong about what I thought was happening in the film (I'll spare you the details; this is a movie you cannot spoil for people) and yet I STILL LOVE IT.    Jake Gyllenhaal is just awesome. He plays Donnie SUPERBLY.  Every single person in this movie is PERFECTLY casted, from Donnie's parents, sister, and therapist, to that awful awful woman who insists that Graham Greene was on Bonanza. And Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze are ingenious background players. Jena Malone is great, Frank-the-Bunny is great, Roberta Sparrow, even that chunky Asian chick who says \\"Chut up.\\" EXCELLENT EXCELLENT casting is my point.    Also, this is one of those movies that you don't have to really \\"get\\" 100%.  I certainly didn't. And I watch regularly. It proverbially lives in my DVD player so I can just push play whenever the heck I feel like it. (Okay so sometimes I switch it with Fight Club but that's besides the point).  Here's the deal:     - the movie is based primarily in the notion of time travel. It's science-fiction disguised as not-science-fiction, which makes sense because it's both and neither.     - it's one of those \\"makes a big statement about humanity\\" movies. I like that. Some people don't.     - don't expect the ending to wrap everything up. In fact, it'll probably just confuse you further.     - you NEED to watch the ENTIRE movie before you cast judgement, at least in my opinion.     - if you don't like to think, ponder, be confused, question, rewind, ask people what the heck is going on, and genuinely say \\"huh\\" then this movie's not for you. Call me dumb but I've seen this film at least fifty times since I own the DVD and I still can't crack the code of the website.    The whole movie is excellent from the storyline to the casting, but it'sa mystery wrapped in an enigma shrouded in shadow.  If you don't like that, watch something else.

B0017MO10U|5.0|This film starts as it alway's has but still has that little air of predictability.  I thaught the story line was good and gave into your imagination of some of the un predictable insight that we all have and it was brought out quite well.  So where will await the further adventures of SG1.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is a really great racing movie which i have had for many years in VHS format and wanted to update to DVD.  The bonus features with actors and producer commentaries done decades later are also great.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|The DVD includes some wonderful dialog and impromptu tune playing that gave me bumps ans chills. These are blues pioneers with awesome experiences and talents to share with the world. Amazingly, four of these musicians died shortly after the recordings were completed. Got to watch this DVD if the blues mean anything to you. The audio disk is also a recording of quality and remembrance. Enjoy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'm recommending this book to everybody I know.  If I had a print version I would pass it along to so many people. Hmmmmm, perhaps a paper copy is just the perfect gift this year for some of my friends and family. It's that good.
0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind is, without a doubt, the most refreshingly told fantasy novel I've read in ages.  The fact that it's a debut novel makes it even more stunning in its complexity and renews the hope that not all fantasy tales have already been told scores of times, or at the very least, that fresh takes on old themes are still possible.      Rothfuss has created characters that are rich, complex, and mysterious (I can't wait to find out more about Bast!).  Kvothe's story captured my imagination, and reeled me in, so that even with the foreshadowing mentioned by another reviewer, the mystery of the tale is present, continuous, and intriguing.  Best of all, Rothfuss's command of the language is such that he has penned intelligent prose that is both technically intricate, poetically rendered, and vivid enough wrap the reader up in it's imagery and leave us wanting for more, more, more!    Normally, I devour books of this size in a couple of intense sittings, but this one took me a full week, not because of it was difficult to \\"get into\\" or didn't keep me interested enough to read for hours on end at a time, but because of a need to linger over this story and savor every word.      I will wait with baited breath for the remaining installments and probably read this one to tatters before they're available.  Huzzah, Patrick Rothfuss - The Name of the Wind is superb!
B001EN71DQ|5.0|I really love the whole Trilogy! Releasing it once again on SD DVD and not Blu-Ray DVD doesn't make very good marketing since. Considering Indiana Jones-The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls is being released on Blu-Ray in October. I realize Mr.Lucas doesn't think we need another new disc format however considering it is now the winner of the \\"format war\\" I'd say it's safe to say it's here to stay. I watched this ever since the creation of the Blu-Ray Assc. group and I did believe it was gonna win. As cool as it would be for everyone on the planet to just click it and download everything you could ever want. I'm all for new Tech. but realisticly not everyone has a pc and internet so I really don't see that happing for some many years! Well here's to being hopefull.
B0019IB26I|5.0|truly remarkable musician, another masterpiece to add to the collection...wonderful concert at the Woodlands! Quality cd purchase
B000001ZSF|4.0|Jean-Michel Jarre's Chronologie has the unique style Jarre became famous for with his groundbreaking first albums (Oxygene, Equinoxe, Magnetic Fields, The Concerts in China). Like the first three ones, Chronologie is structured like a long instrumental suite divided in untitled parts.    The tracks are remarkably different from each other, but the album flows flawlessly. Chronologie melds Jarre's traditional tight, melodic style with some electronic tendencies of its age (the mid 1990s). This idea of mixing different styles is one of Jarre's music main features, and can be heard in most of his albums ever since Oxygene.    Time is the overarching concept/idea here, and sounds of clocks can be heard often throughout the album, specially in the interludes between the main parts of the tracks.    Other reviews have described the sound of each track with more detail; all I can say now is that Chronologie is one of the best albums of one of the greaters pioneers of electronic music. It is a classic, and it sounds so. It's been fifteen years since the release of Jean-Michel Jarre's 'Chronologie', and like most of his albums, it has aged well. Chronologie very recommended to anyone interested in a varied, rich music album.    Best tracks: Chronologie part 2; Chronologie part 4; Chronologie part 6.
0321544080|5.0|If you use or are interested in using off camera lighting, this is a must read.  Why would you?  Photography is about light and McNally teachs how to modify or change existing light so you are not stuck with the poor or boring light you find.  McNally is an artist with light.  His writing style is enjoyable and is humor makes this an easy read yet this is packed with information.  This book was the brainchild of Scott Kelby, and even goes beyond his on line seminars taking a subject that could be dry and makes it enjoyable reading. This book received alot of hoopla about its release- with good reason. Read this with Lowell's Matter of Light and Depth for structured instruction and the Strobist website for portable, inexpensive gear and your photography will move to an entirely different level.
0743496736|4.0|This book grabbed me right away.  My first book by Jodi Picoult and will not be my last.  Tough topic but written very well, good character development. Picoult's topics are thought provoking and great for book club discussions. Great read!
031606792X|4.0|Although Breaking Dawn had a much different tone than her previous books, its unique set-up and closure is what made me love this book.  Final stories are always hard to read...there are so many things the reader personally wants accomplished that authors seldom live up to the expectations.  I enjoyed Jacobs book the most with its distinct voice (plus to tell you the truth I was getting a little tired of Bella's \\"human\\" voice...yes I know teen girls are often dramatic but the change was welcome).  As a writer I think Stephenie Meyer did a wonderful job of finishing the series with as little loose ends as possible.  As a parent I applaud her decision to end the conflict peacefully. As a reader I want more Jacob.  What can I say.  He was the most dynamic character for me so I'm still craving more.  Let's hope there are future installments.
0375842209|5.0|Although the central character in The Book Thief is Liesel Meminger, the narration for the duration of the novel is done by Death. So Death's point of view understands and seems to know all about who he will meet along the way in Nazi Germany. Death is neither overly sentimental (a few exceptions of course apply) nor acutely malevolent or terrifying. He's just a voice that accepts the many ways people come to him, one way or another, and in fact sits back and watches the barbarity of humans. He sees the ugliness, brutality and beauty of mankind, and seems to feel the most pity for Himmel Street, where Leisel and her new family reside. Still, he is detached, and waits for all to come to him.     Liesel is nine when she becomes a foster child for the Hagerman's after seeing her brother and mother die. She learns to love the new, adopted family she has, and because she has stolen The Grave Digger's Handbook from her brother's burial place, she has a fascination with books and wants to learn to read. One book isn't enough, and after Hans Huber Mann teaches her to read, she has many adventure with Rudy, neighbor boy who is a fan of Jessie Owens, stealing books and other things. Liesel becomes absorbed in novels, and each book is a symbol of an event in the story.     One of the more unique characters is Max Vandenburg, the Jew who hides in the Hagerman's' basement. Similar to Liesel, he comes to this house a stranger trying to make an adjustment after a difficult past experience. Max's stay at the house gives Liesel a stronger purpose because she looks after him as Hans Huber Mann once looked after her. Max connects with the child because he has a strong imagination, an introspective way of looking at things. Max gives Liesel a gift, The Standover Man, which encompasses and signifies all the ideas that link these two characters.     Markus Zusak has a powerful ability to create a poetic, deep narrative, using symbols, and examining the issue of courage, hope, and despairduring a troubling and confusing time. Unusually written, as we are often moving back and forth in time between what the reader knows and will know, and given poems as to clues of the plot, Zusak's creates a unique story. Although you are likely to find this book in the young adult section of your bookstore, it seems pretty \\"mature\\" in its voice, and should have been left in the fiction section.     While there is so much more going on in the novel, there is much about the background of Nazi Germany, and those who either oppose or dissent from those ideals. Zuzak gives a haunting description of the barbarity, and hopelessness, of this oppression from the eyes of Liesel: \\"As she watched all of this, Liesel was certain these were the poorest souls alive...Others pleaded for someone, anyone, to step forward and catch them in their arms. No one did.\\"     This is a story that is intense, and leaves an impression. A very creative story here, one that I will definitely read again. Five stars all the way.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|This is one of the very, very few great Hollywood movies about historical events and personalities in which hardly any liberties or revisionist history attempts have been made and yet the unadulterated \\"true\\" story is still so dramatic and exciting.  This movie is fully deserving of all 8 of the Oscars that it won and is not only among the top 5 war movies that I've ever seen but is also among the top 5 biopics that I've ever seen.<br /><br />Patton is shown, warts and all, with little attempt made at trying to sugar coat his colourful personality although this movie gives us a chance to see the other side of the story that we get of the man from the sensationalist press of the time.  Having served in the military myself, I actually fully appreciated what he did to the cowardly soldier and I know I wouldn't have apologised if it was me but Patton saw the bigger picture and knew that he was needed to continue achieving greater things and so did what he had to which really impressed me.  Although the film is almost 3 hours in length, I didn't feel it as that movie is just that good.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality is just excellent.  The THX Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option makes the sound quality very good and I couldn't easily find any imperfections with the picture quality making me thoroughly satisfied with this dvd version.  Although there are no special features worth mentioning, the picture and sound quality more than make up for this.  I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version of this film will be given that it is already so good on this standard version.  I also appreciated the Anamorphic widescreen effect which ensured that only about a fifth of my widescreen was blacked out unlike the pure letterbox format which means I'd have to squint as only half my screen is utilised.  I understand that different people have different opinions about the various formats but for me anamorphic works well enough.<br /><br />This is a great movie and the dvd is equally as good; great film, great picture and sound quality albeit no special features save an audio essay on Patton's life still make this a great value purchase.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Updated 6 June 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to append this here:  the blu-ray version of this great film is certainly worth the double-dip.  As good as the picture quality was on the dvd I reviewed above, 1080p actually improves upon it on this version.  The sound quality in DTS HD 5.1 surround is excellent too and is also an improvement over the dvd.  The special features aren't much to shout about and is not an improvement over that of the dvd but the combined improvement of both the picture and sound qualities makes this a worthy upgrade.<br /><br />Highly recommended!is equally as good; great film, great picture and sound quality albeit no special features save an audio essay on Patton's life still make this a great value purchase.

031606792X|5.0|Received in perfect condition and in good time. For a series that I only started reading at the insistance of others, I'm happy to say that I became an addict. The ending could have been stronger in this book but overall it was a series I didn't put down.

B00026WU82|5.0|Well here we are.  One of the most renowned and praised pieces of popular music in history.  Last time we saw Bob Dylan he was proving that he was more than a simple folk singer.  This time around, he's proving that he should be held in the same regard as Michaelangelo and Socrates.    The most famous drum crash and organ blast ever.  \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" is the song that needs no introduction.  It's the song that is continually voted as the greatest and most important song of all time, even almost 45 years later. It changed what pop music could be, it changed what could be considered a \\"hit\\" song, and as everyone from the Beatles to Springsteen to Wilco will attest to- it proved that shooting for the moon could pay off.  It's the song that starts this album here and sets the table for what will follow.  \\"Tombstone Blues\\" is next- it's Bob's scathing oppinion on various topics of the time- war, crime, hypocricy, religion, etc- in a vain similar to \\"Maggie's Farm\\" from his \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" album. \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh...\\" and \\"From a Buick 6\\" are the next two tracks, and both seemingly deal with a woman in Dylan's life.  While \\"Buick\\" seems to hold in high regards the woman who takes care of Dylan and keeps him grounded and in check, \\"It Takes...\\" appears to serve almost as a warning to her- Dylan wants to be a certain way, and much else should not be expected of him.  \\"Ballad of A Thin Man\\", an attack on a magazine columnist whom Dylan felt had him misunderstood comes next, and is then followed by \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\", a song that appears to be laiden with disdain for a woman Dylan once knew and loved, who is now living a glamorized, fake existence.  Lyrically, a great song in which Dylan asks her to come see him again once she's gotten her head out of the clouds and her feet back on the ground.  The title track (as per Dylan, inspired by blues legend Robert Johnson) and the fantastic piano driven \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\"- (featuring greatlyrics about temptation and things not being as they appear) are the final 2 songs before the epic Dylan masterpiece \\"Desolation Row\\".  Widely considered one of the most complex and difficult Dylan songs ever written, \\"Row\\" is a nightmarish narrative that essentially is Dylan's response to a letter he receives from someone.  Full of metaphors and symbolism involving many of literature's most famous characters- the song goes to show once and for all, how talented a writer Dylan really is.    Angry and mean, yet passionate and emotional.  Dark, complex, disturbing and brilliant. \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" is one of the best examples of why Dylan is held in such high regard.  The only thing perhaps more amazing than the quality of these compositions, is the fact that the writer was only 25 when they were created.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|Wow.  Where do you bein with this?  How can you even put into words what this album has done not only for music, but for society in general?  Without getting too far into the non-musical relevance of Dylan's 1965 masterpiece, it is important to atleast realize that this album began the phase of Dylan's career that essentially turned the music world upside down and inspired generations of musicians, poets, and artists of all sort who came after...    Musically, this album marks the transition of Bob Dylan from a clever folk singer into a rock icon.  About half the tracks here are the acoustic folk Dylan everyone was accostomed to, and the other half are the recently plugged-in, electric Dylan that everyone saw for the first time at Newport.  The album kicks off with the famous \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and gets better track by track.  You have \\"She Belongs To Me\\" which is a beautiful acoustic piece about a woman who, through her methods and existence, has complete control over Dylan.  Not the other way around as the title would suggest.  Next is \\"Maggie's Farm\\", a piece about how various institutions- religion, government, corporation- can and will enslave you if you let them.  \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" is one of the most poetic love songs ever written, and features many beautiful observations such as \\"She doesn't have to say she's faithful/yet she's true like ice, like fire.\\"  A lot of classic Dylan imagery in this song, used to explain what his lover is and is not. \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and \\"On The Road Again\\" are two bluesy numbers that really show a side of Dylan that no one had seen before, and many believe to be inspired by Kerouac's \\"On The Road\\".  \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" is an extremely surreal narrative about a stranger in a strange land.  It speaks on American imperialism and what one would encounter and feel like if they had recently came to the country for the first time.  Lyrically, the song is so complex in its metaphors and illusions that it may make your head cave in.  \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's Alright, Ma\\" follow next.  These are 2 of Dylan's most famous songs- the former a whirlwind of images about escape through music and the latter a personal account of feeling deprived, disappointed, cheated, neglected, and frightened (yet brave in the face of this adversity) by acts of society across all mediums.  Finally, \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\", a soft acoustic gem about change and moving on wraps up the album.    All in all, one of the most amazing recordings I have ever heard.  Stunningly poetic and very deep.  It just may change the way you look at the world.
1563899426|3.0|I found this book worth checking out.  The idea is that all your favorite fairy tale characters have had their homeland invaded by some evil force.  All of the \\"fables\\" have had to evacuate their homelands in fear of their lives, where do they end up?  Manhattan.  They've even created their own community within Manhattan that they call Fabletown.  This first book tells us the story of Rose Red, and her sister, Snow White.  Rose Red has been murdered and Bigsby (Big Bad Wolf) is sent to investigate.  Who killed Rose Red?  I guess you'll have to read to find out.
1401207529|3.0|If you ever hear about Batman: Year One, it's most likely the praise of the story's origins and reinvention. I read it pretty fast, in a day or so, and it was pretty entertaining, but not as good as I'd hoped. I think Frank Miller is a pretty good storyteller, but maybe it's just not my thing. Regardless, it was a good read and it gave me a little bit of insight towards Batman's origins.    I'd give it a 3.5 if I could, but I'm leaning more towards 3 on this one. Pick it up if you're a Batman fan though, definitely.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I agree totally with Patricia A. Sanders. I thought I was emotionally dead but then I put this movie in the DVD player and off I was to feeling strong emotions again. This one has the magic for sure. It pulls all the strings in your heart and it thrills you to the bone. Excellent. Steven Spielberg sure knows how to make a wonderful movie. Every scene steals your heart! Don't miss this one.
1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween turns Batman into what he certainly should be, a pseudo-detective, dark, mysterious night-searcher. The mob theme is a universe which suits Batman very, very well, and the story mixes in the classic archenemies perfectly.    Basically, this is perfect for any Batman fan, and you should go pick it up.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|i Just got this greatest cd by the Jonas Brothers. my favorite song on the cd is Burnin up. i liked it so much that i am willing to send my friend a copy of it.
B000XA5K48|4.0|The first time I watched this film I didn't like it very much. It held my interest, but I didn't care for the wafer-thin plot. And those are diet wafers. But I watched it again with the audio commentary by writer/director Michael Davis. He pointed out some of the elements that I had missed, and my interest picked up.    The jerry-rigged plot has Mr. Smith (ably portrayed by Clive Owen) injecting himself into a conspiracy to murder a very pregnant woman. Hordes of heavily armed bad guys are hunting her. Smith ends up caring for her newborn child. The movie becomes a series of gunfights in which some 130 (according to the commentary) bad guys fall to Smith's super-sharp shooting. The gun battles contain elements drawn from James Bond, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, and the countless other flicks that feature a good guy who can shoot taking on legions of bad guys who can't. On top of this, Davis makes it all surreal by developing fantastic scenarios with a Rube Goldberg twist.    The stunning Monica Bellucci adds a certain ... warmth as she plays a lactating prostitute who really cares. She proves with Mr.Smith that people can attain a satisfying climax under the most trying conditions. Paul Giamatti is the heavy (Hertz) who reminds me of Orson Welles gone to seed.    There are some disgusting elements like a graphic depiction of what could happen when a gun falls into a filthy toilet and Hertz's \\"interaction\\" with a corpse.    In my opinion, if you take away a few disgusting scenes and tighten up the plot, this becomes a great movie.
B000068TPN|4.0|One of the finest, gripping and compelling war movie ever (also Tora Tora Tora, The Longest Day and Sands of Iwo Jima). Think what you want about Mel Gibson, however, this cast is remarkable and believable in the midst of the most incredible and horrific of battle. Note to chicks: unless you get the horror of war and the nature of the soldier, you probably won't like this film. I have seen it three times and I still am in awe of the suffering and heroism of those who served.
0743270754|4.0|It's a long, deep, and ultimately engrossing book about the 16th president and his cabinet. The book has a very strong, almost simplistic, point of view about its focuses. Lincoln is a kindly man always with a story to tell and with an almost preternatural grasp of politics. Seward is the loyal consigliere and companion. Chase is the scheming power-hungry plotter pushed by his scheming power-hungry daughter. Bates is the kindly old guy who no one else really cares about. Stanton is the hard-working, hard-driving guy who never lets the President down. Mary Lincoln is the batty, jealous wife. Everyone comes across as a one-dimensional archetype once they start the Administration. Most of them seem like more interesting people BEFORE Lincoln gets elected.     The book is engaging--it has to be with over 750 pages of text, not including notes, index, etc. But I am no Lincoln expert. I suspect the sketches that are drawn are overly simplistic, but without having seen an alternate account, and not being a Lincoln scholar, I hesitate to state an opinion on the accuracy or the perspective Kearns provides. I can say the book is immensely readable and I enjoyed it greatly.
B000051TT2|5.0|I have been a fan of Tom Jones for a very long time...have seen him many times and was even lucky to kiss Tom.  I just love the CD!!!!! It arrived on time and in perfect condition!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|The conversion to HD isn't perfect - some of the dark scenes are grainy but overall I'm very happy with it - and would highly recommend it to all Lonesome Dove fans.
B001EL6EH2|4.0|The Blu-ray edition of Casablanca will be wonderful if you enjoy lots of postcards, booklets, and a fancy box. If, however, you're main interest is in the film itself, you won't be disappointed but neither will you be blown away by BR's enhancements.<br /><br />The resolution isn't measurably better than a 2006 HD release -- after all there is only so much that can be done with a film made in 1942! But the clarity of picture and sound are worth the hefty price, especially for collectors or people who want to know lots of minute detail about the history of the movie.<br /><br />My choice is always for the quality of the film and sound, which is why I am going with Blu-ray; but I'm not expecting miracles, just a very high quality, satisfying upgrade of this wonderful movie.<br /><br />Bogie and Becall...clearly worth the price! Will make a wonderful holiday gift.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD has become one of my favorites.  I keep returning to it over and over.
B0017XOF5A|5.0|The Ark of Truth was an o.k. movie. I liked it because it is Stargate and because I wanted to see the actors again. Continuum, on the other hand, is superb. The story is great, the actors are fabulous - that's what SG1 was all about a couple of years ago.
0793563836|5.0|I started out with another book, All About Bass. Big mistake. Then I found this book, Ed Friedland's bass method on Amazon and am very happy with it. I especially like that it progresses slowly, with each string, and includes short CD songs right from the beginning lesson. This nailed it as far as getting me to want to practice on a regular basis. The reward of sounding good early sure helps. I took my time through Book One because I wanted to stress the basics. I'm still working through Books Two & Three, and playing along with the accompanying series Easy/More Easy Bass Lines, etc. A nice collection from Hal Leonard for sure.
B001AW9DKK|1.0|I borrowed this CD from a friend, and try as I might, I just couldn't get into it. The guitar work on the some of the tracks was classic Neil, but it seemed that overall, the music just didn't mesh too well, both on vocals and instruments. To each their own on the protest songs, but when I listen to music I want to be entertained and taken away for a while, not listen to a political agenda. Seems that CSNY is trying to find that magical portal back to the 60's when they were at the top of their game. Hang it up boys, it isn't happening.
0743290119|2.0|After reading the author's previous books, my expectations were admittedly high.  Sadly, although this book provides a generic dose of chick lit, it lacks all of the wit and sparkle of Weisberger's previous novels.  Towards the end, I actually found myself skipping through the chapters, because it was painfully obvious where each character was going....and the journey was not particularly unique or entertaining.    If possible, get this one for free at the library.  There are better ways to spend your money.
0312983867|5.0|The book was in great shape upon receipt and arrived in 2 days.  I have been pleased with the service I get from Amazon.com.
0345479092|1.0|Several other reviewers of this book have commented about bad information about breastfeeding and about this book's generally negative tone about breastfeeding and I too was deeply dismayed by that aspect of this book.  I would also like to suggest that other areas of error include claims currently contradicted by recent scientific discoveries.  For example, the presence of pet hair, criticized by \\"Baby Whisperer\\" as leading to allergies, actually has been demonstrated in several studies to help prevent the development of allergies and asthma in children.  There is clearly a need for a revised edition.    This is definitely a parent-centric book in that it seems to care more for the parents' convenience than the baby's nature and well-being.  The rigidness (sold as \\"flexibility\\") seems artificial and certainly does not fit for my son.  I hadn't actually known much about \\"attachment parenting\\" before my read of this book sent me looking to learn more, and a modified version of attachment parenting seems much more appropriate for my baby.  The general plan of \\"Eat, Activity, Sleep, You-Time\\" makes sense, but the truly rigid scheduling (which the authors tout while continuously denying that they are being rigid) is misplaced and likely to create more stress as the parents watch the clock and not the baby.    And the constant \\"luv\\" comments drove me nuts! :)
031606792X|5.0|I bought this book for my granddaughter but my two daughters-in-law both read it, too.  No one could put it down.  The whole series has fascinated them.  The book is being passed around to many others.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|Simply put, Nightmare is one of my favorite movies.  It combines fantasy, music, horror and Santa(?)...but once you hear Tim Burton's in on it, it all doesn't seem so strange.  I'm not going to tell you what the movie's about since you probably have a good idea of it, but I will tell that the Blu Ray version is superior to any version out there.  I've seen this movie so many times, but seeing it with such beautiful clarity, it feels like I'm seeing it for the first time.  I was watching the movie and a friend came over; the first thing she said when she walked through the door was \\"Oh my God!  That looks amazing!\\"  If yo own a prior version of this film, trust me, you want the blu-ray version.  The audio is so good that I actually jumped out of my seat when the doctor came around in his wheelchair lol...my dog got freaked out too.  Good luck trying to find it...I had to go to 7 different places and they were all sold out.  When Amazon has it available, make sure to scoop it up right away...this gem won't be around for long.
0321525655|5.0|I ditto what all have said. Garr Reynolds created what should be thought of as a Bible for Presentations. One area that has not been addressed in these reviews is the utility of this book for professional (i.e., medical, scientific) presentations. I find that using Reynold's basic tenets for the Introduction and Conclusion of a presentation, and inserting the hard data in the middle creates a novel and arresting change to the typical \\"Death-by-Powerpoint\\" scientific presentations. His ideas regarding appropriate ways to present data are eye-opening. I urge professionals to take a walk \\"outside of the box\\" and slowly introduce his ideas into your presentations--the improvements will be palpable!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|The true story about an unlikely hero with a non-heroic name, William Wilberforce.  The title of the movie comes from his association with and inspiration from the author of the greatest hymn and greatest work of Christian music ever written, \\"Amazing Grace\\".  The unlikely songwriter was reformed and repentant Christian ex-slave trader, John Newton, who, like Wilberforce, was a prime example of the liberal abolitionist Christians of the 18th and 19th centuries.  These great men provide a stark contrast between the conservative pseudo-Christians of today, who march in near total lockstep with the conservative business and political agenda, with the real Christian progressives (i.e., liberals) of yesteryear and today.  As accurately portrayed in the movie, the Christian liberal abolitionists squared-off in a David vs. Goliath mismatch against the united conservative business and political juggernaut of their time, in this case united behind the fortunes being made in the slave trade.  Instead of a civil war ending slavery, the British experienced the ending of this abomination due almost 100% to the determined efforts of the Christian abolitionists portrayed in the movie.     The movie does a great job of capturing and portraying the dogged determination, principled perseverance, and ultimate victory of as unlikely a group of successful and inspirational protagonists as could be imagined.  Also shown are their moments of defeat and despair that make their story the substance of real life, as well as the monumental forces resistant to changing the financially rewarding status quo they faced.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I think this season was absolutely amazing. Althought it didn't involve as much killing, it still had more than enough to satisfy that certain part of the season.  This season not only incorporated dexter's killing but also his relationships with Rita, the children and his own sister. I liked the fact that dexter seemed to have grown some kind of a conscience or some sort of feelings. Any how I think its well rounded because it has, drama, sex, killing, relationships.. what more can you ask for from a series. If you love season 1, you will also love this one.
1881273563|5.0|I think this book is great!  It is very easy to listen to, as the author is very engaging.  The author uses many examples of real couples and thier problems.  Although it is meant mostly for couples, it is useful in any relationship.  If everyone tried to learn and speak everyone else's love language, the world would be a better place!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My dad loves history and also loves miniseries like 'Band of Brothers'. This was a hit.
B0000509C4|4.0|This is by far the best of the three Creepshows.  1 was ok, and 3 was disappointing at best.  This one I really liked, especially since I remember seeing it as a kid.  Perhaps that might make be slightly bias :)
0141439610|4.0|The first 100 pages are the hardest to get through, but once Collins ushers his readers and protagonist alike into the isolated gloom of Limmeridge House it becomes plain why this is one of the most celebrated mysteries ever written. The lead couple is rather bland, in particular the heroine, but that weakness is more than compensated for by the presence of such memorable characters as the clever, resourceful Marian Halcombe and the insidious Count Fosco. The tale of greed, murder, madness, revenge and conspiracy that unfolds is well worthy of being considered one of the best and most influential gothic novels of all time.
B0017MO10U|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, the only complaint I have is.......please let O'neill and Carter get together....at last!  They have come so close and still are bound by military regulations.
0385512058|4.0|Largely autobiographical in nature, Keith Ferrazzi explains how business networking made him the success he is today.<br /><br />Ferrazzi has built his career on the successful management of his Rolodex, and presents a \\"warts and all\\" picture of his techniques. Especially helpful are the anecdotes showing how certain networking techniques he experimented with were dismal failures, and how he learned and adjusted.<br /><br />The standard business networking tips found in many business self-help books are explained in the first third of the book, what I particularly enjoyed were some of the more intermediate tips in the latter half of the book. For instance, what to do with your list of contacts and how to successfully manange it once you have accumulated a wealth of business relations and are well on your way up the career ladder.<br /><br />This book won't appeal to everyone, it tries to do too many things. Taken with a grain of a salt, it is nonetheless an enjoyable and easy business read.
0823015033|5.0|This book visually and literally demonstrates every step and technique you will need to create your art.  It is well written and easy to understand.  Whether you have never even attempted to sculpt or you are a professional this book is an excellent resource.
B000067J1Y|5.0|This classic comedy is so much fun it should be illegal as a controlled substance. Dropping a bomb on Saddam Hussein's crotch?!? Now THAT is downright hostile but also laugh-out-loud funny. Sheen's comic timing is great, and so is that of dotty old Lloyd Bridges.  Both the DVD and the seller rate A+A+A+A+.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I very much enjoyed the movie.  I wish they had a bigger budget to with which to work to give it that blockbuster feel.  But overall, it flowed really well.
B0000640ZZ|5.0|My three year old absolutely adores this movie and watches it over and over again. I love the music and don't mind it when she does watch it so many times. Compared to the music in some of the children's videos she watches, this one is very enjoyable to listen to and when the songs get stuck in my head, as they often do when I hear it so many times in a row, I don't mind at all. Beats the heck out of \\"I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map...\\"! I would highly recommend this movie as it is very entertaining for the little ones who seem to enjoy it every time they watch!
B000TGJ8A8|4.0|It has very unique story, which is completely different from the original story done by Phiilip K. Dick. The special effects are great and have done some very intersting usage of time-travel-ish action sequence.
076781326X|5.0|My mom bought this movie on VHS,(it is one of her all time favorite movies) for me when I was a kid and I absolutely loved it. I thought my daughter would also love it, but she is still a little young at three years to enjoy it fully. I was a little surprised to find subtitles in English for an English speaking movie, but found them to be quite useful for understanding some of the \\"cockney\\" English accents. This movie is a classic and the music is wonderful, especially the songs \\"Who Will Buy\\"(this beautiful morning) and \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\". I would highly recommend this movie, even if you do not care for musicals in general, it is a wonderful story and the acting is superb. Lots of good clean family fun.
0307383415|5.0|Every voter should read this book, because everyone should know who it is they are voting for or against. What defines this candidate? Not merely a set of position papers. In my case, I am voting against Senator Obama. That does not make his book any less valuable and compelling. Now more than ever I know why I am making another choice.     Some of Obama's musings in between the strictly narrative sections can be a bit ponderous. The scenes of his life, as described in this book, are full of detail, highly readable, novel-like. As such, they strike me as having been embellished, because only a man with photographic memory could accurately remember conversations and thoughts and feelings in such detail. However, I'll give Obama the benefit of the doubt that these scenes are truthfully described according to his overall memory. And frankly, I doubt the book would be as readable if such fine details were not included, whether they are strictly accurate to the letter or not.     I see a parallel between Obama's life history and his political philosophy. Obama longed to know his absent father. Obama looks to government as more than \\"Uncle Sam.\\" Government is to be Daddy to us all. Progressives may sympathize with this view, and libertarians/conservatives will recoil from it. Nevertheless, Obama's early \\"community organizer\\" days are well-covered in this book, and from the start Obama looked upon government as a solution to nearly every problem (housing, schooling, jobs, health, etc.). It is unclear to me what evidence leads Obama to believe this can ever truly lift poor minorities out of their miseries, when it seems so clear that character and lifestyle choices can undermine any gifts or advantages the government may bestow on poor communities. And that without families -- read intact families with present, functional fathers -- most poor children will never reach their full potential, unlike Mr. Obama.     Also, it is clear from the description of Barack's first service in Jeremiah Wright's church in chapter 14 that Barack was fully aware of the reverend's \\"blame the white man\\" tendencies from the start. Those tendencies may not have been addressed then in the offensive manner that ultimately got so much media attention, but the die was plainly cast. Did Wright really bring Obama literally to tears with that first sermon? I believe he may have, as described in the book.     There's no way any of us can really walk in Obama's shoes, but this book is the next best thing. Barack describes an inside view of what it was like to grow up black in American society, yet also feeling an outsider because of his multinational, multiracial origins and upbringing. It is good for all of us, of all political persuasions, to understand those kinds of struggles, and to honor Senator Obama for all he has overcome, and for his intentions to try to change things for the better.     How the reader ultimately views Obama's methods for achieving such change will depend a lot on the philosophical premises he or she brings to the reading. Still, this book is an effective tool for understanding the origin of candidate Obama's personal ambitions and his politics, whether you like them or not. Further, it serves as a sore reminder of the mental and emotional plague that is inflicted on children when their fathers are distant or completely missing in action. If only all men could understand that before they become fathers!     Barack Obama is a rich man now. For writing this book, he deserves to be. There are lessons for all of us here.

078322737X|5.0|My favorite movie of all time - after Titanic.  I grew up in the 60's, and relate to this wonderful movie.  I love everyone in it, and sometimes play it just to have the music playing while I'm doing housework.  Great plot, great acting, and love Modesto for the small town set.  Great, great movie!!
B000031WD9|5.0|This film is really funny from a teens point of view. I dont know what you adults would think though,it does have some pretty silly and disturbing scenes....But otherwise,to me,this was a hilarious crude comedy,basically about 4 dudes that really wanna score,before graduation. It starts of with a funny scene,and the acting is very acceptable,but was blatant at times by some of the cast. The love relationships were fairly unrealistic,and biased.  Now,its not as easy as it sounds,this has more crude that sex scenes....now,you either find it hilarious,laughable or totally stupid thats up to you to decide.  The script was pretty well developed,and had some scenes,which left you crying for more.  To me,the bad point was how the film developed towards the end,it slowly begins to go downhill from there,but luckily it ends before they actually ruin anything.  Well....For the sex scenes themselves,were highly un-erotic,but not stupid,and the 4 dudes really do remind you of your friends!  Is it worth the rent??Certainly?? But I recommend that if your,what?Over 25 NOT to watch it unless your really hip and cool cause you WILL understand it,but find it disgusting,and laugh is disgust basically...  Is it a film you can watch over and over again? CERTAINLY.....This film is very addictive,and no matter how many times you've seen it,you want to invite your friends over and watch it again.!  Rating of 10? Well,it might just not be a blockbuster..! But it definitey IS a great film that im extremely certain you'd enjoy!
B0017MO10U|5.0|This product came exactly as described and was delivered even faster!  Great job, Amazon!    Thanks!
B000K6QIQO|5.0|I picked this up in a West German shop while stationed there in '77, and I figured I'd found one of those albums that never made it to the states but only as a european release, in its form.  Culled together from B sides and songs that never made it onto other albums, not one of these songs could be tossed away as unworthy efforts by the best band in history.  The title track and the other McCartney tunes are stellar, as is the 'fast version' of Revolution that didn't make it onto The White Album.  George's Old Brown Shoe immediately makes my shoes tap.  I'm glad to see that it's finally here on CD.  If you're a completist, you HAVE to own this.
0765348276|4.0|A fun read, but I liked Jack Campbell's Dauntless series quite a bit more.  I disagree, in particular, with the lead review that praises the tone of the book.  I found the tone uneven and often discordant.  I also found the premise unpersuasive -- that a technologically advanced space army needs the \\"consciousness\\" of elderly people to fill out its ranks.  But the book was worth it, if only for an excellent joke about the Chicago Cubs.
031606792X|5.0|A very good book!!<br />Thanks to amazon to ship me it!<br />It has been perfect and great!!!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|First off this is the only CD i play in my car. The double bass hits harder then the homies' next to me. 5FDP is an incredible fast/heavy/trash sound that everyone I turn on to, wants this CD. I play this so much at work I got this RAP only listening girl craving this band. Ivan Moody is an amazing front man, also in Ghost Machine(more singing), and formally Motograter(not so hard hitting). His voice goes from roaring insanity to sweet serenity. If into singing more get Ghost Machine, or a little heavier and still sings then get Motograter. BUT GET THIS NO MATTER WHAT. You will be doing the same thing I am now. I unfortunatly have to say play this CD on repeat sickly more then 7 times a day on occasion, like I said it does not leave my cars CD player. If your a hard rocker and don't buy this. You are missing out on a touching piece of work. This is a taste of my style and you go figure: Slipknot, Disturbed, Mushroomhead, Demon Hunter, Static-X, Flaw/Five.Bolt.Main, Gravity Kills, Hatebreed... I like it all. But I live by this band... so just BUY IT FOOL!
0307236722|5.0|Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook will become a favorite go-to resource for everything baked.  The illustrations and technique instructions are very helpful.  I wouldn't say this is a book for the beginning baker as some of the terminology and descriptions assume some baking knowledge; but for someone who is already comfortable in the kitchen this is a wonderful guide to every category of baking.  I like how beyond the basics of each technique or recipe she takes it a bit further with a twist on the traditional - the semi-sweet chocolate coating layer on the crust of the coconut cream pie, for example.  I think this is a great well-rounded addition to any cook's library!
0452289963|5.0|This Book will change you to becoming a consious living person, and therefore preventing chaos in your life, and therefore in the The World!    You need to read this book slowly and profoundly to be part of the new earth!!
B0012GVKW8|1.0|This is the worst quality Blu-Ray I have come across so far.  $26.95 is outrageous for a DVD to Blu-Ray dub.  Your probably better off getting the widescreen DVD than the Blu-Ray and playing the movie on upscaling DVD player, you will get the same quality.  The movie is classic, just don't buy the Blu-Ray version unless you find it in a bargin bin somewhere.
B001B71NOI|5.0|IT'S RARE THAT WE WOULD USE THE WORD DISTURBING AS A COMPLIMENT BUT 'THE SLIP' IS BEAUTIFULLY DISTURBING. THE 'NINERS' ARE AN INTELECTUALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DANGEROUS BAND, NOY THE GREATEST BAND OF ALL TIME BUT THEY CERTAINLY DESERVE TO REIGN AS SUCH FOR A WEEK !!!!!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|As others have noted, this album is hard to stop listening to. Brandi Carlile has a maturity, a vocal range and evokes emotion in a way that gets under your skin and you just have to love her. Songs are well written and produced - this is not pop mainstream and yet with her ability to pull listeners in, she just might become a part of that very flow. The BEST album I've picked up in a LONG time.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I have no idea why I never watched this show when it was on TV.  This show makes me laugh out loud.  Not since the Golden Girls has a TV show been able to do that.  I got the series this past Christmas, and have finally finished the entire series.  I didn't have any problems with scratches or duplicated disks.  The only issue I had was one of the corners of the red box is messed up, but everything else worked fine.      If you don't have any of the Friends seasons and want them, then this is what you need to save up your money to buy.  Buying all the seasons individually will be more expensive.  Having 10 seasons compressed into 6 booklets for the 6 friends does pose a problem when looking for a certain episode but a book is included.    This will definitely be one of those shows that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.  LOVE IT! :)
B000OCXMAE|5.0|As an \\"older\\" (43) music junkie who's not a fan of rap rock, and I understand this band's history is heavy with it, \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" is genius. I love the darker and introspective lyrics on most of the tracks. You can feel the emotion and feeling that went into them - transports you. Also, these guys are so musically tight and so much more interesting on this album than most anything I've heard in some time it just makes you want to turn it up real loud in a room or car by yourself and dig it. Really great.
031606792X|5.0|I know that the author said this was the end of the saga - but how can she stop now?!  I need more of this story.  This was a very intriguing twist on vampires.  It was a fun, easy read and kept my interest the entire way through 4 books.
0765360969|5.0|Mistborn is a solid fantasy book, which is a rare thing in a genre which has so many mediocre books.  A standalone novel that starts a series, Mistborn tells of an interesting magic system, exciting action and strong narrative.  A pleasant diversion for any fantasy fan.
B00000JHAU|5.0|This album is best listen to while alone, driving in a car, and really really loud. You wont appreciate it completely until you do this. Spend some time with it, get to be able to sing the songs before you go dissecting the lyrics. Oh, and make sure you have enough time to listen to the album in full, and in the correct order. This album will creep up on you, if you let it. I find it's healthy to examine one's self periodically for change and understanding. In due time, this album will guide you to think about your life a little bit differently than before - something that every good folk album/song should do.<br /><br />Now, a bit on the content. I've read a few reviews that doc Stewart Murdoch's voice. Well, his sound is raw. Not in the gut wrenching, wild and willy nilly sense of the term, but in the sense that he sound like he hasn't ever taken voice lessons. You can tell that his voice is the product of a well attuned ear and a natural, and again raw, sense of music. In the end I think his voice is very unique and very very good. I've never heard anything like it at all; he very much has his own sound although it's very easy to see where he's pulled from; Nick Drake, Velvet Underground, and Donavon all come to mind. His rang is great, and the patterns, while very pleasant, are rather unusual. If your not paying attention, the music easily fades into the day.<br /><br />The only song I'm going to comment on is \\"Fox in the Snow.\\" It is a darling story of a dear troubled friend - as i believe many of their songs are. Fox refers to the girl (more commonly spoken as \\"she is a fox,\\" or \\"foxy lady\\"). Snow refers to cocaine. The rest of the lyrics are similar metaphor. Once you know what the title means, the rest is deducible. There is something all too human about this song - I cherish it like one of my own dear friends.<br /><br />Yes this album is very artsy - which is why I think many people bash it - but isn't music a form of art? If I didn't want my music to be artistic, i don't know why i would bother with music at all.<br /><br />People say this is a good introduction to Belle and Sebastian. I'm not so sure. This album is a good example of the kind of music Belle and Sebastian play, but it's very loaded. I like to think an introduction should be simple. And in that sense, none of the music by this band is a good starting place. You sort of have to just dive in - much like love - a complicated mess that makes us happy to be alive, a melancholy masterpiece. I'm not saying don't start here, just that this entry is no better than any other. Again, be prepared to spend some time, a few listens, because nothing worth loving is every completely understood the first time you experience it.why i would bother with music at all.

B000002LAC|4.0|Beautiful harmony. I would recommend this CD. I am rating it a 4 instead of a 5 because of some of the song choices. Wildflowers Don't Care Where They Grow is a great song written by Dolly. There are other great songs on this CD as well. If you like good, country, harmony you can't miss with this CD
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I've watched this one several times and I have only had it for a week.  It is great to see John Mayer as more than just the pop star.  This show includes a large variety of his musical interests.  I highly recommend it.
B001B2U1AA|5.0|A truly wonderful set of two classics. The dry humor employed in Monty Python might not appeal to all audiences, but as a lover of such shows as Arrested Development, the Simpsons, and Family Guy, these films are Great!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|The best CD we've ever bought.  Of course, we loved the movie. I think we will wear out this CD. We keep it in the car and play it rather than the radio whenever we go anywhere.   Love ABBA's music.  Thanks.
B000JLTRKE|3.0|It seems almost blasphemous to criticize this film. And perhaps WORLD TRADE CENTER is better than it seems. And perhaps the main difficulty with this movie IS that was simply too soon to treat Nine Eleven cinematically. Perhaps, perhaps.<br /><br />But the truth is that this Hollywoodization of America's darkest day is wholly inadequate in addressing its subject matter, despite a sincere attempt by all involved to make a responsible, quality film about the Trade Center disaster.<br /><br />Yes, it touches the event, transmitting about 1/1,000,000,000th of the emotion of the event to the viewer. WORLD TRADE CENTER is well-made, deserving of TWO AND A HALF STARS for good acting and authenticity, but it's focus is too narrow. By reducing itself to the story of a group of miraculously unharmed survivors, it never captures the vastness of the event or the eight million tragedies that crowded that moment in time. Despite the survival of small groups of the buildings' trapped occupants, this should not have been a film with a happy ending.<br /><br />Almost any currently-existing documentary about that day is more effective in speaking to the audience than is this film. (The conspiracy-theory-fueled College Boy film school junk film [[ASIN:B0016N52IK Loose Change Final Cut]] is an exception.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, WORLD TRADE CENTER does not succeed in bringing the event within the compass of our understanding. It may be decades before the media creates such a film. If ever.
B000V86OKG|5.0|What an amazing series...I don't subscribe to Showtime and purchased the first season on a whim...based partly on reviews and partly because I missed seeing Michael C. Hall on Six Feet Under when it ended...and I am SO glad I did! It has become the most addictive series I have ever watched on television...period! I watched the first season at a one or two episode pace till the season was done...but the second season was so different and edge of your seat thrilling, that I had to finish it as soon as possible! I love how the writers make you LOVE and empathize with a serial killer.You want him to succeed and get away with everything he does. I was sad to see a major character killed off for plot's sake at the end...but understand how it was necessary to lead to the final act of murder that Dexter needed to commit to tie up this season perfectly. Now my question is HOW on earth will the third season keep up the wonderful momentum and in what direction will they take Dexter now?<br />I can't wait to see...but will probably have to until the third season is available for purchase...and then it will be a marathon viewing!
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This Jane is so fantastic- of course, she was nominated for several prizes. Rochester was not as dark as expected, and seems to be playing at it instead of truly bitter. This makes some scenes hard to believe, like the proposal scene, where he holds out for so long. He's such a tender guy, not so much conflicted as perplexed, that it's hard to imagine him doing this. Other scenes were more convincing, though. He brings more of a \\"dandy\\" feeling to the character, so the class difference is more apparent.    This is so much fun to watch, and so fascinating to watch Jane- I have just been rewatching different scenes over and over again. Love that \\"scene selection\\" feature!    Some other jarring features were: St. John, not as in the book at all; the kissing scenes which were somehow lacking in imagination (kissing as a romantic device is overrated); the mad wife who hasn't lost her beauty and whose last scene with Rochester changes the plot line.    But all in all, this is very, very good.
B001CT877Q|4.0|since nobody is gonna review the blu-ray version i will.well to say the least this is a very clean transfer.by no means reference quality.but a nice clean transfer.if you are a fan of this movie you will be thrilled.the dolby true hd is where this blu-ray really shines.once again not reference quality but very satisfying.if you had the dvd this soundtrack blows it away.the only thing to note is when you pop this movie in, the movie starts right away so to get the dolby true hd soundtrack you have to go into the menu and change it because it uses the standard dolby digital 5.1 by default.which i thought was kinda weird but oh well.so if you like this movie get it!15.00 you cant lose!
0451169514|3.0|This might have been the best Stephen King could have ever written, unfortunately it went awful at the end. I gave it three stars because the first 500 pages were good, but it starts to be boring at page 600. I think it could have been better if it had been only 600 or 700 pages long. I am sure many fans will read or have read this book and most of them gave it 5 stars which absolutely it does not deserve. I have only read like 22 books by Stephen King and I can say that It is not the best I have read from him.
0786838655|4.0|Rick Riordan's THE LIGHTNING THIEF is the first in his children's fantasy series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and it sets up a world in which denizens of ancient Greek mythology are alive and well in our contemporary times. I dig Greek mythology, so this book was a no-brainer must-get for me. Halfway thru reading THE LIGHTNING THIEF, I jumped online and ordered the three sequels (and then, of course, I went back to reading).<br /><br />A bit on the plot now: He's never been quite that ordinary boy, hasn't 12-year-old New Yorker Percy Jackson. Suffering from dyslexia and ADHD and always having peculiar things happen to him, Percy has always felt like an outcast. The schools he's attended have all singled him out for expulsion, and at home he shares an uneasy existence with his abusive dad-in-law. The only bright lights in his life are his supportive mother and his only friend, Grover, who's a bit of a sissy. But, it turns out, there's a reason for all of Percy's woes...<br /><br />After even more weirdness in his life (including his math teacher's attempt to kill him), Percy Jackson finds his way to Camp Half-Blood (a magical refuge and training ground for fellow demi-gods), where he finally learns that he is the son of the sea god Poseidon and destined, it seems, for big things. He also learns that his best bud Grover is actually a satyr. Percy's tumultuous time at Camp Half-Blood ends abruptly when he's charged with a quest to retrieve Zeus's stolen lightning bolt, a task intended to avert a cataclysmic war among the gods. But the quest comes with a ten day deadline. Ten days, to trek cross-country from New York to Los Angeles, where the Underworld and its god Hades await. Bad for Percy, good for the reader.<br /><br />There's also a little running subplot centering on Percy being wanted by the police for juvenile delinquency. Percy's also implicated in the disappearance of his mother.<br /><br />Rick Riordan aims his urban fantasy at a pre-teen audience and hits his mark, but also manages to net older readers. At 375 pages long, THE LIGHTNING THIEF doesn't claim the heft of a Harry Potter novel, or its complexity, inventiveness, or resonance - not yet, anyway. Comparisons to Harry Potter are near inevitable, what with both lead protagonists embroiled in prophecies and heroic destinies. Not to mention, Annabeth - half-mortal daughter of Athena and, with Grover, one of Percy's quest companions - might seem too familiar a character, reminiscent of a certain brainy teenaged witch at Hogwart's. To me, so far, Rowling's stuff is superior, but then, I've only read the first book in Riordan's series. THE LIGHTNING THIEF still qualifies as an entertaining and lighthearted fantasy adventure. I'm not at all surprised that a film series is in the works (I hear, sometime in 2009).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the sense of fun running thru these pages. Particularly when the author unveils his wicked chapter titles, my favorites being \\"I Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-algebra Teacher,\\" \\"Three Old Ladies Knit the Socks of Death,\\" and \\"I Battle My Jerk Relative.\\" And, yet, Riordan instills enough seriousness in Percy's adventures and the epic stakes are treated with enough concern that you can't just dismiss the story as strictly a farcical fantasy romp. I admit, though, that the sequence with the bed & mattress store may be a bit too silly.<br /><br />I like the conceit of gods dwelling in our midst, and specifically the Greek gods, who, in many ways, seem to be as petulantly human as we regular mortals. Riordan postulates that the gods have always been drawn to where western civilization is at its most potent. And this time around, that's in the States. As such, we get to read about the kids braving the Empire State Building, on which 600th floor the hidden Mt. Olympus is anchored. That the Underworld is now located in Los Angeles seems too perfect for words. Meanwhile, a passing familiarity with Greek mythology is nice and heightens theenjoyment, as Riordan goes to reveal how certain mythological figures have adapted to modern day life.<br /><br />I'm not yet sold on Percy Jackson, the character. The story is told thru Percy's first person perspective, which means that at times the narrative is streaked thru with attitude and pre-teen anxieties. Percy displays all of a modern kid's characteristics; he's at times hip and sardonic but also abrasive, foolish, hot-headed and exasperating. And I guess that's realistic enough. I think I like the kid, and I certainly can't wait to read more about him. Himself new to the magic around him, Percy makes a good point-of-view character, as he interacts with these folks cut from old legend and as he stumbles onto his demi-godlike abilities. I also dig the magic pen.<br /><br />Fast paced and with enough moments of Percy and company being beset by monsters, THE LIGHTNING THIEF ends in a way which lets you know that Percy's challenges will only continue to mount. The stage is set in later books for Percy to face off against a foe perhaps even more formidable than the Olympian Gods. Percy Jackson will certainly have a chance to become a great hero. And, really, when your name is short for Perseus, there's a lot to live up to.enjoyment, as Riordan goes to reveal how certain mythological figures have adapted to modern day life.<br /><br />I'm not yet sold on Percy Jackson, the character.

B00005JNEI|5.0|this will open your eyes to our government for sure and make you want to know more. Can get you mad at the things we don't know about our government because we don't take the time to know them things. I have watched this numerous times . It is very interesting how 1 person starts a small chain that can destroy our country.
0316067601|4.0|I have read many (as many as I can get my hands on) survival books (Endurance: An Epic of Polar Adventure by Frank Arthur Worsley is still the best.) This book, unlike my other survival stories pits our Hero against an Enemy of the human kind as opposed to the Elements of nature. It is well written and provides a point of view that is unique and needs to be heard. I wish the other Heroes of this book could write one too.
0393061310|4.0|i haven't finish reading this book, i'm on the tenth chapter...but it is really interresting and that all ican say about this book.
B000P2A24W|4.0|I was originally a huge fan of the 1980s Bon Jovi sound, so much that when the musically brilliant \\"Keep The Faith\\" came out in 1992, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't rock enough even though I played and knew that album inside and out.  After that, Bon Jovi kind of dropped off the radar for me until their true comeback single \\"It's My Life\\" in 2000.  That album, \\"Crush\\", and its follow up, \\"Bounce\\", certainly had their moments, but to me some of the tracks on each were lacking something.  Then came 2005's \\"Have A Nice Day\\", which to me was Bon Jovi's most satisfying release since at least \\"Keep The Faith\\" and maybe even \\"New Jersey\\".  Unlike many others, I completely embraced the sound and overall direction of that album.  I mention this to point out that I am not stuck only on Bon Jovi's '80s sound.<br /><br />All that being said, this \\"Lost Highway\\" release is a slight step back for me after \\"Have A Nice Day\\".  For sure, it is interesting to hear Bon Jovi mix more country elements into their music than ever before.  As usual, the playing and musicianship on the album are top notch.  Songs like the opening title track, the very catchy \\"Summertime\\", and the anthemic \\"Any Other Day\\" are all excellent tracks on the album.  However, the overall pace drags a bit in other spots.  While I appreciate the sentiment of \\"(You Want To) Make a Memory\\", it is just too dreary of a pace for a first single not to mention Bon Jovi sappy sentiment that we have heard so many times before.  Same holds true for \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\" with Leann Rhymes.  Good track but not quite what I want to hear from Bon Jovi.<br /><br />For sure, I like this album, but I don't LOVE it like other releases from the past two years from some of my favorite all-time artists.  Hopefully, Bon Jovi will go back in a more rock direction with their next release.  They'll never go back to their '80s sound, which is fine; but they just need more consistently catchy and uptempo releases than this one is.
0449911357|5.0|this book is awesome. read it in like 2 hours. i loved the movie and the book surpassed my expectations!
B000Y179KO|5.0|This was way more than I expected, both in terms of quantity and quality.  20 new songs from a band that hadn't released a full-length studio album in 28 years was a surprise, for sure.  Even more surprising is just how many of these tracks I absolutely love.  From their early country rock days (\\"How Long\\") to their amazing balladry (\\"Do Something\\") to Joe Walsh-led rock masterpieces (\\"Last Good Time in Town\\"), all forms are represented and brilliantly so.  The 10-minute title track that leads off disk two is an example of the band adding something new to the mix as well.  For sure, the overall mix is top-notch.  This band has always been about grade A musicianship, and on this album every note is played and sung perfectly.  The sheer simplicity of certain melodies is pure genius.  Clearly, these guys haven't lost it musically after all these years.  This one stands up to their legendary stuff from the 1970s.  Well done!!
B0013FNC38|4.0|I am a huge Jason Mraz fan and was extremely excited to finally get his new album. I have to say, it took me a couple minutes to see where the album was going, but it was worth the wait.  The style of the album does differ from those of the past, but I like what I hear. His happy go lucky song writing skills shine through yet again.  Loved it!
0930289234|4.0|While I was a huge comic fan as a kid, this was the first graphic novel I've read, and the first comic I've read in 8 years. It was a great reintroduction to a wonderful medium. I had always been more of a Marvel fan in my comic heyday, but DC held ingenuity I hadn't seen. The story is more believable than your traditional superhero vs. supervillian.<br /><br />I decided to read \\"The Watchmen\\" after I heard that it had won a Hugo Award, and was on the Time list of top 100 novels. The Watchmen has set the bar high for graphic novels, and I look forward to dabbling more into this genre.
B000K7UG20|5.0|Skip the details.  The movie is excellent entertainment and looks stunning.  That's all you need to know.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|You can try to defend this movie all your want, for being misunderstood and wrongly accused of exploitation. But this movie is junk. Maybe it has a great meaning to you, but for a meaning like that to be effective, the movie first has to be good. This film is nowhere near being a great film. Start with the acting..    And if you're watching this specifically to be grossed out, it may not even happen. This film is not as graphic as one may make it seem. It's the overall feeling you get once the movie's over that makes you want to crawl into a hole. Watch Cannibal Holocaust if you want something gut-wrenching. Watch Salo if you enjoy watching 16-year-old boys getting sodomized for 2 hours.
0321344758|5.0|If you're a digital media professional, there probably isn't anything here you didn't already know. But it's the kind of book that keeps you nodding your head with it in unison page after page. It's also very well written--Steve is the kind of guy you'd like to have a beer with. His takeaways are straightforward, painless, and evergreen. Should be required reading for every design and production person joining your team.
1400049628|5.0|If you are looking for humor you will not find any jokes in this book, it reads EXACTLY like a survival guide for zombie attacks.  The concept alone is where you draw humor.    Just be careful if you take this on a flight, it has pictures of guns and such and I was getting weird looks.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|The original series was the only must see Friday Night show worth staying home for.  The series was captivating and inspiring in many ways.  The music and fashion were as much a part of the show as the plot was.  Sadly the movie does not live up to this.  I felt the movie storyline stayed true to the original characters and the plot would have made for a solid episode, but there was nothing special about the movie.  The movie gets by on its name and the longing of the watcher to go back to and relive the 80's.  This movie is worth a Sunday afternoon not a Friday night.
0743201140|5.0|Probably the best management and personnel development tool around! Four staff members were each given a copy to read and to follow the instructions for getting an analysis. Each was asked to  bring the analysis for their annual job review. They expected the typical \\"this is good and  that is bad\\" comments but found that when they reviewed their positive traits they were asked \\"how can you apply that in your job?\\" Ar real morale and performance builder.
0784011710|5.0|Amazing, brilliant, powerful the whole movie leads to the climax which is not what you expect. Meryl Streep is again incredible! how does she do it, very very believable...
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I was just dumbfounded by the cultural references so obvious in this series especially how the writers must have used these books to develop the characters. How the women were pressured to marry 'right' whether out of a seven sisters college or by following the rules of gurley-brown to enjoy work in the pink collar ghetto because its serves a two fold purpose: to get a man and/or keep your mind off of being single. And the men are expected to conform to rigid corporate rules by having the 'right' wife segregated in domesticity but be expected to get the clients/or theirselves laid.
B0018RWM9G|4.0|As might be expected, producer Brian Eno has once again done his magic for a popular band that (in this case) was in need of some direction.  His approach of layering tracks to slowly build a song's momentum seems a perfect match for Coldplay's material and general style, giving this album a stylistic focus that was lacking in XY.
0316168815|2.0|Just finished it a few minutes to go. I find myself wondering what I've done with my time. I selected this one because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews. Reader's calling it \\"the best book they'd ever read\\" and \\"favorite of all time.\\" So, I'll begin with the positive. The story is told from an unusual narrational vantage point. This made me very enthusiastic in the beginning of the read. However, the creativity stops there. Seriously, that's it.     On to the negative...Im not sure that there was enough support given to explain the relationship between some of the characters. I found myself repeatedly wondering how/why certain insignificant characters kept being looped back into the story. Case in point, Samuel's brother, Hal. What was the point of him? For most of the story I thought of Hal and Samuel as a joint character and both light and insignificant. I digress...    More to the point...the middle of this story really caught some drag. I found it to be very boring. I only finished it because of the wonderful reviews from gracious readers. I just knew it had to pick up!     When the conclusion of the story finally arrived it came in the form of a cheap grand finally. I'm aware that it may be idiotic to complain that a fictional story lacks logic. But I must say that the resolution of this book was very illogical. The final happenings seemed very abrupt and, I felt over-all, cheapened the story. The writing became vague in detail and what there was to make sense of was really out there like a bad twilight zone episode. Before you know it, it's all over and you are being cutely dismissed. (You'll know what I mean when you get there.) In the final words I couldn't shake the personal thought that the story wasn't well structured. The subject matter was unevenly spread. Im sorry I was not able to agree with the majority the reviewers. It started out with an interesting notion but over all I found it disappointing.
B00001OH7X|2.0|The \\"Berlin\\" trilogy - and David Bowie's collaboration with Brian Eno - was a penniless and weary traveler by the time of this May 1979 release.<br /><br />Gone was the experimental edginess and creative power of Low and Heroes, which was replaced by a bland pop framework. Only the excellent Red Money dares to venture into a unique soundscape.<br /><br />The first single - Boys Keep Swinging - is as bland as DJ - the follow-up 45 rpm - is energetic. The solid Look Back In Anger remains a Bowie gem that gets lost in the shuffle of his vast discography.<br /><br />This was grand potential probably lost by a lack of new studio ideas and boredom. Too bad the rent came due much too soon for Bowieno.
1600241824|1.0|We purchased this to listen to in our car on a long trip and it put us to sleep. Very corny and boring.
B00004Y6NU|3.0|I find the music on this CD very nice, but can't really get into most of the song lyrics. Best example of this is Telegraph Road - very nice guitar with piano and other things thrown in, but the lyrics aren't anything to write home about. I like Industrial Disease the best on here - fun and lively. Safe to skip this in favor of Making Movies or another better Dire Straits disk.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|We the viewers get the full grindhouse treatment with scratches hair fuzz and missing reels.Psycho stalks and kills with stunt cars as his weapon of choice.Great cast and humour.
0143113100|5.0|This book has changed how I think about my brain.  I'll admit I used to believe that we were hard wired in certain areas of the brain and once the brain broke it could never be fixed.  I remember hearing that growing up.  I also remember that my father had a brain injury and other than getting lost and distracted he was able to do what ever he needed to do.  This book explains how it was possible that he was able to do that. It proves that Neuroplasticity is possible and give us methods with which to do it.      I can understand some people might have a reluctance to pick up a book that's about Neurology.  It sounds dry and difficult.  But the use of cases and stories to explain the evolution of the theories will guide the non-scientist through this breakthrough research on the brain.  It's not a difficult read.     He talks about the changes that happen when we age and what we can do to stave off the worst ones.  It's not a surprise really we all know people who age well. They follow his suggestion and so retain their faculties into advanced age (whether they knew them or not).  He tells the story of several people with severe brain injury and how they have managed to recover in very significant ways.
031606792X|3.0|I read Breaking Dawn in a week and of all the Twilight books out there, I thought this was the worst. There was so much Bella/Edward goo that I wanted to throw up. The plot, though the surprises were really... surprising, was slow and predictable. The one good thing I can say about Breaking Dawn was it was a fulfilling end to a great saga, even if the other books were much better.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|If you don't like Audrey Tautou, don't worry.  Her role is minor.<br /><br />Take some university students from all over Europe, throw them into an apartment in Spain, and wind up with a far more accurate and observant movie than I had any right to expect.  Funny, clever, witty, and unexpectedly character-driven with a plot that works.  I'm pleased.
0451169514|5.0|When I was younger I saw It the movie and I thought it was terrifying.  It gives no justice to how scary this book is or how good it is for that matter.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I highly recommend it!
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is a tale of what happens when the morality police get their judgments completely wrong.  Still the movie makes it's point without clobbering viewers over the head.  The movie, set in the mid-1900s, stars Depp as an kindhearted \\"pirate,\\" and Binoche as a nomadic, chocolat making, single mother, (who is also step-mother to a \\"kangaroo.\\")     The juxtaposition between characters main and sub, old and young, religious or not, is interesting to follow each has their own unique story to tell.  Though set before my time, the movie's themes feel relevant long after the closing credits end.    The scenery and soundtrack are wonderful start to finish and the movie's gentle, but steady flow is a joy to watch. This is a perfect date movie and yes, you will need a fireplace, some premium chocolat and a bottle of good French wine.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|This is a cute DVD, but I wouldn't recommend it for children under 5 years old due to some of it content.
1416905014|5.0|This is one special book! The pop-ups are unbelievably beautiful...and so many of them!  Handling this book will probably require supervision for the young reader but, with care, should be around to delight and entertain for many years. They didn't skimp on the story just to hi-light the pop-ups, either.  It's complete and well told. Sharing this book with a child will make for some quality time spent together.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first Toy Story.  I highly recommend it.
B001BKXUOQ|2.0|Actually its Slipknot.  Look I don't mind a band changing as long as that change is actual growth, and they can't just go and sound like another band.  Well they can I'm just not going to like it.  Basically this is a Stone Sour cd with more screaming.  Even Taylor's singing on this one sounds like Stone sour.  In the past he's kept a seperate style for both bands.  Not on this one.  One thing I like about Stone sour is that they're not Slipknot, can't stand looking through glass though.      I won't go into every song, but a few were worth noting.  Vendetta is the most annoying song of the year.  If not for the fact that it rips off Testament, can't remember which song right now, it'd be listenable, but this is rediculous.  Gahenna is a song I could've seen either band do, and its probably my favorite.  I like the vocals in the chorus, pretty dark slower song.  Sulfer is pretty good, although the lyrics leave me scratching my head, I just don't get them.  Most people like Psychosocial and I do too.  Its my second favorite song on the album.  Snuff had some potential, but the lyrics were kind of whiney.  Other songs I kinda like are Wherein Lies Continue, All hope is gone, and Butcher's Hook.    Overall its an ok cd.  It just sounds too Stone sour for me.  I like Stone Sour, but if I want to hear Stone sour I'll listen to Stone sour.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|When I first heard that Judas Priest was doing a 2 disc concept album I was intrigued, but I had my doubts.  I then heard there would be symphonic elaments.  I thought that could be cool.  Usually when rock and symphonic music mix it can have varying results, but the concept is a good idea.  Unfortunately the album doesn't deliver, for me anyway.    I'll say that I'm not the biggest Priest fan.  I like a few songs off of each album, but there isn't really a whole album that I love.  That being said I was willing to give this a shot.  The first thing that struck me was the lyrics.  I was enjoying the first intro track that blended into the first actual song, but then the chorus of \\"I am Nostradamus,\\" came in and just threw me off.  I know I like some songs with bad lyrics, but that just didn't fit.  Still I pressed on.  The lyrics didn't improve much, I got sick of every two lines rhyming.  I know it hapens in music, but it got to the point where I was predicting, insert bad nostradamus joke of your choice here, the which words he'd use to rhyme, ask pass and so on.  I would have liked some variation, maybe instead of every two lines rhyming, maybe have two out of four rhyme, in some songs.  When I finnished the first disc, I felt the same as when I'd heard Angel of whatever their previous album's called.  There were some good moments, but nothing really grabbed me.  Also having so many intros became predictable.  Speaking of which why were those seperate tracks anyway?  The last track on this disc kinda did something for me, but there was no chorus, which wouldn't necessarily make it a bad song if it was something progressive that built towards something, but it didn't.  That is one thing this album both discs misses is that song with the great chorus that sticks in your head, it doesn't have to be overly poppy, but memorable.    The second disc was a much more nausiating experience, but it did produce the only two tracks that did anything for me on first listen, Alone and Visions.  On this one they lost what variety they had on disc 1.  Pretty much everything was rediculously slow and boring.  Then there was the title track.  It moved, but again with the Nostradamus over and over again.  I know the album's entitled Nostradamus, but come on at least try to be poetic, rather than beating us over the head with it.    After it was all over, I couldn't help but feel empty.  I gave it more time, and a few songs kinda did something for me.  I like revalation, but Halford's singing in the chorus sounds like he's bored.  That brings me to another thing on this one.  Halford's vocals lack the passion of previous albums, with and without Priest.  This is the same man who gave us Resurrection, a great album.    My last complaint is that the guitars were too far in the background, and I didn't really hear many memorable riffs.  I could elaberate, but I'm tired of typing.    Bands grow and change, sometimes for the better and sometimes not.  I'm not opposed to that, but they have to remember their fans and give them at least a few songs of an older style.  I will say this for them, at least they didn't go alternative pop.  Why people call that growth when a band does that is beyond me.  Songs I like are Visions, Alone, Future of mankind, Revelation, Death, and Pestilence And Plague.  I wanted to wait a while to let this grow on me, but it just didn't.  If you're looking for a metal concept album I'd recomend Iced Earth's Crucible of man.  Actually I'd recomend Iced Earth in general.  They're a great band.
B0000YEEHG|4.0|They say that Bergman is a complex director. But he's really all about one thing: cruelty. Almost all of his major films are about people hurting other people. The violence can be physical, like in \\"The Virgin Spring,\\" but usually it plays out through lengthy dialogues and monologues. The characters choose their words very carefully, in order to construct the most devastating phrasing. In all of cinema, Bergman is the absolute master of the art of hurting people with words.    About halfway through his career, Bergman stopped dressing up the emotional abuse with religious allegory. His films became less dependent on plot, their settings became narrower and more intimate. But the more they were reduced to their cruel essence, the more shockingly convincing they became. The later films are Bergman's best work -- \\"Cries And Whispers\\" (the best, in my opinion), \\"Scenes From A Marriage\\" and \\"Autumn Sonata\\" are all vicious and riveting. The one exception is \\"Fanny And Alexander,\\" which is much kinder than usual, perhaps because Bergman had some warm feelings about childhood.    \\"Persona\\" fits into this fine tradition. The cinematography is stark and unadorned. The sets have very few props, which appear when they are needed and disappear again. Many scenes take place against a plain white background, without even discernible walls. It's impossible to get any sense of the layout of the house the characters live in. There are only four people in the film, only one of whom has a large speaking role. For the most part, the camera alternates between close-ups of their faces. Half of each face is often covered in shadow, which leads to an unsettling visual trick toward the end.    The sterile visuals put the focus on the emotional conflict. Only Bergman could have thought of that famous scene where Alma moves the piece of glass into Elisabeth's way. That elaborate, passive-aggressive malice is his calling card. The scene is similar in spirit to the flashbacks in \\"Cries And Whispers\\" where the women drive their husbands to despair. Bergman's characters attack with something as delicate as nudging a piece of glass with one's foot.    Prior to this scene, the film feels slow. The odd, arty opening, the cinematography, the silent main character are all disconcerting, and make it difficult to feel involved. But when the sharp piece of glass appears on the ground, the effect is heart-stopping. Before Alma has even moved, while she's still eyeing Elisabeth's movements, the hostility is so tangible that it's overwhelming. From there, it doesn't let up until the end.    The verbal violence comes later, in the other famous scene, the double monologue in the end. It doesn't really matter whether Alma's assessment of Elisabeth's character is accurate. She wants to draw blood (a literal wound suddenly appears soon after), so she says exactly those things that will hurt Elisabeth the most. Her choice of words is extremely sophisticated -- you'd have to try pretty hard just to think of the things she says, even if you were talking to your worst enemy. And, of course, she winds herself up as she's talking. Bergman's characters hate themselves as much as they hate everyone else. So, Elisabeth's silence is an equally sophisticated response, it's like a nightmare where you can't get through to your interlocutor no matter what you say.    While Alma speaks, the camera shows Elisabeth's silent face. Then, the monologue is repeated, but now the camera shows Alma talking. Bergman's reuse of the same dialogue in this scene has already been analyzed by everyone. But I think it's simple -- the film repeats the scene so that you won't miss any of the pain inflicted by the words. This way, you get the full reaction from both women, first you're forced to watch Elisabeth listening to the whole thing, then Alma speaking it.    You might ask if Bergman had any point in mind aside from showing people emotionally devastating each other. I don't know -- I'm sure there aremany interpretations of the film that try to find one. But I don't think it matters that much. Although Alma talks a lot in the film, Bergman never really gives you any way to understand her. Her long sex monologue (Bergman may appear boring and old-fashioned now, but actually, he is often extremely explicit) really only shows that she's a very cold person. For this reason, she deeply resents having to be nice to people, including her husband. That's about it. Bergman is always more convincing when he's depicting coldness than when he's trying to explain it. \\"Autumn Sonata\\" is like that too.    Are there any actual people who act like these characters in real life? Maybe, maybe not, but that's beside the point. The hostility is very real, however stylized the expression. Why you'd want to watch that is another question, but if you do, it may be hard to forget.
B000O77SOK|5.0|I enjoyed The Practice - Vol. one...would like to be able to get volume two....The video isn't boring as you'd think lawyer shows can be, it's also humourous at times and relates to happennings in real life. I also enjoy that their personel life is brought in as well as the public cases.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|I bought this DVD because it says \\"Donner Cut\\", which means remade by original director that was fired by the studios and after viewing this dvd, rightly so.  Ok, first Superman movie #1 is awesome, but I'm not sure whether it's old age or he just lost it, but this cut is horrible, just horrible.  I almost didn't recognize the first Superman movie I watched as a kid (I saw Superman #1 later)  Gone is the spectacular Eiffel Tower scene and in its place a poorly done prologue of the first movie?!  That was ghastly.  Gone is the famous Lois falling off Niagra Falls scene and in its place, a shotty screen test involving Lois and a pistol?  Yikes!  Actually there were so many action shots gone, a lot of Brando shots included which even though is Brando, does not really add to the story at all and is quite boring because it's just a halogram of his head!  Gone is the kiss that Clark gave Lois so she forgets everything and in its place is something we see in first movie, but just presents plot holes galore it this movie.  Lastly, gone is the satisfying ending with Superman bringing back the roof of the White House.  What the...  Anyway, avoid this at all costs whether you have seen or not seen the original Superman II.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!!!  Josh Groban is beyond amazing, and I simply never get tired of listening to him!  I think the live recording adds something to the energy of his performance as well, so I recommend the live version.
B000IJ79V6|4.0|This is one the best Superman movies ever made.  There is a never-ending debate on whether this or the first movie is the best, but I just buy both of them!  Personally, I do prefer the first one, given the legendary cast and writers and a lot of what is in the first movie actually was supposed to be in the second movie.  Investor/studio pressures force the director to put all the goodies in first movie to ensure its success so there should really be no contest.  But yes, this movie does put Superman face-to-face with more worthy villains which gives him something to fight against.  My favorite parts are actually those involving Lois and Clark because they have great chemistry.  Make sure you get this dvd and not the blu-ray Donner cut which is just atrocious...don't make same mistake as I did.
159562015X|4.0|I used the review of this book with my staff of seven.  I purchased a book for each of them and had them take the on-line survey ahead of time.  Then, they each brought their individual results to the retreat which led to a good discussion.  I recommend this type of activity for work groups.  It helped us understand each other's strengths and how to work together more effectively.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|If you're a fan of Batman, this is a must-have.  If you're not a fan, then not sure if this is for you.  Cartoons are only good until you just totally grow out of them.  Real-life action movies can be enjoyed for many years to come.<br /><br />Batman<br />First ground-breaking, jaw-breaking movie of the original series.  Keaton is passable as Batman even though he's just way too wimpy-looking with the curly hair.  This is the movie that breaks Batman out of its camp.  This is to Batman movies what The Dark Knight Returns is to comics.  Nicholson steals the show and adds some humor to this dark, gothy Batman.<br /><br />Batman Returns<br />Even better than the original.  Burton has full creative freedom and is now allow to make a Burton film which really shines in this movie.  Some of the best Batman action you will ever see without the use of fancy vehicles or machinery (Yes, action you would not even see in Nolan's series)  This is the darkest Batman movie I ever saw (Even darker than Nolan's Dark Knight, and bloodier).  Penguin is a disfigured hobo that comes out of the sewer.  Michelle Peiffer plays catwoman.  Need I say more?  The blood and spookiness is probably what made parents complaining to WB and resulting in the dismissal of Burton and in turn would give us...<br /><br />Batman Forever<br />Total camp as demanded by the studios.  Contrary to what people think, the director wanted to do a dark Batman, but complaints from fuming parents brought the studio to its knees.  It is not bad, as Batman battles a giggly Riddler (Not a great villain) and a joker-esque Two-Face (Horrible, just horrible).  Nicole Kidman as Dr Chase is lackluster.  It is hard to believe that this is the same woman that won an Oscar!  Are there any good things about this movie?  Hardly.  Batmobile looks like a toy (Oh yeh, they are trying to sell toys).  Gotham City never look so fake.  The introduction of Robin and his origin is probably the only good thing about this movie.<br /><br />Batman & Robin<br />This is the movie that killed the franchise for a while until Nolan rebooted it.  Personally, I prefer this over Forever, but that's not really saying much.  Batman and Robin battles Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane.  Batgirl pitches in to help.  Maybe it's the horrible Mr Freeze one-liners delivered by none other than the Governator himself, or the many costumed crotch shots shown, or the corny \\"I'll get drive-thru\\" joke lines (Were they supposed to be funny?), or the gazillion marketing promotions like Batcard that killed this movie, but the snow scenes do allow you to reminice the Batman Returns days and Poison Ivy is possibly the hottest villain vixen on-screen.d the franchise for a while until Nolan rebooted it.

0316113077|5.0|I love this book.  I expected a book about how to carve and decorate these fabulous cakes that the bakery is famous for.  I was unprepared for the thoroughness of the introductory sections on tools and methods, and the details in the directions.  I bought this book thinking it would be an addition to my library of ideas, and I find that I've added to my library of really good instruction in the basics in addition.  I recommend it to everyone who is interested in creating fun carved and decorated cakes, beginners and advanced alike. Since I'm not interested in cookies at the moment, I can't comment on the cookies section.
B000002OVJ|5.0|First time I heard this was over FM radio wearing headphones lying in bed, listening.  They played the whole thing and they had short interval of somthing weird and then played the next cut, did this for the whole album, it was 1970 somthing.    IF you havent listened to this whole thing with real headphones without distraction, do it, trust me, do it, I would not lie.  Good lesson for guitar players also.
0446677450|4.0|This book tells the story of Kiyosaki and a friend who were taunted about being poor which motivated them to learn how to be rich from their \\"rich dad\\". Two dads are presented in the book: one is socialist and poor; the other is capitalist and rich. Their thinking creates their wealth or lack of it.     This is a book that explains simply how the three classes handle and think about money. By learning how the rich create money, a reader may be able to leave the rat race. It really depends on the reader whether he can overcome his fear of taking risks so he can have a chance of becoming rich. For instance, L and K mention that one would be wise to get used to what one hates doing, rather than solely doing what you love to do. So you should do sales to learn how to overcome your fear of rejection and learn how to communicate better. You should learn many different fields of business to become more successful in general. Don't get stuck solely doing a job you like for limited income.    One should learn to invest in real estate and high risk/high reward investments to become rich. You need to put more effort in making money than just doing a job and saving money every month. You need to learn to take risks and learn how to keep failing until you succeed. You should read about investing voraciously to become financially literate.     Schools don't teach you how to make money. They teach you how to be an employee of an employer that you are making rich. Employees are soft-core slaves with the mentality of servants or slaves. This book teaches you the mentality of the master of money, the king of pentacles. It shows the mindset of the poor and middle class that keep them in their places.    I particularly liked the idea of asking the question \\"How can I afford what I want?\\" instead of saying \\"I can't afford it.\\" The question unleashes the creative power of the mind that creates wealth, the other statement shuts it down. Or you should ask yourself, \\"How can I get out of the rat race?     There is an interesting explanation about how businesses are different from governments. Business owners consider employees liabilities since they increase labor costs and investors do not like to see increased costs on the balance sheet of the business owner. The strategy is to hire as a few employees as possible at the lowest cost so that the business can make a profit. The system is one of employees working just enough not to get fired and employers paying just enough to employees so they will not quit. Government  does the opposite. Agencies spend all their budget and hire more employees to keep the agency growing. Taxpayers foot the bill for the expansion of government. That is why the cost of government tends to rise as time goes by.    At one time, there was no income tax in America, but the tax was implemented by using class envy against the rich. Eventually the income tax reached into the pockets of poorer citizens to pay for the cost of expanding government. The rich use corporations to reduce their income tax burden, the poorer citizens do not. Taxes are our biggest expense nowadays. We work from January to May to pay off our tax burden. L and K do not like the immoral story of Robin Hood who steals from the rich to give to the poor. It is wrong to forcibly take money from anyone, no matter how rich they are. This book advocates a republican view of economics. Everyone is ultimately responsible for making their own money and no one should be taxed to give to someone else.     The authors remind us of our cruel capitalist system by mentioning a pension planner's response about what employees who are not at the top will get for a pension plan. The smiling reply was a \\"silver bullet\\" that they could kill themselves with once their money was gone. In other words, people cannot depend on the government or business to take care of them, especially after the unstable dollar is no longer linked to the gold standard and only has \\"fiat\\" value, whichwill lead us to financial disaster. They do not care and they may not have the money available to take care of you. You will have to increase your financial intelligence to get money for retirement in the future.    There is more on investment strategy. One needs to buy assets such as stocks, bonds, tax liens, and real estate for investment to get rich. It is a good idea to ask attorneys and banks whether they have any foreclosure deals. Houses that you live in are considered a liability because of taxes, maintenance costs, and insurance costs. This is a good book for getting someone to think differently about money. It does not go into detail about buying real estate, stocks, foreclosure deals, tax liens, or bonds. One can go slow and safe and put money in a 401k but you better start at 20 because it will take a long time to become well off. This book is for those who want to take greater risks to possibly reap more rewards and riches.    Like most of these money gurus, they offer their knowledge for a price to cure the world's poverty problems and the increasing gap between rich and poor. Lest you think that the authors are solely vulture capitalists, they do emphasize the idea of giving to receive without expecting return. The book gives good advice as long as you are strong enough to change and follow it. Not many will be able to. Like most self-help gurus, they believe people can change.
B0019X3YXM|5.0|Having never seen the Korean version of this film, I can't tell anyone if it follows the same concept or plot.  But, I don't think you have to see the Korea version to enjoy this film.  It's touching, a little off beat,and leaves the viewer with a \\"warm and fuzzy\\" feeling.    I bought this DVD as on impulse and I was very glad that I did. The atmosphere of the film is beautiful, the dialogue is fluid, and the actors do a good job portraying the characters they were given.  The entire movie is portrayed as a fairy tale, and I think that at heart, that is what it is...a nice light hearted film that makes you feel happy after you watch it.

031606792X|1.0|There was only one word I could say when I finally finished this book.  It was \\"wow\\".  It was not a \\"WOW!!!\\" as in 'that book was the best ever!'  It was just a plain flat \\"wow\\", as in 'What in the world happened in this book?'  Too many things went wrong in this book.<br /><br />*SPOILERS BELOW*<br /><br />Renesmee.  Okay, Rosalie talked of wanting a baby, and Esme's story, and Bella seeing two kids she could of had with Jacob in a vision.  Stephenie Meyer called those foreshadowing to Bella having a baby.  I would guess that 99% of the fan base took all that as trying to get Bella to see just exactly what she would be giving up, sacrificing, to be with Edward.  Apparently not.  Edward has \\"special venom\\", so no sacrifices there.  And Bella's now totally okay and unaffected by drinking blood through a straw?  I'm sorry, but is this the same Bella that is super sensitive to blood and fainted in the Biology blood-typing class from just getting a whiff of blood?  Nope.  The whole chewing through the uterus.....that was gross.  And Jacob imprinting on Renesmee?  *sighs*  Wow.<br /><br />Just about all of the characters were out of character.  Especially Edward.  Asking Jacob to sleep with Bella so she could have a 'normal' baby was just wrong and totally not Edward.  And does anyone know what happened to Esme?  She was practically non-existent in the book.  Emmett was the only Cullen I enjoyed in the book and even he wasn't in it enough.<br /><br />The Volturi.  Stephenie did a great job building the suspense and had me on the edge of my seat.  And then, I was bored to tears by all the talking that happened between the two sides.<br /><br />Bella gets everything she wanted and doesn't have to give up anything or make much sacrifice (a baby, Charlie, Jacob).....which we were led to believe she would end up doing, and she is apparently super duper special and gets to completely skip the newborn vamp stage and save everyone.  ETA:  Even then Bella was not the one who did the saving.  It was Alice!!  What would have happened if Alice had not shown up with the other 'half-breed'.  *sighs*  We'll never know, because SM was afraid to go to battle.<br /><br />But, there were a few things I did enjoy.<br />First was Seth.  He was the most enjoyable character in the whole book.<br />I liked some of the miscellaneous vamps that came about.  But not many of them.<br /><br />Jacob.  Now....I've never liked Jacob.  But I found myself liking him a bit in this book.  But even then, the only thing I liked about Jacob in this book was when Jacob broke off from Sam's pack and took on his role as Alpha in his own little pack.  Best moment for Jacob in the whole series, IMO.<br /><br />And the best moment of the whole book, was when Bella finally was able to show Edward her thoughts.  Sadly, it came at the very very end and I wish there had been more because that was when the Edward that I grew to love showed up.  I actually teared up at that part and was without a doubt the best Bella/Edward moment in the book, only because that was the Bella/Edward that SM created.  Not the completely out of character Edward/Bella that existed through the whole book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the things I did enjoy were just not enough to make this book more enjoyable. Stephenie Meyer said she's a happy ending kind of gal.  She wasn't kidding.  But Bella getting everything was just too much of a happy ending and too much can ruin a story.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|Let me state upfront that I am a sucker for great non-fiction documentaries. I've always believed that life is stranger than fiction. And this is just the last (and perhaps best) example of it.<br /><br />\\"Man on Wire\\" (98 min.) tells the improbable story of Phillipe Petit's dream (and eventual reality) of walking on a high wire between the two WTC buildings on August 7, 1974. The movie starts with his humble beginngins of being a street artist, eventually leading to his wanting to do high wire walks, starting with the Paris Notre Dame, then the Sidney Harbor, and then eventually the World Trade Center Towers. The movie does an excellent job building the excitement into what it took to eventually pull off that implossible event. All of the main players of the event are interviewed now more than 30 years after the event, and Philippe Petit turns out to be a master entertainer and story teller. When you are watching it all unvolve, you can't but help be in awe of it all. Just exilerating, period.<br /><br />If this movie doesn't get serious consideration of being nominated for best documentary of 2008 at the Oscars, there is something terribly wrong with the entire system. This is one of the most enthralling movies I've seen this year, and I've seen a lot of movies.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|I listened to this the first time and admit (moronically so) I found it to marginally good at best. Well, then I listened to about a dozen more times and, like a heroin addict was hooked and can't hear it enough. The writing is incredibly wonderful, the arrangement nearly perfect, and the vocals of this woman come from - well, I don't know where they come from, but are distinctive, moving, and relateable (sic). They come from the heart and reek of experience. While they are mostly love songs, they are no where being sentimental drivel.  If you haven't heard this CD then you are sadly missing some of the most beautiful music on the planet. I love this CD. Go get it now...it is brilliant.  Oh, and her piano playing ability is, to me, pure genius.
B000JJ4PDK|4.0|Obviously this is a classic, so I don't need to tell you it's dope. As far as the remasters and new packaging, however: The volume increase is cool and everything, as far as making this sound better in my MP3 player, but the remixes and bonus content do nothing for this release except dilute it like Puff did with everything BIG left behind. Get this used though, and it's all forgivable.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Since I lost my VHS version of this film, I had missed the occasional nostalgic viewing. This DVD version brings it all back. It's as good as ever, and includes some new enhancement to the setting at Pompeii. Worth replacing your old version.
0061122416|4.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is a great story with many hidden gems.  Throughout the book Santiago is searching for his treasure, yet as I read this book the words within it can be all of our treasures.  In life, we all have strange little events that happen to us, \\"gut\\" feelings that lead us in a certain direction.  Those are the Omens.  If we just pay attention to the little things and understand what others are telling us, we too can \\"speak to the wind and the sun\\" - from a certain point of view.    The \\"Alchemist\\" is an interesting story that also has some insightful life lessons.  I would recommend this book.  I enjoyed it.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is the best series I have seen since the Sopranos or Sex in the City.  It only took one episode of Dexter to get me hooked.  I hope it does not get cancelled like most shows do right when I get interested in them.
B001CU1RUE|5.0|Good CD to buy. Remastering is great, the third disc is a nice addition. Everyone knows the songs, you may have them, but this is a very well mastered CD and if you have the older Elvis stuff from the 80's-90's this will be a jaw dropping improvement over the poorly mastered RCA days. Avoid all of them!    Good job Sony Music.
0066620996|5.0|This is one of the best books on business ever written.  Very easy to read and even easier to put into action.
031606792X|5.0|I really wasnt interested in these books when they came out but once I started the first I was unable to put them down this one was no exception... I loved it...light funny read but not on the stupid level.
031606792X|5.0|After reading earlier reviews of this novel, and having enjoyed the first  three entries in the series, I was frankly worried about investing in this fourth (but hopefully not final) book.  But I found it perfect in its rightness as the conclusion to the saga.  I do not understand the complaints.  This IS a fantasy for heavens sake, and I read fantasy novels to escape.  This is the perfect escape.  It could be a segue into a new series as well.  Great author!  I am now reading \\"The Host\\" and am finding it equally engrossing.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|I remember when they bring Cabaret to Broadway or the West End like they recycle musicals but to me, Cabaret with Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey are the epitome of perfection in the film. You don't mess with perfection or come close to it with these two brilliant performers on stage. Liza gave the role of a lifetime as Sally Bowles, a London singer, who they Americanize her in this film. Fine because it works and nobody sings or belts out the songs better than Liza does. In this film, it is dark Berlin where Nazism and anti-Semitism is on the rise since World War I has ended leaving Germany to pay for it and the onset of World War II. The chilling scenes of Nazism and the rise of it's evil power is done simply in the song, \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,\\" with the unsuspecting Germans not realizing about the true meaning of the song. Sally Bowles has led quite sad life despite her upbeat personality. I don't think Liza ever played a role as suitable or close to her personality as Sally Bowles. Liza is not just Judy's daughter but Liza Minnelli is her own person. She can make you cry and laugh with one breath and you want more. The ending is somewhat vague as if it presents what will come to Germany. I get shivers and chills down my spine when the music has ended and the film is done as if knowing what lies head isn't horrifying enough.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|the 3rd disc is really good.  the xmas story scaaary!   I love supernatural.
0312995423|1.0|I listened to this rather than read it but I can't imagine that the print version could be worse.  If anyone has abused themselves by listening and reading it I would question their ability to maintain membership in the human race.  I weep for the narrator, hopefully he collected hazard pay.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|Just because a film is filled to the brim with awesome action sequences does not excuse it from having an actual plot. Live Free or Die Hard, the 4th kinda sorta but not really sequel is all action and no plausable story line. Though far better than the 2nd sequel, it doesn't even begin to compare to the first movie, or even the surprisingly cool Die Hard With a Vengeance. Those had an actual plot that you can follow even though they were a tad on the far-fetched side.     For this movie, you pretty much have to suspend all belief and sort of go with the flow, if you like that kind of thing. There is nothing wrong with mindless violence in films; we see it all the time. But it's hard to enjoy a film if you are scratching your head over the ridiculous story line.     The one good thing about this film is Justin Long. He's a funny nerdy type of character and it completely works. Bruce Willis is laid back and fits into his role nicely, but it really is the same old thing over again. Also, the whole subplot with his daughter is pointless AND when exactly did he have a kid? No mention of it was ever made in the third one and she seems to be at least seventeen. It's been only thirteen years since the last one came out, and he wasn't that young back then. It just seemed sort of weird watching it.     Though the plot is ridiculous and confusing, it is also very predictable. There is nothing new or exciting; it really is the same old thing you've probably seen a million times over. I would definetely skip this one and check out D H 1& 3 instead.
0307276902|2.0|I had heard about (but not read) the Smoking Gun article before I read the book. I had also watched A Scanner Darkly (a movie based on a semi-biographical book by a former meth addict) the week before. Although I'm not a former drug addict or rehab patient, I've spent time with people who are, and the difference of the \\"feel of authenticity\\" between \\"Scanner\\" and \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is striking.     The book reads as though the author is trying to communicate immense emotion, but doesn't quite have the writing chops to pull it off. So instead, he substitutes lurid detail, and exaggerates so we'll get the point. The problem with this approach is that since the story doesn't fit the \\"mythological truth\\" of well-crafted fiction, nor the \\"logical pattern\\" of fact, an informed reader is constantly being interrupted by a nagging \\"that doesn't sound right\\" impulse. I got 80 pages into the book before deciding that I needed to look up the smoking gun article, which more or less says that James Frey made the whole thing up. I found this assertion to be the more believable. I'm not so terribly bothered by this (after all, he did get caught, and I find large-scale frauds that involve the media amusing) but I am bothered by the experience of reading.    It is rare that I'll give up on a book, and I was disappointed to have to give up on this one because I had been looking forward to it. I probably also had trouble with the writing style (although I'm generally pretty adaptable, I got through Riddley Walker all right). To be fair, it is not the worst book I ever read. But I found it intensely irritating and honestly cannot understand why people like it.
1932907009|5.0|Admittedly, when I walk into a book store I am somewhat overwhelmed by the screenwriting section. There are so many choices; it is difficult to know were to start. I was first attracted to the book because of the interesting (and appropriate) title. Not only is the book easy to read, but it is enjoyable to read as well. An instructional book that's fun to read: what a concept. Unlike Syd Field's books, and no disrespect to the man -  you at least have to recognize what he's done for the craft, Save the Cat feels conversational, like you're being talked to on your level, not down to from on high. Blake Snyder is relatable, and I found every chapter raised at least one point that I hadn't thought of. I spent a summer reading and re-reading this book to revise a screenplay, which is now near completion. It is everything you'd expect from a book on writing screenplays...only different.
B000001Y9I|3.0|Deep Purple was one of the greatest hard rock bands at one time and i became a pretty huge obssesive fan of theirs.  But once I heard the more recent Purple, Purpendicular-Rapture Of The Deep, it left a bad tatste in my mouth.  Bananas and Purpendicular we very highly praised and I had heard Bananas ranked with albums like Machine Head.  Well I went out and bought Bananas hearing all the hype and I couldn't belive people actualy worshiped that album.  it's bland but anyway see my review for that album.  For this review I'm talking about Purpendicular which at most is nothing but a guilty pleasure.  There are some really good songs on this one and dwonright embarrasing ones.  Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming, The Aviator and A Touch Away are all winners on this album but Vavoom: Ted The Mechanic is so bad that it makes Deep Purple look like a joke.  Not much else on the rest of this album.  It's pretty hit and miss.  The three songs are very good musicaly along with Losen My Strings which has good playing in it.  this album is worth checking out but don't get anything after this album.  You will be sorry you did.  Everything after this album is progressively worse and it proves that Deep Purple are now just washed up has beens.  This is probably the reason John Lord left.
0385340990|2.0|After all the hype, I expected a more unique book.  I remember reading novels like this in college (a long time ago!).  The format was not orginal and although it gave me more insight into the era, I was disappointed.  I guess I expected more but found Juliet and the other characters sterotyped.  I kept thinking I read different versions of this story before.

0930289234|4.0|I do believe that this is a modern day classic work.  It has been so long since I looked at anything like this.  I have read Dostoevsky, Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche and many others.  I cannot think why this work should be treated any differently.  It is a work which makes you think.  It also covers aspects of the graphic novel which can take you into the unreal or surreal.  My only worry is that when Hollywood does it, it will destroy it, as it so often does, and disappoints us all by doing 'The Hollywood Ending', and in the process, put many people off enjoying the original...this book.<br /><br />I came across this book on a BBC program.  I believe the program was by Armando Ianucci, who I respect and realise to be very intelligent.<br /><br />Anyway, I was intrigued enough by all the positives which were said in the program to seek Watchmen out.  I checked out my local bookshop, and thought it a tad pricy for what is essentially a collection of graphic novels, which I used to read in my formative years. As I am now in my three hundredth year, I set about checking online for a better price.<br /><br /> Now I am a Scotsman, though now living in Ireland.  I checked prices and decided to see if there would be any difference in price ordering from  the Dubya country as opposed to UK or Ireland.  I got a good deal from Amazon in US, though they said it was going to take three years to deliver.  I did not care.  I wanted it, and I got it... the next week, I think.<br /><br />I was getting filthy looks from my family, due to lack of communication as my head was stuck in my 'comic', as my wife informed me, and my regression into childhood, which she then qualified as a condition I had never actually moved on from... this childhood thing.<br /><br />The punchline, of course, is that I went into another shop the day after I finished Watchmen and saw it in the sale for a pound cheaper than I had paid for it.
B000002NJS|3.0|The \\"Mother Of Reinvention\\" reinvented herself noticeably for this album, but unfortunately, that's not entirely a good thing in this case. Not that it's completely worthless (the title track, the beautiful \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\" and \\"Little Star\\" are all nice offerings), but this overlong album is largely uncharacteristic for Madonna, lacking the all-out feelgoodness of her first 2 albums and the robust maturity of ones like \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Like A Prayer.\\" Her average singing ability is not at its best here, much of the album is bland both musically and lyrically, and it's filled with too many weird techno sounds that make it even more strange.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Great Movie! Best on Hi-Def 1080p  Blu-ray quality was no dissapointment,  watching Batman Begins feels like returning  to the big screen cinemas but only with better and sharper  video quality. Uncompressed audio came in too as a blessing in disguise.  Prologue to the \\"The Dark Knight\\" is definitely an added bonus feature  to view it first in High-Def before the sequel reaches on Blu-Ray too.  A must to be added in any collection.:)
B00005JLFC|5.0|My daughter and I saw Yentl together in 1983 in the theater when she was in the 7th grade.  We walked out of the theater, looked at each other, turned on our heals, went back in and watched it again.      The music is glorious and the story is timeless.  This is an intelligent movie. There is a unique quality to the way the film was made by which it seems there is more story telling through the music than the dialogue.  It's a lovely way to absorb the story, with your gut rather than your cerebellum.    I watched it again about a month ago, and the strains of the \\"klesmer\\" music had me in tears.  Minors, 7ths, flats -- flat minor 7ths!  Heart wrenching, transcendent, other worldly.

The only people who like these talentless Nancy-boys are popular is because of the 10 year old girls who think \\"OMG Nick Jonas iz oooooo soooo sexii!!!! LAWRL!!!!!!!!!!\\". Ugh. I have to deal with those girls every day at my school. These guys can't even sing, they always force and strain their voices to the point where it's unbearable. Guitar work is simple and uninspired it can't be considered guitar work. Drums are pretty good, nothing special. Lyrics are dumb, they're all the same. Oh, and not to mention, I saw them on So You Think You Can Dance and they were AWFUL. They were struggling to hit the notes and those notes weren't even that high. Hell, even K-Fed is more talented. Could you imagine if any Jo-Bros songs had ended up on the \\"greatest songs of all time\\" chart...? I think I'll shut up and go listen to some Iron Maiden now, \\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\" is a song I can listen to for hours on end...

0307386171|5.0|Ian McEwan is the only contemporary fiction writer today with the talent and the craft to transform what in lesser hands might pass for a rather slight novella into a tremulous, gorgeously detailed work of art. \\"On Chesil Beach\\" may be less ambitious in its scope than McEwan's earlier masterpieces such as \\"Atonement\\" but it is no less satisfying for the effect it strives to achieve. McEwan isn't a writer who grows on you. His writing strictly eschews sentiment, so the reader expecting to be moved should look elsewhere. His words - razor sharp, cold and brutal - either hit you like an ice pick on the forehead or leave you with an unpleasant aftertaste.     It is also his favorite thing to use copious amounts of page space to display in slow motion every flicker of thought or emotion running through the minds of his characters. In \\"Saturday\\", the opening night scene of the protagonist observing the descent of an airplane from his bedroom takes up more pages than one would imagine. We get plenty of that kind of thing here.    Ironically perhaps, the thwarted lives of Edward and Florence must seem the saddest story ever told. Born into an age when sex expects to follow love in marriage like hand in glove, the quiet desperation consuming the couple as they head for the bridal chambers on their wedding night, each not knowing what to do, yet willing himself/herself to do the right thing by the other, becomes the subject of this deceptively slight novella. McEwan is in his usual commanding form, wielding his arsenal of killer sharp precision words to devastating effect to achieve just the right nuances. He reveals a comic side in an unexpected scene when Edward deliberately conjures up Joseph Stalin's face in his mind's eye to avoid his first calamity. An unbelievable sleight of hand !  As the narrative lurches fatefully towards its inevitable conclusion, McEwan uses flashback to plug the gap in the couple's back story for us to make sense of their present dilemma.      The wasted lives of Edward and Florence seem a needless cruelty today. McEwan, writing at the top of his game, succeeds in evoking pathos and sadness without the usual mawkishness that accompanies such sentiment. A brilliant book. Most definitely, my choice for the Booker last year !
B0000028M7|5.0|Amazing album!   AIC was so under rated in their prime. Their sound is unique and amazing..  This album rocks!
B000ZN802W|1.0|The main character is totally unlikable because he is so judgmental and cruel to others. Going out on his own is not enough, he needs to hurt and condemn others as he does so. The movie tries to make us feel sorry for him because he is the result of the world he was brought up in. Didn't work for me! He is as much a creator of that world as the result of it. To quote a John Hiatt song \\"You only see the world you make.\\" Finally, as portrayed in the movie, his escapades before he arrives in Alaska are unbelievable; \\"Hancock\\" made a better super-hero. I am going to go read the book to see what really happened.

Buy Continuum, a first rate loving tribute to fans who are fully familiar with the series.

B00140PK6O|5.0|First, I'll admit that I'm a sucker for all things English.  I watched this five-hour production on PBS stretched out over three weeks, and I knew this was a story I would want to see again so purchased the DVD.  The financial disasters, personal disasters, and changing times give a picture of village life in 19th century England. Villagers are busy with gossip, mistrust the new \\"modern\\" doctor's methods, and know their village willl not be the same if the railroad comes.  The costumes are great, and Dame Judi Dench never disappoints.
031606792X|3.0|Stephenie Meyer's [[ASIN:031606792X Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4)]] is the last book in the Twilight series and is a jam packed book of 750 pages. Edward and Bella are some of the best characters I have come across in a vampire series in some time, and Jacob just rounds out the group. The supporting characters in the series are varied and just as captivating. Breaking Dawn begins where book 3, Eclipse, left off. This is not my favorite of the novels, and if you are a Twilight fan you will read it regardless of my review, but if you are looking for pure escapism and a good, though outrageous story, this book is for you. I still think a good 200-300 pages could have been pared out of this novel and sections reworked to make them tighter and more evolutionary in terms of character development.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />We resume Bella and Edward's story with the wedding. They are getting married; she has begrudgingly agreed to it. There is not a whole lot of description of her dress or much of the preparations other than to say that Alice has gone all out. Since Book 1 in Breaking Dawn is from Bella's point of view, it should not surprise readers that the descriptions of her dress and other things are sparse. Bella is not a frilly type of girl. On their honeymoon, they make love like married couples, regardless of their age or agelessness. While I expected everything up until this point, I was not expecting these characters I love to be as static or flat as they were throughout this section of the book. The plot plodded along and the characters went through the motions, but there was little tension, passion, and feeling between these two.<br /><br />The first twist in the book was predictable from my stand point because it was foreshadowed early enough on in the book with seemingly misplaced stories about immortal children. Bella and Edward conceive a child, but no ordinary child--she is half human, half vampire. This is nothing new. I have read the genre for some time, and this is a \\"legend\\" that has been worked into a number of novels, though many writers prefer to think of vampires as unable to sire children with or without human lovers.<br /><br />Renesmee, their daughter, was predictable in her need for blood. I surmised this early on in Bella's ordeal carrying this child. The child's name is elementary and sappy according to many Internet blogs I have read thus far, but I can tell you that it fits perfectly with Bella's character, though I'm surprised that Edward did not chime in with his opinion on the matter. The immovable force that is Edward is largely absent from this novel, which made it disconcerting and diminished the evolution of this book. A lot of this first section of the book could have been condensed into a tighter package, and the characters of Bella and Edward should have retained some of their tension and passion-play from the previous books, even though they are now man and wife.<br /><br />The ordeal with carrying the baby to term should have been wrought with greater conflict between the newlyweds than it was. Most of the time Edward was passively sitting beside his wife, helpless. While this shows his inability to solve all of Bella's problems and to always protect her, it was a bit too much of a character shift. It should have evolved; we should have felt his resolve slip away as he grew more resigned to Bella's fate and her decision.<br /><br />I liked the interactions between Rosalie and Bella--that was a twist I had not expected. I did not expect Bella to turn to Rosalie in this respect or if she did, I did not expect their bond to be so steadfast and hardy. What a great addition and new dynamic to the expanding Cullen network.<br /><br />Book 2, which is from Jacob's point of view, threw me for a loop because I was expecting a section from Edward, the father of Renesmee. Instead, Meyer brings us back to our good friend Jacob and his feelings after his \\"alone\\" time in thewilderness. His point of view is lively and more on track with the character development Jacob experienced in the first three novels. This section had me riveted more so than the first part of the book. Yes, Jacob still loves Bella in the most passionate and unrequited way, but you can't turn those feelings off, especially if you are a teenager and have raging hormones. Those expecting Jacob to just shut those feelings off is deluding themselves. Just because the \\"love of your life\\" marries someone else, does not meant that you can forget about them or turn off your feelings.<br /><br />The best part of this section of the book is the debate about free will and the collective mind. . .which is better to have for battle and living one's life? The battle for free will is strong throughout the series, particularly with Jacob and the shapeshifters. Jacob believes in free will, which is why he can no more order Seth and Leah back to La Push than order himself to forget Bella. However, while he admires and supports the ideal of free will, he is still bound by his nature. He must imprint and to imprint upon Renesmee was inevitable because Bella always thought of him as family regardless of her love for Edward. Jacob finds imprinting on young children disturbing, but now he is forced into a similar situation as Quil. This dichotomy is fantastically played out in the La Push community and particularly among Jacob and several other shapeshifers. In terms of the best written sections of the book, those can be found in Jacob's point of view.<br /><br />Book Three, which is from Bella's point of view, is all over the place, and Meyer had a ton of ground to cover. Bella was expected at the Volturi when she was finally transformed into a vampire, but a vision appears that suggests that that visit may be unnecessary since Irina spied Renesmee and assumed she was one of the forbidden immortal children. This sets up a whirlwind of events in which Alice and Jaspar vanish for parts unknown and the rest of the family rounds up as many vampire friends as possible to witness the growth and maturity of Renesmee to prove to the Volturi that she is not an immortal child, but a half-breed.<br /><br />While there are many things in this section that I found far-fetched even for a fantasy novel, like Bella's ability to stave off hunger and behave contrary to all other newborn vampires, I did enjoy Bella's struggles with her mind shield and her bravery in trying to save all of those she loved. I think the struggles before and after the Volturi arrived would have been more poignant if she had collapsed or expressed some deep thirst for blood.<br /><br />Finally, the build up of suspense while Bella and Edward and their friends waited for the Volturi was fantastic, though the descriptions and intimate details of all the friends and their pasts may not have been necessary. However, for a breach of vampiric law this substantial, bloodshed of some kind should have been called for, at least for Irina's death. She was part of the Cullen family or so the Denali clan claims. The discussion and minor battles between Bella's mind shield and Jane and Alec were not enough to satisfy the tension that had built up over the last month in the Cullen household.<br /><br />***End Spoiler***<br /><br />Happily ever after was an inevitability between these characters, and as a writer, I can understand wanting to satisfy the expectations of as many readers as possible, which is a difficult if not impossible task. I commend Meyer for trying to pack so much into the novel, and I think that the path she choose for them was appropriate. Bella is much more likable as a vampire, though she is still sometimes utterly ridiculous in her actions. I can see how she never really fit in as a human and was a perfect fit for the vampire family. Edward remains the same as he was in the other books, though more lustful. However, his endearing remarks to Jacob were a bit premature for me. Jacob's development throughout the series is nearly complete, but he has further to go. If there were to be another book in this series, it should be about his evolution and his role in Renesmee's life.<br /><br />Finally, I wonder what the cover has to do with the title, Breaking Dawn (which I assume relates to the breaking dawn of their new future together as a family), and the book itself. The white queen could be Renesmee or it could be Bella, but who is the blood red pawn? Is the pawn Edward or is the pawn Renesmee.

1400082773|5.0|This book has been written with great literary flair.  Every place in which Barack Obama has lived or which he has visited is described with the skill of a great travel-writer; every person, every social setting is graphically and memorably brought to life. His independently-minded maternal grandparents, white folk who had themselves eloped against the wishes of the grandmother's father, had no theory about racial equality but simply assumed it and were shocked when their surroundings did not. Apart from the fact that the grandfather had itchy feet, that may have been one of the reasons why they left Texas and moved to Hawaii, which was more racially tolerant than mainland America.  When their daughter married Barack senior, a black Kenyan whom she had met at the University of Hawaii, they accepted him.  It was a brief marriage: he left his wife and his brown-skinned two-year-old son, Barack junior, to study in America, and never returned to live with them.  Two years later she married an Indonesian (another superb pen-portrait), and when Barack was six years old, they all went off to live in a village on the edge of Djakarta.  Barack learnt a lot from his step-father and from life in Indonesia under a savage right-wing dictatorship.  He also learnt much from his mother, who counteracted the step-father's fatalistic acceptance of the situation in Indonesia by constantly setting before her son the struggles of the American liberals in the 1960s and 1970s.  Her second marriage, too, would end in divorce.  She sent Barack back to Hawaii when he was ten, to be educated at a good American school there.<br /><br />Even in Hawaii where there was more racial mixing than anywhere else in the United States, there were many incidents which taught the adolescent Barack that he was a black person in essentially a white man's world, and there was one incident in which he found that even his beloved grandmother was afraid of a black beggar when she would not have been of a white one.  It was a shattering discovery for a youngster whose mother and grandparents were white: to which world did he really belong?  He was still confused and angry at college in Los Angeles; and then he realized that he was going in for self-dramatization (and, to some extent, I feel he had not fully overcome it in this book).  There was no need for him to be trapped in that kind of drama - some of his more mature black fellow-students taught him that.  His  identity was surely something more than was defined above all by his race.<br /><br />But that was easier said than found, or perhaps even really wanted at that time.  He wanted to identify himself with a community, and initially this was a black community.  So in 1983, at the age of 22,  he joined a community organization in Chicago, and the second part of the book is about his time there.  Things had started looking up for black people in that city.  They were immensely proud of the election of the first black mayor, Harold Washington; anti-discrimination laws in the public sector had enabled some blacks to move to the more prosperous areas of the city (only to find that the whites were moving out); but in run-down districts like Altgeld there was still a huge pool of hopelessness.  Some alienated youngsters had created their own gun-culture, and it was uphill and disheartening work for Barack and the community leaders to get people to come together to do something to help themselves, and also to pressure the authorities.  After a year's hard work there were some small successes to celebrate (each movingly narrated), and each bringing in new participants, and also set-backs - which lost some of them again.<br /><br />For some of Barack's colleagues, total rejection of white society was the only way in which black `self-respect' could express itself.  Barack understood the psychological  need for this;  but - not only because of his own background - felt that self-respect cannot be based simply on what was essentially a generalized hatred for and separation from a society in which blacks were enmeshed with whites in a thousand practical and inescapable ways.<br /><br />After three years as a Community Organizer, Barack thought he could be of more use to the black community if he took time off to train as a lawyer.  He won a place at the Harvard Law School;  but before he took it up, he paid his first visit to Kenya in 1987; and the account of that visit takes up the third part of this book.  In America he had already met a half-sister with whom he established an instant rapport (a most touching account, that), and now he met the rest of his very extended and complicated family (Barack Senior had fathered eight children from four different women), with all their rivalries and resentments, but also with their warmth.  From the third wife of his grandfather he learnt the whole story of his Kenyan family. If he had visited Kenya in search of roots, his perplexities and self-questioning did not diminish - but that aspect is not the only one in this vivid account of his visit to the country.<br /><br />The book is a reflection of a sensitive and thoughtful man of mixed race in America.  In 1995, when it was first published and Barack Obama was 33 years old, he still seemed very uncertain of who he was, was focussed on the problems of the black community in the United States and then on his Kenyan heritage.  Today he seems very confident and sure of his identity, campaigning for the Presidency on a programme that transcends any question of race.

031606792X|1.0|Almost from the beginning of Breaking Dawn, it was apparent that it would be nothing like the preceding three novels.  I kept hoping some of the tone of the first three books would come back after the gruesome and disturbing pregnancy/birth sequence.  As I heard elsewhere, the only part of this book at all like the rest was the narration from Jacob's perspective.  Jacob remained essentially the same, except for his all too convenient plot line.  I could not get past how radically different everyone and everything about this book was from the others.  The first three books told the story from an almost sweet perspective despite what the stories were about.  The protagonists were all likable, respectable people.  In Breaking Dawn, all of them were turned into hardly likable characters.  Are we really supposed to believe that Bella's father just quietly decided to accept all that he was asked to accept?  It seems that Breaking Dawn went off in a direction it was not originally intended to go in.  If this is not true, than a story was told with no clear way to end it.  Breaking Dawn seems to have been an attempt to make a happy ending with all the complicated elements of this series too easily resolved, except for Bella's mother which remained, smartly, unresolved because expecting us to believe she would be okay with Bellas's fate would have been asking way too much of us.

B000VSBX34|5.0|I may have been born in the 80s, but I was still fell in love with the Beatles (and John Lennon) long before my teenage years.  I think a Hard Days Night was their best film, and was just pure genius on how Dick Lester made it.    This one I felt never had the tightness the other film had but it was still good and fun to watch.  I am giving it 5 stars not for just the movie, but the package and the remastering.  The video is clear as day, color is perfect, the extras are very nice, and the movie isn't bad either.  So throw away your tape versions of this film and get this one.  Any Beatle fan should own it (but make sure you get Hard Days Night and Yellow Submarine on DVD as well, for they are both worth it too).
B0012RM4NG|5.0|I've been meaning to buy this album for a while just because of the first track, Burning Times.  It was too expensive until this re-release showed up.<br /><br />First, Burning Times and Melancholy (Holy Martyr) are two of the best songs I've ever heard.  They're up there with Master of Puppets by Metallica, The Sentinel by Judas Priest, and Hallowed Be Thy Name by Iron Maiden (in my book).  The whole album is very good, though.  It lags a bit in the middle, but it finished incredibly strong with The Prophesy, Birth of the Wicked and The Coming Curse.<br /><br />This version also features some good covers of Judas Priest's The Ripper and Black Sabbath's Electric Funeral.  The packaging is basically just like a vinyl album package.  It's a folding cardboard sleeve with two pockets-one for a booklet and another for the disk (which is in another smaller sleeve).  The disk is a black-surface CD that looks like a tiny vinyl album.<br /><br />Oh, my XBOX 360 doesn't recognize the disk, but my computer can read it just fine.  Normal CD players shouldn't have any issue.  I think that the black reflective surface is the reason...

B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein's debut album doesn't dissapoint. I listened to most of the tracks long before I got the album itself. To say that this is Rammstein at its rawest and simplest isn't really an understatement. Eventually, the band started to develop a more melodic and slower style, decreasing with each album until Reise Reise. I am keen to the slower songs, like Seemann, Klavier and Nebel. I started with Mutter, and it took me long to buy another album from the band... basically because the band was kind of typecasted with Du Hast when The Matrix was released and you basically heard it every week for two years.    My personal favorites from this album are Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen?, Der Meister and Du Riechst So Gut. It's great to hear a band that's good from the very beggining.
0345477618|5.0|When I first saw Star Wars I was very young.  At first I had a strong desire to know how all the cool things on the screen were accomplished.  Over the years bits and pieces appeared in magazines and books, but nothing really felt complete.  As I grew older I became interested in the ideas behind the movie, where they came from, how did they change over time, what was the history.  Now, I've grown interested in the stories of the people who worked behind the scenes.  What is their history, what did they bring to the production?  Now here it is, all in one book, with a lot of behind the scenes photos and stories.  It uses interviews from the time of the film's making, so it isn't colored by the amazing success of the movie.  It's a quick read, too.  The pages are full of photos (most I've never seen before), though the font size is a little small.  It's a high quality book and should last a long time, which is good, because I think I'll be reading this one again and again.

B00104QSOM|2.0|Slow and not much blood, not that there's anything wrong with that.  Only that if you're weighing whether to sit through 2 and a half hours of a movie, you'd prefer to go in with no illusions.  This movie is an allegorical story that in both its substance and form deconstructs the illusions we live by.  The plot is slow and misshapen, punctuated by sparse moments of triumph and terror and manipulations and murders, and fragile loves across the void.  The cardboard, threadbare quality to the characters is undoubtedly part of the allegory.  The driven, ruthless man without illusions would seem to have the advantage, but for what?  A great question that humanity wrestles with.  This film contributes no insight about that, however.  It will be remembered only for the iconic line in the final scene, a line that itself is out of place.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis shines.

B0000AKCLS|4.0|More outstanding blues rock from one of this country's top young blues guitar slingers Joe Bonamassa.  On this, his 3rd album, Joe does an album of mostly covers.  Bonamassa breathes fresh new life into tracks originally performed by blues masters like Albert King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, Elmore James, Albert Collins, Robert Johnson and others.  He also throws in a few original tracks as well.  This is a very good blues album in many ways.  Bonamassa covers all kinds of guitar styles here on electric, acoustic and slide.  His interpretations of blues classics pay homage to the original versions, but Joe is able to put his own stamp on all of them.  His cover of John Lee Hooker's \\"Burning Hell\\" is especially effective.    Bonamassa continues to be one of the great young new blues talents on the circuit today and this is another very good album.

B000RW3VD4|4.0|Brilliant time capsule of the 1980s and Wall Street hustlers in particular, anchored by a riveting performance by Michael Douglas as slash and burn big shot Gordon Gekko. Like Platoon the script is filled with over-the-top dialogue - \\"Who am I?\\" says Bud Fox (Gekko's protege played by Charlie Sheen) at one point. Nevertheless Stone captures the excess and furious pace of the period.<br />Aside from the film, what makes the 20th Anniversary Edition really worth the price of admission is the \\"extras\\":<br />- A deeply revealing and frank director's commentary from Stone following on from the excellent ones he has done for Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July.<br />- Two documentaries on the making of the film.<br />- Deleted scenes including optional commentary from Stone.
1577314808|5.0|I will say that sometimes this book is a difficult read, but I do like Eckhart Tolle.  I have read \\"Stillness\\", and a third of \\"The Power of Now\\".  I've read enough of the latter book to come up with certain conclusions.  Tolle derives his ideas from the New Testament, Krishnamurti, and a lot from Zen.  Of course, Zen traces its thinking to Hinduism and Vedantic thought.  Tolle's thinking is mostly Zen and touches onto the yogic concept that all people are connected through their thoughts and is for a sort of Cosmic union, one person at a time i.e. we need to be each other's salvation.  I do agree with him that many people have misinterpreted Jesus (Yeshua) who grew up in Roman Palestine which had a lot of Hellenic philosophical influence which was also influenced by the East.  Some have said that Tolle is Buddhism repackaged, but these people who are being indignant are not realizing that Buddhism in a sense is Hinduism or Vedanta repackaged, one could allege.  Unlike mainstream Buddhism, Eckhart's writings are rather theistic.  I am not sure what to think of Eckhart being labeled enlightened.  I supposed that's done to have people read his works.<br />That's the only thing that sort of bothers me.  I don't necessarily agree with all of his Biblical interpretations, but a lot of it makes sense.<br />Your mainstream Christian, Jew, or Muslim won't agree with much of Eckhart's thinking.  All the religions connect in some way.  Christians in Egypt used a rosary to venerate Mary.  They used the same name Hindus use for their rosary which is a mala.  Religions changed to be adapted to different locales, but they are all connected in a way.  We all have one consciousness, but we get all trapped in the forms.
0525950079|4.0|A two hundred year later sequel to Pillars of the Earth.  Entertaining and adventuresome but the Sisyphus approach he uses gets to be a bit predictable--one of the various protagonists ALMOST prevails and then gets knocked down.

If you enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, you'll enjoy this one, too.

I purchased it the other day because I was getting sick of missing 1 or 2 out of 5 pictures in quick-sequence shots (bouquet-tossing, cake cutting, etc).     After just one shoot, I have completely fallen in love with it. I was able to fire off sequences without missing anything, it recycles my flash supremely quickly and I only wish I'd bought it sooner. I will actually be getting rid of my 430ex backup flash so that I have two flashes that are compatible with this.
B000PR9V8U|4.0|This book gives a very accurate picture of the communication issues in relationships. It also has good, implementable suggestions to improve things. However, I managed to read this through the end, for one reason only - the accuracy of the content. I think it could have been better written, to make it a more interesting reading. All the same, this is highly recommended, since it gives you good insights into the key aspect  of any successful relationship - communication.
B000002L5I|5.0|For years I wanted to get this cd for the song \\"Blue on Black\\". After finally getting it I find out it's a great rockin album from start to finish. I wish I bought it years ago. It even drove me to go see Kenny in a live show and it was one of the best concerts I have ever seen and I have to been to quite a few in my day. It doesn't get better than this.

B001ACY8D2|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time is Sigur Ros' Agaetis Byrjun, so naturally I pick up their other albums as they come out.  Takk was good as was ( ) but I'm really enjoying this new 5th album which according to the Sigur Ros website translates as \\"with a buzz in our ears we play endlessly.\\"  The first song, \\"Gobbledigook\\" is quickly becoming another favorite, bouncing from one speaker to another. The second song, \\"Inni mer syngur vitlajsingur\\" is an awesome anthem, but the title which in English translates as \\"Within me a lunatic sings\\" just makes me laugh. The song fills me with joy too. \\"Festival\\" starts out slowly, but then powers into another classic Sigur Ros song.  \\"Godan daginn\\" is sweet and soft, almost like a lullaby and I hope no one ever watches me listen to \\"Vid spilum endalaust\\" because I'm just bouncing around in my chair. lol It's a true pop song.  Their music isn't like any other bands I know of.  The clear, high vocals by Jonsi Birgisson are sung in either Icelandic or \\"Hopelandic\\", a made up language that he uses to first fill in songs without lyrics. For the first time, one song on the album is sung in English. The album is fun and cheerful and full of life.  I have to admit, I was first taken aback by the naked bottoms on the album cover, as well as on the video of Gobbledigook with everyone running through the countryside naked.  It's not sexy, it's just sans clothing. :)  Listening to Sigur Ros taught me to listen to music differently.  I don't know the lyrics and can't begin to know what some of the songs mean, (witness my totally favorite song Flugufrelsarinn which I just found out is sort of about saving a fly in a river!) but I love the beautiful sound of Jonsi's voice and the gorgeous and overlayed background instruments, the uncommon use of playing an electric guitar with a cello bow, the symphony and boys choir in the background of \\"Ara Batur\\".  It's a lovely album and I can't recommend their music highly enough.
B0019X3YXM|4.0|I have never seen the Korean movie to compare the 2, but I thought this version was wonderful. Albeit a tad slow in the beginning, it picks up right after that. Elisha Cuthbert is wonderful in this, the star of the movie. I was never a huge fan of hers until watching her in this, she shines. The story is powerful and well acted. I thought that this movie had a bit of everything... can make you laugh, make you sad and make you happy. I would definitely recommend seeing it. I am very happy to have it as part of my movie collection.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars, season 1 absolutely rocks!! I love it how her and Logan get together even though from the start you wouldn't be able to picture it!! Sucks how they leave you with a cliff hanger for the final episode but you can kind of guess who it is-Logan-I think. Now all I have to do is wait for Amazon to finally deliver seasons 2 & 3 and I'll be set-wont see me for a week...  CD  Australia
0571202284|5.0|This a must-purchase for the starting animator.  I read The Illusion of Life first, which was a lot of words and theory but fewer walk-throughs (though you should buy that, too!).  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
031606792X|5.0|I have read the entire Twilight saga.  So have the other two girls in my office.  Two of us think this was the best book of the saga while the other one liked Eclipse better.  I still go back and reread sections of this book.
B00000DRW0|5.0|This page is supposed to be devoted solely to the sale of the now-deleted 1990 \\"Raw Power\\" CD. If you are looking for Iggy's mix (from 1997) and not Bowie's original mix (on the 1990 CD), tread carefully among the sellers' offerings on this page.
B000A88FAO|4.0|The beauty of this disk lies in the warmth and clarity that is provided by the format. It almost sounds like Vinyl, well almost.     My only complaint would be that at times I swear the tape speeds up and slows down. But this is only evident during 1 song.
B0017HPHBM|5.0|A truly great movie! It has everything! Suspense, drama, action and a good story line.  This version of the Batman certainly resurrected the franchise from the doldrums.  The DVD is excellent with a lot of extras.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I won't talk at any length about the motion picture itself since so many others have done such a good job of that already. This will be a more  personal review and one that I hope will give you a different perspective of the film's value as a piece of Sci-Fi Movie History.<br /><br />Do I recommend you buy a copy of Forbidden Planet. Unequivocally.. yes, buy it and not so much as an icon of Sci-Fi movie making. I'll simply encourage you to buy this DVD for it's significance as one of the first truly mature and sensible science fiction movies ever produced. It's influence on the gene from the 1950's right up to the present is well documented. Buy this DVD for the rich experience it will give you of a Sci-Fi picture done right!<br /><br />Here is my personal story. I was two years old when this motion picture was first released so my introduction to it came first via B/W television broadcast, the color TV, and then later as VHS and DVD. Along the way I was also exposed to less well made Sci-Fi fare and even then this picture stood out as a favorite of mine. Thomas Frazier (Garfield Goose and Family Classics on WGN) would introduce this picture and I would turn out every light in the house and turn up the volume.<br /><br />As a young boy of 12 years old, watching this highly intelligent, yet very accessible drama I was terrified as perhaps many of you were by the Id, enthralled by the Krell. The story gave me a much better appreciation of the role 'science' could play in telling a story of human dimension and scope. While the obligatory and obvious monochromatic (racial and ethnic) stereotypes typical of the age are now glaringly apparent, the time honored human themes of lust for power, ambition, greed, and jealousy are woven into this film with great skill.<br /><br />Yes, my first crush was of course on the blond and so very alluring Anne Francis. What young man hoping to one day travel the cosmos wouldn't dream to find out there an intelligent, sexy, and beautiful(but not so innocent) maid simply waiting to be taken away from her domineering and overbearng parent. It was not embarrassing to admit that when Anne Francis (who is by the way a very accomplished actress) played her role as Honey West on TV, I was much older and well on my way to seeing more of what the character Jerry (Nielsen's second in command) was after.<br /><br />There are few movies I recommend as highly as \\"Forbidden Planet\\" when asked for a Sci-Fi rental pick. The three man crew concept born in this film (Capitan, Doctor, and First Officer) is immediately recognized by  every Star Trek fan on the planet. The character blend and dynamics are a bit different in this film, but this formula put a focus and a thread of action to this drama that was a break-through at the time. And don't forget the portable communication devices... the early 'phasers'.. the 'transporters' .. and the idea of FTL (faster-than-light) travel.. When you watch Forbidden Planet today, it's all to easy to forget these concepts were totally new to movie audiences of the 1950's.<br /><br />Also, to any budding radio and electronics's buff of the early 60's Robby was an absolute delight. It wasn't until I had read Issac Asimov's \\"I Robot\\" that I stopped seeing Roby as the apex of human engineering marvels. When I first learned programming on an IBM 360, I affectionately called the CPU 'Roby II'.<br /><br />If you buy this DVD and simply watch it, in time many of your own delights at it's drama and action will become part of your own rich set of motion picture memories. It's worth very penny of the price.<br /><br />P.S.  Since The Day The Earth Stood Still is coming out soon, I know they are destined to release a remake of this picture, so here is my vote for the new actors and their character roles:<br /><br />Altair --  Jessica Alba/Grace Park/Beyonce<br />Dr. Morbius --  Morgan Freeman<br />Captain Adams -- Jeffery Donnavan<br />Doc  --  ? (but preferably a woman)<br />Jerry Farmer ---- Benjamin Bratt
0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris presents his rationale that the world faces an equally dangerous yet wholly unexpected vulnerability from religious moderates as it does from extremists.  Harris asserts that moderate beliefs cause the masses to refrain from attacking fundamentally flawed religious beliefs based on the notion that certain values are perceived as too sacred to question.  If you are an atheist looking to bolster your views, an agnostic wishing to amplify your curiosity, or a member of any religion looking to strengthen your convictions, Sam Harris will deliver as his book is filled with provocative questions and thoughts worthy of our times.<br /><br />Harris has a resounding ideal that becomes apparent very quickly in his book.  \\"There is no reason that our ability to sustain ourselves emotionally and spiritually cannot evolve with technology, politics, and the rest of culture.  Indeed, it must evolve if we are to have any future.\\"  It is evident that Harris' mission is not to disrupt the beliefs of the religious sector, but to instill in the public an inquisitive nature about events that at the very least opens the issue of religion up for discussion among all other topics.<br /><br />The foundation of Harris' view stems from his belief that people generally assess situations in all realms of life based on logic and rationality, excluding religion.  \\"Tell a devout Christian that his wife is cheating on him...and he is likely to require as much evidence as anyone else, and to be persuaded only to the extent that you give it.  Tell him that the book he keeps by his bed was written by an invisible deity who will punish him with fire for eternity if he fails to accept its every incredible claim about the universe, and he seems to require no evidence whatsoever.\\"  The result of this stance ends up producing a defense and justification for an avoidance of a meticulous examination essential for truly understanding fundamental motivations.  If we are unwilling to even ponder such a line of reasoning, how can we expect to successfully find fault among common terrorists actively hiding behind the same line of logical reasoning? Assertions like these will resonate with some, and will strengthen the religious views of others; but all intelligent people will agree that there is merit in considering such thoughts because if our beliefs cannot withstand simple logical questioning, than what does this reveal of our beliefs?<br /><br />Where Harris might emit some weakness is in his view that the entire impetus behind Islamic terrorism is the loose quality of Koran.  This clearly overlooks the far greater population of Muslims that do not share terrorist ambitions despite devoutly following the same text.  Thus Harris may have been better served looking at all influencing factors (such as poverty, social influence, group identity, etc) instead of assuming religion must represent the only incentive.<br /><br />The End of Faith is not to be taken lightly, as even detractors of Harris' work will require significant time to sincerely analyze the vast scope of reasoning offered.  If you are seeking a thought provoking outlook on world events and religious attitudes and have the strength of conviction to handle an undeviating line of reasoning, you will find this book invigorating.soning, how can we expect to successfully find fault among common terrorists actively hiding behind the same line of logical reasoning?

0312382464|5.0|The first book I read by Sharon Kay Penman was While Christ and His Saints Slept.  I've been hooked ever since.  I've enjoyed every book of hers I've read and this is no different.  Great author.

B00127RAJY|5.0|First for some background:  I have asthma, I'm 28 years old and I've had two kids... My usually workout regime consists of primarily yoga, pilates, core work plus a little variety (ie. Whatever I happen to be in the mood for).  I've been doing everything from strength training to kickboxing and have been working out regularly for 9 years.  My achilles heel (largely due to asthma) is my stamina and endurance.  When I started this workout I couldn't run a block without having to take my inhaler.  Going up and down the stairs used to wind me... especially when lugging laundry baskets up and down.  I've done level one 7 times now and I'm probably going to be stuck on level one for quite awhile, but already I've been noticing impressive results.  I am better able to keep up with my kids and now I only have trouble going up and down the stairs if I've just done this workout (Leg muscles get fatigued and shaky).  Be forewarned: if you're anything like me your going to want a LOT of water after this one and you're going to need to sit down and take it easy for awhile afterwards. This workout is HARD, but definitely worth it! From my experience so far, this workout is a great way to get your cardio in.  I have a hate/hate-more relationship with cardio.  Usually I have to ease into cardio and workout up to what a normal person can do minus asthma.  The layout of this workout works great for me because it works cardio in in short bursts but it manages to keep your heart rate up the entire time.  I found it was extremely challenging but not impossible like most cardio sessions I've tried.  The workout starts with a short but effective warm-up, then 3 circuits of  3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, and 1 minute of AB work plus a cool down at the very end.  I love this system!  This is cardio that works for me.  It's super effective and efficient... every muscle group gets worked in 20 minutes plus a bit if you count the intro, warm-up and cool-down.  Great for the chronically time crunched such as myself.  I probably would not recommend this workout for a beginner, but for anyone who has been working out for awhile and they find they are stuck in a rut... or perhaps they have that last bit of baby fat on their abs that just wont seem to budge... you should definitely take a second look at 30 day shred.  If you have determination enough to stick to it, this is the workout that is going to get you results!ly time crunched such as myself.

0689849109|5.0|My nine-year-old girl loves this book and I've enjoyed reading it with her.  We all know people like those described in the book that are over-critical, grumpy about everthing, never satisfied or loners.  Pollyanna applies her charm and glad-game to each of them and melts even the iciest personality.  The vocabulary of older writing appropriately challanges a young reader.  Short chapters make for easy stopping places when it's time for lights out.
0670020745|1.0|I thought this would be an interesting book along the lines of Oliver Sacks' works but with the addition of a personal point of view.  Unfortunately I found it to be both overly simplistic in the descriptions of how the brain works and those descriptions seemed unnecessarily prolonged.  Very little of the author's voice comes through the narrative making the most intriguing aspect of the book relatively \\"meh\\".

B0006ZE7G2|4.0|Of all the efforts put in bt Pink Floyd, this is the one essential Roger Waters compilation.  This product is a journey into madness.  It's about the alienation he feels between the band and the fans.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Dark, painful, angry music here. And lyrics that match the mood, attached to the most brilliant melodies Sting ever strung together on one LP.    Their previous albums only set the table for Synchronicity. Sting, stung with king-sized pain from marital woes, calls on every creative fiber beneath his frown. The result: the Police were never better, cresting their talents in a musical finale that made me grateful, in a way, that they split afterward. I doubt they could have improved on this.
1591841984|3.0|I got this one out of the library. I suppose it's worth a quick read, but I certainly wouldn't pay for it. If you're even moderately familiar with the received wisdom about Apple and Jobs, you'll find this all very familiar. Sure, there are a few anonymous insiders revealing trivial new details, but mostly these do nothing but add to old stories. Hey, Steve's kind of a mean jerk! \\"Yes, that's true,\\" said a nervous Apple employee, who wouldn't give his name for fear of being fired.<br /><br /> \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" was clearly hastily written and sloppily edited. There are quite a few typos, and it's so repetitive. I got tired of seeing the same phrases repeated over and over, and anecdotes from early in the book would reappear unchanged in later chapters. That's frustrating in a book that already feels very padded at 300 pages.<br /><br />Each chapter ends with some bullet point suggestions for how you can channel Steve's Brain in your own work. These are so dumb I stopped reading them: literally they come down to \\"be smart!\\" \\"have a vision!\\" \\"drive your employees to do their very best work!\\" I got the impression that the editor insisted that the book have some sort of business-book component, and this was simply the quickest way to add it.<br /><br />I strongly recommend instead the thoroughly hilarious book by \\"Fake Steve Jobs\\" called [[ASIN:B001AQVT94 Options: The Secret Life of Steve Jobs]]

B000MRAAJM|4.0|I purchased this collection on DVD a while ago and after upgrading my equipment to 1080p LCD/PS3 and 7.1 audio I had to have this on Blu-Ray more than ANYTHING in my blu ray/dvd collection. I had been hooked on this series since the very first time I saw it. David Attenborough is an amazing narrator and a perfect match for this series. The footage is incredible and captures the essence of nature unlike any other wildlife series I have ever seen.    I do have one complaint about the Blu Ray release of this series (Why I only gave it 4 stars) in that it has a great deal of problems with 1080p playback in certain scenes. The flickering of dark backgrounds on light foregrounds such as during the angel falls scene during \\"freshwater\\" is unacceptable especially for videophiles. It is not as great as I would have wished for because the flicker takes away from what would be one of the most remarkable scenes ever captured in video history. I have a top of the line home theater system with a samsung 46\\" LCD running the 1080p content from a PS3 40GB with monster cable connecting it all. I contacted BBC america because I thought I had a defective disc set, which amazon happily replaced for me. It turns out that BBC released an official statement that because of filming coniditions, High Definition video capture was hindered, or not even used at all. It is understandable, but disheartening nonetheless for us looking for the ultimate viewing experience with this collection, hence the reason for buying another copy on Blu ray.    Anyways, if you don't mind visual artifacts from time to time or it just doesn't bother you regardless, this collection is abolsutely a must for any blu ray collection. Some claim that they do not experience this problem, but I am hard pressed to believe it because BBC admitted that the artifacts exist regardless of the equipment you are going to try to view it with.     Overall, Hats-off to BBC for making this series. It will cease to amaze you every time you watch it! and for the price on amazon, it can not be turned down!
B00006JU7T|5.0|This true story based film is set in the corruption addled 1970s New York police force, with Serpico as the only cop who wouldn't take the huge bribes on offer.

0743298039|1.0|One reviewer said that this is the same \\"shock-o-rama\\" one sees on TV these days, insest, abuse and sado-masochism, and I agree. Do we need more of it, especially in literature, whose purpose is to educate and elevate, not merely to entertain in the lowest sense of the word? I don't care that the book it well written, if the subject matter is basically trash. If it's the shock factor that keeps your attention, and not the story itself (which is not great by any means, and should never be compared with Wuthering Heights or Rebecca), nor anything else of value that you may learn while you read, the book is not worth wasting time on. Good thing I've only spent $6 on this garbage.

B0013D8LOK|4.0|The back alleys of London have been host to many of the most revered 19th century pieces of literature, spawning some of the greatest stories, protagonists and villians: such as Charles Dickins' \\"Oliver Twist\\", H.G. Wells' \\"the Invisible Man\\", and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. One of the more underated London-based books \\"the String of Pearls\\", or better known to Broadway as Sweeney Todd, has finally joined his brothers of extrodinary literature in the silver screen as the musical \\"Sweeney Todd- The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\".     Todd's tale was one of the biggest broadway bangs when it debut. Keeping with the style of broadway music, Tim Burton recruits the likes of Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman(with Timothy Spall as his servent, go figure) to yodel their tales of triumph and terror with surprising success. The orchastrated score was kept simple, but devistating none the less, all musical numbers where performed to the apex of quality, for both the perfomers and the band. I would expect nothing less, this was an award winning musical after all.     For those who don't know about this hack-n-slash tale, Sweeney Todd(Depp), a gifted barber, arrives in gothic London after serving a false account of rape in labour camp for 15 years. After visiting his old shop, Todd devises a plot with the baker/land lady, Mrs. Lovett(Carter), to dispose of the corrupt Judge Turpin(Rickman) that locked him away, making a healthy deposit of other human casulties to the bake furnace for pies along the way. Many aspects of Todd's and Turpin's characters looked as if they where taken from a Jean ValJean(Les Miserable) personality who's led astray. While in no means the only colors are black and white, but the cobblestone streets are shown in color when speaking of symbolism, in an otherwise opaque color scheme of a movie that just might be considered a greek tragedy.     Sweeney Todd is a flawless film, having beautifully executed acting and song in one swift stroke, becoming a favorite film of mine, and one that should be held in the same high regards as the Penny Dreadful novel and Broadway Musical. The only problem holding it back was a personal nick of mine. Having grown-up on the Harry Potter books and movies, seeing Rickman play as the potions master Snape, now still in character, and now as a singing judge(even though it was a beautiful attempt) just felt a bit corny.  4.5/5
031606792X|5.0|This was an excellent book, and a great ending to the series. Lots of plot twists and a complete page turner all the way through. I highly recommend it!
0385341075|3.0|If there's one thing this book did for me it was a desire to read Great Expectations just because of the way the author uses it as an important prop for his island based story.  This was a mix of Lord of the Flies and Treasure Island though it remained a mystery right to the end. It's probably one of the most unusual books I have ever read but I liked it because it was a story told honestly with no frills and it was set in a part of the world among people I would not be familar with. This in itself attracted me to the book.  It certainly set the scene for me and I transported myself totally into the story and for the duration of the read I was on that island. It also reminded me of the Life of Pi for some reason.  You could just imagine a scenario where people are faced with moral decisions but the gruesome event towards the end of the book took me completely by surprise.  This was an unusual, easy read but a rich and rewarding experience.
0312379293|5.0|Lord Jeffrey Archer is back with a bang! Doing what he does best. Writing fiction with revenge and justice as the major themes of his novel.<br /><br />I have not been as lucky as some as to meet this Lord in person. But I'm sure it would be an amazing experience just to hear him speak on any topic on this earth. He has an astounding insight on what seems to be almost everything.<br /><br />Lord Archer has proved yet again why he is one of the leading best selling authors of this generation.<br /><br />The similarities to Dumas's Count of Monte Cristo are clearly evident in this tale and even the main protagonist keeps referring to the book. But Archer gives this tale a modern twist and spices it up with intimate knowledge of the details that he gathered during his 2 year tryst in Her Majesty's prisons.<br /><br />The tempo of the novel keeps building up and its quite un-put-down-able (not sure if that is a word, but it describes this story aptly) To use a real word, this is a page turner. Definitely not bed time reading unless you plan to stay up all night until you are done.<br /><br />This is a book that every mystery/crime fan should buy and read and re-read (its a book that may need to be read twice as new angles are discovered which have a different significance on past conversations and situations)<br /><br />I'm now waiting for Paths of Glory which he is due to release in March of next year.
B00006DEF9|5.0|It's hard to believe that Singin' in the Rain was not a mega-hit when it was first released. An Oscar nomination (Jean Hagen) and a Golden Globe (Donald O'Connor) did not start those lines forming up around the movie palaces of the era.<br /><br />Jean Hagen's performance is laugh-out-loud funny every minute she's on screen!<br /><br />The lack of initial audience response is surprising because this is a wonderful, hilarious spoof of the movie industry, itself and a perfect musical comedy. Gene Kelly's legendary performance dancing in the pouring rain is worth the price of this DVD alone -- not to mention Donald OConnor's \\"Make 'Em Laugh.\\"<br /><br />This is a DVD that belongs in your collection. Every moment is a gem!
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|This recording is worthy of attention if for no other reason than the fact that it *is* pretty original.  And that is getting harder and harder to find it seems.    Now, to contradict myself I will say that *musically* this recording reminds me of late 70s Wire a lot.  The moody angularity and willingness to make some noise is impressive.    One thing I know, nobody \\"gets\\" music like this on the first or second listen.  If you are not willing to give this a chance, get something more easy to aurally digest.
B000002UQJ|4.0|REVIEW: Although not quite as adventurous as the critically acclaimed \\"FLOWERS IN THE DIRT\\": the well-crafted, radio friendly pop sound of \\"OFF THE GROUND\\" still showed McCartney on an upward swing (perhaps owing to his continued songwriting collaboration with Elvis Costello - a.k.a. Declan MacManus), and in full command of his musical sensibilities. Of course some of the press wasn't as kind, but with such great tracks as \\"Hope Of Deliverance\\", \\"Get Out Of My Way\\", \\"Winedark Open Sea\\", the McCartney/MacManus compositions \\"Mistress And Maid\\" and \\"The Lovers That Never Were\\", and the title track: who cares? Incidently, it is the two more plainspoken numbers (\\"I Owe It All To You\\" and \\"Peace In The Neighborhood\\") which come across as the most appealing moments on the album. And though there are a few so-so lapses in the program (\\"Looking For Changes\\", \\"C'mon People\\") and some re-treads (\\"Golden Earth Girl\\" sounds suspiciously like a remake of \\"Warm And Beautiful\\" off the \\"WINGS AT THE SPEED OF SOUND\\" LP): the overall gestalt is one of a recording artist who has found his footing again, and who relishes the sheer joy of making music. May he never stop.

Only the semi-\\"New Agey\\"ness of such songs as \\"Golden Earth Girl\\" and the tacked-on coda \\"Cosmically Conscious\\" may truly offend some Christian believers. However, the positive aspects of the album (including many pro-Christian sentiments) should be a welcomed relief for all. As such the record should earn a slight ACCEPTABLE rating.

B00005JLEU|5.0|This film is one of my favorites.  It is a \\"work of art\\" as many have said.  If I had children, I would want them to see this one (after the age of 5 or 6, I'd say), but it *is* long, and the young ones could fall asleep if you're watching it at night with them.  I love the message of friendship, and how kindhearted the characters could be.  Other characters were not so kind, but you later learn why they are unkind and are able to see why compassion reigns supreme.  I have nothing but love for this film!
B000PFU7OO|4.0|Often when I see a film and like the soundtrack, I'm disappointed in the CD.  Not so in this case - I loved the film, and the CD brings it all back when I listen.  One complaint is that the volume has to be turned *way* up in order to hear it - then when the changer switches to the next CD it's much too loud, but I can live with it.
B0000040MU|5.0|Beefheart once described himself as the most exciting singer alive.  He was right.  He sounds like a werewolf being prodded with a stick.  This is one of the essential Beefheart CDs.  Actually, they're all essential.  It might be a prototype, but it rocks.  Along with Lick My Decals, The Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot and Doc At The Radar Station, this one hits the spot.  And Strictly Personal, too, psychodelia and all.  Along with the Allman Brothers Live At Fillmore (and Mountain Jam) these are my desert island discs.  If you only hear these, you will know what true passion and creativity are.  These people are ARTISTS!  Nobody else gets close.

B00005JLCI|3.0|Yes, this is one of Kenneth Branagh's productions of Shakespeare; and he typically saves the most interresting role for himself. He is a good actor, but in my opinion, the multi-emotional role of Hamlet is beyond his ability. When Hamlet is instructing the actors he hires for the play within the play, he begins to act, but then stops himself in deference to the troupe of real actors, headed by none other than Charlton Heston. Branagh should have taken a cue from Hamlet.

B000P0J09C|5.0|I love me some Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />I just wanted to say that, because in all honesty I can't think of a single director who has ever worked that has come close to delivering what Kubrick has delivered to cinema.  Film after film, moment after moment, emotion after emotion, Kubrick is flawless and his films are as complete and as unique to him as they come.  No director has come close to delivering as consistently as Stanley Kubrick, and no director has a style as unique to himself as Kubrick (sure, many directors have their own style, but Kubrick's style is definitive and incomparable).<br /><br />That said, `Full Metal Jacket' is one of those war movies that is separate from the pack in style and construction; a film that defines a genre.  Sure, it may not be the best war movie out there, but it is one of the most unique.<br /><br />The film is split in two, focusing its first efforts on a boot camp and then delving into the battle field for the second half.  The films heart is built within the first few moments, while drill sergeant Hartman is scrutinizing and terrorizing the young men under his thumb.  In particular there is Pvt. Pyle, a husky dim-witted young man who seems out of place in the military.  Pyle tries hard but is unable to keep up with the other trainees, but after he is pushed to an extreme he manages to reel himself in and advance quickly.  This advancement is not as jovial as it should be, as we can see Pyle is being overtaken by something much darker within the pit of his soul.<br /><br />`Full Metal Jacket' brilliantly portrays the fact that not everyone is built for this life.<br /><br />The second half of the film takes a group of these men to Vietnam, the focus being on Pvt. Joker who is now serving as a military journalist.  He's soon thrust into battle as he leads a platoon into sniper territory.  The final scene, involving a sniper hit and the rushing conflicts of humanity, is really what makes this movie as harrowing and effective as it truly is.<br /><br />`Full Metal Jacket' brilliant portrays the fact that no one is really built for this life.<br /><br />The acting here is monumental and extremely powerful, especially in the opening section of the film.  The two key performances come from R. Lee Ermey, as the sadistic drill instructor, and Vincent D'Onofrio (academy away snubbee) as Pyle.  Ermey has received cult status, for his performance is brutal and outlandish and definitely memorable; but to me this film belongs to D'Onofrio.  His subtle emotional breakdown is flawlessly captured with just a shift in facial expressions.  His character is one of the most moving and definitely one of the most effective in the bunch.  Matthew Modine comes close to capturing the stripped humanity of the soul in his final scene, but D'Onofrio is unforgettable in his tragic turn as the odd man out.<br /><br />I am new to the whole `war movie' bit, for it has never been a genre that interested me too much.  I have always been more of a biopic, dramatic type of cinemaphile, but I have quite a few films in this genre on my agenda for the next few weeks.  `Full Metal Jacket' is one of those eye-opening films, a movie that surpasses its genre thanks to some brilliant construction on the part of its director.  Kubrick takes this film and creates something universally grounded.  It is much more than a war film but more a study of humanity at its most strained and resistant.  As the film draws to its conclusion we are faced with questions of a deeply rooted and personal nature that challenges us as human beings to decide just who we really and truly are.e as it truly is.<br /><br />`Full Metal Jacket' brilliant portrays the fact that no one is really built for this life.<br /><br />The acting here is monumental and extremely powerful, especially in the opening section of the film.

1400063515|3.0|As a mathematical statistician I am a little taken aback by Taleb's lack of scholarship in understanding and appreciating what professional statisticians do.  He puts down economists, Nobel laureates, philosopher and statisticians among others.  There is a degree of unseemly arrogance on his part and I am sure that some of the other 300 or so reviews on amazon take him to task on that.<br /><br />It is a shame too because for many of us, it spoils the really good main point of the book which is that Black Swans exist, make predictions difficult if not impossible but can be handle in the stock trading business at least by using his barbell approach.<br /><br />I found the first 1/3 rd of the book very philosophical extremely redundant yet provocative.  The rest of the book was much more interesting to me particular the last few chapter which had the most technical discussion and many points to agree with and also to quibble with.<br /><br />A Black Swan is an extreme event that is very rare but so significant that it creates instability in averages and can ruin predictions and be either castastrophic (the negative Black Swan) or bring great fortune (the positive Black Swan).  These Black Swans are real and Taleb cites many examples.  Taleb is also right with his point that some economists are blind to the Black Swan or at least the unpredictability of them.  I have often seen major declines in the stock market explained after the fact with seemingly logical but very suspicious and dubious rationalizations.  Taleb deserves credit for recognizing this and realizing that in the world he calls extremistan where the Black Swans exist they must be accounted for but no should attempt the futile business of predicting them!<br /><br />He also recognizes that there is another world where the Gaussian distribution and other light-tailed parametric distributions prevail and he calls this the world of mediocrastan.  Here, the usual parametric statistics is useful but in Taleb's view it is not very common in practice to be in a mediocrastan world.  This is the world of parametric statistics and is the place where most elementary courses in statistics reside.  But here is also where I think Taleb makes a big mistake.  He assume that this is the world where all statisticians and econometricians live and play and so these teachings are irrelevant to the practical world.  Well, in many of the areas he discusses the parametric statistical models do not work.  But probabilist, statisticians and econometricians have realized this for at least the past 60 years.  In the 1930s and 1940s the field of nonparametric statistics developed through the work of Pitman, Mann and Whitney and Wilcoxon to name a few.  Also the theory of extreme value distributions goes back to Fisher and Tippett in 1929 and was rigorously developed by Gnedenko in the 1940s. Nonparametric statistics deals with general distributions that do not have a simple parametric form and includes the heavy-tailed distributions that Taleb cares about.  Also the asymptotic theory of extreme values that Fisher and Tippett, Gumbel and Gnedenko discovered showed that the extreme events had systematic behavior based on the three extreme-value types of distributions.  So the extremes can be treated using asymptotic statistical theory just as well as the averages can be characterized asymptotically through the central limit theorem and the stable laws (in the case of a heavy-tailed population distribution).  So in some ways Taleb is off and out of gas because he doesn't address or perhaps is even ignorant of this theory.<br /><br />In the area of finance as well as in other areas, time series models have been useful in developing forecasts.  In the world of mediocrastan the Box-Jenkins ARIMA models are very useful for problems in forecast and stochastic control.  This was well established with the very popular book by Box and Jenkins that was first published in 1970.  However financial data oftenfalls into the world of extremistan and the stationary distributions when they exist are non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed.  It is in this context that ARIMA models fail but the statisticians and econometricians have developed other models including the GARCH models which handle this type of data and allow for better predictions.  Taleb mentions the GARCH models but only to make fun of them in a very superficial way that does not discuss any of the mathematics associated with these models.  Again, I am not sure if Taleb is ignorant about this body of literature or just dismisses it because he see other models that cannot be used to predict as more appropriate.<br /><br />Taleb is enamored with Mandelbrot and his theory of fractal geometry and the apparent natural properties of fractals.  Well at least fractals look like coastlines on the world globe as well as other common items in our natural environment.  But is this enough to say that fractals are the only models relevant to extremistan?  I am not yet convinced.<br /><br />This August I went to the Joint Statistical Meetings in Denver.  There was a session on the Black Swan and to his credit Taleb was brave enough to accept the invitation of the statistical community to come to discuss the issues in his book.  Unfortunately, I was not able to attend that session.  But it got mew curious enough to want to read the book and see what Taleb's premise was all about.  I do not yet know much about what came out of that session.  I hope that at least Mr. Taleb came out of it with a better appreciation of the intelligence of statisticians and the more sophisticated models that he appears to be ignorant of based on the lack of discussion of them in his book.<br /><br />Another branch of nonparametric statistics developed in the 1970s that is now called resampling methods.  One of the more successful of these methods is the bootstrap.  I have done some research into bootstrap methods as well as having authored a text on the topic.  I believe that the bootstrap approach to time series analysis is another way that these time series with non-Gaussian innovation distributions or the stationary distributions of the time series model can be handled.  I am not yet convinced that in the world of extremistan the hope of some form of forecasting must be abandoned as is Taleb's thesis.d the stationary distributions when they exist are non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed.

Child 44 is a tour de force that includes all three. Not often mentioned in other reviews I've read of Child 44 is the complex love story beneath the quest for answers in the crime story. I applaud Smith for creating such multi-dimensional characters that force you to care about the political plights and life/death decisions of those involved.

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Blowup was Michelangelo Antonioni's first English language film, made in Great Britain, in 1966, and it's a flat-out great film, at a crisp 111 minutes. It was nominated for two Academy Awards; Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay- by Antonioni, Tonino Guerra, and Edward Bond- adapted from the short story Las Babas Del Diablo, by Argentine writer Julio Cortazar, and won the National Society Of Film Critics title as best film of 1967. Having first seen the two Hollywood films most influenced by it- Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, in 1974, and Brian De Palma's Blowout, in 1981, I did not know quite what to expect, since the former is also a great film- arguably Coppola's best, and the latter is a merely solid Hollywood thriller. Blowup is not only a great work of art, but a great work of philosophy. It is arguably as great as Antonioni's earlier Italian language masterpiece, La Notte, and the film caused a bit of a scandal upon its release, both for its showing casual sex and drug usage, and for its female nudity. Of course, forty years later, this all seems a bit silly, as tame as the scenes really are to the modern eye.<br />  The story follows an unnamed photographer (David Hemmings) who may or may not have inadvertently captured a murder on film, which may or may not involve a mysterious young woman (Vanessa Redgrave) who later visits the photographer in his studio, ready to have sex with him to retrieve the photos before he develops them. Both of the main characters are never named in the film, despite numerous reviews that call the two main characters Thomas and Jane. In watching the film twice- with and without commentary, I found zero in the way of evidence to support this claim of their being named, so I take it as one of those bits of information that gets repeated ad nauseam by bad critics until accepted, despite its being untrue. Possibly there were press kits that named the two characters, but they are not named within, nor in the credits. Yet, this very lack of names only makes the film all the more interesting, for not knowing the truth of these two characters only heightens their mysteriousness, and the events that ensnare the both of them. The photographer even sardonically comments in the film, when he's about to lay two girls- or `birds', `What's the use of a name?'<br />  Hemmings is a famed photographer whom we first see emerging from a London flophouse, just one of a crowd- not unlike the Carlo Battisti character in Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D., where he's gotten some great and intimate photos of the poor, which he plans on using in a book. He posed as a poor guy to get them, yet hops into his convertible wood paneled Rolls Royce. We then see him rather misogynistically mistreat a high fashion and clearly pre-anorexia nervosa anorexic supermodel (Verushka) in the grotesque Twiggy vein- whom, in a famed scene, he erotically `mounts', as he photographs her from above as she lies on the floor, five models who pose behind dark glass screens, and the two `birds' in pink and green pantyhose. We also find out he lives next door to an Abstract Expressionist painter, Bill (John Castle), and his girlfriend, Patricia (Sarah Miles), whom he has an unspoken attraction to, and who seems to return his feelings. In describing his paintings, Bill says he has no intent when he starts a painting, and that meaning only comes later. This is a key to the film, or at least the viewer's warning on how to take what they see....Others have laid bare the plot.<br />  Like Akira Kurosawa's classic film Rashomon, Blowup works on many levels, yet allows us to participate in the interpretation to an even greater extent than Rashomon. Photographs can lie- just ask AP photographer Eddie Adams, who, a few years later took the infamous photograph of a Vietnamese police commander shooting a Vietcong prisoner in the head. What was not shown was that the prisoner had killed many innocent people. By going beyond being a mere whodunit, and engaging the very the meaning of meaning, itself, Blowup (and it is Blowup, not Blow-Up, as on the DVD cover) illustrates the differences between the writer and the visual artist. The former elicits significance from things that need to be seen, while the latter does so from that already seen. In truth, there could be plausible and non-criminal reasons for all that happens in the film, and only the dull life of Hemmings spurs him on to imbue significance. That we can never know the real truth within the film is the real truth as to why this film never loses its hold in repeated viewings. On that score, no comment is needed.engaging the very the meaning of meaning, itself, Blowup (and it is Blowup, not Blow-Up, as on the DVD cover) illustrates the differences between the writer and the visual artist.

B00092ZL80|5.0|I bought this DVD mainly to listen and view my Chicago favorites. They open the show with EWF and start off with Beginnings which has been one of my all time favorite Chicago songs if not the all time favorite. It almost goes downhill after that. I would have not chosen to open the show with that song. That one should have been at the end or on one of the encores. Nonetheless, they play a couple of other songs together than they break off. EWF gets to play first and then Chicago takes the stage and then they join together again as in the beginning. Earth Wind and Fire steal the show and they are tighter musically. Chicago sounds good but not as great as they can be. Overall I would give them an A-, EWF an A+, and together an A. I would recommend this disc if you're a hard core Chicago or Earth, Wind, and Fire fan.   '
B00005JNJV|4.0|Christian Bale is, bar none, the best actor to ever portray Batman onscreen, and only Guy Pearce, I believe, could have come as close to being as good. Batman Begins, by director Christopher Nolan, who made the classic Memento (starring Pearce) and the good American version of Insomnia, shows that he understands what has made Batman the most popular superhero in comic book history- yes, surpassing both Superman and Spider-Man. That said, as good a comic book film as Batman Begins is, that's all it is. It has no real depth, other than in the realm it occupies. But, that's more than enough for your average moviegoer. At 2 hours and 20 minutes in length, it also re-visions Batman, not as a psychotic loner who makes himself into an avenger, nor as the campy icon of the 1960s television hit, nor the last two installments of the 1990s film franchise, but as a Ninja warrior. This is good, in that it allows Liam Neeson, as the villain Ra's Al Ghul (who uses the alias Henri Ducard), to finally allow his penchant for wooden acting and spouting inane Oriental koans to be fully realized, unlike his turn in the second Star Wars trilogy, but bad in that it utterly undermines the psychological complexity of the Bruce Wayne character, for the Batman, in his purest original form, is a vigilante driven by vengeance, not a savior. Neeson has not had a role so suited to his Lurch-like acting style since Darkman.... The film lands somewhere between camp and grit, but could have needed a bit more camp, thus why it just misses out on being a great film- even if only in a comic book vein, like the first Batman film by Tim Burton. That said, this darker avenue bodes better for the future of this new franchise, even if it means enduring the grim-faced and dubious Oriental philosophies that even martial arts films are wise enough to wink at.

B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Tim Burton is such a predictable director of films that even when, on the surface, he seems to be stretching himself, he's actually merely distorting art towards his own relentlessly immature aesthetic. In a sense he's the dark filmic counterpoint to Steven Spielberg's gauzey light pabulum. Neither has a fundamental grasp of what it is to be human, nor the essence of a good tale. Quirkiness does not equal interesting. If you doubt that you must find Tourette's sufferers fascinating rather than annoying.<br />  Big Fish is TB's attempt to do `adult' drama, yet it so desperately tries to rip off the best in other films- even less successful ones like Forrest Gump, a tale similarly set in Alabama. Along with that film's everyman-ness Big Fish tries to channel the warmth of My Dog Skip, the father-son dynamic of October Sky, & the rites of passage feel of Stand By Me. While it does not succeed as well as the aforementioned trio this is a good movie. Yet, dammit, with another director this could have been a great movie, certainly alot better than Burton's previous bests- the flawed but interesting Ed Wood and Planet Of The Apes. Instead, it's maybe just a little better. It's like when you see the goddess of your dreams but she turns out to be an Anti-Semite, smoker, or lesbian.<br />  Let me remove myself from despair & give you the capsule tale: an old talespinner- Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying and his son, Will (Billy Crudup), wants to know the reality behind the stories that so charm everyone else- including Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) and Will's wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard). The last few days of Ed's life give way to flashbacks and fantasies. The young Ed (Ewan McGregor) has all sorts of adventures: he meets a giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory), discovers a Utopian town called Spectre, befriends a witch, catches an elusive legendary big fish, and joins a circus run by a werewolf named Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). He joins the circus to get information on the girl of his dreams- the young Sandra (Alison Lohman) who's engaged to his childhood nemesis. Later, he becomes a military spy and rescues a pair of gorgeous Chinese Siamese twins named Ping and Jing from the Red Army.... Still, this is overall a good film- there is a wonderful sequence where young Ed 1st sees Sandra and time stops. He walks through hoops and juggler's balls fall to the ground as he walks by. This is a great sequence because it does simulate that feeling, but we've seen the time-stop before. What makes the scene a winner is that, to compensate for that momentary sensation, time has to speed up. Doing so causes Ed his opportunity to meet and woo Sandra for a few years.<br />  This is truly unique, but- alack- the only instance of using fantasy to serve a narrative purpose, and not just be `ooh-ah' fantastical! That TB only does this once in the film confirms it was a happy accident, not an understood exercise of filmic control. Still, the acting of Finney and McGregor is superb, as are the other supporting performances.he girl of his dreams- the young Sandra (Alison Lohman) who's engaged to his childhood nemesis.

B00008976Y|5.0|Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the more interesting filmmakers of the last quarter century, and the centerpiece of his claim to greatness is the Three Colors (Trois Couleurs) trilogy of films that he wrote and directed in the early to mid-1990s, filming them all at the same time. Blue, White, and Red represent the three colors of the French flag, and symbolize the three virtues of liberty, equality, and fraternity respectively. Blue (Bleu) is the first film in the series, and was released in 1993. The color blue also resonates for its associations with depression and coldness, that are well demonstrated in the film. It was deserving of the many award sit garnered, such as winning Best Film at the Venice Film Festival and the Goya Awards, as well as star Juliette Binoche (who looks like a prettier Julia Roberts, as well as a better actress) winning Best Actress at Venice and the Cesar Awards.<br />  Yet, Kieslowski made a wise choice to depoliticize his films, for the freedom that Blue deals with is not political but personal and emotional- a hoped for freedom from memories, and not the cheap sort that Hollywood would foist, such as a woman running away from an abusive boyfriend. If only more artists (think Latin American writers) could learn that political statements can be made slyly and subtly and wield far more power than overt preaching. Another wise move he made was to cast this film as a picaresque, whose main character is delineated in small strokes, with scenes that do not drive simple plot not character development, but stand alone and apart as merely defining her state of mind.<br />  The film starts with an automobile accident that kills off a husband and father, the famous musical composer Patrice de Courcy, and his five year old daughter Anna. The only survivor is his wife, named Julie de Courcy ne&eacute; Vignon (Juliette Binoche). This is foreshadowed when we see a shot of leaking brake fluid from the car when the daughter is let off the side of the road to urinate. Fortunately, the crash occurs off camera, not in the melodramatic style a Hollywood film would drool over. Interestingly, at the end of the film, after the credits, Kieslowski has a sly tweak when he notes that, since the car is an Alfa Romeo, any loss of brake fluid, and the accident, are purely fictional events. When Julie wakes in a hospital we see an extreme close up of her pupil reflecting the image of her doctor. It is an objective shot of subjectivity after Julie regains her consciousness after an unspecified period of time. This ellipsis of death to the opened eye has a great psychic resonance to the viewer, in a way mere words cannot. She recovers, after a fey attempt at suicide by overdose at her hospital, and decides to abandon her country estate and set out for an anonymous life in Paris. In one scene, Julie comes upon her old maid who is crying.  She asks, `Why are you crying?' The maid answers, `I am crying because you are not.' The rest of the plot has been detailed by others.<br />  I started this review by stating that Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the more interesting filmmakers of the last quarter century, and I stand by that claim. The only thing a viewing of this film will add to that claim is to append the term great to that description, for Blue is a flat-out masterpiece. It is as mysterious as a work of Antonioni, symbolic as a film of Bergman, humane as a work of Fellini, and precise as a work of Kubrick. That's good company to keep, and this film earns such companionshipe. Fortunately, the crash occurs off camera, not in the melodramatic style a Hollywood film would drool over.

B00008G9JO|5.0|This album doesn't sound like any other album ever made by anyone.  Even Tull only made one like this.  There's certainly a Celtic influence, but I really don't think you could call this folk music.  Many of the songs have such a strong, upbeat rhythm, it's almost like celtic disco?? Not perfect (I still can't quite get my ears around \\"Journeyman\\") but still one of Tull's best.  Rover is my particular favorite.  Makes me wanna hop in my truck and drive away whenever I hear it.  The two bonus tracks are also very good and fit well with the rest of the songs.  The whole album always gives me sort of a cold feeling.  In a good way.  No matter what time of year it is, I feel like I'm watching the first snowfall of the winter.
B0017MO10U|5.0|If you are a Stargate SG1 fan you will definately want to purchase this movie. I have been a fan since the beginning with the original Stargate with Kurt Russel. I usually have found spin offs lacking from original releases but I just fell in love with this series and how the charactors all interact and bring out the best in each others charactors. I found Stargate Continuum to possess a fantastic storyline that keeps you captivated through out the movie. My only critical point is that the ending kind of comes up abrupt, kind of \\"huh\\" its over. I still loved this and will add it to my Stargate collection. A word of caution to potential buyers - there are bad imitations from market place sellers so beware. Amazon.com took great care of me as I was one who got taken from a low price and recieved a bootleg copy with sub titles you can not turn off. I then purchased from Amazon.com and recieved a perfect \\"New DVD\\". Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I received this as a wedding gift and I think this is a great product for in between vacuuming times if needed to quickly sweep. It works great under couches and dressers. It also is a great tool for the bathrrom and the kitchen. It will pick up anything from twistie ties to dust to crumbs and dirton hard floors and carpet. Mine has not lost its charge or broken in any way. It is quiet and rechargeable and easy to store. It has replaced my broom and dust pan. I love this product.

B000V877RA|3.0|I have the finis center mount snorkel and I got the hang of that one but this one gives me some trouble.  I bought the freestyle snorkel because I've seen some great swimmers all using it so I had to give it a try but I prefer the center mount snorkel.  Supposedly the freestyle snorkel is bent to make it harder for water to come in at the top but a lot of water was getting in.  (Of course I'm not sure if water came in the top or if my seal around the mouthpiece was not tight enough or how water was getting in.)  I'm not giving up on it altogether but i found the center mount snorkel easier to use.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|BEWARE: SOME LITTLE SPOILERS.<br /><br />What a novelty act this mess of a movie is. Technically very good, you sense that the technical department did their best to put in action a promising concept: a monster movie that does not show the monster very clearly and is shown entirely through the lenses of the camera of one of the characters.<br /><br />So far, so good. But the road to hell is full of good intentions. After the ending of the movie, you sense that it was all a scheme, a way for the movie makeers don't bother with explanations about the monster's origins, the lack of empathy towards the leading characters (I simply did not care about them), the unfortunate use of Hollowywoodian cliches towards the end (spoiler here: the chopper is brought down by the monster. Both pilots die, but our three leading characters escape...), the absurdity of trying to rescue the girl and risk killing all your friends in the process, etc, etc, etc....<br /><br />All in all, J.J. Abrahams once again has a good premise and blows it.
1416955070|2.0|I will admit that the only reason I read this book was because of Ms. Clare's identity in the Harry Potter fandom. I had never read any of her fanfiction, but I believed that it's better that way for me to enjoy her published original fiction.    After reading, I guess I should feel glad I didn't waste about two years of my life following her in the HP fandom when she still wrote. The story feels so dry, and the pace is just plodding along. I feel as if Clary, Jace and friends are just being thrown randomly from one mini-adventure to another without any real connection to a central plot (I'm sure there's one somewhere, but it got lost in the interminable character monologues!) Even the supposedly witty lines felt flat and the characterization isn't enough to make me want to find out what will happen to Clary in the succeeding books.    Some day, I might pick this book up again to read, but for the moment, there are plenty other better-written YA books that I can dig into.

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is one of very few alternative rock groups i listen to, I'm mostly a Hip Hop and R&B person, but Linkin Park does a lil rapping which is why I listened to them in the first place, but ever since I have always loved Linkin Park...they're kind of EMO (which i hate) but they are extremely catchy and they make good music. I bought this album way back in 2002, and ever since I still listen to it (not as often) but every time I listen to this CD i just feel strong for some stupid reason. All the songs are perfect or above average, there are only 12 tracks but the album feels complete.<br /><br />1)Papercut - the song starts with a head bumping beat, than an even more head bumping guitar riff, and than a break your neck combination of everything. The song is one of my favs because there is good rapping, and the screaming is scary but intising. 10/10<br /><br />2) One Step Closer - I think I heard this song first after watching Dracula 2000, it was very in your face an the lyrics were just gritty. I never even knew who Linkin Park was but I knew the song, it was very surprising to find that this song was by Linkin Park...anyway a very good hard song. 10/10<br /><br />3) With You - the sound was very similar to One Step Closer but different construction, not one of my favorites but I never skip the song. 9/10<br /><br />4) Points of Authority - another mix with rap and rock, the beat was sick (mixed wit a lil DJ'ing), the chrous was very catchy. I feel EMO listening to this song, but the actual lyrics made perfect sense, I actually could relate to this song. 9.5/10<br /><br />5) Crawling - this song won Linkin Park there first Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance...the video for this song was very poetic in my opinion very specific and very intuitive. The actual song was very disturbing to me in the beginning, I couldn't figure the frantic screaming that Chester was doin, but I've learned to love it. 10/10<br /><br />6) Runaway - this is a very poetic song actually, actually hearing Chester singing without screaming was a nice change. This was my old favorite wen I was younger, I use to play this song like 10 times a day, seriously. 10/10<br /><br />7) By Myself - this song was my least favorite, I don't know why but it just is. It wasn't very catchy and the actual story of the song wasn't very interesting. The song is decent tho. 7.5/10<br /><br />8) In The End - THIS IS THE BEST SONG OFF THE WHOLE ENTIRE ALBUM. the beginning piano was unforgettable in my head, the beat is impossible not to love and Mike Shinodas lyrics are very true. Chesters Singing is a A in my book. The whole song is just great, the best song by Linkin Park.  11/10<br /><br />9) A Place for My Head - Mike Shinoda's lyrics were in my head wen I heard this song. The beat is very catchy, and the hook is catchy. And the \\"You try to take the best of me, Go away\\" part was sick as hell. 10/10<br /><br />10) Forgotten - another song demonstrating Linkin Park's story telling, I tend to skip this song a lot for sum reason, the song is good but there is just sumthin about it. 9/10<br /><br />11) Cure For The Itch - this is an instrumental, but more of a demonstration from Mr. Hahn, his DJ skills are great, people that don't like scratching or Hip-Hop u will skip this but I personally love it. 10/10<br /><br />12) Pushing Me Away - the final song of the album, this song closes album rather well but again not one of my favorite songs. The song is a story and a good one at that, Chester's singing is very well done and the instrumental's is good. 8/10out screaming was a nice change. This was my old favorite wen I was younger, I use to play this song like 10 times a day, seriously. 10/10    7) By Myself - this song was my least favorite, I don't know why but it just is. It wasn't very catchy and the actual story of the song wasn't very interesting.

0930289234|5.0|I think most people can relate to being so busy with daily life that you have little or no time to read.  Thank goodness for the graphic novel.  This piece of literature is very well known and very highly regarded by many enthusiasts.  I finally found out why.  If you are a reader of novels, please don't assume this giant sized \\"comic book\\" can't deliver.  I assure you it does.  The artwork is very good and the story telling and character development is top notch.<br />Watchmen is more of a social and political commentary of the Cold War / Post Cold War Era.  It focuses on the weaknesses and flaws of the masked heros of the time and shows how imperfect they are.  It's very well done.  The characters have great depth and stunning psychological profiles.  The novel sucks you in right away and never let's you go.<br />Watchmen does tend to show it's age and the ending does get a little corny, but these are very minor complaints as you can see by me giving it five stars.  I can't imagine the movie being able to do the book justice.  We'll have to wait and see.<br />Highly recommended.  Not for children.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Robert B.Parker is one of the best - if not the best - in telling a story almost entirely through dialogue and as such perfect for film.   His novels are million sellers, and they deserve to be.   Parker's output is amazing. The Spenser series, the Jesse Stone and the Sunny Randal novels, a couple of westerns and YA novels, the list goes on and on.   Stone Cold is a TV movie based on the 4th novel in the Jesse Stone series. And it's terrific. Parker has never ever before been transmitted to film like this.   Though Jesse in the novels is a little younger than Tom Selleck, Tom is perfect in the role. He's witty, tough, straight, comes equipped with a huge heart, and is ready for action when he needs to be.  Not that you would expect that in Paradise, Massachusetts, the quiet little New England fishing town where Jesse just started as the new police chief. As a former L.A. homicide detective who left behind the big city and his divorced wife, Jesse probably didn't expect a serial killer couple to disrupt the peace. As the killers try to destroy Jesse's private life just as a gang rape case stretches thin his small town police force, Jesse decides it's time to hit back.   Tom Selleck in my opinion has never been better. And he knows it. No wonder he is one of the executive producers on the series.   But this is not just about Tom. Polly Shannon is lovely as his girlfriend (or pal, as Jesse prefers to call her), Viola Davis and Kohl Sudduth shine as small town cops, the dog too - as the dog (what would a Parker tale be without one)   Robert Harmon's directing is state of the art, as are Jeff Beal's music, Rene Ohashi's camera work and the location and production design.   If you keep in mind that this is just a TV production it is amazing what the team pulled off with a relatively small budget. As such it is better than most of what's been around lately.  Get it and watch it. It won't disappoint.

B000UNYK76|5.0|I am a hardcore Pearl Jam fan.  Own all imaginable albums, DVDs, and other goodies associated with the band.  I've also been to 6 live performances over the years.  That being said, this DVD is an incredibly accurate substitute for tickets to the front row of a Pearl Jam concert.  With the stunning images and the amazing sound on the DVD, you really feel like you are at the concert.      With the crowd singing all around you, you sit on your couch, but feel as if you're in the middle of a huge crowd in the middle of an Italian \\"piazza\\", or square.  However, all the music is trumped by the in-between scenes, showing the band members outside of the concert hall and doing \\"regular things\\".  McCready and Vedder playing on some ancient Italian structure, Ament skateboarding in some small Italian playground, and local Italians playing \\"Porch\\" in honor of this beloved band.  Most importantly, seeing the best frontman of our generation, Eddie Vedder, behind the scenes, where he is able to leak out just some of the most coveted insights in rock, is priceless.  With his unmatched respect to classic rock, shown through the band's extensive list of covered songs, Vedder links the older rock scene with today's.    This DVD is a must buy for the Pearl Jam fan, and for the casual fan would offer a spectacular insight into possibly the most influential band in the last 20 years.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|First of all, I would like to comment on what another so called Priest fan said on here about \\"Nostradomus\\" sounding like \\"Ram it down\\"? What the f@#k is this guy smoking? This album is something you have to get accustomed to, I know it's no \\"Painkiller\\" which I still think is their best album but this has a new twist to their style. It seems like their trying out their progressive style of Priest. Halford is hitting notes that I have not heard since maybe \\"Stained Glass\\" or \\"Sin after Sin\\". The drums are nothing special on this album but fits with this style they are trying. Guitars are alot more toned down but still can hear there style that Priest are known for. This album kind of reminds me of Queens \\"Innuendo\\" but better. I recomend this album to anyone who wants to hear another side to Judas Priest, I give it a 8/10. I don't recomend this album to anyone hoping to hear \\"Jugalator\\" or \\" Screaming for Vengeance\\" Laters........

0812975219|4.0|Some years ago, I had a colleague who organized a Mark 6 pool among friends. They had a database of previous Mark 6 results and from it derived that some numbers were more easily drawn than others. They then collectively bet on such numbers which they believed would have a higher probability of winning. I asked him the basis of his action. He explained that the fact some numbers appeared more frequently was real as proven by the statistics. The reason could be the material of the paint of different colour, the difference in the shape of the numbers painted, or their different position before drawing. Although the factors would be too complex to compute, the results shown in the statistics were sufficient to show the bias. By the time I left the department, the pool was still losing money.    It is not a coincident that the essence of the book is exactly on the same thinking. Taleb points out that human beings always overestimate causality, and we tend to view the world as more explainable than it really is. An example used in the book is the performance of stock and option investors. These investors use sophisticated statistical methods to analyze the performance of the market in the past and predict the future. The information they derived from analyzing the past may adequately explained what happened. However, the performance of the market on the following day has no relevance to the past. It is a Brownian movement which only depends on the factors at present. It is actually more random than expected.    For that matter, people always confuse between randomness and causality. The book gives an illustration on the two corresponding sides of such thoughts:  Randomness v Determinism  Probability v Certainty  Belief v Knowledge  Coincident v Law  Forecast v Prophecy  Lucky idiot v Skilled investor  Survivorship bias v Market out-performance  Stochastic variable v Deterministic variable  Noise v Signal    It is not surprising that such thinking would attract objectionfrom the skilled investors. There are a lot of comments on this book defending the reliability and almost certainty of statistical analysis and prediction of market movements. However, from the market performance in recent months, I tend to believe that the market is much more random than we thought.    Since human being developed self-consciousness, or the soul if one likes to call it, we always wonder why things happened. This quest for reasons has also developed into the religion delusion. This innate property of the human mind makes it easy for us to attach reasons, whatever they are, to nearly everything. Thus we are easily fooled by the randomness of nature, which is now beginning to be recognized in modern science such as evolution biology and quantum physics. For the ordinary people, it is useful to reflect on the randomness misconceptions discussed in the book.    There is a survivorship bias in many statistical data we gather. We see the winners and try to learn from them, while forgetting the huge number of losers. The case study used in the book is the survey of the earning ability of the stock and option traders. While a lot of data on the traders in business can be gathered, the survey is actually gathering only the data from the survivors. Data on many traders who lost money and dropped out in the previous years are all ignored. Thus the statistics is unreliable. Let's say we want to survey among government executive officers on how the university graduates adapt to government work. We are only surveying the survivors of the government recruitment. University graduates who do not make it are all missed. If we conduct a survey in an online forum on the habit of people using computer, we are only surveying those surviving in the forum. Such statistics need to be qualified on their target participants. However, there is a misconception that survey with survivorship bias can be applied universally.    Many probabilities have skewed distributions. Many real life situations do not have a 50% probability like the two sides of a coin, but have unusual and counter-intuitive distributions. People can often be fooled by the fact that they won a bet 50 times and think that they will win next time with absolute certainty. Taleb opines that some aggressive stock and option traders eat like chickens and go to the bathroom like elephants. They earn a steady small income from selling the stocks and options, but when a disaster happens they lose a fortune. They are fooled by the randomness of the market which is hidden from them.    There is the story of black swan on probability, on which Taleb eventually wrote another book. Swans in Europe are white. People may take numerous observations to prove that swans are white. So a fact is established that all swans must be white, and the probability is 100%. However, it only takes one twist in the DNA to turn one swan black and the probability is re-written. In fact, black swans are found in Australasia. The impact of the highly improbable is severe. The more improbable it is, the harder the impact when it happens. Another joke on the false improbability is when Taleb observes an old man everyday to see if he is still alive. For eighty years, there have been about 30,000 observations and the old man is still alive. With such a large number of observations, he could conclude that this old man must be a superman who is highly improbable to die. By the track record, he may even live forever. But it only takes one death to turn the probability to zero. The truly scary thing is that the black swan could be a random event. That means it is capable of happening any time to turn a high probability totally upside down.
0061537934|5.0|The title is so apt on so many levels. The analogy to racing cars along with how one lives his or her life.  While at first I was reticent to read about a dying dog, I became so enthralled I could not put it down.  This is a keeper to be read again and again even though one knows the outcome and ending.  We could all learn so much from Enzo and his spirit.
B000G75AE8|5.0|I am a huge Slayer fan and when I heard that they were going to release their next album titled \\"Christ Illusion\\" I instantly pre-ordered the album to make shure I get it the day it comes out.  I was suprised that Paul Bostaph left the band and Dave Lombardo returned to Slayer.  God Hates Us All was a brutal album and Christ Illusion was a good follow-up album to that.  When I listened to it for the first time I noticed that Dave Lombardo got better on his drum work and in some ways surpassed his drumming on \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\".  Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman never lost their edge on guitar and still deliver a brutal guitar assault that would leave your ears bleeding and Tom Araya's bass playing and vocals are still killer.  The cover art on the album are both offensive and really cool but eventually stores started to sell alternate covers on the albums. My favorite song on this album is also a controversial track, the song \\"Jihad\\" was criticized by victims of 9/11 because the lyrics are about the 9/11 terrorist attack in the view of the terrorists.  Songs like \\"Cult\\", \\"Eyes of The Insane\\", \\"Catatonic\\", \\"Flesh Storm\\", and \\"Black Serenade\\" are heavy and brutal and gives the listener a dose of classic Slayer thrash.      Sadly I recieved word that Slayer is going to release one more album after \\"Christ Illusion\\" then they are going to quit the band.    Buy this album and keep headbanging to SLAYER!!!
B00004ZD69|4.0|Still a high water mark for the sub-genre, the four tracks making up this double disc represents Godspeed's most ambitious, immersive audio experience yet. Though the album is not without its bloat which some may deride as pretentious anti-establishment noodling, and the uproarious fade-in seems to be far more memorable then the ambiguously stretched out finale, one would be hard pressed to cite a modern rock disc which offers the highest highs and lowest lows in a more organically epic presentation.
0792839749|5.0|I bought this movie for my 2.5-year old son, after he fell in love with the original version of Mary Poppins movie.  Now, he cannot have enough of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and all the features that this magical car has.  He loves the music and songs, as well as the story line.  It's a great movie to watch for the whole family once in a while.
B00000I8NC|4.0|4 1/2    One of the best short-lengths period, not to mention the absolute best post-rock e.p. available to date. Although the second track might feel like filler to some with it's reliance on spoken-word, here fits with more integrity then we usually ever see when implemented. Two tracks of the massive collective's restrained best helped bridge an orchestral gap between the grittier debut and what would become their most acclaimed.
B0015XASFS|3.0|First, I'm a huge fan of Josh Grobin's.  Saw the Awake concert in person twice and was totally enthralled each time.  Unfortunately, for me, the excitement of seeing him live is not generated by this DVD.  It's too polished and most of the audience interaction was cut.  The interaction during the concert created a nice balance between the dramatic music and the playfulness of the singer which is missing on the DVD.  Parts of the DVD seem to highlight Josh's awkwardness with faster tempo music.  He knows he can't dance but his minimal attempts seem forced for the sake of the DVD.  The two times I saw him live he moved much more naturally.  However, the music is fantastic and Lucia Micarelli's Kashmir rocks.  If you're Josh Groban fan this is a must have.

006091307X|2.0|I have this problem that once I commit to reading a book I can't put it down because I think that if I keep reading, maybe, eventually something worth reading will come up in the later pages.<br /><br />This is why I dislike The Crying of Lot 49.  The author goes on and on like a crazy hobo in an unending stream of conscious.<br /><br />This book could easily be a short story.  It's not subtle at all where the author spends pages and pages over using metaphors and similes, going on tangents and generally trying desperately to fill out what never should have been an entire book in the first place.<br /><br />It took me weeks to finish this short read that should have taken only a few hours because I kept putting it down and eying it like a disenchanted child staring down a plate of vegetables.

0761119752|5.0|I absolutely have loved reading this so much to our two older grandchildren that I just had to order another for the third one!  Can't say enough about the concept, rhythms, characters, etc.  For me it even tops Barnyard Dance, which is my other Boynton favorite, although the two have much in common.
075640407X|5.0|I am deeply suspicious when I read so much praise about a new writer's work - I've been burned before by books that didn't come close to living up to the buzz.  This one, however, more than lives up to it; it surpasses the paeans written to it.  There have been many excellent reviews here, so there is no need for me to write more - you just need to get this book, if you read no other new fantasy writer this year.

B000XUOIQ4|2.0|I saw this movie the first time and i thought it would be really neat. i was so psyched because it took place in paris and i had seen a lot of advertising for it. but this is like a 101 dalmatians wanna-be failure! it is loaded with annoying songs that you wonder when they'll be done and get back to the dialogue. also there are plenty of bizarre details such as why does everyone speak with a quasi-English accent when they supposedly are from paris? why does the mouse hang out with cats? why are there 3 colors of cats from a white cat who never mentions any father figure who helped to produce them? why do the white cats have similar personalities and the brown cats as well? i think this movie is just lacking too much and there's really nothing to save it. it was okay. just okay.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|I won't lie.  I went to this movie only because my wife insisted that I take her.  I had seen the show throughout all the years it was on HBO and I knew pretty much all of the characters and storyline.  The movie was a GREAT continuation of the series!  It picked right up where the finale ended and the transition from small screen to silver screen is a successful one.     I think there was like, 300 people in the theater and probably only about... 10 guys.  I think I was the youngest one at 27 years old.  And you know what?  I cried my eyes out.  I did!  The movie did SUCH a good job wrapping up the ending and it is a good one!  If you watched the series and you're familiar with the characters and storyline, you will NOT be disappointed!

0439023483|4.0|The Hunger Games races through a crumpled and crushed America where the future has divided the country into the Capital of the state of Panem and the 12 districts that feed and clothe the capitalistas.     In a landscape that reminds us favorably of F. M. Busby's great SciFi novel, Rissa Kerguelen, the outlandishly cultured Capital forces the 12 Districts to send two \\"contestants\\" as \\"tribute\\" to the annual \\"Hunger Games.\\" If you rebel, you get what the 13th District got-- you become a glowing lava pit.    The contestants fight to the death in a special game park that is preserved afterward as a tourist attraction where Capitalistas can revisit their favorite death-moment.    Suzanne Collins is an excellent writer, who draws her characters, good and not-so with care. The plot draws you in, and the pacing carries you along quite well. I didn't break out of the readers' trance until the final page. Then I noticed things about Collins' worldbuilding that were a little shaky, sort of like a Potemkin village.    But I don't care. This is an excellent read, especially for Young Adult readers. Who knows? They may go on to read other science fiction greats like Busby, like Heinlein, and like Mike Resnick's Africa stories.     Like what we publish in Jim Baen's Universe, this story may be set in a dystopian future, but it isn't ugly. The characters shine as they cope with the future they were born in, and the culture they're stuck with, but never drown in.

0446607274|4.0|Angels Flight by Michael Connelly opens with Harry Bosch worrying about the direction his marriage with Eleanor Wish has taken. It is two in the morning and he and his team get a call to Angels Flight, a train that takes people to the top of a hill in downtown LA. Two dead bodies have been found, and one of them is Howard Elias. Elias is a famous black civil rights attorney that has made a fortune and a reputation on suing the LAPD. This is a very sensitive case since many cops would be suspects. Elias was about to go to court the next Monday in a case accusing the LAPD of brutalizing Michael Harris while he was interrogated. Harris was tried and aquitted in the murder and torture of a young white girl named Stacy Kinkaid.<br /><br />In Angels Flight, Connelly is obviously choosing to tackle the racial tensions that were so prevalent in LA during the Rodney King and OJ trials. While Bosch and partners Jerry Edgar and Kiz Rider try to solve Elias's murder, they stumble onto another shocking case regarding Michael Harris. Connelly's shift of the case over half way through the novel was somewhat unexpected yet very compelling. The first half of the novel is about Elias and the racial tensions brewing in LA, and the second half shifts to a different case about Michael Harris and the death of Stacy Kinkaid. Many authors couldn't pull this shift off, but Connelly does it superbly. In the end, the cases come together in the gritty and somewhat shocking traditional Connelly fashion.<br /><br />This is a good novel, almost epic in its scope of a case spanning only three or four days yet going in so many different directions. Bosch's personal life takes a sharp turn in this novel, yet never gets in the way of the raw police details that fans love. Connelly once again proves he is one of the best.
B0017APPT8|5.0|This movie looks great on blu-ray sometimes too good that you can notice the special FX look fake on some scenes.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|Crosby, Stills & Nash, Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel,  Final Fantasy!?!    This music is Japanese RPG influenced.  From someone who rarely listened to the first three bands mentioned above but has played and enjoyed Japanese video games, this is what I heard and it makes sense being the band members are in their 20s.    You can really hear it in the excellent song Blue Ridge Mountains.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I loved this CD  I gave one to my daughter and she said she listened to it all the time!
B000002UAI|3.0|The reason this is a difficult album to judge is because it's almost like two different albums: the originals and the covers.<br /><br />The cover songs - which account for 6 of the 14 tracks - are the weak links.  It's not that they're bad - even \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" (often derided as the \\"worst song the Beatles ever recorded\\") is very listenable - it's just not up to the quality of the Beatles' original songs.  But, as it's been said, this album was sort of a rush job, so you can't blame them.  Plus, \\"Beatles for Sale\\" has the difficult task of following up the hugely popular 100% Lennon/McCartney genius of \\"A Hard Days Night.\\"<br /><br />The 8 original songs are what make this album.  Uncharactaristically melancholy, almost all of the originals (excluding only \\"Eight Days a Week\\" and \\"Every Little Thing\\") are about the bad side of relationships.  The first three songs are goose-bump raisingly negative, and show a growing maturity in Lennon/McCartney's song-writing, both lyrically and musically.  The cluster of origianals at the end of the album are very musically interesting, showing a preview of the sound of their future releases of '65-'66.<br /><br />I think that the 8 originals on \\"Beatles for Sale\\" surpassed anything the Beatles had produced up to that point, and are even a little better than the music on \\"Help!\\" (\\"Help!\\" seems to be alot more commercial, due to it being written for the movie, but that's another story).  Unfortunately, the rush in which this album was recorded prevented it from being as good as it could have been.  Instead of a really solid knock-out album, we get a half-baked album, with 8 astounding original songs and 6 so-so covers.<br /><br />I recommend this album because it has some of the Beatle's best original tunes.  But don't expect a consistent album.
0452289963|5.0|This book is awesome.  I first came across Eckhart Tolle because he wrote the introduction of another book I purchased.  This book will give you a clear understanding of the ego, the habits of the mind that get us caught in routines that are the cause of much suffering, and this book will help you examine yourself.  This book is easy to read, very easy to understand, and you will be saying \\"yes, yes, yes, how true\\" as you read it!  This book is simple, beautiful Truth.  I think people often buy spiritual books because they are looking for something dramatic and earth-moving, or they are looking for something they consider to be profound, etc.  But this book is Truth....Truth that is already here.  Truth is simple and it is here....you simply have to awaken to it and see it.  This is a must read!!
B000UJ48U4|5.0|This is truly a movie that you don't forget after it has finished.  It gets in your head and stays there which is one of the reason that so many people admire the film even though it had its fair share of detractors when it first came out.     Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films and is one of the few films that I can watch over and over again and still find it fresh and exciting.  Visually, it is one of the most beautiful films you will ever.  Kubrick's technical brilliance with color schemes, sets and camera work is in full effect here.  Much of this film looks like a beautiful old photograph or a painting rather than a film.     Some people don't like the film because of the slow pacing.  Personally, I prefer films which build a dreamlike state in which tension is increased steadily throughout but that is my preference.  If you don't have an affinity for these types of movies then you might have been turned off by the intentially slow pace of the film, a pace which is reflected not only in how the film is shot but how the characters speak their lines.    Eyes Wide Shut is a great film that becomes richer and more enveloping with each viewing. It requires patience, demands attention, and allows one to think about its characters and the subtle nuances in their dialogue exchanges in the context of its theme about the possibility of marital infidelity in a fragile marriage. Some have seen it once and hated it only to gradually admire it on second viewing. Do yourself a favor: in this mindless time of mediocre films, check out Kubrick's last film \\"Eyes Wide Shut.\\" If you hated it or disliked it the first time, you may find yourself at least admiring, on second viewing, the world Kubrick has created on screen and how he fashions this world before our eyes, as he has with all of his films. Keep those eyes wide open.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|This film has magnificent costumes and sets, but the DVD transfer looks substandard to me (regular DVD).  Much of the film looks grainy - certain scenes have a yellowish tint to them - other scenes look faded.  WHAT is wrong?  Universal needs to establish better quality control!  There is no excuse for a major new film release on DVD looking this mediocre.  The last DVD I watched that looked this bad was the first release of \\"The Last Emperor\\".
0756404746|5.0|It's like Harry Potter, but without any of the flaws.  It's beautifully written and makes HP look like Eragon by comparison.  The story is totally believable - no ex machina BS here.    This book is a masterpiece.  You must read it.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|These boys hit a home run with Leviathan, and they come back to answer that with this eminent piece of work.  Outstanding.  Calling this band heavy alone would not be doing them justice.  There is a lot of depth here, and like Leviathan, there is nary a dud on the entire album.  If you have never heard of Mastodon, Leviathan is a great place to start, but remember that Blood Mountain is equally good.  You may want both for your collection.

And to think that one of the main characters is a \\"perfectly ordinary, if somewhat large\\" piece of luggage hahahahhahahaha thumbs up for this book, and congratulations to the author.
B0015D3YQI|5.0|Dario Argento is famous for his hitchcockian tributes, such as; Deep Red, Tenebrae, and Suspiria, but with Phenomena he changes his formula into something quite daring. When you watch an Argento film you can expect two things, creative deaths and a killer you never expected. With this film however there is a killer, but it is complicated with supernatural elements weaving in and out of the picture. I do not want to give away any plot spoilers on this film so I will skip the plot. I will tell you that this is one of the most enjoyable of his films, possibly in my opinion his last great film. Check it out!

0385340990|5.0|I saw a review for this book (actually more like a casual mention of it) in the NYT.  It sounded intriguing.  I tend to like historical fiction and this one promised a look at an aspect of WWII I didn't know about.  I was surprised at how quickly it grabbed me and how compelling I found it.  I read it quickly - not straight through, but pretty close.  The approach - the reader learning the story through letters among a number of people -  was entertaining and at times heart-wrenching.  It gave insight into the characters that a straight narrative would probably not have provided.  I loved it.
0618918248|3.0|This book seems to me an attempt to provide street cred for atheists. Dawkins already has that for me, because he was a friend of Doug Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide). So why three stars? Because readers may (wrongly) assume the reviewer agrees with a book if he gives it five stars. I don't agree with this book, but I yet enjoy Dawson's writing (and that of Christopher Hitchens) which, to my mind, is far clearer and more readable than that of say, Daniel Dennett.<br /><br />That said, I don't see any new ground here. It's as if, as Chesterton said, any stick was good enough to beat Christianity with. But Chesterton said that about a century ago. Wasn't this already in Why I'm Not a Christian by Bertrand Russell? Does anyone think that debating St. Thomas Aquinas proves something? Has anyone even read Aquinas? Most of the arguments in this book were stated by H. G. Wells in The Outline of History, and answered by Chesterton in The Everlasting Man. I am not so naive to think that any self-proclaimed atheist (sic) would actually go read Chesterton or other authors to see the other side of the debate, if you can call it that, but I also find it difficult to believe they think there is no other side.<br /><br />Dawkins sets himself an impossible task, but he goes about it with style and wit. That is to say, the topic is either too big or too slippery to deal with in this way. What Dawkins does instead is what Aquinas does: he considers an objection, then answers it. (Anyone with the slightest interest in Aquinas is referred to The Shorter Summa by Peter Kreeft, which summarizes Aquinas' seminal points in about an hour of reading.)<br /><br />Dawkins makes the convincing observation that we are all atheists as regards the pantheon of gods throughout history; why not drop one more? My question would be what one are we dropping? More than that, what do we mean by religion? Usually, in this book, this means Christianity, whatever than means, except when that religion doesn't furnish any handy examples. Then the examples are drawn from Islam or some other religion (only the more radical versions) and generalized backwards to include Christianity. Never mind that this wouldn't fly in a debate. It's not a debate, Dawkins would insist, except of course, when he's debating Aquinas.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis, who seems to be the only British non-atheist that Brits can name, Dawkins doesn't debate. Instead, he accuses Lewis of not playing the game when he says he used to be an atheist. Of course, it's all good if someone says they used to be a believer, and are now enlightened as an atheist. St. Thomas, incidentally, begins the Summa with something like: \\"Is there a God? Apparently not,\\" and his definition for God is \\"that which no greater than can be imagined.\\" \\"Belief\\" doesn't refer to belief in just anything, and faith isn't faith in faith.<br /><br />My problem isn't so much with this book, as with the way the whole debate is cast. \\"Believing in God\\" has almost nothing to do with the Bible, which begins in a different place. The Bible begins with historical events and people's reactions to them. The New Testament begins with a figure who, as Lewis says, we may shut up as a madman, cast out as a devil, or fall at the feet of, but whom one cannot consider simply a \\"good man,\\" since he claimed to be God. Christianity is entirely about coming to grips with and considering the events of history, not a philosophical argument for the existence of God. That said, we may be grateful for Dawkins' critiques of the human side of religion. Let us welcome his thoughtful pondering as a voice for reform, and take his remarks in the generous way he intends.<br /><br />Finally, Dawkins' book is the best argument against itself. He writes with passion about life and a universe which, if he's right, has no meaning. A believer would say that Dawkins' nimble mind and passionate soul are themselves the best argument against macro-evolution, and that his creativity and concern reflect the passion of the Creator.

B000YABIQ6|4.0|After hearing good things about the show I bought the DVD. It's fantastic. The DVD set itself has the usual mini-docos. Fashionistas out there would love the feature about costumes and the audio commentary given by Janie Bryant. John Slattery and Jon Hamm team up for some commentary and it's hilarious. However, I'm giving 4-stars since I'm not a fan of the packaging. The DVD set comes with this plastic sleeve that's suppose to hold it together but it can be a pain to get it to work.

Well, it would be if you had the humility to follow advice.  However, if you are trying to raise three kids on a government mid-manager's $40,000 a year and would like to improve your plight, this author has little use for you.  I would be $10 closer to being a millionaire if I hadn't bought this book.  Hey - at least I did buy it used.

B000007638|4.0|A glorious time capsule of Wings at the height of their popularity in 1976, this one was a HUGE seller for the band, and no doubt the entire tour was a mindblower for Paul McCartney, who reached fame he couldn't imagine AFTER having been in a little band called THE BEATLES not too many years earlier. The tracks pulled for this set aren't all perfection...as some have pointed out, things like \\"Silly Love Songs\\" and \\"Listen To What the Man Said\\" are probably better off in their studio versions.     Nonetheless the versions here are eminently enjoyable in the context of the entire set, some of which harbors versions of McCartney/Wings faves that arguably transcend any others in existence. I can't listen to the studio version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" after hearing the live version. (Same as with some Peter Frampton tracks on \\"Comes Alive\\" and Elton tracks on \\"Here and There,\\" oddly enough both issued the same year as WOA...1976 - good year for live records, I guess.)    The album's got some wonderful highlights: \\"Yesterday\\" is one that never wears out its welcome, and you can hear a pin drop in the hall when Paul sings it. \\"Rockshow\\" is an inspired reading of the \\"Venus and Mars\\" track, \\"Live and Let Die\\" is a stunner and even \\"Richard Cory\\" is an odd, but interesting bit of cover material, perhaps the only live recording of the obscure Paul Simon song.    Anyway, the only thing I'd like to hear is a big old remix of the entire album, since the dynamics are a bit limited by the original mixes and mastering. Many live albums (Kansas' \\"Two For the Show\\" and the aforementioned \\"Here and There\\" and \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\") have been very successfully remixed and yielded spectacular results and this is another landmark live album that deserves (and actually screams out for) special remixing treatment. Let's hope we get something from Paul that becomes the definitive audio version of what is still, and probably will always be, a permanent document of a truly great rock and roll band that will never pass this way again.

B0013FNC38|2.0|I had to laugh when I read the review that compared Mraz to McCartney. While there are a few good tracks on this album, it is so over-produced that I had a hard time listening to it.  Mraz is good unplugged, and songs like \\"Love for a Child\\" are great until the full orchestra kicks in, and all the violins take over.  About half the way through every song, his voice is lost and you only hear triangles, strings, and more strings.  For those of you looking for a piece of what you hear on t.v., just purchase the single.

One often sees lists of best this and best that, and topping any list of Most Poignant Moments On Film must surely be the scene from Wall-E, where he watches his battered, treasured tape of Hello Dolly, and clasps his 'hands' together - pure movie magic! I see that Hello Dolly is very high on Amazon's list of bestsellers - thank you, Wall-E for inspiring a new appreciation of Dolly, and when you win the Oscar at the next awards, Dolly will join in your celebration!

Never fail to be amazed at how Willie can change his vocal styles for different versions of the same song.  This CD is no exception.  Nice listening plus the bonus of the outstanding jazz musicians that perform with him.  Wynton Marsalis is a magician and he has some great back-up help to compliment Willie.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I like this version of Batman because it is how I think Batman should be. After his parents being shot, Bruce Wayne was lost and angry. To spend his time and money to wear the bat suit and learn to fight, he was NOT in it for the glory of being a Superhero like other Batman movies tell it. He wanted to punish criminals and maybe even kill them which the movie touch base on between revenge vs. compassion.     I have opened my eyes on Chris Nolan since Momento. But with this Batman series, he will be the writer/director to watch. I think he is thoughtful writer which seems rare in movies these days.

0316067601|4.0|I am one of many who think this story is an amazing story and worth reading.    All these men are heroes and I think anyone will find this story truly inspiring.      The only thing I didn't like about the book was the excessive cussing and political statements.  However it is Marcus' story and he can tell it however he wants.  God bless him, I'm glad I got to read it.
0743496736|3.0|I really enjoyed thiss book up until the very end.  I feel that that author was trying to go for a surprise ending, but failed.  The ending just didn't come together for me.  There wasn't enough closure.  That is a matter of opinion though, and other readers may feel differently.  I have noticed this pattern before with Jodi's Picoult's books, but I still continue to read them because all in all her books are very enjoyable and each one is very unique from the others.
B000BSNPRG|1.0|Unfortunately, I didn't get to watch the DVD because I didn't notice that it was in the PAL format before I ordered it, so I had to return the product. I understand, though, that Within Temptation will be releasing a concert on Blu-ray sometime soon, so I hope to get that one when it is released.    There wasn't an option for N/A on the star rating.
B0019X3YXM|5.0|I've read review after review comparing it to the original, well, I haven't seen the original, so those reviews mean nothing to me.    What I can say is that we almost turned the movie off, finding it quirky and weird, not seeming to make sense in the beginning.      By the end we were touched, the characters and the story brought us to tears!  I am going back to watch it again...and believe me...I don't do that with many romantic comedies.    Well acted, well done.  Pick it up, watch it and love it!
B0013J30W2|4.0|Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is an accounts manager with no excitement in his life.  He doesn't seem to even like himself too much.  Then, one day he meets Fox (Jolie), and his world is turned upside down.  Fox is a member of a thousands-year old secret society of assassins.  Wesley's father was also a member, with a lot of talent when it comes to killing people.  Wesley believed his dad to be dead for years, but it turns out he was just murdered by Cross (Kretschmann), and the fraternity wants Wesley's help in delivering justice.  Soon, Wesley discovers that he has special skills like his father, and is learning the ways of the fraternity.  But all is not as it seems, and Wesley may be in deeper than he realizes.<br /><br />\\"Wanted\\" is an interesting action film.  It is reminiscent of both \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Fight Club\\", but resembles neither.  It is full of interesting, logic-suspending fight/assassination scenes that are visually impressive to watch.  McAvoy brings life to Wesley and makes him someone that the viewer can relate to.  The storyline is different enough and interesting to make it an above average action film.  The supporting cast gets the job done as well.  Can Morgan Freeman do any wrong?  Overall, \\"Wanted\\" delivers a pretty intense 110 minutes, and is not a mindless summer action movie.  This is worth checking out.

0789318121|5.0|This book was worth the money spent on it. It even included the entire script of the movie after all the pictures and other collectible information.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This is a very good movie depicting a great story.  The only flaw in what would have been an otherwise great movie is its overuse of the flashback technique to the point of being somewhat confusing and disjointed.  But, that is a very minor flaw easily overshadowed by great drama, romance, mystery, suspense, and tragedy. The storyline remains intact and continues to convincingly fall into place as the movie progresses.  Big Pharma's use of the desperately poor of Africa as expendable medical guinea pigs, whose poverty and living conditions are stunningly and accurately portrayed in the movie, serves as a backdrop to the mystery that gradually unfolds before the viewer.  A real tearjerker that is ultimately about what constitutes a genuinely good person.
B001AHM2C6|3.0|After watching the film the first time, I got my hands on the score and after having heard it on its own two feet, I was kind of disappointed. The first track on the soundtrack, \\"Why So Serious?\\" is without a doubt, the best track of them all. It brings you back to those first ten minutes of the film, where the Joker is introduced in what could arguably be one of the most memorable opening scenes ever filmed. But from there on, the score becomes little more than repetitive. There are some good pieces, namely \\"A Dark Knight\\" and \\"Harvey Two-Face\\" but this score doesn't really stand up to a solo listen and sounds like the same thing over and over. I think Zimmer and Howard's work on Batman Begins was a little better than this or at least easier to listen to on its own merits.<br /><br />Now this isn't to say that the music is bad. When watching the film with the score in place, the film and music work together perfectly. On its own though, it comes off as a bit dull.

At one time, I also carried my holga too.  Highly recommended.
0765356139|5.0|I stayed up far too late finishing this one. Adventure, spectacle, suspense, twists, humor, mystery, gruesome monsters, and something else which makes it more than just another epic fantasy--there's love and there are real characters struggling to do good despite themselves.     I really enjoyed this book.

0790729342|5.0|This is THE template for the post-apocalyptic action film. Came out the same year as Blade Runner and both movies hold up to scrutiny and still amaze some 25 years later. You would not believe the flood of imitators that followed its release in the early eighties and it still continues to inform the look of the dirty, raw sci-fi genre (Doomsday, anyone?) I liked the original okay, but ROAD WARRIOR (which you don't need to see MAD MAX first to follow, you newbies) distilled the essence and multiplied it times 10. George Miller, the genius behind this flick, struck gold with this combination, then preceded to bungle it with MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME, which was probably the second most-anticipated yet then most disappointing film upon its release in my pre-teen universe... The first being RETURN OF THE JEDI.

B001AR0D4A|5.0|Any bad reviews written about this movie is written under lack of intellegence and understanding. This movie was crafted just as well as Shawshank and Green Mile and the performance were equal. The problem people have with tis movie is internal. Steven King himself has declared this movie to be amazing. The book had no ending. Steven King said he couldn't think of one. Frank and Steven got together and worked long and hard on what the ending could be. They both decide that this was the only way. Steven King also stated that he would have ending the book the same way if the idea had come to him.    I love this movie. It is not a horror movie. It's more of a suspense drama. The situations (if real) were perfectly illistrated. I enjoyed every minute of it. If you haven't seen this movie you need to. I suggest watching first before you buy it because it is not a happy movie and I know that some people with strong opinions that don't care for things that might be different than their own point of view might not like it. But it is a masterpiece.    Don't take anyone's word for it, just watch it.
0446691437|4.0|If you are already a motivated person, there is no reason to read this book. If you have trouble dealing with procrastination, this book will definitely help you out! The author pinpoints exactly what keeps creative people from being creative and inspires you to tackle any obstacle in your way.

People who are already hard at work will not find any new ideas that they didn't already know.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|This is probably the best family film I have seen in years. I saw it during it's opening week, and I absolutely loved it. The movie has a good story with likeable characters, and has a lot of solid family values that I felt set it apeart from typical \\"flash and bang\\" movies.<br /><br />However, that's not to say that the movie does not have lighting fast action scenes and some of the most creative visuals that I have ever seen in a movie. After you see this film, watching NASCAR will look like watching a turtle race. If you need a description, think of Star Wars Episode 1's pod race scene, but with the speed dial cranked up from 5 to 10, and mixed with the video game \\"F-Zero.\\" Yes, I did compare an aspect of this movie to a video game, but I mean that in the most positive way it can be said.<br /><br />Overall, this is a love it or hate it movie: if you love it, you will see all the great things the movie has to offer, but if you hate it, you'll just say: \\"this looks like a cartoon\\" and move on. The thing is though, that the movie IS a live action cartoon in the truest sense of the word, and the fact that the Wachowsky brothers were brave enough to take a risk and make it is commendable. I just wish that they had been rewarded for it, instead of being chastised by pop culture over the film's poor box office take.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|This movie is great because it can be watched repeatedly, and each time the viewer will learn something new! It has an excellent dark mood, and it is fascinating how the filmmakers updated the film noir genre to a modern day high school. I loved the way the characters talked in this film. It is almost like a poem, which admittedly may take some time to get used to. I recommend watching this movie once without subtitles to focus on the action and once with subtitles to uncover all the secret, twisting dialogue. This movie will leave you with a lot to ponder for a week or two!

B0018CWEYY|5.0|I hesitated before writing this review because there are only two types of people in this world: those that love LOST and those that hate it.<br /><br />Fans of the show (who collectively refer to themselves by the unimaginative moniker 'losties') will not need to read any review to know that this box set will eventually be nestled between the green box for season three and the mystery color box for season five. (As with all things LOST, the potential color of the season five box set is fiercely debated, although there is a general consensus that dinosaurs will be involved.)<br /><br />On the other hand, the 'Lost haters', as they are affectionately called, will berate anyone who deigns to spend 40 dollars and untold hours on a Television show that, in their opinion, is worthless tripe. However, these people will still devote several hours of their time to writing reviews about how bad LOST is and how everyone who likes it should be tortured and imprisoned.<br /><br />So, this review is not for those two groups, both of whom made their final decision 4 seasons ago, somewhere around the time the plane crashed on the island. No, this review is for the tiny minority of you who have not been exposed to the LOST phenomenon and have yet to form an opinion you will soon be forced to defend bitterly, and sometimes with violence. You are, in a way, the all important swing voters in a deeply polarized intellectual battle.<br /><br />The forth season of LOST promised a faster pace and more answers than previous seasons, and for the most part it kept that promise. Of course, the events of season 4 created more new mysteries than were put to rest, and ensured that no one could possibly predict where the series was heading.<br /><br />For fans there were enough jaw dropping moments and gratifying resolutions to make this an instant five-star rating. For haters there may be enough answers to bring a few back into the warm embrace of the losties.<br /><br />For the uninitiated: Call in sick for a week and buy enough canned food and bottled water so you don't have to leave your house for 6 days. Buy seasons 1-3 and watch every episode, every disc, back-to-back, only pausing to eat and use the restroom. Do not try to sleep.<br /><br />On day 5 collapse in bed and sleep for 48 hours.

031606792X|5.0|I have just finished the fourth and final book and I loved the book.  It was the perfect ending novel for the series in my opinion.  Now I am heartbroken and sorry that the story is over!  It has been awhile since I have been so taken with a series, not since Diana Gabaldon's Outlander saga have I been so enthralled with a story.  I can only hope that Ms Meyer will continue to share stories of these characters in future novels.  Maybe one centering on the Quillette werewolves and the Jacob/Reneesme story...
B000W9DTG6|4.0|I didn't give this product 5 stars only because the extras weren't all that great, and that is important to many DVD consumers.  Ocean's Eleven has some  pretty good special features, including actor commentaries, movie documentaries, PC features, and more. Ocean's Twelve has no special features other than it's own movie trailer.  Ocean's Thirteen has a few additional scenes, and a couple casino video extras.  So, it you are a person who is looking to by this set because of special features and extras, I would look for something different.  However, I still gave this product 4 stars because I, personally, was not looking for special features, I just wanted to own all three movies in an attractive boxed set.  So, if you are just looking to own these movies because you love them, then buy this set.  If you are looking to own these movies because you haven't seen them, but heard they were good, then definitely buy this set.
B00140PK6O|5.0|If they keep making movies like this, I will keep buying them.     If you like period English dramas, you won't be disappointed with Cranford. There's a little more comedy thrown in there, than other movies like this - I laughed out loud a few times. The movie is long, but the plot keeps you engaged throughout. In the special features section of the DVD, the makers of the film indicated they had enough material to make another Cranford film. I really hope they do. This movie left me hungry for more!

B001DHXT20|5.0|The second film to be produced directly by Marvel seems eager to prove why comic book companies should exercise direct control over their films. Rather than being nothing more than a new director's take on an old classic, The Incredible Hulk is both an engaging film and a love letter to every other incarnation of the The Hulk that proceeded it. This film truly endeavors to understand and assimilate the entire history of the character into one new project, and boy does it succeed.<br /><br />At the center of The Incredible Hulk is an ambitious attempt to marry the two most popular and conflicting visions of the character. The film borrows many elements from the fondly remembered 1970s television series but also incorporates many of the more important elements from the comic book. It's a tough balancing act, but the film makes the disparate elements mix together in a way that makes complete sense and (I believe), leaves fans of both series feeling satisfied. The origin and characterization come largely from the TV series (though, thankfully, it's Dr. BRUCE Banner this time), but the more memorable supporting characters and conflicts from the comic are worked in as well (though Rick Jones was quite fortunately forgotten). Additionally, the enemy is a highly logical choice from the comic book series. Finally, the bad memories of a mutated Nick Nolte are beginning to subside.<br /><br />The film also incorporates minor elements from the TV movies, the previous film (which is neither acknowledged nor completely contradicted), and even the previous Hulk video game. Of course there are also many wonderful nods to fans of each of the Hulk incarnations. The flashing danger light, the appearance of student reporter \\"Jack McGee,\\" and Stan Lee's cameo proved to be my personal favorites. Lou Ferrigno also receives a far better cameo than in the previous film.<br /><br />Most importantly, whether you have any interest in previous Hulk incarnations or not, this film is exceptionally well plotted. It resists the urge to shine the light fully on Hulk or Dr. Banner, instead carefully developing the two in unison. Dr. Banner (masterfully played by Ed Norton, who actually outshines Bill Bixby) gets farther than his television counterpart was ever allowed, and that experience necessarily changes him. The transformation is satisfying, yet still allows the franchise to return to familiar territory by the end.<br /><br />In parallel, the monster also receives his share of development, though this isn't made clear until the end. His final scene cements this film's brilliant unison of television series and comic book, leaving no doubt that this is the most impressive project ever to come out of the Hulk franchise. I was left so excited, so convinced for the first time that the character had truly come to life, that I almost expected Doctor Strange and the Defenders to show up in the next moment. For only the third time in all my movie going experiences, a beloved comic book character actually seemed real (or at least possible), even in spite of the sometimes questionable computer animation.<br /><br />Finally, true Marvel fans will be amazed to see just how much continuity this two hour film packs. Clear and meaningful ties are made to Captain America, Iron Man, and S.H.I.E.L.D., and just you wait for the film's final scene! While DC is still trying to decide who should play Superman and Batman for their Justice League movie, you can rest assured that Marvel is getting ready to tie their films together in a meaningful and impressive way. The Marvel Universe has truly made the move into Hollywood and, with The Incredible Hulk as a shining example, it's safe to believe that they've just begun delivering everything a humble fan boy could ever hope for.y well plotted.

0425166805|2.0|When I saw a very old copy of this in the dollar bin at the library book sale, I snapped it up. What a hoot! This is the book that spawned a zillion sci-fi books and Coast-to-Coast AM shows.<br /><br />His theory that extraterrestrials visited ancient Earth is very interesting. It would have been much more compelling if he hadn't felt the need to drag in Project Bluebook and Edgar Cayce. His projections for the future of Earth and NASA are really funny forty years later. I can't tell you how many times I laughed and had to read passages out loud to my husband.<br /><br />I can live with the fuzzy logic and faulty reasoning. What I cannot abide is Daniken's unwavering assertion that ancient peoples were all knuckle-dragging troglodytes. Time after time he insists that ancient people could not possibly have the knowledge or intelligence to make any of the objects that have been found by archaeologists. I could go into a long rant, but the bottom line is this: We are not descended from idiots.
B0000024YL|5.0|We bought this album last century and it is still in a big box of 60's and 70's vinyl LP's somewhere in the house. Having just travelled the length of the New Jersey Turnpike I had to have this as a souvenir. I had forgotten just how brilliant Simon and Garfunkel were-and are! This is a classic compilation, which I play several times a day. My favourite of all time is \\"America\\", or is it \\"Cecelia\\"? \\"Or Bridge over Troubled Water\\"? Just magic music.

1400082773|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a client, more out of curiosity than anything, and wow!  I was pleasantly surprised to find this amazing and very moving book, written with such eloquence, so heartfelt and quintessentially AMERICAN.  What makes this book even more poignant and relevant is that is that it was not an election-year hack-job designed to win votes, but it was written more than a decade ago, at a time when no one could have imagined that this man would be the Democratic nominee for President in 2008.  This is a man I would (will?!) be proud to call Mr. President.  Political leanings aside, this is just a  great read.  Highly recommended.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|This is one of very first full length anime movies i ever saw, and it left a big impression on me. I recently watched it again and thought it would be fun to make a review on here for it.<br /><br /> The story is interesting, and contains some political intrigue, where there are some twists as to who works for who and who IS who. So it makes you think a little bit.<br /><br /> The characters are intersting as well, from Jubei, the central hero, and the old man he meets, too the 8 devils which are confronted with, all having their own fantastic skills and techniques, each using their unique power to try and stop Jubei, a kind of mercenary ninja that isnt exactly all about the money.<br /><br /> Even though the film is over 15 years old, its some of the very best animation i have ever seen in an animated movie. I think it looks even better than a lot of the newer anime films out now that mix A LOT of CGI in the drawing, sense all drawing is practically done totally with the computer now for nearly all films in anime, with the exception of some.<br /> The attention to detail is impressive, and how it flows so well, its just beautiful. This is a true piece of animation. A classic.<br /><br /> Now, i was introduced to the English voice dubbing version of the movie, and always loved the voice actors in this movie. But after viewing it recently ,i noticed how out of place some of the language used was, especially for a film based in feudal japan, between the 12th and 19th century. Expressions like \\"...piss off! \\" , for example, though humorous, just isnt the correct terms in this era.<br /><br />And that is like my biggest dislike, is the dialog used for the english dubbing. Even though i like their voices and their personalities are likable...it just comes across as bit silly and ridiculous, citing that as the films weakness. BUT, fortunatly, this DVD is bilingual, coming with the ORIGINAL JAPANESE LANGUAGE DUB (with english subtitles)<br /><br />Trust me, the English dub is fun, but the orginal japanese dub with english subtitles is superior. I could take the film more seriously now, and in turn it made the whole experience a lot better. It was like almost watching a entirely new movie. And i usually prefer English Dub over Subs, so i never thought id prefer subs instead.<br /><br />If the english dub was the actual way the original voice cast and script went, i would of gave this movie 4 stars for the 1990's styled american street talking dialog. And though it isnt that painfully bad lol, its still a weak dubbing, in terms of historically correct speech for that time. I wouldnt of been suprised to hear someone in the movie say \\"blow me\\" or \\"how bout a nuckle sandwhich , wise guy!!!!!???\\" something retarded like that. Thankfully it isnt that bad. But again, the Subtitled version you can choose from with the orginal japanese voice actors is superior and makes this movie more timeless.<br /><br />The musical score in this film is great, with a marching main theme thats memorable. And also other parts of the films music is haunting and uses japanese instruments and traditional style. I liked it. Set the mood for something evil and that things werent what they seemed.<br /><br />The guy who put this film together by the way, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, was the one who brought us Wicked City. And we see similar touches of bizarre horror carried on into this film, the likes of which were in Wicked City. At times Ninja Scroll could very well be taken as a horror film, becouse of the intense depiction of various mutilation and bodily disfiguration and other violence, but it all paints a perfect picture of how it probubly would of been in feudal japan with demons walking the earth. Its quite a dark film, in that respect. But it also has a sense of humor, and even a bit of romance.<br /><br />All and all, its a classic anime film. And the dvd itself, though others pointed out issues with lack of a true widescreen (which sucks), the special edition version offers an interview with the english voice actors, Dean Elliot (who voiced Jubei) and Wendee Lee (who voices Kagero, the strong willed ninja girl)<br /><br />Plus theres a image gallery and even an interview with the director, Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Which is a real treat.<br /><br />The film itself , aside from the bonus features, is worth owning in itself, but the bonus features give this special edition some perks for the viewer. And now you can get this edition very cheap. So if you loved this film, id buy it. Just NEVER pay list price for it. Those days of 30 dollar anime films need to be over and done with.<br /><br />But ya, Ninja Scroll is a great classic, and thats why its one of my all time favorite anime movies.ed Jubei) and Wendee Lee (who voices Kagero, the strong willed ninja girl)    Plus theres a image gallery and even an interview with the director, Yoshiaki Kawajiri.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is the kind of movie where either you'll love it, or you'll hate it. I loved it. Not once was I bored, or looking at the clock. The Fall not only has captivating scenes, but it has a great story to tie it all together. All in all The Fall does what I expected it to do: It left me savoring the story.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This film gives excellent information that an untrained person can relate to in an everyday way.  Al Gore is wonderful.  He tells a story that gives one pause and then he gives you hope and an energized look at what can be done.  It's not all fire and brimstone, but this film gets serious on what matters most.  The film is a wonderful example of how one person can use their power and influence to do the right thing.  It also makes you wonder, deeply and sadly, what our world would look like right now had we gotten President Gore in office, as those of us who voted for him, the majority of America, wanted.  Woe is me.  The folly of the American people and their so called representation.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have been enjoying Catan with family and friends for a few years now. If you've ever played the original, you know that it is inevitable for the game board to shift during game play. The dice, a hand, a finger..something usually finds its way to the game board and hit the tiles.    The interlocking ocean pieces that go on the outside of the board and keep the game pieces in place is the highlight of this version. Besides the fact that the game board will never get ruined again, it makes the game look and feel more like a true game board.    The new artwork is O.K. Nothing that I or anyone I played with go to excited about. It's pretty easy to adjust to the new artwork on the octagons that represent the resources it provides.    This is a great buy for any Catan lover, I highly recommend this product.
B000IOM0WY|1.0|This is in regard to the Blu-ray version of this movie.  The film itself is quite enjoyable and worth watching.  I bought the BR edition of this a few days ago, the menus and all look good, no problems there.  The problem came in when I started watching the film itself...in the very first shot I could tell that something wasn't right.  The picture quality was grainy and awful, it was annoying.  I took it out and put in one of my other Blu-ray movies(thinking maybe my player was acting up) but it looked great.  I bought it new so I don't know why it would look like that.  Some parts (very few) looked the way they should, but mostly the picture was worse than most standard DVDs I've seen.  So, I give the Blu-ray version one star, the movie itself I give four stars.
B00138H0H4|5.0|I don't write many reviews here, and it's usually when I have a very good (or a very bad) experience with something that I'm stirred into motion.  In this case, Brandi Carlile's album The Story is a very very good experience, and I'll have to, if anything, try not to gush in this review.    The title track is now even gracing a recent car commercial, which will probably turn some people off, but will cause many more to wonder who this intriguing voice is and what else has she done.    Funny thing about that title track, \\"The Story\\". It's a great song -- melodic, catchy, sensitive, compelling. When it comes on, I'm driven to turn up the volume. Brandi sings it with palpable emotion and flair, even down to the primal crackling scream/growl she emits in the last runthrough of the chorus, as the song escalates and peaks.      What's the funny thing, then? Well, in my view, even though \\"The Story\\" is a great song, there are at least FOUR songs on the album that are even better.  \\"Cannonball\\", \\"Turpentine\\", and \\"Josephine\\" top it.  And the very final song on the album, a hidden track called \\"Hiding My Heart\\", sat in one-track-repeat mode on my player for an entire weekend. I couldn't get enough of it.    Going back and listening to Brandi's very fine first solo album, and then seeing how much better \\"The Story\\" is, it makes me wonder how she can sustain this level of quality, much less the growth.  Interestingly, many of the songs on The Story (which came out in 2007) were written years ago, some as far back as 2000.  What else does she have waiting to be captured?  I can't imagine, but you can bet I'll be the first in line.    Highly recommended.
B00008YJHC|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  Near every song flows in such a haunting manner that it is impossible not to be shaken.  I find myself near drooling during the outro parts of \\"The Happening\\" and \\"All Over The World.\\"  The pixies perfect this delicate art of taking an already short song halfway through and turning it into an acid trip.  If you are wasting your time reading this sentence, you are also delaying the biggest treat your ears will ever devour.
0307265730|4.0|This book is written in Indian 3D version. You are there in every scene and you can guess where they are going, so plain and captured so well. The style is unique and when you get deeper the characters come alive. The stories are precious and there is nothing short about them  Hema and Kaushik could end up on the wide screen and you know movie makers will eat it up like the Titanic- Begin with a Tsunami and the flashback.  I can hardly wait for the next work and of course the movie    Ravikrishnan

0679746323|3.0|I am not a student of Chinese history and knew little of the details of Mao's rule in China until reading this book. In fact, the reason I read the book at all was to learn a little something more than my general impressions derived from news reports during this period. With that said, my overall evaluation of the book is that it is a long ponderous volume that for the general reader is not worth the effort of slogging through over 600 page of dense text to learn some of the details of Mao's reign. I also have some skepticism of the large volume of supporting materials, which are used to source choice facts or quotes plucked from these items to support the authors' statements.     Despite the large effort necessary to get through it, the book serves a very basic need. I believe that even among sophisticated and educated people, little is known, especially in the United States, of the horrors of the Communist regimes of Stalin and Mao Tse Tung -- this in marked contrast to our knowledge of the Holocaust and Hitler's insanely evil mass murders. In recent years, however, some scholars (e.g., Robert Conquest) and popular writers (e.g., Martin Amis) have attempted to bring to the attention of general readers the atrocities and mass murders of Stalin and the Soviets. But as far as I know, there has been little corresponding effort with respect to Mao's atrocities, and this volume helps to fill that gap. Its greatest value thus lies in just setting forth the facts of Mao's mind-numbing atrocities. At the end of the book (p. 613), the authors write that \\"[w]ell over 70 million people had perished - in peacetime - as a result of his [Mao's] misrule.\\" This one statement just about says it all. What more does one need to know about a leader who systematically caused the deaths of over 70 million innocent souls! The remainder of the book gives the ghastly details, in particular the widespread famines that resulted from requisitions of agricultural products needed by the regime to generate foreign exchange to support a massive weapons program.      The parallels between the atrocities of Stalin and Mao are striking. The pervasive use of state terror to acquire and consolidate political power, grain requisitions that left a helpless populace to starve to death, a war against peasants (\\"Kulaks\\" in USSR) and intellectuals, collectivization of families into state worker barracks, and party purges -- all carried out in the name of a Communist doctrine that was supposed to free \\"the people\\" from the yoke of capitalism. The authors point out, however, that while Stalin's mass murders were largely committed by a professional terror agency (KGB & its predecessor organizations) and in secret prisons and slave labor camps away from the public eye, Mao's atrocities were often carried out by frenzied bands of marauding Communist thugs in staged public gatherings where the victims were \\"denounced\\" and abused and tortured before crowds of cheering citizens.      But the extent to which the entire Communist movement in China was controlled and financed by Stalin came as a surprise to me, especially the fawning and subservient role played by Mao. According to the authors, virtually every major decision and policy move made by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from the moment of its founding in the early 1920's until Mao's petulant attempts to show his independence in the 1950's was controlled by Moscow. I was not surprised to learn that the Soviets gave unqualified support to Mao after the Japanese were defeated in WWII while the US vacillated and hemmed and hawed in its support of Chiang.       I came away from the book with the feeling that I got only part of the story. For example, it is well known in America (neither of the authors is American, by the way) that the US \\"supported\\" Chiang Kai-Chek and his Nationalists in the fitful civil war that ravaged the country from the 1930's until Mao and the Communists drove Chiang to the island of Formosa in1949. My impression from other readings is that the US support role in the civil war, especially from 1945 to 1949, was substantial and that President Truman's uncertain and bungling efforts to broker a compromise between Chiang and Mao led to the Communists' victory. Yet there is little in this volume describing US policy in China in the 1940's and its effect on the outcome of the civil war. In addition, there is no mention of the internal struggles within the US Government -- for example, the role of Communist sympathizers like FDR's Vice President Henry Wallace and Asian specialist Professor Owen Lattimore in securing Mao's triumph over Chiang.      All in all, the flaws in the book balance its benefits. Most of the text consists of anecdotal stories of Mao's cruelty, his never-ending scheming, and his intimate involvement in state atrocities -- to establish that Mao was a very bad man on a personal level.  This theme is constantly embellished by reference to his personal traits and habits - for example, his four \\"marriages\\" and many children, for whom he had not the least regard, his elaborate security apparatus involving thousands  of personnel, his luxurious life style in mansions constructed to his personal taste in every city in the nation where he might visit, his enjoyment of the benefits of things (e.g., movies and books) denied to his own citizens, and his procurement of young girls for sex much like medieval European kings. Clearly, the authors establish that Mao was a loathsome individual on almost every level of human existence. As they point out, however, his legacy and reputation still dominate the Chinese government, and as we saw in the Beijing 2008 Olympics, his portrait still hangs proudly in Tiananmen Square.

B0007YMUZW|5.0|With Cold Roses, Ryan Adams equalled the beauty of Whiskeytown's 2nd album, the masterpiece Strangers Almanac. Some say he already did this with his solo debut, Heartbreaker, but as strong as that album was, I don't think it was quite as solid as Cold Roses, which - to my ears - only contains the very best of what Ryan Adams is capable of achieving as a songwriter and musician. No, there are no songs here to equal Come Pick Me Up or Why Do They Leave, but Cold Roses has a larger amount of truly excellent songs compared to Heartbreaker. The songs Magnolia Mountain, Meadowlake Street (one of Ryan's most beautiful ballads), Now That You're Gone, Cherry Lane, Mockingbird, Easy Plateau, Let It Ride, If I Am A Stranger, and Life Is Beautiful are my favorites - songs that draw on influences such as Neil Young, Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones, all filtered through Ryan Adams' personality.<br />Cold Roses is one of those rare albums that soon entered my all-time top 10 album list and is bound to stay there for as long as I live.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|i already owned this movie on regular dvd, but when i found out you get a sneak peak to the Dark Knight in high definition. then i had to buy it again on blu-ray. well worth it. this is the best looking blu-ray movie i have ever seen, the picture is amazing. the first 6 minutes of the Dark Knight was awesome. the special features are cool too, alot of behind the scenes stuff.   as far as the movie, great 5 star movie. the writing is great, very believable. of corse it follows bruce wayne before he becomes batman. his parents get killed he becomes obsesed with vengence. then it gets good. he comes back home to his riches, wayne manor, and wayne enterprise, where he finds a military weapons development department. and gets access to all his gadgets, and the Tumbler...oh yea the new Batmobile. then he battles the scare crow, and the Legion of Shadows. the movie ends seting up the Dark Knight.
1401207510|1.0|This is not a review of the actual Moore/O'Neil's newest enrty into the league series (see the Amazon listing of the standard edition for that) but rather of the Absolute Edition of the Black Dossier.  As has been said in the uniformilly negative reviews that have preceeded mine, this book is a not only a cheat to fans who have supported the series (and DC) this far but also a blatant (and continuing) bait and switch.  The first 2 Absolute League volumes included a hardcover of the series as well as a hardcover of the complete scripts with sketches throughout and where priced at $75.  This tima around the scripts have not been included and the price has been increased to $99.  Add to that, DC advertised, and still advertises, this book including a vinyl record that is not included.  The book is houses in a black slip case that is shipped in shrinkwrap, dispite this mine came with scuff marks on the back and sides.  It does include the 3-D glasses and Tijuana Bible but those are the only extras.  Don't let the DC site fool you, the cut-away of the Nautilus is simply a double page spread within the book, not a pull out or fold out.  I bought this as I have the other 2 League volumes and Amazon offered a heafty discount for pre-orders.  Its no wonder Moore has jumped ship to Top Shelf as its clear that DC has as little respect for its customers/fans as it does its artists.  See Top Shelf fantastic 3-volume slip cased edition of Moores Lost Girls for an example of how good an oversized hardcover comics collection can be.  Or, for that matter just look at their previous Absolute League books to see what they where capable of when they still put a litte effort into it.  This is a rush job aimed at getting every last cent out of their remaining Alan Moore work.

B001CD6FKS|5.0|The racing scenes were bleeding spectacular.  I mean \\"spectacular\\" in a way that has never even been imagined.   Honestly, it deserves an Oscar nod just for art design.  What's so ingenious about the opening sequence is that it not only sets up all the characters with entertaining and emotional efficiency, but it also establishes how the cars work in this fantasy world.  So despite the races being faster than anything you're ever likely to see, the main action beats are always delivered with a clarity and a style that will keep you thrilled beyond belief.  Each race is perfectly crafted with the stakes and the challenges rising further and further with each successive scene...until we reach a final showdown that leaves you utterly breathless.  Literally.  And the \\"visual vocabulary\\" of the film is truly innovative.  It's like the camera is no object.  As an audience member, you've never felt freer.  Unlike the stylistic approach of the recent 'Star Wars' prequels, which generally used locked off cameras and relatively tame tracking shots, 'Speed Racer' ducks into, under and around the action in a way that opens up the medium like no other film before it.  Compared to other film in its greenscreen sub-genre, this leaves movies like 'Sin City' and '300' looking rather timid by comparison.    But at the heart of it, this is really a film about fathers and their sons.  A coming of age story about hope, expectation, and the pain of loss.  I found myself with a lump in my throat while watching the movie.  Wait, let me rephrase.  I found myself with a lump in my throat within ten minutes of the film starting.  Emile Hirsch, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Matthew Fox and Scott Porter as the young Rex Racer all provide intimate and genuinely moving performances.  Make no mistake about it, this film is the definition of joviality on celluloid.  But the story is basically driven by the shadow of a lost family member from the very first scene in the film, and that's what reallymakes the film worth watching.  As well as being immersed in a fantasy world of drop dead gorgeous visuals, of course.    In the same way that 'Sin City' was an exaggerated, impressionistic noir, and just as '300' was an exaggerated, impressionistic war movie, 'Speed Racer' plays as an exaggerated, expressionistic 1960s kid's show.  Which is exactly what it is.  It's campy.  It's fun,  And it's full of humour and heart.  Of course, brooding characters and over-the-top gore is easier to sell than camp, colourful fun, but allowing oneself to become absorbed in the film's style makes for a rewarding experience.  I've heard complaints about the film's exposition, but the only scene where I could perhaps understand that criticism was about half way through when Taejo's family troubles were being told.  But even that zipped by very quickly and the audience still understands exactly what was at stake in the upcoming race.  So if it is a flaw, it's a minor one at best.    The characters are warm and lovable, the villains are wonderfully hissable, the actors' performances are all suitably camp, and the morality tale at the center of it - the battle of family versus corporatism - gives the story a real spirit.  And makes the races all that more enthralling to watch.  It's infectiously charming, and even at 129 minutes the film glides like a T-180 on ice.  I was convinced I was only in there for about thirty minutes, and when it finished I was left gagging for more.    So what's the verdict?  While the story wasn't exactly the peak of literary greatness, it was very well told.  Despite its two hour plus running time, the narrative was sharp, the emotionality was touching, and the plot turns were genuinely exciting.  If the film was not such a special effects extravaganza, it would probably have been given a 4 star rating.  But the film DOES have incredible special effects.  And it DOES offer an absolutely sublime spectacle.  Not only that, but the Wachowskis seem to have yet again set another industry standard - one that will likely be copied and mimicked for years to come.  Until the Brothers reinvent the wheel for a fourth time, that is.  And as such, the rating for this film is for something that could easily end up becoming highly influential classic.    Bring on 'Speed Racer 2'!
0446679089|3.0|I quite enjoyed this novel but I think parts of it are going to keep coming back to bug me as I think about it more.  John Corey is a riot, I really had fun reading his wisecracks but by the end they were coming a little too hot and fast to make it believable.<br /><br />I think I was expecting more from it, this is in line with Michael Palmer and other thriller writers.  If you enjoy them, I think you will enjoy this.<br /><br />My only real problem with this book is the character development, there really isn't any. With the exception of John Corey and Emma Whitestone you never do figure much out about anybody.  Ted Nash, the \\"USDA\\" representative on the trip to Plum Island drops completely off the map after being introduced as a major player in the story along with the FBI agent (Foster?).<br /><br />I'm glad I read it, I'll probably read mor DeMille novels but I won't expect all that much from them in the future.
1878424777|5.0|I had heard about this book a long time ago through a friend and teacher of metaphysics but only now I am mature enough and free from some of my own baggage to allow me to grasp the concepts in this book. Don Miguel is short and sweet. With precise and non-judgemental words, I felt as though he was talking directly to me, about my own relationship with myself.    The book is structured around Four Agreements that we make with ourselves. Within these agreements are clues to how we sometimes tend to dishonor ourselves just to please other people. He says nobody abuses us more than we abuse ourselves and explains self-talk, or what I call self-sabottage -- how we doubt ourselves and feed our brains with negativity and limiting beliefs.     THE FOUR AGREEMENTS:    BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD -- Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.    DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY -- Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.    DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS -- Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.    ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST -- Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.    I really enjoyed this book and listening to the CD was fun as I could carry on with my daily tasks and take in the wisdom at the same time.      This book is written with love and honesty and it demonstrates Don Miguel's care and sincerity towards people. It reminded me that I am a higher consciousness living in human form and that being human sometimes means making poor choices. But with self-awareness I am able to transmute some of these choices into life lessons and therefore, free myself from limiting and self-destructive beliefs.     If you are ready to be honest with yourself, look at your own stuff and make changes to how you operate in life, I really recommend you take a look at this book.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I went ahead and bought this album online after only hearing the single \\"Mercy\\" (which is actually starting to drive me nuts after hearing it so many times in commercials, etc) and was really pleasantly surprised at how good of an album it turned out to be. The rest of the songs are more mellow than the first single, but I liked it anyways, as it wasn't as \\"poppy\\" sounding. I also bought the Leona Lewis album at the same time, impressed by her performance at the closing ceremonies at the Olympics and found I liked this album a lot better than the Leona Lewis one. Overall a good buy and listen.

But it has some of the best eye-popping 3D effects I have ever seen. The story doesn't bare too much scrutiny -- stories of this type never do -- and you'll enjoy it more.  Okay, never mind what a T-Rex is doing on a barren plain at the center of the earth, it still makes for a really wild chase.

0553582461|5.0|No spoilers....    I finished Fool's Fate 3 days ago and had to sit and digest for a while before writing a review.  This is the final installment of the Farseer/Liveship Traders/Tawny Man trilogies which take place in the Six Duchies (except for the Liveship trilogy which occurs to the south in Bingtown/Jamaillia but in the same \\"world\\").      There is some overlap in characters and events in the Liveship Traders trilogy and the Tawny Man trilogy which becomes evident in Golden Fool (Book 2 of Tawny Man).  Therefore, I would recommend reading the 9 novels in order but you could probably get away with skipping the Liveship Traders trilogy.  At a minimum, you need to read the Farseer trilogy (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin and Assassin's Quest) before embarking on the Tawny Man trilogy.    Fool's Fate, in my humble opinion, is the best of the nine finely-written novels in the series.  This book was simply a treat.  Robin Hobb writes complex, flawed characters so there is no Superman-esque hero conquering all.  However, this makes the series all the richer.     Some reviewers have noted their dislike for the ending of this book.  I think this is simply a matter of taste.  I thought the ending was perfect and consistent with the characters' desires and motives throughout the series.  I think the criticism may lie with the 100 page denouement at the end of Fool's Fate which I loved because I thought it wrapped up several loose ends.  Some readers disagree.  However, you should not let that mild criticism get in the way of reading these novels.  This is probably the best fantasy series I have ever read (the jury still being out on George R.R. Martin's awesome Song of Ice and Fire).

B00005QDYT|5.0|In the last year or so, I have read in various places that the vinyl LP is making a comeback, a resurgence, or just not dying out altogether in the CD and MP3 age.  As someone who grew up with vinyl as the medium where I heard my favorite music (the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Yes, etc), this comes as little surprise and much delight for me -- the whole experience of the vinyl LP encompassed not just the music on the 12\\" vinyl slab, but the artwork, graphics, and visual component that was the album cover.  and countless PInk Floyd fans who held onto their LPs of 'Dark Side of the Moon' (and kept replacing them as they wore out) and just about any of their other albums would concur with me that they are among the top bands who excelled at providing as compelling visuals as the music itself.  Granted, having long now been accustomed to CDs, hearing an entire album in one sitting without having to deal with changing a side of a record, admittedly is a nice convenience, itself more or less rendering the idea of vinyl LPs (with their nasty ticks, pops, and scratches) to the dustbin of audio history.  Once Pink Floyd decided to issue as comprehensive a 'best of' career-spanning compilation in 2001, it was released as a two-CD set, and was a very good, non-chronologically sequenced set of Floyd classics that flowed particually well in two sets of thirteen songs apiece -- starting and ending with a Syd Barrett-era track.    However, much to the delight of this particular fan of the vinyl LP, the 2-CD set was issued some time later as a four-LP box set, on heavyweight vinyl.  Both discs' track listing of course is broken up to be spread out over eight sides of vinyl -- this, plus that each LP is wrapped in an individual cover and inner sleeve resplendent with superb Storm Thurgesen visuals (right down to each record's label -- see my images I provided), the 'Echoes' LP box set is very much a winner for any Pink Floyd fan who would prefer to hear this set the way the original albums (except for 'The Division Bell' for which the LP was limited and by then, CDs were de facto) were issued, and the sound of the remastered tracks on fresh vinyl is something to look forward to, for you analog, vinyl fans.  The 'Echoes' LP box is the closest way to hear almost all of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" on one side of an LP (they present parts I to VII -- some day it would be nice to hear all nine parts as one cohesive track).
B00127RAJY|4.0|If you are looking for a quick, effective workout Jillian does not disappoint.  I have been using the 30 Day Shred for about 4 weeks and have noticed quite a difference.  I have always exercised, so I am usually skeptical about a workout video actually giving you a good workout.  The 30 Day Shred is much more difficult than I expected, but in a good way.  I feel like I am really getting results and it only takes a little over 20 minutes.

0385340990|5.0|I love this book.  I laughed.  I cried.  I'm trying to find out if it's possible to emigrate to Guernsey.<br />The story is told through a series of letters (I know:  Meg Cabot does this all the time.  It's still a good way to advance the story.  Just be mindful of who is writing to whom.)<br />For many pages, I wondered if the book was going anywhere.  I didn't care if it wasn't, because post-War London and Guernsey are surprisingly tranquil.  Then I realized:  the plot had been moving all along.  I was just so wrapped up in it that I didn't realize how fast we were all moving.<br />I finished this book in maybe a day, to the complete neglect of my friends and family.  I was extremely resentful that real life dared to intrude itself on Juliet and Isola and all the rest of these amazing characters.  And more than once, I put the book down to sob over the fate of characters (and real people that I've never even met.  More than once the book sent me to Wikipedia to see if the historical things they discussed were true.  They all were.)<br />Buy the book, find a quiet corner, and get comfortable.  You won't want to leave.
B001CCIS18|4.0|Every year has at least one quirky movie that really captures your heart and imagination, and in the year 2006, that little movie was \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\"<br /><br />Yes, it's another dark comedy about a quirky, dysfunctional family. But \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" approaches the family dysfunction from a bizarre, smart, and sometimes slightly nuts perspective. This indie movie deserves all the credit that is being heaped on it -- it's truly glorious.<br /><br />Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an anxious motivational speaker who talks a lot about \\"winners\\" and \\"losers,\\" which is pretty funny when one considers that his family is full of oddities. His wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) is on edge as Richard inflicts his nine-step program on the family, and her Proust-scholar brother has just arrived, after a failed suicide attempt.<br /><br />And then there's little Olive (Abigail Breslin) -- she's wants to be in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and is being coached by her outspoken, heroin-snorting grandfather. When she gets into the pageant, the family piles into a minibus to go to Redondo Beach. Unfortunately, the trip exposes all the problems they have -- death, disappointment, suicide and lost dreams. And a broken clutch.<br /><br />If you're going to make a dark comedy about a family, then for crying out loud, give it a heart. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" realizes this, in a little family world where a wordless hug speaks more than dozens of empty lines. These people drive each other crazy, don't ever communicate, but they really do love each other -- yes, even foulmouthed Grandpa.<br /><br />But lest anyone think it's syrupy, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris wrap it in a wicked cocoon of clever humor. \\"Sarcasm is the refuge of losers,\\" Richard says smugly, only to receive a sarcastic \\"REALLY?\\" He's not the only one: each character has his or her own odd spots, and a unique way of expressing it. (\\"High school's your prime suffering years! You don't get better suffering than that!\\").<br /><br />And while a road trip sounds dull, Dayton and Faris drop little incidents through it that keep it fresh, even if it's just hiccups from the horn. The climax of the strangeness is the \\"Fawlty Towers\\"esque smuggling of a dead body, and a truly surreal song-and-dance sequence. It has to score a 9.5 on the \\"bizarre endings\\" scale.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin is a simply brilliant little actress -- cute, yet not cutesy -- and she tends to fill up the screen with her natural appeal. The other actors wear their parts like comfy old sweaters, such as Colette's weary mother and her business-obsessed hubby, not to mention Alan Arkin's priceless turn as the drug-snorting patriarch.<br /><br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a comedy as dark as it is funny, but somehow it never becomes depressing.

B000AYEL6U|4.0|I had never heard of Elizabeth Gaskell, but now I want to read everything she has ever written.  This BBC mini-series is wonderful.  Richard Armitage is absolutely amazing as John Thornton.  He plays brooding and tortured better than anyone.  Some might try to compare him to Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, but I think Richard showed a little deeper of an inner turmoil.  All the performances are great.  I started watching this at 10:00 at night and stayed up until 2:00 in the morning to finish it.  It may not be as well known as Pride & Prejudice, but it is definitely worth checking out.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|For a while, I thought the arc of this movie was going to parallel the classic \\"Citizen Kane\\" trajectory, with Daniel Day-Lewis' character rising from humble beginnings and snatched opportunities as an oil well rigger - to a hollow, rattling, rambling millionaire alone amidst his riches. However, just as I thought I had the character's conclusion pegged that way, the movie made another catapult into new territory.    Everything about this movie proceeds by jagged, akimbo grasshopper leaps, like the ones that might be made by the giant grasshopper-like well pumps that dominate the film's landscapes. \\"Blood\\" has a distinctive beat to its plot - just as its score has a distinctive beat marked by industrial clanks and crunches.    The plot is loosely based on Upton Sinclair's book, \\"Oil,\\" exposing the greed and chicanery rampant in the oil mining industry. However where Sinclair's book made the protagonist's adversaries a consortium of industrialists - this movie made Lewis' main adversaries a group of religious fundamentalists. That was a daring choice, but it does give the action another dimension.    Paul Dano is superb as the two-faced religious leader - so smooth and passively faith-basted on the one hand - so much the raging tyrant on the other. However Daniel Day-Lewis brings in the tour de force performance as oilman extraordinaire. This is a memorable film on all scores.
0553582038|5.0|A friend recommended I start Game of Thrones about five or six months ago. I ended up devouring all four books, and I love each of them.    The reason I'm writing this is because I came here before starting A Feast for Crows and saw a lot of negative comments and bad ratings. So much so that I was a little scared of the 950+ page monster I had in front of me, especially since I loved the first three so much.    After I finished it, I was baffled. A Feast for Crows is amazing. Simply outstanding, and easily on par with its three siblings. The main complaint - lack of plot development - does have some merit, but there is a reason: this book is huge set up for the rest of the series. I'm not going to get into why, because of spoilers, but almost every storyline has been pushed to the edge of the cliff. I imagine the same will happen for the other half of the characters in A Dance with Dragons, so we may have to wait for the 6th installment for this juggernaut to take off, but make no mistake, Martin has quietly but masterfully placed his pieces for the showdown.
B000W91RUG|1.0|I was baffled by how many people like this show. It is TERRIBLE. The comedy is so obvious, and all the actors are horrible. Please for the love of God tell me why this show is funny. How I Met Your Mother is pretty good, as is Rules of Engagement, but this show is almost unwatchable.     Is there something I'm not getting? Has Everybody Loves Raymond and Two and a Half Men warped your brains to find unfunny situations funny? I'll watch Two and a Half Men, which in my opinion, is about on par with this show, and I will stare, baffled at how obvious the jokes are. It's as if the laugh tracks have created some Pavlovian response mechanism for the mentally challenged, forcing you to laugh every two seconds at banal dialogue.    Please, I am asking you to perform a service and tell me why this show is funny. Tell me why you laugh at this show. I just don't get it, and I feel like the minority considering 28 other people gave this 4 or 5 stars. It boggles the mind. Please, help me out...
B000V86OKG|5.0|I absolutely LOVED the first season of Dexter and thought it was done really well. I liked the \\"development of character\\" part of it, the story was well drown and I felt that all the characters in the show were real and likable. But the story in the first season felt complete and I couldn't imagine sequel to it. I was curious `cause the show was great but in my head I didn't expect much.     When I started watching I couldn't stop until it was finished. It kept going from episode to episode with such a progress and twists. I really enjoyed it all the way. I did NOT think it was that predictable. Maybe story-line somewhere but the development of the character was extremely well done: my hat's off! I was always fascinated by \\"hidden identity\\" aspect of the character. This on is done much better from anything else I have ever seen before. It works on so many levels. It is a bit disturbing but really deep. It constantly asks question and provokes thoughts. Also it's right in your face. I think it addresses so much.    I would recommend this to any fan of anything with substance.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|One has to appreciate the time and effort that must have been put into making this series.  The footage is breathtaking and the narration is informative.  I am very well pleased with my purchase.  It is a great reminder of the awesome beauty of nature amidst the busyness of our lives, especially for those living in a concrete jungle.  Raw, and quite artistic at times, it is a true and accurate documentary...
B0011NVCO8|4.0|This movie weighs in at two hours and thirty eight minutes and for most of that time I was glued to the screen. It's a classic story of the lone honest cop tracking down the powerful gang boss, but with a twist.<br />  Denzel Washington, mezmerizing as always, plays a man who builds a powerful drug trafficking empire, smuggling drugs direct from Vietnam using U.S. military personnel and planes to ship the pure heroin to the streets of New York. Washington loves his mama, dresses in expensive suits, looks after his family and pursues the American dream. He is also ruthless, prepared to shoot a rival in the head in the middle of a crowded Harlem street in broad daylight without fearing anyone would testify against him.<br />  The twist is his character's assertion that what he is doing is nothing more or less than pure American capitalism. He has a business to run and he runs it. He becomes rich -- but that is no more than the legitimate and just reward for his enterprise. \\"This is America,\\" he says at one point. And the fact is that the police, with the exception of the Russell Crowe character, are just as corrupt as the criminals, all on the take and making their own living from the drugs trade.<br />  I should add here that I was a little nervous about watching this film because I have a low threshhold for screen violence. But there isn't much violence, those scenes that are included are necessary to the plot and the camera does not dwell on them too much.<br />  The movie falters a little in its final 20 minutes which consist of an extended coda after the climactic scene. However, in general this is first-class entertainment which should also raise a few questions in viewers' minds as well.

0765357151|5.0|After enjoying the movie quite a bit, I had to see what the original was like.  It was no surprise, then, to find that I enjoyed the book quite a bit, but for reasons not the same.  The book is way different than the movie, with really the only common element being vampires and Neville's name.  Everything else is completely different!<br /><br />Right from the beginning we know there are vampires, so no surprise reveal.  And as another reviewer stated, the book is more about one man's trials and tribulations in trying to survive amongst the blood thirsty vampires, and then to try and overcome them by defeating them with science.  This really was a good read, ultimately finishing up much stronger than the movie.<br /><br />It is a little deceptive though.  You pick up this 300 page book and start reading, then you get to page 160 and I Am Legend ends.  From there the rest is all short stories.  Nowhere does it state that I Am Legend is basically a long novella, with the rest a bunch of short stories.  Not on the back of the book.  Not on any product descriptions.  In fact everywhere only talks about I Am Legend.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but a little deceptive in the marketing.  Perhaps more bang for your buck, since you would have bought I Am Legend by itself anyway.<br /><br />All in all, the book is a lot better than the movie.  The book is a great stand alone vampire/horror book that focuses more on man's struggle, rather than the gory side of it.  Some of the short stories were interesting as well, but the star of the show is definitely I Am Legend.<br /><br />5 stars.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was great.  I loved how they continued the movie from the show instead of doing something totally off the wall. and I watched the movie twice in the theaters and. Oh did  I mentioned that I loved this movie. It has it all love, heart-ache, joy, sadness.  I recommend this movie to all.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|First of all I have to say this is one of the best transfers to bluray I have seen for an 80's movie.  I keep this Bluray aside to show friends when they ask me about if its really worth changing to blu ray.  Trust me I have seen/own some subpar ones like T2 and Total Recall bluray versions which are not any better than thier DVD versions.  I put this movie in and watched it on my 65 plasma and my wife thought it was a newer movie just released thats how good the picture is.  I've shown this to most of my friends and they also admitted that the quality on this was amazing for 80's movie.  The picture is sharp with hardly any grain and the colors are really vibrant exactly what i expected from a bluray.  If you like the movie and want to upgrade to a better quality then don't hesitate to buy this one you won't regret it.        Also to note those who say the blu ray version is subpar you might wanna adjust your HD settings to make sure you are getting the most out of it.  I had my TV on the factory settings and the picture quality on my blurays were pretty disappointing it wasn't until I started reading some of these reviews that I realized the factory settings were not getting the most out of the HD experience.

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is the final installment in the Twilight saga and I have to admit it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, which is why I think I found it so incredibly entertaining. It was thrilling and different. It takes you in many different directions that you would've never expected  based on the previous books in the series. I most definitely recommend this book and I have no doubt that you will enjoy it as much as I have. Stephenie Meyer said that she found closure in the end of her work in the twilight series and she hoped that all of the Twilight fans would find this as well. I found closure in this book. It was an excellent finale to a wonderful series. (Careful spoilers below)<br />I have some other reviews on this book and I have not failed to notice the dislike that other readers have shown towards this book and how everything meraculously works out at the end. I have to agree that I was suprised that everything did work out and that no major or important characters died, but I wasn't at all dissapointed. Life isn't perfect, and Meyer definitely showed this through all the struggles that Bella and Edward had throughtout the series and as soon as I finished the book I thought it was more then fitting that everything worked out for them and Jacob in the end. They fought hard the entire series to have happiness and be safe and that is exactly what they got in the end. And no, not everyone will get a happy ending in life, but thats no reason that a book can't give the young girls of today the hope that a happy ending is in store for them.
0439023483|4.0|Ok, so it's not exactly war, but the plot of \\"The Hunger Games\\" weaves love and sort of a gladiatorial/survival competition together. Other reviewers have made comparisons with similar stories they've read--but for me it was a fresh read. It was sufficiently suspenseful to keep me reading through it at a pretty good clip, and there were plenty of twists to keep me guessing.     The story involves a futuristic republic that has replaced the United States following some sort of war or revolution. The government uses fear and brute force to keep it's various \\"Districts\\" subjugated to the fortress-like Capitol, built in the Rocky Mountains. The Hunger Games is their continual reminder to the citizens of who is in charge. 24 tributes, a male and female from each of 12 districts in the nation, are selected from a lottery of teenagers. The odds are stacked against the poor, but even the rich are not immune. When the protagonist of the story, Katniss Everdeen, finds that her little sister has been drawn--she is compelled by love to take her place. Can she find a way to reverse the odds and to survive while not becoming just a pawn of the system? In the game, she and the 23 other tributes engage in a protracted fight for survival in a fully televised outdoor arena, with only one winner left standing. But what will become of friendship and human dignity? How will she face her fellow tribute from District 12, a familiar face and schoolmate?    While there is nothing heavy or philosophical about this book, it explores the theme of human fascination with violence in entertainment--something that is older than the Roman Coliseum and the Gladiators, and is as much a part of our entertainment today. Collins does this without focusing overly much on the grotesque, but shows the conflicting emotions, and the seemingly futile struggle against powers greater than their own. Yet all the while, love and the will to survive compel Katniss to become the clever heroine.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Although I quite liked Around the Sun (I cannot say that to Reveal, as I don't like it), I guess Peter Buck & Co. weren't happy with the result and they stormed the studios with Accelerate!  At first I thought the REM were back with the usual stuff. Not so. They are angry, fast and heavy! Many songs are political or social as they are not happy with the current situation in the US and you can feel the urgency in many of the songs. What's better, the whole album is consistent, no fillers here.    For the first time since New adventures in HiFi and Berry's departure, REM can be really proud of themselves! When I think about them I feel invigorated and proud too.  The best songs for me are Accelerate, Supernatural superserious, Horse to water, Until the day is done, with the first being in the top 5 list of the best REM songs ever!

B000JSI7DK|3.0|It's happening again. I'm watching movies in completely the wrong order. I watched Back To The Future in the wrong order (three, two and then one!), and now I'm watching the Rocky movies in the wrong order. The first one I saw was Rocky Balboa, and then the one with Dolph Lundgren. And now I've seen the first one.<br /><br />In my current workplace, we have these talking keychains, tacky stuff that insist on charging a fortune for, and they feature lines from popular films. We've had Dirty Dancing, Scarface, Star Wars, Rocky and a couple of others. Customers press the buttons (constantly), but the one I seem to constantly hear is \\"Yo Adrian! It's me, Rocky!\\" So I smiled whenever I heard one of the six lines that features on the keychain.<br /><br />The story's pretty simplistic, but effective, so I won't repeat what millions of other reviewers have said before me. What was astonishing is that it was written by Mr Stallone himself. That I was surprised at. Congratulations to him, he's made a good franchise out of it (except for part five apparently - I originally thought Rocky Balboa was part five!)<br /><br />I really didn't like the cover to this blu ray edition. Yes, we know that Rocky is a movie about boxing, but do we really need to see a bruised and bloodied Stallone on the cover? I said that as soon as I saw the cover, I just don't like it.<br /><br />Apart from all the boxing scenes, there's a genuine love story going on too. I went all gooey when I saw the scenes between Stallone and Talia Shire, who played the afore mentioned Adrian. The scenes where Rocky is trying to get the shy girl to talk to him and trying to impress her, was excellent, and made me really go all soft and gooey inside. And the gradual change in Adrian's character was brilliant too. But she literally does not talk much throughout the movie.<br /><br />Stallone was really good in this. His body is not as pumped up as it is in later movies (obviously before he really got into the whole body building scene), and it looks a lot more natural. More preferable in my opinion. He's still hubba hubba. And the sad puppydog eyes are still there. I always feel shockingly maternal when I watch Stallone movies - I just want to protect him.<br /><br />The blu ray looks fantastic, it's still grainy which gives the film a certain edge, and obviously there's so much that can be done in high definition to a film that's meant to look grainy. Who wants clean and shiny movies all the time? The boxing scenes (choreographed by Stallone himself) are frighteningly realistic, bloody and will make the viewer wince at every hit. The fight scene was filmed in reverse order apparently, starting with the fifteenth round, and lots of makeup, and gradually moving the makeup with each scene until it was back to round one. Rocky actually won an Oscar for film editing because of this.<br /><br />The Rocky movies are always brilliant to watch, and I do really like watching them. Maybe it's something about Sylvester, because the whole boxing thing really does scare me. Yes, lets beat each other to a bloody pulp for money. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. No thanks.

B00003CX9S|3.0|I can cry at anything. I cry at films, reality TV shows, Neighbours *cough*, sob stories on American Idol, etc. And I've cried so much at a similar film, Mask, that I can no longer watch it. I was actually expecting to dislike this. Everyone seems to rave about it. What's to like?<br /><br />For anyone who has seen this movie, the scene where the doctor (played superbly by Anthony Hopkins) takes John back to his home and introduces him to his wife - that was me. When John starts crying and says he's never been spoken to like that before by a beautiful woman, that was me for the rest of the film. I cried on and off for the rest of the movie. And was still crying when the credits rolled.<br /><br />Elephant Man is based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, who was afflicted with a disfiguring disease. Some of this is similar to Mask, where Rocky (played by Eric Stoltz) is also afflicted by a similar disease. But this was in the 19th century, and little was known about this kind of thing. Because of this, Merrick is subjected to years of misery as the 'Elephant Man' in freak side shows, things that were popular on those days. There are benign tumours which grow all over his body, distorting his head, face and body, which makes him sleep sitting up or will die from suffocation.<br /><br />Most of the movie is set inside the hospital, where we learn Merrick is extremely well educated, and instantly likeable. I'm still not quite sure about the beginning of the movie - where we see Merrick's mother being attacked by an elephant in the fourth month of her pregnancy. It seemed a bit tacked on to the beginning of the movie and didn't really work.<br /><br />There are a few familiar faces in this - fans of UK TV show Hotel Babylon look out for Dexter Fletcher, he's appeared in films too, but that's how I know him. Fans of Anne Of Green Gables (!), look out for Wendy Hiller, playing the main nurse. She was Mrs. Harris in the sequel. There's probably others too, but those are the ones I know.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I really don't see this as the kind of the movie I will ever watch again. It's just too upsetting, although I know people I've spoken to, disagree with that, and watch it over and over. It just had to much of an effect on me. Otherwise it's a really brilliant movie, with similarities to Mask, but in black and white, and outstanding performances., I really don't see this as the kind of the movie I will ever watch again.

1563894696|3.0|My preference is for 'detective' Batman, which we almost get here. The story is a whodunnit, but there's very little actual detection carried out. Instead the story becomes a little repetitive with more and more bad guys being dispatched on each holiday.<br /><br />The whodunnit aspect is weakened by the inclusion of several 'psycho' Batman characters, such as the Joker, the Scarecrow, Mad Hatter, and (eventually) Two-Face. I'm getting pretty sick of 'dark' Batman stories, and especially of the Joker.<br /><br />The ending is quite disappointing since there's no realistic way anyone could have forseen the ending (a necessary requirement of a good whodunnit in my opinion).
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy watching all of the Gilmore Girls' episodes together.  Even as she gets older, these episodes provide for our special mother/daughter time at least once or twice a week.  Amazon has by far had the best price on the season packages.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|I saw this film on an international flight a couple of years ago, before it was released in the US, and loved it.  I thought everyone in it was great, the location perfect for the story, and that all of the elements came together nicely.  I've seen it several times since and my feeling for this film has not changed.  It's one of my all-time favorite films.

B00133KFGW|4.0|Great condition.  It took a little longer than expected to receive it (over 2 weeks)
B00005JLEU|4.0|This movie is beautiful and I agree with many of the reviews. But those that say it is for young children probably do not have children. I watched this with my five year old daughter (the first hour) and she got very quiet and left the room. She ended up being very scared and upset in a very real way. She even had nightmares. It was my mistake. I should have watched it first to see. I am not saying that ALL children would be. But I would definitly say it is for more sophisticated children/older. And yes-classic disney was a bit more scary. But the scene where snow white gets lost in the forest is not quite the same as the feeling and imagery of the this film which does not let up as does Snow White when she says \\"I was being silly to be scared\\" then starts singing. Just watch it first and see what you think before showing small children.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Kurosawa's epic Throne of Blood deftly captures both the spirit of Shakespeare's Macbeth and the Age of the Warring States (Sengoku) of Japan.<br /><br />For students of Japanese history, Throne of Blood is great film to check out to understand the spirit of the Sengoku Period (Age of Warring States). Though the story and characters are fictional, the motives are real and very similar events depicted in the film occurred often throughout that period.<br /><br />The Sengoku Period from the late 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century is the perfect setting for a medival Japanese retelling of Macbeth. It was a time of relentless warfare between small provinces that were kingdoms in their own right. It was also a time of treachery and betrayal - the low overthrowing the high. A number of houses were toppled from within by their own deputies.<br /><br />In fact, Kurosawa's retelling of Macbeth is actually more truthful in both reality and essence in this regard than Shakespeare. The real Macbeth was not the bloodthristy ambitious tyrant portrayed by Shakespeare whereas Kurosawa's characters while fictional themselves aptly represent the bloody and treacherous reality of the times.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|Considering the upward trend in pricing on entry level audio electronics as of late (thanks to podcasting...) this unit easily satisfies a multitude of requirements at a bargain price.  The build quality is on par with other Behringer products (read: all but perfect), noise is not an issue (SNR 110dB), the \\"British\\" (haha) style EQ is clean and the thing just works.    I too complain of no power button.  A soft-on toggle/rocker would have been a nice addition, given the recommended power-on procedure (Connect power supply to board, then plug supply into the wall) but I suppose it could be easily solved with a remote control outlet.

015206396X|5.0|It seems that the young adult fiction market has captured most of the new talent in writing.  Far be it from me to complain when there are those random times I stumble across an excellent read.  Graceling is a good book - adult enough to remain interesting, mature in the sense it presumes its readers are fairly intelligent, and captivating.  The only lack the book had was it is far too short for the amount of information within.      Set in an incredibly detailed world that is dynamic, Graceling tells that timeless story which so many authors return to - coming of age and self-growth.  This however has an unusual twist to it, as the best stories often do, and provides a rather interesting backdrop to it this time around.    The story begins with the ruthless Katsa, a young woman who was a Graceling by birth.  Bi-colored eyes are their signature feature.  Graces are basically like gifts that make people do something extraordinarily well.  Some people have cooking Graces, and are master chefs.  Others have cooking graces, animal graces, etc.  All sorts of talents, really.  Katsa's is a curse more than a blessing, for she possesses a very potent Grace - one which allows her to kill easily and quickly.  She is a young woman without peer, being used by her Uncle as his violent paintbrush cutting through the kingdom where she lives.  Starting to be discontent with her orders, she doesn't enjoy hurting people over trivial things.  Katsa meets a catalyst on a very special rescue mission - a man named Po, also a Graceling, whose mere presence changes her forever.    I really liked this story for a number of reasons.  The action scenes were good.  They aren't wordy.  They also mince no words.  There is violence in them.  No, not Hollywood horror-movie splatter, but they are believably dark and gritty \\"real\\" fight scenes, or seem to be, at least.  The characters are all multi-faceted, which is both a strength and weakness of the book.  It's a strength, because they remain interesting and ever changing.  It's a weakness, because the book is far too short to explore all of their depths.  The side characters are some of the most interesting, and we meet them far too briefly.  Katsa and Po are indeed deliciously interesting, but I'd loved to see more stories about Raff and some of the others.  Understandably, it's not their story per se, but a very good job was done with all of them.      I eagerly await a sequel to Graceling.  For now, I think I'll read it a second time. :)  Thank you for a most excellent story.
0618918248|5.0|...this is a very good book.    I'll start my saying that I put myself in the ranks of evangelical Christians, so I agree with relatively little that Prof Dawkins says in this book.    That said, his book was insightful, and very well-written.  It really did make me think about the issues that Prof Dawkins discusses.    If you're looking for a well-written, thought-provoking book defending atheism with real arguments (rather than just antireligious whining), this is definitely worth the read, regardless which side of the issue you come from.
031606792X|5.0|You will not be disappointed in the 4th book of this series.  My 16 yr.old granddaughter got me started on these, and I couldn't put any of them down after I started.  Very offbeat but entertaining.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This cast of relatively unknown actors sings their way through the 60's and 70's, but it's more about the history of those times than it is about the Beatles.  If you lived through the Beatles, Vietnam, Kent State, the race riots, this movie may explain the mileaux better, and more artistically, than anything currently available.    Across the Universe came out the same month that my wife, son and I saw Love, the Cirque de Soleil show set to original Beatles songs re-mixed by legendary producer Sir George Martin and his son, Giles.  That piece of live theater starts in post WW II bombed out London/Liverpool, with themes of British aristocracy being lost, the kids equally lost, and everybody looking for their future.      While Love stays with British history, Across the Universe looks at both sides of the pond, as they say.  I don't think you'll have any trouble following the history, and you'll love the music, some of it very serious, some very avante.
0765350386|5.0|I used Amazon's \\"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\" to find this book after having read \\"The Blade Itself\\" series and \\"The Name of the Wind\\", both excellent reads.    Also, I noted that Robin Hobbs also wrote a glowing review for the book.    This book was a lot of fun.  I got hooked from the very beginning, as this book is very fast-paced.  Many of of the reviewers talked about the magic system - how original and fleshed out it is.  Well, they're right.  I found myself realling getting into it, and loving the ideas about how it all worked.      OK, I'm going to say it.  Just like most other Fantasy books I read, there's an orphan with special powers as the main character.  I guess it was either an orphan or a farmboy, and the author chose orphan for this story.     However, the fast pace, the \\"heist\\"-style story, the intersting ideas (taking a quote from another reviewer: what if Frodo failed?), made this a fast read and a lot of fun. Plus, there were alot of fun surprises.    This needs to be said because when I was talking the book up to a friend he was hesitant because he'd read the main character is a girl.  He loves his heroes to be named Drizzt or Conan.  However, according the author's website, the main char was originally written as a boy, and when I told him that, it seemed to alleviated enough of his concerns that he said he'd check it out.    Note: I checked out brandonsanderson.com, and the author does a fantastic job on his site.  Particularly, the chapter-by-chapter annotation where you can read his thoughts about what he wrote.  I had previously purchased the DragonLance Annotated Chronicles and thought it was pretty slick.  Seeing the same thing on the web for free is even better.    5 Stars.  My Library has book 2 reserved for me now, and Amazon has my Pre-Order for book 3 coming in October.

B0010ZR160|5.0|This is one of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time.  Watch this movie and refer it to everyone you know. It is very interesting to talk to people about their reactions to this movie. The point of the movie is not about whether you're Irish, your neighborhood, etc. The reviewer who was insulted about the characters' ethnicity TOTALLY missed the point. This reaches much deeper. Check it out!

B000P12LWY|2.0|The reign of King Henry VIII was a glamorous historical period of drama, intrigue, sensuality, and cultural import.  We therefore have a right to high expectations of any televised drama set in this fascinating era.  Instead, The Tudors delivers an unpleasant, sleazy hack job featuring a venal, violent megalomaniac and the women stupid enough to get involved with him.  I have seen the first disc; it hasn't given me any good reason to want to see the rest.    The problem isn't the show's lack of historical accuracy.  I can forgive a work that is willing to sacrifice historical accuracy for the sake of pacing and drama, particularly a TV series.  What I can't forgive is a show that does this and manages to be less interesting than real life.  Yes, the real Henry VIII had both an interesting love life and a violent streak.  But he was also pious, scholarly, independent-minded, (for all his bluster, the king portrayed in this show seems incapable of independent judgment, and is always being prompted by advisors and courtiers), and, paradoxically, prudish.  He was a complex individual replete with contradictions.  In short, the real Henry VIII was much more interesting than the one-dimensional, tantrum-prone sex-fiend The Tudors portrays.      The Henry VIII of this series is not the sort of person a well-adjusted individual could like.  Not when he's throwing chairs and destroying furniture.  Not when he treats his wife like gum to be scraped off a shoe.  Not when his most common emotional states are sinister glee or rage.  This wouldn't have been too much of a problem had they made him witty, charming, or interesting.  The real Henry VIII was probably at least one of these things.  But the Henry VIII of The Tudors isn't just creepy and cruel; he says precious little that is interesting or memorable that isn't yelled (a few scenes with Thomas More being exceptions).  He's not a bad boy, but a horrible man, and this show wants you to spend many tedious hours with him.There are some worthwhile performances from Sam Neill and Jeremy Notham.  The series is also visually serviceable.  Yet stripped down to its bear essentials, it's a mediocre melodrama given undeserved respectability by its connection to history and royalty.  It may be too much to ask for a show to be good drama and edifying history, but it's quite reasonable to expect it to be at least one of these.  For The Tudors to succeed at neither given the richness of the subject matter is inexcusable.    If you want the kind of historical drama that The Tudors purports to deliver, the HBO series Rome is much better.  It has more sex and violence, but it also has witty dialog, an ample supply of sympathetic characters, and appears to have made a greater effort to achieve historical authenticity.  Or better yet read a popular history of the period by the likes of Allison Weir or Richard Starkey.  You will be both more enlightened and more entertained than if you waste time with this lemon of a TV show.
0446402389|5.0|During the turbulent times at Stalin's death, Leo is fighting the soviet bureaucracy in search of a serial killer.  The story follows Leo's fight against his own personal demon along with the denial of the state in his search for the killer..  Mr. Smith succeeds in capturing the flavor of the this era in the Soviet Union and the wide spread paranoia of the populace.  I found the story unpredictable and and full of twists and turns.  It held my interest to the end.  I am looking forward to Mr. Smith's next novel.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I first saw this movie because of my love for Robert Downey Jr, and this is by far my favorite film by him. The story is silly, clever, and dark. There is a plethora of clever inside jokes and jibes. The cast is phenomenal; Downey Jr. plays a great imp as Harry Lockhart, and Val Kilmer is great as Gay Perry, who is full of biting jabs and flair. Michelle Monaghan also shines in this movie, she adds a lot of spark and goofiness to the film.     I was laughing my butt off for the entire film, and it made me such an active viewer. I was gasping, covering my mouth,  laughing so hard at the clever jokes...I couldn't get enough of this film. And, getting to watch Robert Downey Jr. look so great for 110 minutes was also a big plus.    If you want AMAZING acting, great laughs, and a good interactive story, then SEE THIS MOVIE!!! A lot of people say it's stupid, not funny, or lacking chemistry, but they are definitely wrong on all counts!
0316168815|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. It was so unique. The characters were so well developed. You would think the subject matter would be too sad to read, but it was so beautifully written, that you didn't really think of the sadness--instead you just rooted for the characters and found comfort in their happiness.
B000005H3M|5.0|\\"Big Swing Face\\" is one of Buddy's more popular albums. I would certainly describe it as a classic. I first heard Buddy Rich when I was a kid when an older cousin of mine played me some of his LPs. Needless to say, I was mesmerised, and spent the next four decades of my life as a drummer.     This CD version also contains tracks that are not on the original LP release, which I still own. Even today, this recording remains one of my all-time favourite Rich albums. You can really feel the atmosphere of the gig, and the band just groove so well. His music crossed categories, and attracted a huge audience, and even if you're not into jazz, or drumming for that matter, you will love this album.     I was fortunate enough to see the Buddy Rich Big Band on two occasions back in the 80's, and even met the great man at the second gig. He was, and still is, my drumming hero, and I feel honoured to have seen him play live. The guy was a genius. He could play things on a drumkit that were incredible, and leave even today's top Session players (Dave Weckl, Vinnie Colaiuta, etc.), shaking their heads in disbelief.     One of the many highlights on this recording is when Buddy introduces his 12 and a half-year-old daughter Cathy, onto the bandstand to sing \\"The Beat Goes On\\". It is here that you start to appreciate how much of an \\"entertainer\\" Buddy was, and audiences always loved when he got out front. Often known for his wonderful sense of humour, Buddy could charm any audience with his great wit and warmth of character.     \\"Big Swing Face\\" is a fantastic album. If I had to choose just one Buddy Rich CD that everyone should buy, this would be the one. You will be tapping your feet throughout this recording, and the music and feel of this recording just gets to you. This band is hot man! Buddy could swing like no other.     Buy it today.     Yanek
0763617105|5.0|This piece of Modern Fantasy features a small owl family. The mother owl leaves and the three owl babies are left to worry and wonder where she's gone and when she'll return. In the end, the owl mother returns to her three concerned children and reassures them.<br /><br />The first time I heard this story was at Texas Tech University in my Children's Lit course. Dr. Button was a skilled reader and acted out the scenes of this book, making us all fall in love with the story.<br /><br />Bill, the youngest owl baby, has a repetive part in the story and I would ask children to read that line on each page. I would also incorporate this book in a Fall, noctournal animals unit.

B001AR0D4A|1.0|First off I am a big fan of Stephen King, so when I heard that the Mist was being made into a movie I was excited. Let alone it was being directed by Frank Darabont, who did The Green Mile and Shawshank (2 Great movies)      This movie had to be the worst movie ever made, Bad acting, horrible special effects (Made Special effects from the 80's look good)      They stayed close to the book to a point but the end of the movie ruined everything.     It was a very bad movie do not waste your time nor money in seeing this movie!

0783232039|5.0|Jennifer Tilly does a fantastic job in this movie! Playing a doll-obsessed killer, she resurrects Chucky, and puts him in a crib, thinking he's cute. But Chucky escapes, Tilly is turned into a doll, and the bloodshed starts. To my surprise, Katherine Heigl plays a small role in this movie, the main action between Chucky and Tilly, who get married, but then are constantly fighting and argueing, Tilly saying she wants to be treated with respect, Chucky just wanting to mindlessly kill. There is no scary part in the whole movie, but a lot of gore and dark humor. It's my first Chucky, so I can't compare it to the first 3, but I do know that I had a great time watching this movie. Great fun! Highly recommended, 5 stars, Grade: A.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|My 7 year old hated this movie as did all her friends - younger and older.  They said the best part of the movie was the popcorn.  Too bad Pixar usually makes great, fun movies for all.  They blew it this time.  I'd give it less stars if I could.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Around two years past it's debut in theaters, I finally decided to give Batman Begins a chance (despite diehard fans shunning it's realism).<br /><br />I remember watching it during a late night, and liking what I saw, but my memory was fuzzy when I tried to recall specific scenes.<br /><br />Another year passes - I am purchasing art supplies on Amazon when, by chance, I see Batman Begins now available in Blu-Ray. Having bought a PS3 over the summer, and wanting to test the supposedly superior audio/video capabilities of this new format, coupled with my curiosity concerning why I enjoyed this film in the first place, I decide to add it to my order.<br /><br />---<br /><br />$17.95, 140 minutes and The Dark Knight later, I am happy at the way Christopher Nolan has managed to elevate Batman and Gotham into the modern world and yet retain a grim tone that is undeniably fantasy in nature.<br /><br />Begins starts off with a look at a child Bruce Wayne and his growth into the determined young man that becomes Batman. I didn't know anything about actor Christian Bale prior to his turn as the Caped Crusader, but I quickly respected his intensity and believability as Gotham's prince on a mission to rid his city of evil.<br /><br />Some feel the first half is a little too drawn out, but, with this being an origin story, you can't expect the action to take center place throughout the entire movie. The pacing was handled very well: Nolan knows when to introduce a montage, and when to focus exclusively on one scene for an extended period of time.<br /><br />After a crisis of conscience, Bruce leaves Gotham on a quest to find himself. Soon, we're introduced to Henri Ducard (masterfully played by Liam Neeson) - a mentor that takes Bruce and teaches him the methods of stealth and war which will eventually become a part of his Batman skills.<br /><br />But not all is as it seems, and soon Bruce will have to make some difficult decisions regarding his once firm belief in black and white notions of good and evil. Once he returns to the states, we enter the second half of the film where we see him regain his position amongst the wealthy of Gotham...and slowly flesh out his Batman persona.<br /><br />The action sequences here are generally good, though some are a tad *too* dark (there's a marked difference between representing Batman's use of ambushes and making all of the action we as viewers are supposed observe, obscured). Of course, we're introduced to a variety of new personalities.<br /><br />Michael Caine plays Alfred, Bruce's loyal adviser and butler. Caine's portrayal is a bit more relaxed and casual than Michael Gough [of Batman (1989) fame], and despite not being entirely sold on this Cockney accented version, he manages to pull off the wise confidant to his master's secret well enough.<br /><br />Next up is Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. She serves as the moral vehicle that spurs Bruce to reconsider his actions and leave Gotham until he's mature enough to return. I found Mrs. Holmes's acting to be rather lackluster and easily forgettable. Thankfully, her role isn't that vital later on.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, as Sergeant Gordon, was one of the few actors along with Bale that managed to impress me. You'd never guess that he was English by his accent and mannerisms - and his believability as the morally unshakable officer that aids Batman never falters.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman rounds out the good guys as Lucius Fox, Bruce's \\"Q\\" (provider of gadgets and various technology) and true friend within Wayne Enterprises. While Freeman's role in and of itself wasn't lengthy in terms of screen time, he does prove to be crucial towards the end  and delivers my favorite quip of the entire movie.<br /><br />The score is proportionally moody and fast-paced to the visuals it accompanies. It isn't quite as memorable as Danny Elfman's work [Batman (1989)] but does an admirable job of never being intrusive.<br /><br />My only real criticism is that we don't get to see much, if any, of Batman's detective side - he generally relies on contacts to get ahead. Still, I can't fault it too much given the amount of story we're supposed to take in.<br /><br />On a technical note, I am exceptionally pleased with this Blu-Ray version. While I don't own an HD TV or an expensive speaker set, the image and sound quality is much better than comparable recent DVD releases. There's also a bevy of extras that were in the two-disc DVD version of Begins, though admittedly I haven't viewed any of them.<br /><br />Entertaining, brooding and with morals that everyone can live by, Batman Begins is a keeper.fault it too much given the amount of story we're supposed to take in.

0061122416|5.0|[[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]]    Coelho writes as though he were painting the pages with a bright colored world, each word exquisitely chosen to flow together with those around it.  No modern fiction writer has a better masterly of language.  In The Alchemist his artistry with words combines with his gift for story telling to create a fantastic journey.  We follow a quest for self-discovery through varied lands, seeking a dream as much as its fulfillment.  While the tale itself may seem simple or familiar, it is one with which everyone can relate.  This universality of theme is what has branded it a classic.    But for me, it is still the beauty of the language that has made me a life long Coelho admirer, starting with this book.
B000067J24|5.0|Fantastic Brazilian soundtrack on this lightweight romance comedy. Told like a folk tale, the movie's plot is silly but fun. Penelope Cruz is unbelievably cute. Not for women only. It's a great diversion and won't hurt your head. Watch it.

B00078XGRO|5.0|This Star Trek film was the best one I have seen altogether. I loved this one very much. The story continues in an on going conflict with the Borg and is exceptionally layed out in a great story concept. The effects, the directing, and the music scores all tie together to make this Star Trek epic a collectible to view over and over again. Jonathan Frakes definitely knows how to direct a Star Trek film and knows what the fans want to see through his eyes. He did great! I recommend this one for all Trek fans to buy.
B000QFBW6K|5.0|John deWald has given an excellent review, but I think a couple of additions could be made. I would suggest you read this in conjunction with his review.<br /><br />By the time he had reached the Ring, Wagner had passed the bounds of opera. The Ring is more correctly described as music-drama, for in this work (and Parsifal) the dramatic element is as important as the musical element, an aspect that is hard to recognize from CDs. After years of listening to the work on CD, I finally saw this work via this performance (I was lucky enough to see it on a 100\\" screen and hear it through an excellent surround system; all of which helps give an impression of \\"you are there\\"). And it was at that point I realized I was experiencing something greater than what we normally class as opera.<br /><br />Although this production had four different directors, they revealed a similar conception in understanding the work. And the performers and conductor tied it all together so that you are not really aware different directors were involved.<br /><br />The presentation is abstract, and once you become aware of the nature of the work, you realize that is the only legitimate treatment for it. I have seen advice that for your first DVD Ring, the Met production might be easier as it is a more traditional staging. This statement suggests the director was apparently trying to treat the Ring as a traditional opera and did not properly understand what he was directing. Let me add, I normally dislike abstract settings, but in this case it is the only option and really works.<br /><br />This production is justifiably famous. It has a cast of outstanding singers, with no weak link (and Wagner is very demanding on his cast). But they are all outstanding actors as well - essential for a production true to Wagner's intentions.

B0019HQIFE|4.0|I suspect that most people who are considering buying this disc are already familiar with John Mayer.  Then again, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got the disc with Sony's promotion for their Blu-ray player.<br /><br />One review panned the disc because of bad video and sound quality.  The quality you get will depend on your equipment.  I have Sony's top end current generation TV, and their newest Blu-ray player, so I assume that I'm seeing it as they intended it.  The video quality does not rise to what you might expect from blu-ray.  Because of the concert hall spot lights, faces were washed out and lacking in detail.<br /><br />As for the sound, a good recording can sound bad on bad equipment, but you can't make a bad recording sound good on good equipment.

He then goes to an electric set with a trio, and starts with a classic blues song.  On that one, his playing lacked originality, but had plenty of feel.  If you liked the original, you'll like this because the feel is there, but I think he is capable of more.<br /><br />He then went into a Hendrix cover, but he made it his own. It showed his talent.  Later, he played some blues songs where he seemed to channel Hendrix in his style, and there are also hints of many other players in his playing.<br /><br />His blend of styles, song writing and playing show that he is not somebody whose songs will sound the same or be stuck in a narrow genre.

1594489505|5.0|Wow, I just finished reading this book last night, and it has really stuck with me. I couldn't put it down. I'd agree with others who've said the first half of the book is slower than the second half, but it was all engrossing, and I felt so involved with the two main characters, Miriam and Laila. Although much of the book is heartbreaking, you are able to see what the Afghan people have endured just in the past several decades, and what they will do to create a better future for their families.    Is this book brutal? Yes, in many parts. But, there is also alot of love and joy brought from family, friends, and the desire of these characters to take control of their own lives, even in the face of war, poverty, and at some points, extreme hunger and understandable feelings of futility.    I highly this book. It's an excellent follow-up to \\"The Kite Runner.\\"
B001AEF6CW|3.0|Just got my brand new Big Lebowski 10th Anniversarry Bowling Ball Edition.    My thought, case is cheaply made and had visible scratches on what should have been a brand new purchase.    The DVDs are enclosed in cheap cardboard sleeves that are placed inside the bowling ball one on top of the other. Print on the cardboard sleeves show visible fingerprints like the glossy coat of a PS3.    It's still a cool collectors item, but I don't think it's worth the price Universal is asking for. luckily I had a $25.00 gift certificate!

0385340990|5.0|Guernsey, an island in the English Channel, was occupied by the Germans during most of World War II. For five years, the islanders lived in fear, danger, and deprivation while they were out of contact with the rest of the world. By the time they were liberated, though abused and starving, the islanders had forged enriching friendships out of their hardship and their need to protect each other.<br /><br />This novel is a good example of fiction presenting facts in a more effective way than non-fiction can. I was absorbed into the experiences of the characters, and I will remember the historical experience with more than a precise memory of bare facts.<br /><br />The story is told in a series of letters between a young writer, Juliet Ashton, in 1946 London and her close friends, in addition to the members of the literary society on the island of Guernsey. The letters are witty, charming, engrossing, and satisfying. The story is so well written that it may become one of those durable books that is read year after year and rediscovered by each generation of readers--a book that could become a classic.<br /><br />by Katherine Misegades<br />for Story Circle Book Reviews<br />reviewing books by, for, and about women

1843650495|4.0|I just wanted to warn potential buyers that this is only the first part of the \\"Little Women\\" story.  This edition only goes up to the chapter titled \\"Aunt March Settles the Question.\\"  This is because this is the Chrysalis, which is a UK company.  In general, the UK publishes Louisa May Alcott's books separately as \\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives.\\"  However, in the US both parts of the story have usually been published as one volume entitled \\"Little Women.\\"      Otherwise, the story is wonderful and follows four girls in their trials and tribulations.  Certainly one can read this book only and get a good story.  However, parents who are getting this for their children should also look into purchasing \\"Good Wives\\" or at least getting a US version with both books included.  The book is printed on thicker paper than typical paperbacks and has interior color illustrations (watercolor, I think). This book is nicely put together--just remember that the story continues in \\"Good Wives\\".
0321525655|5.0|I finally had a chance to read Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds. Garr is a leading authority on presentation design and delivery, advocating his minimalist (or \\"Zen\\") approach to presentations. His blog is one of the most visited web sites on the subject.<br /><br />That's what 50% of this book is about, convincing the army of business managers writing thousands of PowerPoint presentations every day to drop their bullet point slides, take off big corporate logos from their slides and use more images supported by minimal text. It is an important message and I forgive Garr for repeating it many, amny times throughout his book.<br /><br />The other 50% is focussed around taking the designer approach to presentations. I enjoyed reading backgrounds on Japanese and Zen culture and how they can be applied to good design. I did learn a few things about photo composition.<br /><br />The book is nicely illustrated with example presentations, and many \\"before and after\\" slide transformations.<br /><br />Having read slide:ology by Nancy Duarte just a few days a go, it is interesting to draw a parallel. Slide:ology contains more practical presentation advice: how to define color schemes, specific examples about slide build up. Presentation Zen adds more on the create design process, esthetics, and photo composition.

B001ACY8D2|5.0|With their fifth album, Icelandic quartet Sigur R&oacute;s may have earned the dubious honour of \\"most un-pronouncable title\\" or \\"worst album cover\\" ever, but it's also their most accessible album, a strong contender for \\"best album of the year\\" honours.<br /><br />If you've never listened to them, it is difficult to describe their sound. Their lead singer sings in an ethereal falsetto, usually in their made up language Hopelandic, against a dreamy melodic folk/quasi-symphonic backdrop.<br /><br />Opening cut \\"Gobbledigook\\" is a clap filled Folky affair. \\"Við spilum endalaust\\" took me by surprise, an upbeat Pop song that one could easily imagine on a Coldplay album.<br /><br />Spare and cathedral sounding is \\"Festival\\" which builds to a towering climax. \\"Suð &iacute; eyrum\\" is a delicate piano ballad with tumbling sounding percussion building in as the song progresses. \\"&Aacute;ra b&aacute;tur\\" is an angelic sounding spare ballad one could imagine on some soundtrack to some epic. It features the 20 member London Oratory Boys Choir and the 67 piece London Sinfonietta.<br /><br />\\"&Iacute;llgresi\\" is a lovely acoustic ballad, and the absolutely stunning \\"Flj&oacute;tav&iacute;k\\" is a piano ballad that finds lead singer J&oacute;nsi Birgisson's falsetto soaring vocally to Heaven.<br /><br />The brief \\"Straumnes\\" is an ominous sounding instrumental, and closing is \\"All alright\\", their first foray lyrically in the English language. A tender lullaby-like piano ballad with Birgisson singing in a frail lower register in the first half. He might as well be singing in their signature Hopelandic from his warbling. Still, a stirring and beautiful song.<br /><br />So many adjectives could be used to describe this album; ethereal, melodic, magical, hypnotic, hymnal, and they would still not be enough to describe the beauty of this stunning album.
0143038419|5.0|When I finished this book I promptly kissed the cover, turned it over, and started reading it all over again. As another thirty-something woman who suffers from depression, longs to better understand my own Eastern religion, and craves how to find pleasure in life, Gilbert's emotional journey touched me and inspired me so directly that I was sobbing in gratitude for the special gift I felt I received from reading her story.  I alternately laughed and cried throughout the book, but more than anything was able to connect to my own thoughts, feelings, and experiences in new and meaningful ways just by reading the author's revelations and insights about herself.   Although this book probably appeals most to those like me--those who share a great deal with the author's voice and experiences--the story is still an engaging one for anyone who can appreciate humor, adventure, romance, and a good dose of spirituality.

B000002X4T|5.0|If you like Jefferson Airplane, and you don't own 'Volunteers,' you are missing out. It's one of the band's finest moments, and contains some classic songs.    First, after the release of this album, there would be some major changes. Drummer Spencer Dryden and Marty Balin would both depart from Jefferson Airplane.    But back to the album. Every song here is great, but the standouts are the title track, which has to be one of the best protest songs of the '60s, 'Wooden Ships,' a song written by David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Kantner on Crosby's boat, 'The Good Shepherd,' 'We Can Be Together,' and the psychedelic 'Eskimo Blue Day.'    The album cover is supposed to be like the front page of a newspaper. The cover photo I have always found to be very interesting. It shows the band just sitting down and relaxing.    Overall, if you don't own 'Volunteers,' you are really missing out. This is a classic Jefferson Airplane album, and a must own if you are a fan. I highly recommend this to any Jefferson Airplane fan. This is the band at their finest.    Highly recommended for any Jefferson Airplane fan. This album is a must own.    ENJOY!!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|An exceptional achievement by its emotion and spiritual depth. The only regret, not minor for a Christian is that the resurrection of Christ, commencement of the Faith, is only too quickly raised. Without the Resurrection, the mystery of the Passion does not make sense.
B000002X2B|5.0|While yes, this is under the title of Paul Kantner & Jefferson Starship, it is still a Jefferson Starship album, in my books, although this could have easily been released as a Jefferson Airplane album.    With musicians like David Crosby, Jerry Garcia, Grace Slick and Mickey Hart chipping in, Jefferson Starship's 1970 debut album is a classic. Who hasn't heard 'Have You Seen The Stars Tonight'? It's a classic, and a nice, calm, relaxing love song.    Also here are 'Starship,' which is a seven minute science fiction rock epic, and 'X-M,' another cool song that's a great one.    The musicianship here is incredible, as is the cover art. It's very psychedelic, and the letters are written in a very cool font. The cover of the album is definitely a highlight here.    Overall, if you want to hear the OFFICIAL Jefferson Starship debut, buy 'Blows Against The Empire.' It's a classic, and if you like Jefferson Airplane, you will appreciate this album just as much as the die-hard Jefferson Starship fan will.    Highly recommended for any Jefferson Airplane or Jefferson Starship fan. It's a classic.    ENJOY!!!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|this movie is one of the best i have ever seen.  i am a long time fan of SATC but even people who havent seen the show can relate to it.  there are so many amazing scenes...some are funny, some are emotional, but all you can relate to in one way or another.  to tell you the truth, i wasnt prepared for how emotional the movie would be...but it was!  i refused to watch a preview or read a review before i saw it, so i had no idea what was going to happen.  and i LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!!!
B000LPS47U|4.0|Beware all those who are squeamish or easily offended. Re-Animator is of the old school B-horror movie class that revels in gore, nudity and all around madness. It is the perfect melding of humor and horror, as madly brilliant medical student Herbert West perfects his procedure of reanimating the dead. Once perfected (on a very put-upon cat) West begins to reanimate all the dead bodies he comes across, and since this is a horror movie, he stumbles across quite a few. Again, because it is a horror movie the path to perfect reanimation does not run smooth, and West must face the dire consequences of his actions.   The special effects in Re-animator are quite good for 1985, and the tongue-in-cheek tone of the movie makes them even better. They were meant to be laughed at, even in 1985. The acting is much better than the average horror movie, particularly Jeffrey Combs, as the monomaniacal West. In plot, acting and effects the movie is just fine; its in the details that the movie goes gleefully off the rails, making it the most fun horror movie of all time.
B000Y179KO|3.0|I've been an Eagles fan since I was a teenager. They still are a great band, but It's sad to admit they have lost their creativity. No song of Long Road gives the \\"let me hear ths song again\\" feeling, besides Don Felder shines more being absent! The band lost a great talent when he left. The songwriting lacks innovation and the lyrics are sometimes very stupid. It seems to me they tried to play this one safe, after all, old loyal fans would buy it anyway (as I did... dang!).
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Caveat Emptor: If you are looking for a jazzy, upbeat musical, if you're looking for Gene Kelly to tap dance across the screen, if you're looking for lines of chorus girls in sparkly outfits or a plucky, cock-eyed optimist to belt out her troubles, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a bloody gorefest with a mad killer stalking his victims through shadowy streets, look elsewhere.  If musicals annoy or don't make sense to you, look elsewhere.  For everyone else, bon apetit.    Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, a Gothic musical thriller set in 19th Century London, is a tale of revenge, murder, cannibalism, rape, corruption and madness. It's told through Stephen Sondheim's hyper-intelligent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics and Tim Burton's mad-cap and macabre aesthetic. Burton films Sweeney Todd in an over-the-top stylized manner, reminiscent of the German Expressionist horror movies; with mad angles. The London he creates is a bleak, Dickensian cityscape of skeletal buildings and depressing gray skies that rain dark drops of blood. The characters that inhabit such a city are dark and drab to match their surroundings, or brightly flamboyant in colors as lurid as their characters. If such a visual style sounds almost cartoonish, it is; and it works. For a story as dark and morbid as Sweeney Todd, an unworldly aesthetic is needed to keep the world from resembling our own too closely.    The story is simple and dark as a Grimm's fairy tale. Sweeney Todd was banished to prison by a corrupt judge who lusted after Toddâ(tm)s wife. After twenty years, Todd returns to London to find that his wife is dead and the lecherous judge has adopted his daughter. Bent on revenge, Todd returns to his original home and profession, opening a barbershop in the home of his old neighbor, Mrs. Lovett. But the road to revenge is never straight and when more bodies begin to pile up than were expected, Mrs. Lovett comes up with an ingenious plan to dispose of them and improve her failingmeat-pie business at the same time. This grisly tale is told through Sondheim's brilliant songs, sometimes haunting, sometimes hilarious, always memorable. Burton and his cast bring the songs to life remarkably well, particularly Johnny Depp. The slight harshness in Depp's voice conveys the utter despair of the character perfectly. Helena Bonham-Carter is the weakest vocally, but her characterization is superb and outweighs her musical shortcomings.    Sweeney Todd nearly defies classification. No other musical is as grim and macabre; no other musical has such gleefully black humor, and no other musical surpasses its \\"genre\\" to be such a haunting story of humanity in an inhumane world.
1400079276|2.0|Haruki Murakami said, in an interview, that he was trying to use simple language to tell a very complicated story in KAFKA ON THE SHORE.  He lamented the fact that most authors seem to be doing it the other way around.  He might be right about that, but I'm not sure why that's such a bad thing.  In fact, if you take KAFKA as his argument for a new stylism, then I've gotta vote on the side of the complicated words telling simple stories.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that KAFKA reads like the shadow of something much, much better.  Or, better yet, like a mosaic of pieces that have broken off of better ideas.  It's a complicated story, alright, about the intertwining fates of a fifteen year-old runaway with an Oedipal curse and a mentally handicapped man named Nakata (who, incidentally, can speak the language of cats).  Punctuated throughout both stories are seemingly disconnected eccentricities: soldiers who never age, a Colonel Sanders pimp, otherworldly coincidences, dream-shifts, transdimensional beings, and -- possibly -- incest.  Lots of incest.<br /><br />There's a very real possibility that I found the novel so distasteful because the first tale is told from the point of view of the runaway, Kafka, who, it turns out, is a really bad storyteller.  \\"Artists are those who can evade the verbose,\\" Murakami writes in this novel, and yet Kafka never fails to describe in droning detail the clothing and accoutrements of everyone he meets.  Maybe that's just a testament to Kafka's shallowness, his pervasive pubescent indigence, his inability to see beyond his own needs.  (Although, instead of \\"needs,\\" I should write \\"sexual desires.\\")<br /><br />Ironically, Murakami includes a discussion on Chekhov halfway through the book.  Chekhov wrote that if, in a play, we see a gun on the table in Act One, buy the final act, that gun should have been fired.  It's an excellent rule, an argument not just for necessity and meaning, but also for narrative import.  Murakami writes, on behalf of Chekhov, \\"What doesn't play a role shouldn't exist.\\"  And then he fills this book with the most bloated nonsense: an out-of-place argument against women's rights that contributes nothing to the story, detailed explanations of food and forests, and lots of lingering descriptions of Kafka's genitalia.<br /><br />I get that Kafka is fifteen, and perhaps obliged to be phallocentric, but it doesn't make him a very sympathetic character, which is unfortunate, because he's half of the book.  He is running away from a dark and foreboding family life, and he carries with him a disturbing, sexy prophecy, handed down by his father.  Kafka behaves, at first, as if he is running away to avoid this prophetic curse (and believing this makes the first half of the book bearable), but Kafka eventually embraces his fate, rationalizing his actions by saying that he doesn't want to be at the mercy of anything but his own decisions.  Romeo makes the same delusional argument at the end of Shakespeare's play, just before he kills himself.  The argument in this case has a similar effect, although instead of resulting in the death of a character, it simply kills the story.<br /><br />The trickiest thing to this kind of off-the-wall fiction is focus and meaning, and Kafka has none of either, although he does a lot of aimless searching for the latter.  The most effective part of the book is the half that follows Nakata, a man who appears to be mental disabled, but who has strange and intersting powers.  Nakata is being led by some unknown force on a quest for an \\"entrance stone,\\" and along the way he encounters whisky mascots, some unusual precipitation, and a surprisingly helpful trucker.  Nakata is an endearing character, if not one-note, and his story -- even with some of its unexplained nuttiness -- has some drive and consistency.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it doesn't batten down the emotional mess with which it is paired.  Murakami is trying to make a much larger point, he's trying to demonstrate the subtle geometry of love and loss, and longing and belonging.  It's like using math to explain the motion of waves on the shore: the equations are complicated, dark, and perhaps unending (and, ultimately, unsolvable).  It's intriguing, I'll give him that.<br /><br />But even the best ideas need limits, and this book sprawls all over the place like a stoner who's passed out on your couch, spouting pseudo-philosophical non sequiters and self-referential witticisms that aren't nearly as sly as they think they are.  Characters get into herky-jerky dialogues just so Murakami has a chance to make a quick comment on the nature of symbols, or consciousness, or what it means to exist.  He crams these bite-sized philosophy prompts and lectures into the lines and instead of being profound or thought-provoking, they cripple the already glacial pace of this book.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with absurdism that a little humor and self-deprecation won't fix, but there's none of those things in KAFKA ON THE SHORE.  Instead, it's a pastiche of barely edible egoism, a shotgun approach to metaphysics and spiritualism.  In the last third of the book, Murakami writes, \\"Taking crazy things seriously is a serious waste of time...Pointless thinking is worse than no thinking at all.\\"<br /><br />I can't say I agree with that statement -- not 100%, anyway -- but if you do, then you're better off not reading this book.s trying to demonstrate the subtle geometry of love and loss, and longing and belonging.

B00003CXCT|5.0|This set was purchased as a Christmas present last year and the gift was really enjoyed a lot.
031606792X|1.0|What it comes down to is this; Breaking Dawn is just not a good book.    The first three were mediocre at best, but they had entertainment value even if they lacked any kind of substance. This book takes everything I didn't like about the first three in crams it into a big mess of ideas and plots that go nowhere and accomplish nothing except to distract the reader from the poor writing and the lack of any kind of coherent plot.    **Spoiler alert**    The first half of the book is nothing that anyone didn't expect. It was fairly boring, but it seemed to fit with the rest of the series. Bella and Edward get married, (seemingly ending the Jacob vs. Edward issue) and go off to have a picturesque honeymoon on a private island. The dream is complete and wish-fulfillment is at its peak. Honestly, she should have just tacked this onto the end of Eclipse and called it a trilogy.    Except then things get weird. And not in an \\"Oh, this is an interesting plot twist\\" sort of weird, but in a WTH? kind of way. Somehow, Bella gets pregnant, tossing all her old theories about reproduction out the window. (Which doesn't make a lot of sense, considering all human bodily fluids turn to venom when someone is changed. Except apparently seminal fluid can still impregnate humans. Magically. Through magic.)    From there it spirals downwards to various uncomfortable movements that made me go \\"Wait a minute, isn't this book written as a young adult book? As in... for 13 year old girls?\\" That doesn't stop Stephanie from having her leading lady Bella downing human blood, suddenly enjoying the taste, and having her new husband rip through her uterus with his teeth so that she can give birth to her new demon spawn.    Also, it displays poor writing to write in 1st person through three books and then change perspectives for part of the fourth. Being able to write the entire story through one persons eyes is part of the challenge of 1st person, IMO. Despite this, it does supply the only good thing about this book. Jacob's chapter titles. I think I would have liked this book better if he had just killed Rene-whatever right after her morbid c-section.    The third part involves lots of talking and posturing and chagrinning that culminates eventually at a battle scene where there is more talking and posturing and chagrinning and only one person happens to die because \\"SM didn't feel like killing 90% of her cast.\\" If you don't have the guts to kill anyone DON'T BUILD UP TO A MASSIVE FIGHT SCENE. Do something else for God's sake.     In the end, this was just not a good book. The writing was worse than the first three, the characters were suddenly out of character and there were loads of creepy moments that aren't suitable for the age group this book is being published under. In trying to give the fans and herself what she wanted, SM created a contradictory book full of plots that went nowhere (the whole J. Jenks thing? Elaborating on Leah's character so that she could... um... do nothing?)     She tied everything off with a pretty little ribbon where everyone (except Leah) got a happy ending whether they liked it or not. I found it more than a little creepy that Jacob imprinted on Rene-whatever. Because even if NOW he isn't sexually or romantically attracted to her, we are led to assume that in seven years he will be. So it's okay for a the person that raised her almost like his own child to marry her in seven years? Just because they are not biologically related doesn't make that feel any less like incest.    Beyond this, Bella's sudden change from being awkward teenage girl to being mostest perfectest vampire ever was beyond irritating. Bella is the key, Bella saves the day, Bella is the most prettiest vampire evar and doesn't care about human blood because she's better than that. Her being a newborn without the overwhelming hunger made no logical sense and was a huge cop out. Her battling to control her new appetite would have made for a much more interesting read than her \\"battle\\" with the Volturi.    Instead she has to battle with her sudden addiction to sex?     In any case, I did not find this to be a good or worthwhile book. It took me longer to read this than it did the others because at times I found myself just not caring. There is no conflict or sacrifice. Everyone gets a happy little ending and Bella gets everything she's ever wanted in the entire world and all she had to do was make herself a perfect victim.     I could go on, but there's really no point. Happily I am not one of the people that paid money for this.    And as an aside, I am sick and tired of people saying to cut Stephanie a break because it's FANTASY. It's just FANTASY. I've been reading fantasy since I was six years old and every single author I've read (even the bad ones) at least understood their own world and their own characters. They were consistent and did not push the bounds of suspension of disbelief. Just because it is fantasy does not give her free rein to feed her readers crap and expect them to swallow.    \\"The difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense.\\" -Tom Clancy
B000IFS0HM|5.0|McCourt's child protagonist and his over-riding optimism, his natural-born inclination to make the best of things, makes an otherwise grim tale not only bearable but uplifting and heroic. Despite the daily, brutal grind of poverty, this child still manages to experience, wallow in, simple joys. Due to McCourt's honest voice, I felt every one of this kid's untidy, conflicted emotions. I LOVED this kid.    But after reading some of the criticism here, I think some people forget that this is first and foremost a MEMOIR. Memoirs are subjective by nature. So if McCourt's personal experience shows prejudice toward the Catholic Church, or if he seems to present a \\"stereotype\\" of the drunken, morose, Irish----that's HIS viewpoint----naturally. If you want a more balanced view don't read memoirs! Read academia! (It's like reading an autobiography of a politician and complaining that it's too political).    I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. The naysayers included. It's not a pretty story, but it IS heroic.
1416523359|3.0|There are moments in this book, like when the husband dies, when Lisey's confronted in the study, and also in the flashback scenes, where the old King seems to be writing and its thrilling to read because he puts you right there in the moment...3 stars for those pieces.   But then there are moments when the story just treads water and it seems like he's trying to stretch the book and is stopping to smell the roses and describe thunderstorms...very romantic. Its a far cry from the books he wrote in the past where things pick up about a 1/4 of the way through and the story just picks up speed and its all guts, death, gore and glory by the end. Love in those old stories was a tool used to conquer evil in the most desperate moments.    Lets face it King is writing for a different audience now, some who wouldn't like the rawness of IT or Tommyknockers, and they seem to like it.    Hey, SOWISA Stephen, good luck.
B000BPG2JC|5.0|The Wyoming sheriff narrates a flowing story that includes: local streets, paths, roads and landmarks; Indian lore and culture; historical events.  In short, the author mixes the real world with fiction so the story seems real.
0385340990|5.0|I started this book last night and couldn't wait to get back and finish it today.  The concept of reading a book with just letters did not (initially) appeal to me and I doubted that you could get good character development.  I was so wrong!  I loved the first part of the book immensely and it weakened just a tad at the end but it was a lovely story with a wonderful ending.  I loved it!
B000IVW25M|4.0|The dvd arrived in the specified time frame and was in wonderful condition upon arrival.  I would buy from this group again.
B001AHM2C6|4.0|love it...always makes me want to see the movie again so can't wait till the movie comes out on DVD!!!
1400063515|5.0|This book reminds us that skepticism and empiricism are virtues that we ignore at great peril. It paints broad strokes so don't expect excessive details since it's meant as general advice and as a warning. It's rich in sarcasm and humor, so if you like your books dry and mirthless you might not like it's style. It's content however, is concise and effective in making its point that something is wrong (decision making madness on a colossal scale) and tips to avoid making those mistakes in your daily life. I think that people who like to make up their own minds (or are often called upon to make them for others) will find this book invaluable for it's timeliness and clarity. Personally, I also loved the fact he has Eco and Mandelbrot in this book.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Amazing in every way, well worth the money you are paying for. Made with such care and passion, you will want to share it with others to see.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|they had to make it hd-dvd.<br />i can see that blu-ray is where things is going.<br />i want this so bad.<br />ill have to wait till it comes out on blu-ray.<br />after seeing and hearing whats been done i cant wait.<br />i got the big burr for this...lol
B00003CXA6|4.0|Gettysburg is a great movie, and one of my all time favorite war films.  When I watched this I had an old love for history rekindled. I then went and read the book that this movie was based off of \\"Killer Angles\\" by Michael Shaara.  Then from there I started looking up some of the characters like Chamberlain, seeing as he's not taught in schools, to find he did exist, he was there, he did do that, and from there I decided to study the Civil War.  Civil War enthusiasts, will enjoy this film, it's heart touching, and shows you in a vague manner, what the war was like.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I wanted to add a note that I was very surprised this only has 4 stars on here. To me this is their best work, an absolutely stunning album. All the more so, as it was not expected at all. I love the first 2 albums as well, but this feels like a real work of genius to me. I hope they'll release another one day.
B000UJCALI|5.0|The Shining strikes me as one of only three Stephen King adaptations that are completely successful, the others being Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption.  Unlike that other film, The Shining was from the start in for a substantial makeover, in this case by Stanley Kubrick and his co-screenwriter Diane Johnson.  For this reason, the film has never really pleased many fans of the original book who believe that films must be faithfully and accurately transcribed to screen in order to be considered a successful adaptation.      Watching The Shining today, what strikes one are the uncommonly elegant sets, the lack of special effects (one trick shot of the hedge maze notwithstanding), the gliding Steadicam cinematography and the tricky tone the film manages to maintain between horror film, domestic drama and very black comedy.  There are scenes in the film that never fail to make me laugh and others that give one the appropriate creepy frisson expected of a horror film.    The film takes a distinctly more psychological approach than the novel.  While the hotel does appear to be truly haunted in the film (Danny sees ghosts, Jack appears in the portrait in the final shot, etc.), it's also possible to read all of the scenes between Jack and Lloyd (the bartender) or the Grady (the former caretaker) as the delusions of an alcoholic having a breakdown.  Certainly, the subtext is at the very least made quite clear.  Oddly, the one scene in the film that I recall making clear beyond question that the supernatural is at work (when the ghost of Grady opens the storage locker door to release Jack) is actually ambivalent.  Jack speaks to Grady through the door and we simply hear the door being unlocked while the camera remains on Jack's face...the next time we see him he is hacking away at the bedroom door with an Axe. Perhaps he used the ax to bust open the locker door himself?  In any event, Nicholson is great in the film, perhaps his finest performance.    The Blu-ray is (asexpected) notably crisper looking than earlier DVD's.  There is some grain evident and the colors don't quite \\"pop\\" in the same way that they do for some more recent films but this is undoubtedly the best The Shining has ever looked on video.  Considering this is one of the best photographed films of it's period, I think most people will be pleased with the picture.
0061122416|1.0|I was really looking forward to read this book having heard so much about it. I was utterly disappointed. Quite honestly, I am puzzled how this book earned such rave reviews (\\"will change your life\\" etc.).  The book is simplistic, naive, cute maybe.  It reminded me of the time when my mother read stories to me when I was a little kid.  I would rate it with zero stars if I could.  The book is thin and you can read it easily within two days or one if you got the time.  I would not waste my time on it.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This was one of the most boring movies I ever saw!  It makes the word love truly just a \\"four letter word\\".    I even brought it to work and let my coworkers borrow it to get their opinion.  Only one out of six said it was worth watching.  I gave the movie to them!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I consider \\"In Rainbows\\" the best Radiohead album.  I cannot remember having listened to a CD as much as I have been for months now to this one.  Not only one of the best Radiohead CDs but one of the best CDs in the last two years. Should be on everyone's CD rack or iPod.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I love Loreena McKennit and here with An Ancient Muse I love her even more! She has such strength and purpose and her passion comes through clearly in all of her songs. Even the instrumentals are extremely moving. I never grow tired of Loreena and I hope she keeps on going strong!<br /><br />Beautiful...as usual!
B001BKXUOQ|2.0|Psychosocial, admittedly, is a basic riff that is repeated throughout the whole song and doesn't really offer anything new. However it's catchy, heavy and fundamentally the only reason I bought this album. It was the first single and is the best song on the album.    Gematria, is the 2nd best song. Faster and more aggressive then the others, which takes Slipknot back to their roots of their self titled album which featured all the nu metal classics including Wait and Bleed, Surfacing, Sic and Eyeless.     Compared to Iowa, this is a more melodic, cleaner sounding album with less 'shouting' and more so called singing by Corey. It's more of an reincarnation of the Subliminal Verses, if alittle more experimental. But does it live up to ones expectations after 4 years of Slipknotness existence? No, not really.    So why not? None of the songs, apart from the two mentioned, stand out. I'm not saying they are 'filler' tracks, but they offer nothing new. They are simply reincarnations of every other slipknot song. Technically, they are impressive and one would wonder why this album was still such a dissapointment, even if there is some serious headbanging to be done here.     I'll let you decide. If you want pure, uncommercialized brutality, buy their first self titled album, or any other for that matter.
B000001EEN|5.0|I know the history of this concert, but just the pairing of this group is so fun and exciting for the listener.the remastered cd from 95 is the one I own. The only other thing I hope for is this entire concert on dvd-hopefully the artists will agree to release it some day
B000URDEB0|4.0|A lot of people compare the old lead singer to the new one saying that the old lead singer is better.  I agree that the old lead singer had more talent but I think both styles of music is totally different.  The songs on this CD would not work well with the old lead singer.  I actually like the new sound of Nightwish but I also like the old sound (they are both good to me).  I do not give this CD a 5 star because well every song on the CD is not good.  I do not like Master Passion Greed and 1,000 Nights is ok at best for me.  The rest of the CD I do like (some songs better than others).  Another reason I do not give it 5 star is that the lead singer (both old and new) is not as good as the lead singer of Within Temptation (I like there style and music more than I do Nightwish although I like Nightwish).  It is a CD worth buying and a great CD.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Hands down, this is the best Tool album so far. The work is epic, and narrative and thematic elements weave their way through the entire album. Should definitely be listened to from beginning to end, in order.<br /><br />Production value is also highest on this album. Much clearer, punchier and polished than previous Tool albums.<br /><br />I bought this album for the song \\"The Pot\\", but it took me several weeks to get there, because I got stuck on the first track, \\"Vicarious\\". From there it was \\"Wings for Marie\\", written in memoriam for Keenan's mother. Then it was \\"The Pot\\", and currently I can't get away from \\"Right In Two\\".<br /><br />Amazing album, I can't recommend it highly enough.
B000IHYY52|5.0|If you have a Blu-ray player and enjoy Jazz this is a must have.  Each performance is great.  The styles of Jazz vary from performer to performer.  I like a variety of music so this was not a problem for me. It shouldn't for most either, since, after all, the performers are \\"Jazz Legends\\". The most benefit from this disc will be to those who have their Blu-ray hooked up to an audio system and especially if you can take advantage of the Dolby Tru-HD sound track here.  There is also a two channel uncompressed sound track.  I haven't been one to embrace multi-channel music but this disc is an excellent example of how surround sound music can be done right and with Tru-HD listening becomes quite an experience.  The mix is done as if you are in the audience.  The instruments are in front of you with just enough to surround speakers to give ambience to the music.  The video, of course, being in high definition, is stunning as well.  Legends of Jazz on Blu-ray is a real audio video treat and the price is no more than a typical CD.  Looking forward to hopefully seeing more of this series come to Blu.
B00005NRN9|5.0|This is an awesome way to introduce someone to the world of Cirque Du Soleil, the story is great for a first date(worked great for me!(saw it in 3d IMAX)) It takes you thru the different stages of life, from womb to death where a man finds love, above all else, is the most important thing...I wish they came out with a 3D/HD Version.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Just saw Jersey Boys and this CD was especially good. Shipped on time, good quality. Excellent
B000OT6V00|5.0|When you meet our hero, you should be shocked, but his character melts you, as he plays a charming soul. The action is different, but never the less required to give this film an edge, and the end can only ever be done in this movie, cool yet hot.<br /> Nope the guys won't see the romance, just the well hard action, but you girls will see his soft side, and oddly admire him.<br /> If you want a SCI FI film with a difference even a bit of, should I say cuteness?! He could be your hellish hero too.<br /> Always worth a watch, just see him get love advice from a kid on a roof.
B00169N0BK|1.0|Purchased it because of excellent reviews - also anxious to do my own printer profiles.  However, it doesn't handle CRT monitors and that wasn't made clear prior to purchase.  I had to send it back. I use both a CRT and an LCD and of the two the CRT has the best color gamut.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I just finished watching Saw and thought it was a great movie.  maybe I need to watch it a second time, but my question is are we to assume Dr. Gordon was killed by saw and Adam never rescued?
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|My daughter got me to watch this when it first came out. Now Im hooked on it worse than she is. I have all the Harry Potter movies on BLU-RAY. I am such a big kid. The details on blue-ray are spectular. Wonderful addition to my movie collection.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|great movie that will keep you laughing. In some ways is a much more realistic look at how a regular guy would react if he was suddenly involved in murder and intrige.
B00110K62U|3.0|I LOVE LES MISERABLES DREAM CAST!!! The performance of this concert is THE BEST EVER. All the singers were awesome especially Colm Wilkinson!! However, the editing of this particular dvd did not do the concert justice. I am very disappointed about how they editted out Gavroche's performance. The little kid is such a great performer and for them to cut it out was just awful. They didn't even do a good job about it because cut him out after he already started singing and then they replaced it with an image of Javert looking down from a different part of the performance. Edit was horrible, but other than that, the concert is amazing.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|If you're a fan of the series, you've got to buy this. Fun pink storage case and all the episodes you love. =)
0446402389|5.0|This is one of the more hyped thrillers of the last year, and as is usually the case with that kind of thing, I went in a little suspicious. But Smith had me hooked by the second page, and I inhaled the rest in a matter of days.<br /><br />On the surface, it's a serial killer novel. But what makes the thing so damn compelling is that the killer is operating in Russia, in 1953, when Stalin's power is at its height. Because the State is perfect, there can be no crime; since there can be no crime, there clearly can't be a serial killer. Case closed.<br /><br />It's an incredibly effective device that pits the protagonist not so much against a monster as against the system, a system far more horrifying than any individual, a system that inflicts violence as a matter of course and calls it patriotism. While the book is a great read on a number of levels, Smith's finest accomplishment is the unrelenting sense of claustrophobia he invokes in a reader.
0061205699|5.0|Quite simply, one of the top three American novels of the 20th century. If not the best.
B000E33VWW|3.0|The only reason to make a film about someone as controversially repugnant as Truman Capote would be to illuminate his greatest quality- his superb prose writing. At his best, Capote was one of last century's greatest wordsmiths. Instead, the current film, Capote, focuses on the lesser things the man was known for- his showmanship, sensationalism, and homosexuality- although in that last category what is shown is tame and watered down. Now, I'm not saying that a full fledged swordfight between Philip Seymour Hoffman (who plays Capote) and Bruce Greenwood (who plays his lover Jack Dunphy) was necessary, but since the film focuses on the six years Capote was researching and writing his 1965 non-fiction novel In Cold Blood, because of his homoerotic attraction for one of the two killers the book follows, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.), it would have illuminated something more about the man. Of course, what creative processes were behind Capote's creation of what he termed `a whole new form of writing'- the `non-fiction novel'- would have been even better.<br />  That said, these elements, which are the fault of the screenplay by Dan Futterman, adapted from Gerald Clarke's biography Capote, are the only things that keep this good film from greatness. All the rest of it, including the direction by Bennett Miller, is superb, starting with Hoffman's stab at the icon. This is not a hagiography, and the film makes several wise choices, of which showing Capote's flaws is one. Another excellent choice is to not do a cradle to grave biopic. By focusing only on a few year period it allows us a look at a pivotal point in the character's life. But why, then, not go deeper into the creative processes of the artist? Why not try to provide some insight into why this meek, little man would be so attracted to an amoral thug? Manifestly, there is nothing left to get at with the November 15th, 1959, Holcomb, Kansas murders of the Clutter clan by Smith and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). As with Leopold and Loeb, before them, and any number of spree killers after them, they are relative ciphers. So, why Capote's need to `understand' them, especially Smith, if not the homo-eroticism? Unless the whole point of the film is to show us Capote as a vampire, waiting for the pair's execution so he could have a good ending for his book.<br />  Yet, there was so much more to be mined- Capote's relationship with Jack Dunphy- both as a lover and artist. Considering that Dunphy was not in a league with Capote as a writer would have made their dynamic all the more interesting, as well giving the criminally underrated Greenwood (so good in the cult tv series Nowhere Man and as JFK in the Kevin Costner film Thirteen Days) a chance to show his considerable acting chops in a major role, in an arts house film. Another waste was the whole presence of Capote's childhood friend, Catherine Keener's (Nelle) Harper Lee character, despite her solid portrayal, especially considering her own one hit wonder, To Kill A Mockingbird, was big right at this time.... A final point, though, and that is with the title of the film. Given the wise decision to not go cradle to grave, why such an all-encompassing title? Why not something more specific and germane to what is onscreen? As with much else in the film, such as Hoffman's over-hyped, but solid, performance, it is these little niggles and wrong turns that make so much of what the film does right go wrong enough to just miss being something truly great.s with Leopold and Loeb, before them, and any number of spree killers after them, they are relative ciphers.

B0013J9KOO|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Plenty of good action scenes and special effects.  Probably about as much as the first film, if not a bit more.<br />*Production design (costumes, props, settings, etc) is phenomenal.  Retains much of the same stuff from the first film, but expands it hugely with loads of new creatures and very big locales.  Also added one or two cool new weapons.  But for the most part, it's highly imaginative and fantastic.<br />*Storyline is good.  It's easy to follow.  Actually pretty similar to the first film, both in structure and in the mixture of action, romance, and comedy.  Also expands some things more, particuarly in regards to the myth and fantasy elements.<br />*Characters are just as much fun as before.  Good writing and acting.<br />*Not bad music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Probably not for young kids; contains some gnarly creature violence (just like the first one).<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Seems to be quite a departure from the previous film.  It was mostly a gothic comic-book style film, whereas this one is much more like a fantasy (or specifically, a fantasy following in the wake of \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\").  Can be considered good or bad.<br /><br />As said above, it feels a little less like a comic-book film and more like some kind of fantasy.  But it remains very true to the style, characters, and conventions that were established in the first film.  Overall, this sequel is a little bigger, more ambitious, and much more imaginative.  I found it to be a great deal of fun, and would reccomend it to anybody who enjoyed the first \\"Hellboy.\\"
B00005K3NR|5.0|I recently got this movie on blu-ray and it's beautiful. More clear and very colorful. I can't wait for the Chloe Moretz remake! This movie is very creepy. A teenaged girl named Carrie White is always being picked on and made fun by the sexy teenaged girls. (Her psycho God-crazed mom doesn't help.) The girls even threw towels at her while she was crying and having her period. When the gym teacher; Miss Collins sees this happening, she forbids them to go to the prom. Sue Snell, who was throwing towels felt bad and told her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom. Chris Hargensen, one of the girls who hates Carrie plans a terrible revenge that involves pig's blood and asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan to help her. Prom night; Carrie and Tommy are having a wonderful time and (for some reason) win prom King and Queen. After they celebrate, the blood is dropped on Carrie, and the bucket drops on Tommy's head and kills him. Soon, everybody laughs. What Chris and Billy didn't know was that Carrie had telekinesis and uses her powers to kill just about everyone in the gym. Later, Carrie's mom tries to kill her, but Carrie kills her mom and their house falls in and kills Carrie also. The very end with Sue putting the flowers on Carrie's grave and a bloody hand pops up is awesome. Hell, the whole movie is awesome. I would love to take Carrie to the prom. If you love horror, revenge, and proms, you'll love CARRIE!!!
0374280967|4.0|In its own little way Alan Bennett's novella about what might happen if Queen Elizabeth II were to become an avid reader is almost a perfect entertainment. Not much happens in it until the very end, but the pleasure of the work is in how Bennett takes us to his comic denouement very cleverly and unobtrusively. This is really a book meant as a bonbon for people who are themselves great readers, and (particularly) readers of very intelligent (mostly British) novels (the queen's first escapade as a reader is by picking up a copy of an Ivy Compton-Burnett novel, and her new avocation receives impetus when she reads THE PURSUIT OF LOVE and LOVE IN A COLD CLIMATE; she continues through Anita Brookner and Henry James and Vikram Seth, with Proust an interesting sidebar for her along the way). There are real lines to treasure, such as the queen's reactions when her subjects tell her about their fondness for Harry Potter (Bennett's imagined queen, we learn, does not care much for fantasy). After the Helen Mirren film THE QUEEN it might seem there is not much left for a writer to do with the figure of Her Majesty, but Bennett very cleverly creates a scenario by which a monarch might capitalize on her very special status among her people to imagine doing something which is both precedented (as she is quick to tell others) but which is still very surprising.
B0019EXZXU|2.0|I thought this was going to have hard-core action, but I didn't know it was about stealing safety deposit boxes, and in one of the boxes, has pictures of a royal princess getting naked and getting gang-banged by some black guys! It was just alright. If it wasn't for Jason Statham being in it, I probably wouldn't have watched it. I wouldn't recommend THE BANK JOB!!!
B001DHXT1G|5.0|Being a huge fan of the tv series, and not a huge fan of the first one, I have to admit I was skeptical.  After seeing this in the theater, I was not disappointed!  It feels a lot more like the tv series, which I love.  The big green guy definitely delivers this time with the action scenes, which were probably the best of the superhero flicks this year (school yard scene was incredible!).    Edward Norton was great also, although I'm very interested in seeing what his version would have been.  His dialog does seem stripped down for the first half hour, which definitely has that \\"Bourne\\" feel to it.  I think if they would have met somewhere in the middle on this section of the movie it would have been perfect.    The blu-ray on this release is a must have with all the features that are going to be included, and the limited ed. \\"green-ray\\" box art.  IMO, 2nd best movie of the summer behind The Dark Knight.
B000OPOAMA|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie. (Which is now the 4th Hannibal movie in the order it's supposed to be.) Hannibal has been hiding in Italy from Clarice and anyone else who is looking for him. A dirty cop named Pazzi finds out who he is and tries to get the reward for his capture. Mason Verger wants revenge for what Hannibal made him do, and Clarice just wants to find him and put him in prison. If you love cop thrillers, and the Hannibal movies, you'll love HANNIBAL!!!
