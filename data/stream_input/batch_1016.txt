0143038419|2.0|Will traveling around the world help Ms. Gilbert deal with depression?<br />Maybe, it certainly couldn't hurt and it's sure worth finding out.<br /><br />The novel is a 2006 memoir of Elizabeth Gilbert which chronicles her trip around the world after her divorce and takes the reader with on her journey of self discovery.<br /><br />Ms. Gilbert paid for the trip with an advance she received on a book she planned to write.<br /><br />After the difficult act of divorce the author spends four month in Italy (Eat), four months in India (Pray) and four months in Bali (Love).  While telling the reader about each location, Ms. Gilbert also dwelves into self analysis finding spirituality and emotional balance.<br /><br />The book simply didn't speak to me.  I couldn't feel sorry for the author, maybe because the story of her divorce isn't complete and the missing pieces seem essential to understanding the tragedy  (not to mention all the guilt she felt with really explaining why).<br /><br />If the writer wanted to sound candid and likeable she missed that goal right in the first five chapters.<br /><br />All the self analyzing and pontifications drove me crazy - it was OK in the beginning as we were just getting to know the character but the continuation of it, page after page with noting happening, no story and no plot.<br />The writer, who is excellent at her job, seems to be begging to be the center attention with everyone's empathy shining on her.<br />How can you go to India, witness heart breaking poverty and still think that your comparatively luxurious life - not to mention getting paid for one year what most of those people will not earn in a lifetime - is dark and unforgiving?<br />I fear that if that doesn't put one's \\"misery\\" in perspective they are beyond help.<br /><br />The book was boring, full of not-so-enlightening, shallow observations and self pity - it bordered on whiny even though I wouldn't go that far.  I did not find anything remotely profound or helpful in it - and that's OK but usually when I read artificially feel-good books I know what I'm in for and this one took me by surprise.<br /><br />If you are one of those that found this book life changing - that's great and more power to you. But refusing to grow up and elevating trivial matters to Olympic altitudes, to me, is neither wise nor enlightening.<br /><br />Just so all the fans of this book understand - this is my personal observation and I am by no means saying this is bad literature, hence the two stars - this is a stylized piece, the writing is very good, the deprecating humor shines through and the format is inspiring - but it just not did not speak to me.el-good books I know what I'm in for and this one took me by surprise.

B002HK9I04|3.0|The writers of South Park are equal opportunity offenders so watching their show and this movie, you should expect to be offended--and learn how to take humor in that.<br />If you are really pent up, or legastic, or super conservative, you will not like this movie.  If you can laugh at yourself, at society, and at culture-roles, you will find this freakin' hysterical.<br />I have seen this twice now, and each time feel as if I need to go to ask forgiveness afterwards.  It's SO bad...!<br />The music is what sets this apart--and won it awards.  The complex mixture of something classic like this music with the class-less storyline makes this a contradiction that is a success.<br />Not for the slight of heart.  ;)<br />Consider yourself warned ;)
1439148953|1.0|After all the hype about this novel, I was greatly disappointed in its plot andcharacters. The main character, Eilis Lacey, drifts through her new life in Brooklyn for three-quarters of the book. During the rest of the work, she drifts through her time in the Old Country. There is absolutely nothing interesting about this young woman, nothing at all. It was described in one review as a quiet book. Quiet is not the correct adjective-dull is a more apt description.
1932100660|5.0|I read the book and immediately could relate to the information revealed by Dr. Campbell. I've been to China and seen the difference between their diets and our American diet.  Also noticed that when our Chinese co-workers ate out every day with us Americans the Chinese complained they gained weight within a very short time.    For many years I've sensed that nutritional information provided by physicians, diet plans, educational books did not make sense; and by getting higher levels of nutrients from eating plant-based whole foods, I understand how this could reverse the effects of high animal fat, protein diets. My family is high risk for heart disease and I intend to reverse that.    Several years ago I read another book \\"Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating\\" [Paperback] by Walter C. Willett and P. J. Skerrett. It was the beginning of my transition to a more natural diet. However, the \\"China Study\\" pushed me to consider the vegetarian or vegan diet. As a result my husband and I have begun transitioning to a vegan diet.     The China Study is not a diet book. The author merely reports his research results for the reader to come to his/her own conclusion. He also exposes the background of the American diet and recommended daily requirements. He innocently found the results of his study and after many years of research knew that Americans needed to know what's behind our confused state of mind pertaining to diet. I am not surprised the number of doctors, industry leaders who will try to negate the information from this book.    During the past month it has been an intense period of learning about wonderful ingredients (all plant based) we never knew how to use and to create wonderfully delicious meals. I am amazed at the \\"cleanliness\\" of meal preparation. No more greasy dishes to clean up. It feels good to adapt to this lifestyle. It's an adventure we have decided to take, and believe will take us a healthier place when we are much older. Thank you Colin T. Campbell for exposing all of this.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Whenever you go see a \\"Twilight\\" film, you don't go in expecting to see the grandiloquence of Fellini, the depth of Bergman or the unconventional dialogues of Jim Jarmusch. You know what kind of films these vampire movies are. The first target audience is the teenagers, then the adults who keep the teenagers in them alive. There is of course nothing wrong with that. I find that these films are made with honesty and a true desire to entertain while being respectful to the books.     I find it amazing to witness these talented filmmakers (the next one being Bill Condon) relaying each other in order to bring these stories alive. They each bring their own strengths and visions, thus keeping the whole process fresh. It can't never truly be like the books cause cinema and literature aren't the same art form. They both have their own rules. But I find it fun to see what part of the story will remain and what part will not.  Especially considering the fact that a new book came out portraying one of the new born vampires. We get to see parts of that small book on the screen and that was a pleasant surprise.     In \\"Eclipse\\", I was glad that the work was done by the director of \\"30 Days Of Night\\". You know right then that the action will be well handled. As for the more sentimental stuff, he can only put in the script what's already in the book. And even though a majority love the books, we can fairly say that they are also a bit cheesy (but not in a necessarily bad way). Inevitably, the film can only be \\"cheesy\\" at times. Again, that doesn't make them bad in any way. Just fun, entertaining and wonderfully cheesy. Like a guilty pleasure.      I do find that all the actors and actresses were good (even getting better and better) but I still have a problem with Kristen Stewart. She blinks a little less but she just won't stop fidgeting in an unnatural way. It looks too much like acting. But I was pleasantly surprised by Robert Pattinson and how mature he appears. I still thinkthat Taylor Lautner tries too hard to talk with a deep voice but his charisma wins over. I missed the terrifying calmness of Michael Sheen but I never get tired of Dakota Fanning. She really is chilling. But I miss Rachelle Lefebvre. Bryce Dallas Howard is a gifted and beautiful actress. But Rachelle has an edge that is truly hers. She appears strong. Bryce appeared weak. I do not remember Victoria as a weak person even though she gets more or less easily killed. Bryce doesn't scare me. Rachelle does (I'm not really scared but you know what I mean).     I'm still dumbfounded though to see how much people seem to not like \\"New Moon\\". Although I enjoyed \\"Eclipse\\", I feel like the second opus was the best movie so far. Not only in term of the story but also in terms of the directing. I really felt like Chris Weitz cared for his characters. Don't get me wrong, I like David Slade and I liked the \\"Eclipse\\" movie. But I do feel like this third act was more a case of delivering what was in the book than it was an act of love from the director.    Now, I can't wait to see what Bill Condon will do with \\"Breaking Dawn\\". How lucky the fans of \\"Twilight\\" are to have him close the final chapter to this cheesy but truly fun saga.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|I am and always will be a huge Ozzy fan.  I have lost track of how many times I have seen Ozzy in concert with or without Black Sabbath.  The guy is just a phenomenal musician.<br /><br />That said I was a little disappointed to hear Zakk wasn't going to be on this album.  I also remember being heartbroken when I heard that Randy Rhodes had died.<br /><br />I approached this album with a little trepidation because Ozzy's best work comes not just from his Writing and Singing but from the chemistry that occurs with the musicians he collaborates with in the studio.<br /><br />He found unmatched Chemistry with Randy and lightning struck twice when he got Zakk.  I think everyone can agree that the years without those two have been below par albums in comparison.  I get the feel this even has less chemistry than the Jake E. Lee time.  I am a bit disappointed even though I still really like the album.<br /><br />It is like having your favorite dish with one or two of the ingredients missing.  You still like it; but it just isn't quite the same.<br /><br />I am enjoying it, but it is still running a little light on the richness of the flavor.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|If you're a fan of Wes Anderson, this should fall right in line with what you would expect from him. Quirky, colorful, unique, and fun! This movie although based on a classic children's book is more intended for a mature audience. Sure kids will enjoy the look of the film, but some of the dialogue will go over their heads. This movie also really shines on Blu-Ray as you can see the details in striking brilliance (check out the fur).     The movie itself is just a reminder of why watching movies can be such a great experience as you are transformed into this animated world of talking animals and greedy farmers. I was transfixed at the overall aesthetic of the entire film. When you've finished watching the movie, take your appreciation to a whole other level by watching the making of documentaries which chronicle the painstaking process that went into creating the characters with real puppets (in different scales) and what goes into creating stop-action animation. It's a shame that more people have not been exposed to this little gem of a film. But hopefully over time more people will get the chance to be charmed by this movie in the same way that I was.

B003JSU2NU|5.0|I've been listening to the Eclipse soundtrack since I got it a couple of weeks ago.  I love it!  Now that I've seen the movie (just yesterday), I think that the songs fit really well with the scenes in the movie.  My favorite song right now is \\"Heavy in Your Arms.\\"  I also really like the \\"Ours\\" by The Bravery.  \\"Chop and Change\\" by The Black Keys, \\"A Million Miles An Hour\\" by Eastern Conference Champions, and \\"Jonathan Low\\" by Vampire Weekend are some of the other songs that I really like.  \\"Jacob's Theme\\" is a nice soothing instrumental piece also.

B002ZG99CC|3.0|First of all don't go into this movie expecting it to be exactly like the original \\"Karate Kid\\" because it's not. With that said, I think Jaden Smith did a pretty good job. Firstly, I don't like the fact that this movie is set in China. Secondly, I think Jackie Chan's performance was below his talent. Third, this movie was over 2 hours, and that was way longer than it had to be. Certain parts just dragged it out longer than it had to be in my opinion. Fourth, the jacket on/jacket off metaphor for was kinda lame. Then again, so was wax on/wax off, but ultimately when it came together it worked. I do like the fact that Jaden Smith actually got a chance to kick some butt in this movie seeing as how any real \\"Karate Kid\\" fan remembers that Daniel LaRusso got his butt kicked the whole movie. Including, the tournament, and in the end he does some kinda kick winning the whole thing. At any rate, I do think that Jaden Smith should keep acting because he does have a talent for it braids and all.

032147404X|5.0|I first grabbed this book as a complete amateur who only knew that taking a picture required me to click a button. Kelby's writing style and easy going nature made it easy for me to understand what he was talking about and enjoy reading his instructions. I'm not very technical when it comes to photography so I was thankful that he made it possible for me to understand and execute his tips. I believe every starter should grab his books, I loved this one so much I ended up purchasing the other books in this series as well. If I could give more than five stars I definitely would.
0714843377|5.0|This book has short, 2-page essays on a variety of topics related to being creative.  I read the whole book in a couple of hours.    The essays themselves urge you to think differently about what it means to do your job (the assumption of the book is the job is advertising but the lessons apply pretty much anywhere).  They urge things like seeking criticism, taking responsibility, not being afraid to fail, etc.  All good things if you want to stand out from the crowd.  All inspirational.  And all things I will strive to remember when I head for work tomorrow.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Eclipse is a very good adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's book. There is a good balance between the tension between the characters (particularly the triangle - Bella, Edward and Jacob) and action.  I read an interview with Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner where they talk about the differences between New Moon and Eclipse.  The overall feeling of both actors was of Eclipse presenting more emotional of the development of the characters.  The rivalry between Edward and Jacob is palpable and Kristen Stewart plays off the emotions very well.  Clearly, she is committed to Edward but she has to deal with her feelings for Jacob. Overall, the comfort level of the actors in their roles is better.  Taylor Lautner, in particular, filled out Jacob's character very well. One could feel Jacob's frustration.     I liked the presentation of the sub-plot stories of Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone).  Rosalie's brooding over Bella's choice to become a vampire is explained in a well-acted scene and Jasper's character develops showing his strength of character.   I would have liked a bit more of Rosalie's story on her transformation into a vampire but I also understand the need to keep the film within a reasonable timeframe.  The battle scene between the newborn vampire army and the Cullens and werewolves was nicely orchestrated with just enough emphasis of the individual fight scenes. The concluding scene between Edward and Bella about their marriage and her transformation gets us ready for the final installment.  How will Bella deal with her parents after she becomes a vampire? Overall, a well-acted and beautifully paced film.

0143038583|5.0|I already knew quite a bit about the ubiquity of corn and the issues with our food supply from watching King Corn and Food, Inc., and doing some other reading, but this book was a much more in-depth account of how our food is grown, made, and processed. His book is well-written and insightful. I don't think Pollan casts any corporation into the role of villain as some reviewers have said. His book provides information and the readers are, of course, free to choose on which foods to spend their money. (I'm sure I'll still eat at McDonald's occasionally.) I think more people would be appalled if they knew more about the food they eat and they'd change their eating habits and demand higher quality food.     I'm glad I read it - and I'm glad I live close to Polyface Farms!
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|This throttle quadrant is great.  Works beautifully and adds another touch of realism to flight simming.  As for those people who have calibration issues, it just takes a little tweaking.  Initially, I had the same problem with the throttle and propellor levers but I figured it out.  As I moved the aforementioned all the way up and down, they would only register from about 21% to 79%, so I could not get the full range.    First, go to the Saitek website and download the latest drivers.  Second, in FSX, assign the throttle, propellor and mixture to the appropriate levers.  Third, in FSX, Controls, Calibration, set the Sensitivity for all three levers all the way to the right and set the Null Zone for all three levers all the way to the left.  That's it.  Try it now and it should work perfectly.  Enjoy!
0316044938|2.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" has all the ingredients for a really good story, if not a truly great one.  The problem is......there's really not much of a story here, as much as observations and back-story. Must almost every sentence be followed by paragraphs on-end of back story and reminisce??  This writing style quickly becomes annoying and ultimately destroys the story.  Quite frankly, the lovely bones as a narrative of events as they unfold is about 20 pages long...the remaining 200+ pages are filler...most of which is semi-poignant at best.  One credit I give to the Author is the very real element of grit and complexity of human emotions, actions and reactions when and after loved one dies, especially a child. This quality would truly shine if not for such choppy storyline, constantly interrupted with introspection and back story. I am not an enemy of either...if used in balance with the fundamental storyline. I also felt that most all of he characters, with perhaps the exception of Lindsey and possibly her Mother,  were never fully ripened.  Harvey's character study was perhaps the most lackluster, with only a brief glimpse of what made him who and what he had become.  Truly disappointing.
B002ZG9760|5.0|great pic of alex pettyfer in 'popstar' mag.  other than that, nothing much has been mentioned about the summer release.  alex was in 'tom brown's school days' and 'alex rider: operation stormbreaker'.  they were hoping for a full series of movies based on the books, but 'rider' bombed at the box office.  alex did a great job in both movies, esp. 'rider'.  it is good to see him back and working.  i hope he gets the recognition he deserves, even if it is only becuz of people wanting too see vanessa hudgens at the movies.    the added bonus of neil patrick harris, might bring in the adults as well, making it a family movie nite.  the story is 'beauty and beast' told from the beast's point of view, which hasn't been done before.  alex spent 4 and half hours in make-up (and 1 and half getting it off) every day.  but i hope we get to see a lot of him as he is as well.  he has certainly worked hard in everything he has done.  (martial arts and stunts in 'rider'.)  he deserves a break.
0981951244|5.0|If you only keep a handful of books on your nightstand, this is one that should be there to read again and again. It is simple, powerful, and contains the fundamental \\"recipe for success\\" that when employed should get you to exactly where you want to be.

1453605738|1.0|The font is too small. I'm not sure what point the author is trying to get across with this tiny font, but it fell on deaf ears, mostly because I couldn't read the book. I tried using a magnifying glass, but because I like reading outside the pages caught on fire. The book's only redeeming quality is the picture of a pretty dress on the front.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|What a fun movie. The story is outstanding and the animation is wonderful. The cast of voice actors do a fantastic job of embracing their characters and advancing the storyline through deliciously-quotable dialog. For younger viewers, the movie is captivating and compelling while higher-level jokes and cultural references abound for the benefit of adults. Both touching and humorous, this is a great example of a creative and interesting movie perfect for family and friends of all ages.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This video is awesome!  I used to be really athletic and alternate weight lifting and cardio every day for an hour back when I was training for sports, but this video's higher levels kicked my ass!  What you definitely need for this video, though, is a set of hand weights.  I substitute 5 pound books for them, but they do become cumbersome for some of the moves, so I would suggest getting the weights if you can.    First of all, I would recommend that you alternate all 3 levels of the workout if you can.  Working the same muscles with the same movements every day on the same level could lead to overtraining, which could give you injuries that would prevent you from working out in the long-term.  But if you alternate the videos (level 1 day 1, level 2 day 2, level 3 day 3, level 1 day 4, etc.) it would be easier on your muscles since you're doing different movements on different muscles every day. If the higher levels are too hard, just try to do the easier movements demonstrated until you can fully do the harder things.    Secondly, if you can, try to prolong the cool-down and stretching after the workout.  At the end of the videos, Jillian leads you through a 2-minute stretching period, which honestly is not enough of a proper cool-down to prevent injury.  You don't want to randomly stop your intense workout, stretch for a few minutes, and then sit on the sofa for an hour.  If you can, try to do easy cardio (like walking around the house) for several minutes, and then go through the stretches.  This is what I like more about the P90x videos - the longer cool-downs after the workout helps your muscles settle down easier.    Finally, make sure you always keep your muscles engaged!  Especially during the ab workouts - many people may be tempted to relax their muscles and go through the last minute of their circuit pretty much taking a break from the workout since the ab moves aren't too difficult, but try to imagine \\"your belly button going into the ground,\\" as Jillian says, so that you don't skimp on that part of the workout.  And never relax your arm muscles when you're reaching them out for the strength exercises either.  As Jillian says, don't drop them!  So don't slack off when you're doing this video!    I'd also like to add a note that I suffered from shin splints for the last year, but I could still do this video!  After a month of working out with this video pretty much every day, I tried to go running again, and my shins had no problem running 3 miles in 25 minutes on a slow jog, and I felt that my legs were stronger to carry me through the running as well.  If you have lower body injuries, just do the less impacted jump training modifiers that she leads you through to minimize further problems.  For those who say that they're getting knee injuries from this workout - you are probably doing the exercises wrong.  Remember to always keep the knee BEHIND the toe, and try not to even bend it forward at all.  Those exercises are meant to work out your butt, not to see how much you can bend down low with your knees jutting.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While the detractors may think every 5-star review on Amazon is \\"fanspam,\\" I can safely say that it's not. I bought Firefly after seeing some episodes at a friend's house and have not been disappointed. I've watched the whole series twice and enjoyed every minute. It even inspired me to watch the movie (Serenity) and get the comic books, because I wanted to know more about this fantastic universe.<br /><br />The characters (particularly Mal and Jane) are superb and the writing is the right combination of exciting, witty and comical. There's not a throwaway episode in the bunch, which is hard to say for any sci-fi television series.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD a year ago, and after the first attempt at level 1, I thought I was going to pass out. I know that she says no breaks, not even for a glass of water, but I think I would have had some serious problems if I hadn't rehydrated a few times during those first few workouts. But I noticed that as the week progressed, I needed to stop fewer and fewer times, until finally on the 7th workout I was able to complete it without stopping even once! She was right, you really notice your body getting stronger and adapting to this workout.     It was difficult to measure my progress, though. I didn't lose much weight, but I figured that maybe I'd built muscle, and since muscle weighs more than fat, it would have been hard to judge my progress based on my weight. But I did feel that I looked better, but since I hadn't taken measurments before beginning the 30 Day Shred, I couldn't tell if I'd lost inches or not.     After a few weeks, I got lazy and stopped doing the DVD. But now I'm starting up again and I just did my first workout to it in a year. And OUCH!!! My body is screaming at me all over again! haha I don't think there's a single muscle in my body that doesn't hurt today: my arms, legs, abs, chest, back, shoulders, everything got a beating from this DVD! And that's only level one.    It's definitely intense, but you know what they say: No Pain, No Gain!

B0000700KQ|5.0|It was a great movie.  My wife and I didn't really know much about it, just been told many times to see it.  We \\"figured it out\\" in one viewing (spoiler: the first half of the movie is a dream, she's jealous, etc).  The bad reviews here are a real ego boost for us, lol!  The more passionately written ones are the best.  Funny how much people will hate something they are too stupid to understand.

0312370830|2.0|Two stars for opening the window - a little bit - into an ugly and little-known history of how the French police rounded up children and their mothers for eventual transport to Auschwitz. Told through the experience of the child, Sarah.      The modern-day story built around this core narrative was, for the most part, forgettable fluff.

0143116177|2.0|Never have I so looked forward to a book, only to be thoroughly disappointed. I was looking forward to a life's work on the true history of money, and by extension, the development of trade, civilizations, nation states, etc. Yes, I was expecting a lot. What you get is a scattered bunch of individual anecdotes mixed with several \\"I told you so's\\" from which I learned little. In the end, I felt the true purpose of the book was only to pad the author's bank account. He would have been more honest if he had written a trashy romance novel. Hopefully, someone will see the value of what the title of the book suggests and take up the challenge of writing a true history on the subject.
1423113497|4.0|Okay, so the story was fun.  The characters were fun.  The book was definitely a page-turner.  The only SMALL guff I had was that all the chapters follow the same pattern: the heroes meet up with some villain that needs to be trounced, they figure out how to trounce the villain, the villain gets trounced.  Rinse, lather, repeat.  NOW, having said that, the DETAILS of each villain and each trouncing change fairly radically from chapter to chapter, and they are truly a delight.  So this is a recommended read: it creates a fun new world, has characters who (though a bit slow on the uptake at times) are accessible and fun, and it also slyly slips in a basic course on Greek mythology as it careens on its rocket-propelled journey.    The books are fun.  Good, good fun.  And, honestly, some days that's just what the doctor ordered!
1878424114|5.0|\\"The Seven Spiritual Laws Of Success: A Practical Guide To The Fulfillment Of Your Dreams\\" by Deepak Chopra is a short and simple book, but also one that is also profound and enjoyable as a guide filled with timeless wisdom and practical steps you can apply to create more success in all areas of your life.  It is based on his longer book, \\"Creating Affluence.\\"<br /><br />Chopra begins by saying these are also the laws of life, and that they are the same principles that nature uses to create everything in material existence.  He then defines success as the continued expansion of happiness and the progressive realization of worthy goals.  He says success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.  He then briefly describes the concept of laws.  After these definitions, he proceeds to go over the seven spiritual laws of success and how you can apply them in our lives.<br /><br />Each of the chapters begins with a couple of sentences regarding the law.  Then there is a quote related to the concept.  Then there are a number of pages explaining the law.  Finally, each chapter ends with some steps for applying the law.<br /><br />The first law is of pure potentiality and is based on pure consciousness, which is found through practicing silence, meditation, and non-judgment.  The second law is the law of giving.  He notes that it could also be called the law of giving and receiving, because the two complete a dynamic exchange, and the more you give, the more you receive.  You practice by giving and being grateful for all you receive.  The third is the law of Karma, or cause and effect.  This refers to action and the consequence of that action.  You learn to make choices and recognize the consequences of the choices you make.  The fourth law is of least effort, and as Chopra explains, the law is based on the fact that nature's intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned carefreeness.  To practice this law you practice acceptance, responsibility, and defenselessness.  Law five is that of intention and desire.  This chapter helps you understand your desires and relinquish your attachment to the outcome.  The sixth law is of detachment.  According to Chopra, to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish your attachment to it.  The seventh, and final, law is that of Dharma or purpose in life.  This chapter focuses on our unique talents and how we express it.  It's about our true self, our unique talents, and service to humanity.  The book then has a short conclusion that brings everything together.<br /><br />Even though the book deals with complex topics, it is written in a very easy to understand manner.  The book is short and can be read quickly, but will have a more profound impact if savored slowly.  One should take some time to understand how the laws can be applied to one's life through the suggestions at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />This simple book really does share some powerful principles to live by and help you create a more satisfying life.  I've just read it again for a reminder of what's important, and to help ground me toward living at a congruent level.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks..

B0036S4CTS|4.0|This book was a nice surprise.  I loved the way the charactors developed and was pleased with the resolution.  Of course, I would love a happy ending but the end was believable and gratifying. I found the book to be thoughtful and well written.
B000002KO1|4.0|The Pretenders' debut is one of the most well-endowed arguments for gender equality in rock music.  Rock `n' roll is the most predominantly masculine genre in popular music.  Its appeal is unisex, but its foundation is strictly masculine.  So a performer like Chrissie Hynde is a precious release from a style of music chiefly populated by men: Hynde is woman just as Mick Jagger is man, her sex an attribute of herself rather than a political tool.  I bet Hynde could throw down with Jagger, too: she's similarly focused, clever, funny, aggressive, and--here's the deal-sealer--human.  She digs tattooed love boys, wonders about the lovers of today, and wishes he'd realize she doesn't care about his private life via reggae that could compete with reggae-rock pioneers the Police.  I love her Kinks cover as much as I appreciate her sense of humor: \\"His face went berserk and the veins bulged on his ... brow.\\"  The band's good, too.

Outstanding story that needed to be told. I share it with anyone that is willing to listen.
030726999X|5.0|Although my lengthy wait for this \\"last book in the series\\" ensured that I had to work hard to remember who was who and had to plod through the first third of the story, this novel did not disappoint. Larsson describes the Swedish political system and its machinations in far greater detail that he did in the previous two volumes - and the relationship he describes between the press and the government and society is very interesting. Between the thorough description and the odd setup of circumstances, there is a terrific buildup of suspense. And the ending will not disappoint. As for the characters, they're terrific. I love Lisbeth Salander - the first Aspergers-like female protagonist ever, I think! - and Kalle Blomkvist, and there are several compelling new characters. If you loved [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]] and [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]], you'll probably love this book, too. In any case, you'll have to read it! Don't you want to know what happens to Lisbeth and Kalachenko?????
0553381687|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />I'll update this review when I'm done with the book. But, I just had to say this is the best fantasy I've read in years.<br /><br />Update: Just finished. The book is fantastic and I highly recommend it. However, this Kindle edition is so full of typos and spelling errors that it is very distracting. This was my first Kindle book. I hope that future books on the Kindle are not as error prone.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Take notes; if you're going to do a remake, THIS is how it should be done.  It kept the heart of the original movie while creating its own legacy.  Both Daniel LaRusso and Dre Parker are suddenly thrust into a world that is completely foreign to them (Daniel, a new transplant to California living, comes to realize how far from paradise this place really is, as he has to contend with trying to fit in, making new friends, and avoiding the school bullies; while Dre, who really is in a foreign country--China--has these same issues to contend with).  Both mothers are widowed and are trying to make the best of their situations with their only sons (which could be why they both seem oblivious to the pain and anguish their children are going through).<br /><br />Help comes for both of them in the form of mentors/sages Mr. Miyagi (for Daniel) and Mr. Han (for Dre), who teach them the true meaning of manhood and courage.  The differences are obvious:  age (Daniel is 15 going on 16 when we meet him; Dre is twelve years old), race (Daniel is Italian, Dre is African-American), and time period (Daniel lives in a simpler time of go-carts and video games, while Dre is a child of the new millennium).  However, the experience of a first love/crush, the wanting to be accepted by your peers, and the need for guidance is universal and rings true in both stories, as well as the loving but sometimes frustrating relationships between parents and adolescent children.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was one of those skeptics who vowed it could never be done, but in this instance, I'm glad I was wrong.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is an absolute treasure.  The camera work is as good as it gets for the era.  The film editors just mostly stood back and let the band rip.  So many times the cameraman and editors destroy awesome performances - not here.   This is fabulous.  Sure there are some cutaways (inserting other images/footage over the concert film) and extreme close-ups - but all of these are so brief and well-done they are not a problem at all.  (We've all seen concert films ruined by overuse of these techniques.)  The sound is excellent.  I can't say enough about how great this DVD is so I'll just repeat:  This DVD is an absolute treasure.    BTW, there are some drawn out improvisations, characteristic of the era.  But if you're getting the opportunity to watch the greatest at work (Page or Bonham solos) just chill out and be thankful for the opportunity to watch greatness in action.
B001DDBCUA|2.0|Ok, so I'll be honest.  I have only seen one full episode of the show and maybe five or six half episodes.  I never had HBO and so I'd watch it on occasion when on vacation and holed up in a hotel room.  I found it witty and at times engaging (and titillating) but it was never anything I needed to rush out and see.  In fact, I wasn't going to bother with ever watching the movies since, well, I didn't think I'd know what was going on.  The other night this came on and my wife suggested we watch it since it was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />OK.<br /><br />Thankfully, the few sporadic `half episodes' I did happen to see had introduced me to some key characters in the film.  I knew who Steve was because I saw a part of the episode where Miranda finds out he has an eating disorder (that was him, right?) and I knew who Harry was because I saw the episode where Charlotte got her divorce and I even saw part of an episode where she was disgusted with his body hair.  I actually had never seen an episode with Mr. Big, but everyone knows who he is (I have seen an episode with Aiden, so I was missing him).  I had no clue who Samantha's man was.<br /><br />Here's the thing, this film just doesn't have a lot going for it.<br /><br />I know that enthusiasts of the show itself will have a problem with me saying that, but I'm just being honest.  From my personal perspective (and maybe it's because I didn't follow the show) I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.  I thought that the wit, while present at times, was overall rather corny and underdeveloped and I felt that the chemistry between the actors was rather nonexistent.  Sure, the inner queen in me (it is a small queen, but she is there) was totally interested in what everyone was wearing, but aside from that I was kind of bored.  Certain aspects of the films plot I actually felt a minor connection to (I actually just endured the very thing Miranda and Steve go through, so I understood both sides of that case and loved the way it was resolved) but overall I found everyone so whiney and unlikable.  Miranda herself was unforgiving and hypocritical; Charlotte was underdeveloped and forgettable (and her constant reflection on her own `great and wonderful' marriage was rather pathetic); Samantha was somewhat engaging but overall a tad obnoxious and Carrie, well, she was probably the most likable character, unless you count Harry's pining over the women in his life (how sweet!).<br /><br />I know I'm going to be hated for this.<br /><br />I found the plot to be rather formulaic (I won't give it away for anyone who hasn't seen the film) and the script itself felt clich&eacute;d and amateurish.  I mean, was the entire series like this?  If so then I don't understand that HUGE following, unless you are watching it solely for the nudity and fashion sense (ha, watch for the clothes and for the lack there of).<br /><br />The acting was decent, with Sarah Jessica Parker taking the `best in show' mention (as I expected).  Jennifer Hudson wins the award for most awkwardly over-acted performance in a film for the year that was 2008.<br /><br />And what was up with Chris Noth's eyebrows?  Do they always look like that?overall I found everyone so whiney and unlikable.

B002UNMWAG|1.0|I wish I could give this movie zero stars....just a horrific mess.  I've seen better movies at 4am on Cinemax.  What a disappointment.  Terribly written, cheesy plot (if you call it that), poorly acted...just a gong show.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|I want to state for the record that I really, really love the original `Men in Black' film.  It is just ridiculously on-point.  It is one of Will Smith's more successful efforts in that the film is as good as he is in it.  That said, this sequel was a dismal disappointment that actually infuriated me.  How could it be THIS bad?  The reviewer for this site mentioned that it is a copycat, but I wouldn't be that nice.  This film doesn't have the insightful humor used in the first film.  Instead, this film feels very cheap in tone and concept.  It goes for cheap laughs as apposed to trying to build something original and fresh.  Smith and Jones try and elevate the material, but there really isn't anything to elevate here.  The overall plot is forgettable and the elements that are peppered in (like a love interest for starters) are clearly reaching, with no real roots to ground them into this thankless film.  The visual effects are decent, but nothing truly eye-catching.  The original film is one of the best science fiction films of the 90's, but this dud of a sequel represents one of the worst films of the 00's.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|'Aphrodite' is Kylie Minogue's 11th studio album and her first since 2007's release of [[ASIN:B0015I0HMC X]]. How does it measure up? To the delight of many fans, it's definitely not `X' or even close. `Aphrodite' is an album that chooses to overlook `X', what was supposed to have been Kylie's big comeback,  and instead takes Minogue back to her roots: pure pop, dance, music that sounds a bit like a flashback to a '90s gay club. Unlike `X', it makes no attempt to try to compete with what's considered \\"en vogue\\" now: it doesn't pull any addictive rips of Lady GaGa, it ditches the Bloodshy & Avant productions that have populated the latest releases from Britney Spears and Madonna and really seems to be made for Kylie's core audience in mind. The album's producer, Stuart Price (mainly responsible for Madonna's 2005 hit [[ASIN:B000B8QEZG Confessions on a Dance Floor]] and the latest Scissor Sisters album [[ASIN:B003LXM1RS Night Work]]) is at the helm of `Aphrodite' and while each song can stand on its own, he definitely gave the album a cohesive, streamlined feel. In a way, that's good - many were put off by the `X' album's lack of focus. For me though, the album could definitely have used a bit more variety.<br /><br />The Good: `Aphrodite' is a lot like a casual sex hook-up: the thought and anticipation of it is really thrilling and exciting and then after the deed is done, you realize it was a bit better in your imagination than it was in reality. `Aphrodite' is a quick-paced album; there really is no filler tracks that slow the pace of the album. Instead, Price put together the album to feel like one big party: you have a few \\"feel good\\" tracks to set the mood and dance and grind slowly to, some romp shakers and one or two laidback tracks to give you time to catch your breath. The album clocks in at about 43 and half minutes, a total of 12 tracks. Where `X' felt willing to take a few chances and deviate off course, `Aphrodite's is very focused and to the point. It's mission: to make you dance. It's a pure summer album: carefree, stripped of sad ballads, stocked full of dance beats and celebratory, happy feelings and lyrics.<br /><br />The first half of the album is probably the best. \\"All the Lovers\\" isn't the best track on the album but it's flirty, airy lyrics sets the mood and tone that this is an album destined for the clubs and dance floor. \\"Get Outta My Way\\" is the track where the album really heats up. It's fun, it has attitude and has Kylie making demands of her inattentive lover. \\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\" is very club orientated, with layers of sounds coming together to make a big hand-clapping party anthem. Other stand-out tracks are \\"Everything Is Beautiful\\", a very low-key with bubbly-prickly sounds in the background playing against a heavy drum that gets your head bobbing and the album's title track, \\"Aphrodite\\", featuring a \\"Rhythm Nature\\"-esque drum and military beat. If anything, \\"Aphrodite\\" could easily be considered Kylie's real comeback track.<br /><br />The Bad: I have to say ... that like a hook-up (my earlier analogy), `Aphrodite' is a bit of a let down after listening to it a few times. The first few tracks are fun, unapologetic dance, upbeat and carefree - then with \\"Closer\\" it stumbles somewhat and regains it's footing with \\"Aphrodite\\". The later half of the album though feels like one song put on replay with a different track backing. I couldn't help but to recall `X', and yes, I know it's an album that many Minogue fans disliked but what made that album stand out was that she definitely took some chances with her usual style and it produced some very catchy, pop, dance tracks. For me, half of `Aphrodite' just isn't entirely interesting. The lyrics aren't as deep, they sound a bit monotonous and even with Stuart Price at the helm, the focus of the album wanders more so than it did on `X'.<br /><br />Aphrodite' is all right but it feels stifled and timid - it's definitely Minogue back in safe territory after a not so warm reception for `X' but is it a comeback? I really don't think so. It's a fun outing though with some really nice dance tracks but I feel Kylie can do a bit better than this.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"Aphrodite\\", \\"Get Outta My Way\\", \\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\"m reception for `X' but is it a comeback?

B000BB14YY|5.0|A lot of my friends rave this film as one of the best films of all time.  I'm not in that boat quite yet, but I must say that this ambitious retelling of Shakespeare's `King Lear' is not just an impressive undertaking but it is also one of the more engrossing and rapturous `variations' of this story I've ever seen.  With great attention to detail and directorial flourishes that will keep the audience on edge, `Ran' is certain to leave a lasting impression.<br /><br />I'll be honest; I thought the opening segment went on for far too long.  In fact, I was becoming a tad restless waiting for the film to actually begin, but after all is said and done I'm actually glad they elaborated on that hillside opening, for it established character needed to truly flesh out the films many layers.<br /><br />The film tells the story of an aging Japanese Lord, Hidetora, who, nearing death, decides to leave his entire kingdom to his eldest son, Taro.  What seems like a good idea to him (and him alone) turns out to be yet another hasty and foolish decision on his part; a decision that costs him dearly.  His daughter-in-law, bent on vengeance over the harsh way her family was treated, uses her husband's newfound power to wreak havoc on the kingdom, and the jealousy that overtakes the Lord's middle son, Jiro, proves to be disastrous.  But there is always the youngest son, Saburo, whom the Lord banishes in the films outset due to his apparent disrespect.  With all the chaos surrounding Hidetora, chaos with which he had a direct responsibility towards, he begins to reflect on his own decisions and how they have placed him in the predicament with which he finds himself.<br /><br />Is there a road to redemption?<br /><br />What I found so fascinating about this film was the way in which it tackled so many weighty themes without ever feeling rushed or compact.  That may be due to the WISE decision to stretch this out nearly three-hours in length.  All three sons represent a completely different side of their father, and watching their respective stories unravel helps up understand fully the man behind it all, and the man who seems to be suffering the most.  In the final scenes, where Hidetora seems to understand where he went wrong and comes to his decision as to what he wants to do with the remainder of his life; it's heartbreaking.<br /><br />The performances are very strong here, especially from Tatsuya Nakadai, who really understands how to relate Hidetora's conflicted emotional state.  You can see the anger the brims from his confusion and the eventual stagnant complacency that comes from the understanding of complete failure.  Of the sons, I was most impressed with Jinpachi Nezu (who plays Jiro) and I also found Masayuki Yui's portrayal of the loyal Tango to be commendable and noteworthy.<br /><br />In the end though, the real star here is Akira Kurosawa.  He has shelled out quite a few masterpieces, and while I don't consider this his finest work (I go between `Red Beard' and `Ikiru') this is certainly one of his most respectable when you consider all the time, effort, a meticulous attention needed to make this work.  Not only is ever set piece authentic and eye catching (not to mention every costume) but every character is beautifully fleshed out and ever sequence is marvelously edited to create a cohesive and visually stunning work of art.  The battle scenes are flawless, and the tower burning scene is one of the most impressive sequences in the history of cinema; hands down.<br /><br />I recommend `Ran' without any hesitation.tching their respective stories unravel helps up understand fully the man behind it all, and the man who seems to be suffering the most.

B003IPC5SO|4.0|\\"All the lovers\\" is the lead-off single from Kylie Minogue's new album, a great Pop song with shimmery synths and slightly remniscent of her \\"I believe on you\\". It sets the tone for much of \\"Aphrodite\\" which is catchy Dance/Pop, produced by Stuart Price who has also worked with Scissor Sisters (on their new CD), Madonna and The Killers.<br /><br />The title track is filled with chunky tribal percussion and electric guitars. \\"Get outta my way\\" is a euphoric club banger (think \\"In your eyes\\" or \\"Love at first sight\\"), as is the incredibly catchy Techno-ish \\"Put your hands up (if you feel love)\\".<br /><br />The album is choc full of great tunes; \\"Closer\\" with swirling effects is haunting, the heavenly-sounding \\"Illusion\\" filled with dreamy \\"Ooohs\\" and \\"Aaahs\\", the buzzing Ravey \\"Too much\\" (co-penned by Minogue, Calvin Harris and Jake Shears), the guitar-festooned propulsive \\"Cupid boy\\", and \\"Can't beat the feeling\\" (nicely laced with cowbells).<br /><br />Standout has got to be the haunting sublime \\"Everything is beautiful, co-penned by Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley, and the closest thing to a ballad on the album.<br /><br />Nothing earth shattering, but a joyous Dancefloor experience, definitely her best album in my opinion.
0449227421|1.0|Pass on this book unless every thing else has been used for toilet paper or fire starter.<br />No it's not that bad but boring and never seems to end.  Had potential with the idea<br />and tied together nicely, just too many clich&eacute;s, and was a real let down.
0061122416|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. One friend that read it really loved it. Another friend couldn't stand it and couldn't even finish it. I went into it not sure if I even wanted to try. It turns out to be a very simple read. Nothing profound, no big flattering words, no elegant prose but I found myself enjoying it all the same. It had a lot of ideas and philosophy that I liked to sit back and ponder on. I love a book that makes you think. It is about a simple shepherd boy who seeks out his own personal legend. The book is about the journey he makes, the people he meets and the things he learns. Don't open this book thinking it is a literary masterpiece... just ease into it a look at it for the simple meaning and beautiful story it gives.
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is right up there with War and Peace and Dune in creating a world (in this case, worlds) and immersing you in it (them).  I read part of it in book form, and listened to much of it on my iPod.  What a treat it was on several LONG plane rides.  I have insisted that several friends give it a try; none had heard of it and all were astounded and grateful when they had read it.  This is a monumental and great work.
B003GEDLW6|5.0|I just love this album. Every song has something worth listening to. No filler here. What separates Pendulum from many other drum and bass bands is that they actually mix up the beats. This makes every song unique and not overly repetative. If you like drum and bass or electronic music, you will most likely enjoy this album.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I received my Blu-ray copy of this film while I was entertaining house guests. Being the selfish sort that I am, I insisted on watching it and not waiting days until my guests left. The female of the pair had barely heard of Rush, and was certainly not a fan. She even joked that it is \\"a guy's band\\". She watched the entire film, and said that she really enjoyed it!<br /><br />I can't add much that has not already been said in other reviews, but this is a film for fans of musicians, entertainers, and underdogs in general. Obviously it's all about Rush, but the story at the core is that three very talented musicians were able to achieve great success while maintaining their integrity (not just an illusion here) and creative freedom.<br /><br />The most enjoyable portions of the documentary for me are the exchanges between the band members, often very candid. It is clear that these men are close friends and care very much for one another - even beyond their bond within the band. I truly believe that they put their friendship above the success of the band.<br /><br />The Blu-ray and DVD contain about 1 1/2 hours of extra footage, some of which is priceless. My personal favorite are the scenes filmed while Geddy, Alex, and Neil have a casual dinner together in a hunting lodge. It is the single most \\"fly on the wall\\" portion of all the footage.

B002ECN4P0|2.0|I'm a big Stones fan. Let me start by saying that. The two stars is not for the music. That's 1000+ stars per song all the way. I'm writing this review more as a complaint than anything.    About 2 years ago, I reviewed 'Jump Back.' My opinions have not changed much. It's still missing many classic tracks from the 1971-1993 (actually 1989, because the last album represented on this album is 'Steel Wheels') including 'One Hit to the Body,' and 'Rip This Joint.' It also includes many single (meaning edited) versions as opposed to the album versions. So yes, that's still disappointing. For further detail on this, see my review on the original Virgin pressing.    Seriously, though, considering this, WHY REMASTER IT? Is it *really* necessary? This compilation as a whole is not good, and so did Polydor Records and the band really think it needed to be remastered along with the rest of the Stones' 1971-2005 output? I question if the band was behind the decision to remaster this or if it was Polydor. Regardless, it's not a good collection. Too many missing songs and WAY too many single edits.    Personally, I'd like to see Polydor get the rights to 'Rewind: 1971-1984,' which has been out of print for years in America and Europe. That collection, despite the fact that it stops in 1984, is far better and quite superior to this one in my opinion. No edits, and it also includes one of the best Stones songs (in my opinion), 'Hang Fire,' which is another track absent from this lackluster compilation.    Overall, Polydor has done a nice job remastering the studio albums from '71-'05. Buy those instead. If you are a casual Stones fan, start with 'Rewind: 1971-1984' (you can find it used really cheap here on Amazon), and if you must have 'Mixed Emotions,' 'Rock and a Hard Place,' and 'Harlem Shuffle' (all great songs, might I add), seek out 1986's 'Dirty Work' and 1989's 'Steel Wheels,' the albums in which those tunes are taken from. That's the way to go.     Unless you are on a tight budget or you are too lazy to seek out 'Rewind,' 'Dirty Work' and 'Steel Wheels' (or all of the studio albums from this era, which is admittedly quite costly, but well worth it), don't buy this album.     NOT RECOMMENDED.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is an easy read that I was unable to put down.  The characters are well developed and the book paints such a vivid picture, you feel as if you are there, on Himmel street, with Leisel, Rudy and their families.  I feel this book deserved more hype than it got, but then again--I think 2007 was around the time the Twilight books gained popularity for Young Adult readers--'nuf said.  I would give this book 100 stars if I could, I will never forget this one.
B00314VYNE|3.0|My daughter received this doll for her 2nd birthday.  Jessie is absolutely adorable.  My daughter has had the doll for 3 days -- the yarn hair is getting pilled, the shoes don't stay on, the belt comes undone often -- and if I have to put her hat on one more time! AHHHHHH!    I am disappointed.  We have Toy Story toys from 6 years ago that have weathered better.  It would have been nice if they figured out how to keep her hat on!      She is a really cute doll and her legs are very flexible -- even more than Barbie.  Arm's don't bend at elbows, but she is really cute.
B003CIG7AE|2.0|I wanted to really like this also (like everyone else who is a fan of the Band). But, after about 5 listens over 1 week, I never had any of the songs really \\"catch\\" on and latch into my brain. These sound like (dare I say) boring songs. Hopefully they will come back with things that are more deep and not so popish and plain. They are a great band, and I will try to get more into this and see if I change this review. Other than that, I am not a fan of this album.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|I had only caught glimpses of the Trailer so didn't really know what to expect. I don't want to give anything away so you can view this film with a fresh open opinion. I thought this was very well made. The acting is good (for the most part) the scenery is excellent and that music...Leonardo goes to Shutter Island to investigate a disappearance. The island is creepy as hell as are the inmates. You have Mark Ruffalo with a very good performance, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow were also very good in this. I especially liked Michelle Williams. I found it even better the second time I watched it. Enjoy :)

B0000VCZKM|3.0|Neither the best nor the worst musical in film history, but solid performances by all stars and truly stunning talent amongst the \\"orphans,\\"  especially Aileen Quinn as Annie and the little darling who played \\"Molly.\\"  Carol Burnett is a standout as Miss Hannigan as is Albert Finney as \\"Daddy Warbucks.\\"  Cannot overlook the supporting cast, especially Geoffrey Holder as Punjab.  My young granddaughters love this movie and watch it over and over again.  By now they can recite all the dialogue and sing along with every musical number.  It's a huge success at my house!  \\"Annie\\" gets a special thumbs up from my 2 year old granddaughter who sings and dances her way through every number and begs to watch the DVD over and over again when she comes to visit me.  It's her absolute favorite movie, one she watches over and over again and never gets tired of it!!

0385523386|5.0|Having taught Houses of Healing (emotional literacy course) in two women's prisons in NYS for the last twelve years, I thought I knew everything there was to know about women's prisons.  I was wrong.  As a result of my experience I was much better informed about prisons than most lay men/women.  My experience has pretty much challenged and transformed most of the stereotypes about prisons and prisoners I had accumulated as result of the media.  But I was never an inmate and that difference became clear to me as a result of reading Kerman's book.  I'm glad I read it because I will be a better teacher next term as a result.  I am going to recommend the book to my inmate students because it will give them hope.  And I recommend the book to anyone who has a relative or friend in prison, a women's prison, because it will impress upon you how much you count in helping them survive their sentence.  I say \\"women's prison\\" because I don't know about men's prisons.  I hope someone will write about men's prisons from an inmate perspective as well because we need to know about them.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|19 songs and not one clunker.  Amazing.  You don't even have to like the movies (which my son and husband don't).  But they were asking me - what we were listening to?  Nice selection of indy artists.
B003GDYN24|1.0|I will get it out of the way.  This album is one of the worst albums I've heard from an artist that I like.  Words cannot begin to describe my disappointment with this album.  Kelis, in my opinion, had not dropped an album worse than 4 stars until now.  Flesh Tone is a complete mess.  The creativity and direction she used to possess is no longer present.  Instead it's watered down into some euro/dance/pop garbage.      There's absolutely no soul, no funk, no creativity and no passion whatsoever.  Everything that made fans love Kelis is GONE.  Instead long time fans are treated to some kind of Lady Gaga/Kesha/Idontknowwhatthisis music.  Being a comeback album (her first in like 5 years) she provides 9 dance songs (better suited for a maxi single or something) zero ballads, zero midtempos and zero listenable songs.  If this is the best she could do then I would rather her wait a few more years to come back out.  Where's Bossy,Caught Out There, Get Along With You, Popular Thug, Millionaire, Milkshake?????    I'm all for progression in music or whatever but this is just terrible especially if you've followed Kelis since she was getting along.  Where's the attitude and personality???  Word of advice...leave the euro-dance songs to the people that actually specialize in it.  This album deserves 0 stars and is exactly what I will give it.  Unlistenable.  0 Stars.
0790744295|3.0|Creepshow (Snap Case) is a very uneven horror movies anthology which is a homage to 50's horror comics. Leslie Nielsen is amazing in his role as a demented killer in the segment called \\"Something to tide you over\\". The special effetcs are quite good and the music is very effective. My favourite segments are \\"Fathers day\\" and \\"Something to tide you over\\". I found the \\"The crate\\" and \\"The lonely death of Jordy Verril\\" to be ok. The last segment \\"They're creeping up on you\\" was not so good and could have been replaced with something else. Overall this is an entertaining movie anthology and I give it 3/5. 3/5.
B00337KM2S|5.0|During this last generation or so, it has been common for employees to have to travel extensively for their jobs, but usually not to the extent that Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) does in \\"Up in the Air.\\"  Ryan's job is anything but stress-free, either, as he has to fire people for a living in a very tough economy--he is hired to do so by firms that do not want to fire their employees themselves.<br /><br />Ryan leads a solitary life, but in the course of his travels he meets and takes an interest in hottie Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), a fellow road-warrior, and also meets Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young employee in his company who suggests changes that, if implemented, would radically change his job duties and lifestyle.<br /><br />In the course of the film, the issue of commitment, and how each of the three deals with it, surfaces.  Ryan states that he doesn't see many stable marriages, but he has no close family ties, no rich friendships, no absorbing and stimulating hobbies, no intellectual pursuits, and no acts of community service--nothing that would make an unmarried life fulfilling and rewarding.  When he is not working, he just rides on airplanes--period.  There is a difference as wide as the Mississippi between him avoiding what he sees as unwise or unhealthy commitments and simply damning existence altogether.  He does start to have feelings for Alex, and the viewer does ultimately see whether his dealings with Alex reinforce or dispel his reluctance to commit.<br /><br />The movie is rated R for adult content, but this is a movie that most children would not be drawn to anyway, as it is for mature audiences.  Even if you are not a big film buff, don't miss this one.  Since the film examines the issues of commitment and economic dislocation, \\"Up in the Air\\" might be seen decades from now as being emblematic of the late Aughts and early Teens.  It is very much a movie of its time.
B0000509C4|1.0|Creepshow 2 is a very bad sequel to the 1982 Creepshow directed by George A.Romero. The storylines seem to have been written as a failed high-school movie and the acting is subpar at best. The animated parts make the movie look cheap and they could have been animated much better. The music is cheesy 80's music at its worst and the special effects look cheap even for the time when the movie was made. I feel like I wasted time that I will not get back. I wish I could give it 0 stars but since I cannot then I give it a weak 1. 1/5.
B0000041LA|5.0|This is an incredible recording. The London Symphony Orchestra is at its finest in performance.  Ashkenazy at the piano was outstanding. The  the sensitivity displayed of both the music and the performance in the First and Second concertos shows Prokofiev's depth and understanding of the human soul.  The Third Concerto is stirring and truly a remarkable piece, difficult for the pianist to play as well as the orchestra. This is a great recording!
B000A2WNB2|3.0|I bought this for my Muse-fanatic wife and watched it with her as soon as it arrived. Though not nearly as good as the live HAARP DVD, it's still fun to watch Hullabaloo to catch a few more Muse tunes performed live. Musically, Muse lives up to their press as a sonically stellar live band. Visually, however, the video gets annoying to watch at times because they appear to live by the motto \\"let's see how many different camera shots we can squeeze into every song\\". So you really never get the sense you're actually at the concert the way you do with the HAARP dvd where you get a lot of time to watch the guys do their thing. My other complaint would be that we couldn't get the DVD to play on any of our DVD players and can only watch it on our computer. It must have something to do with the formatting and perhaps I missed the warning somewhere when I was ordering it. Still, it's Muse, and I guess even an \\"Okay\\" dvd is good enough with Muse -according to the wife.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|Kylie started the 2000's on top, her album \\"Light Years\\" put her right back where she belongs, as a first class dance-pop diva. \\"Fever\\" made her a star in America, and then came the downfall...  \\"Body Language\\" (an attempt to break further into American music scene with an R&B sound that turned into a snore fest) and \\"X\\" (An album not quite focused, with some great tracks and some uninteresting ones).   Kylie took time out to take care of her health and tour, etc etc...    But now Kylie is BACK to what she does best, fun peppy dance-pop to please her target audience (the gays).   This album is the most fun since \\"Light years\\" and the most interesting since \\"Fever\\", quite possibly her best work.     The album is a non-stop feel-good party of positive outlook on love and happiness, feeling fierce and mighty and being back to life! Every song is there because quite simply it is FUN, different kinds of fun...but always lots of fun. Kylie at her best, diva goddess majeztrix super star glamour fairy queen of the universe!

Despite the fact they were successfully bought by Amazon now,the eccentric story is unbelievably hard to comprehend because they are almost down to zero $$$ breathing in their last breath and decided to face the infliction of hardship to make their dreams a reality.

B003IPC5UC|5.0|Simply put, if you have enjoyed Kylie's music in the past you will love Aphrodite.  This CD is filled with potential singles and there's never a dull moment.  I'm not quite sure the U.S. doesn't embrace her as much as the rest of the world, especially since there is very similar music put out by current U.S. artists.  It seems that radio has been more open to happy dance music, but why we aren't hearing more of Kylie, I'm not sure.  This CD is filled with catchy pop tunes that will keep you dancing and smiling.  The quality and theme of this CD will surely be put to good use on her next tour, which Kylie has already announced she will do.  Let's hope there is enough support for this CD to warrant a few tour stops in the U.S.  I have seen her perform five different times and she is a superb live performer, and yes, she does sing live.

B0034JKZ86|3.0|While I enjoyed some of the characters (the frazzled firefly, Tiana, the rich girl), this was not my favorite Disney movie.  A little scary with all the voodooisms, and no memorable song.    It was funny at times, and a little bit romantic, although it never quite explained why Tiana fell in love with the Prince.    Oh well.  I may be getting too old to expect much from cartoons.    Nice to see a Black princess though.
061891868X|4.0|I have to admit that many of Dr. Smollin's discussions of string theory left me a little daunted; however, his almost fierce adherence to the key issue of theoretical physics was impressive and I think deserving of praise.  Although mine is not really a math-physics kind of mind, I do enjoy the topics of cosmology and theoretical physics as presented in the popular literature on the topic.  Where I am able to follow the discussions, I am almost always led to my own thinking on the subject; that is the hallmark of a truly relevant book.  While I doubt I will ever add anything to string theory or any other, I will be a much more critical reader of works on this and other scientific subjects in the future thanks to the author's book.  Since it is the mass of us without a professional's background who vote to spend on research of this kind--or not--and the dollar value of big ticket science has often come under scrutiny, it is probably a good idea for more of those with an interest in physics to at least understand what's at stake.<br /><br />Whether the reader understands the theories the author presents, primarily string theory, they will take away a surer understanding that science makes certain demands on any such theory.  As Dr. Smollin relates, any current theory to be valuable should make testable predictions that can clarify its usefulness.  While experiment cannot absolutely state a theory is \\"correct,\\" they do have the possibility of proving it isn't, and having done so can clear the path to knowledge by eliminating theories that are wrong or at least inaccurate.  As the author makes clear, much of the past 30 or 40 years has been spent on theories that have been tweakable to the point of absurdity and few of any of which have led to testable hypothesis.  If what I'm understanding of the situation is true, I suspect that society has spent a lot of money on equipment, such as the large hadron collider, that cannot provide answers because theoretical physics has failed to provide adequate questions.  The presence or absence of the Higgs boson and mini-black holes, while interesting, seems to lack an adequate intellectual structure into which they can be meaningfully placed.<br /><br />As the author also points out, however, recent theoretical physics has been for several decades somewhat divorced from its former connection with experimental physics, which has given rise to what seems like a lot of fogging around.  The recent investment in the LHC at Cern, with its capacity for higher energy experiments, may at least provide the physics community with new data with which to integrate theory.  This may help overcome the road block that seems to have prevented physics from moving forward for so long.  The technology to actually answer questions takes time to develop, since much of the innovation that leads to it moves incrementally and in tandem, and until recently it just hasn't been there to provide the more difficult data with which theoretical physicists need to work.<br /><br />More than anything, the author's presentation of what good theory should do will be of interest to the non-professional reader.  According to his estimate, it should surprise by making suddenly clear a lot that was confusing, and it should led to testable hypotheses.  He notes that a theory that is simply \\"elegant\\" or \\"beautiful\\" need not necessarily be correct or testable.  Nature, as he points out, is often not as aesthetic as theorists might hope; or at least it operates with a different sense of aesthetics.<br /><br />I found the author's very pointed complaint that too much rests on the professional scientist's shoulders with respect to \\"popularity\\" and tenure a very interesting one.  One can't help but wonder how many really useful, bright and well trained individuals whose ideas have been tabled in favor of the \\"theory of the moment\\" have left the field because they could not find academic positions as outsiders of the mainstream \\"theory.\\"Again, one also can't help but wonder how many of the same pool of bright people have been spinning their wheels in the accepted theory wastefully to gain the personal perks they wanted.  This is not a problem just in physics; it pervades our society extensively and erodes much of the good that might have come from better use of bright young people.p but wonder how many of the same pool of bright people have been spinning their wheels in the accepted theory wastefully to gain the personal perks they wanted.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Thanks to soldiers liked Marcus Luttrell.  words cannot express the debt owed to you amd your comrades.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|The music is soft, and relaxed, but there is nothing but truth being sipt on the mic. To me, that makes the album seem more like a monumental effort. The beats are sophisticated, classy and complex, and to couple that with hearfelt lyrics about very serious things we all worry about is pure gold, imo. I feel like this album is meant to actually make the listener look deep inside themselves, feel what they are talking about (A Piece of Light, Dear God,Walk Alone), make them dance (How I Got Over,Hustla, Radio Daze, Right on, Web 20), and touch their soul all at the same time. I really liked the fact that the album sounded like something from the old school. The recording was a bit gritty, almost like somebody was recording the whole thing on wax, in addition to some of the 80s vocals and sounds used in some of the beats, At times, it felt like a mixture between something 80s-ish, jazzy, and 70s motown era all rolled in one.    The only song I didn't really feel was The Day. It annoys me for reasons I can't understand. But other than that, it's a very solid album, and makes me wonder where will they go next.    I can't help but think that them being a band for a late night comedy show might have something to do with their transformation. I mean, they were good before the new gig, but boy have they changed. They have become more fluid with their music. So far, I think it's a good thing. I'm sure this album will get a lot of people interested in their music but turn away some of the OG roots fans. Was the change all in a matter of time? Who knows.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|\\"Scream,\\" the tenth studio album from the Prince of Darkness, is loud, riotous, and fun.  It is full of nostalgic heavy metal sounds blended well with modern rock highlights.<br /><br />The relentless opener \\"Let It Die,\\" let's the listener quickly learn that Ozzy Osbourne shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.  Next is the first single off of the album, \\"Let Me Hear You Scream.\\"  It's an in-your-face rocker that is sure draw huge reactions from live crowds.  The would-be title track, \\"Soul Sucker,\\" rolls in after that, and has quickly become my favorite track on the album.  It's a slow-churning pounder that will literally beat down the listener.  I find myself singing this tune throughout the day.<br /><br />From there, Ozzy lightens things up with \\"Life Won't Wait,\\" but wastes no time on turning the volume back up with the Christ-questioning \\"Diggin' Me Down,\\" the political-tinged \\"Crucify\\" and the fist-pumping \\"Fearless.\\"  Next is the slower-paced \\"Time\\" and then \\"I Want It More.\\"<br /><br />Rounding out the album is the disturbing yet touching \\"Latimer's Mercy\\" and \\"I Love You All,\\" a big \\"thank you\\" to all of Ozzy's fans who've stuck with him through thick and thin.<br /><br />Mike Bordin is replaced on drums by Tommy Clufetos on this album and the former Alice Cooper/Rob Zombie/Ted Nugent skin pounder maintains the album's blistering rhythm throughout.  Adam Wakeman sits in on this album on the keyboards.  \\"Black Rain\\" veteran Blasko returns on bass.<br /><br />The most notable addition to Ozzy's band this time around is lead guitarist Gus G.  He replaces the legendary Zakk Wylde.  Wylde brought a unique styling to Ozzy's sound, and although it is missed, I have to admit that Gus G handles lead guitar duties just fine.  In my opinion, his style is very reminiscent of Randy Rhoads' stylings which, to me, sounded like a well-orchestrated moment of chaos.<br /><br />Ozzy's vocals are solid and sound very good.  His writing on this album is also very strong.<br /><br />\\"Scream\\" is a loud reminder to the world that Ozzy Osbourne still knows how to pound out great music.  I hope that it isn't Ozzy's last album.  Highly recommended.rld that Ozzy Osbourne still knows how to pound out great music.  I hope that it isn't Ozzy's last album.  Highly recommended.
B000S81MHY|5.0|The Proxxon KT70 is a great XY table.  I have purchased two of them so far, for use as part of the Nano Gigapan project to allow us to take high resolution mosaiced images under microscopes.    You can take the knobs off and couple them to stepper motors fairly easily, and thus have an automated xy stage for a fraction of the price of equipment designed for microscopy.    The KT70 moves 1 mm per turn of the handles, and a 115x microscope has about a .75 mm field of view, so there is plenty of precision and accuracy in the KT70 for this purpose.  In fact, the KT70 has 20  hash marks per revolution, so each hash mark is 50 microns.  From my measurements the table has the accuracy to repeatably hit these marks.    That does point out one issue for Americans - everything is metric.  50 micros = 0.0019 inches - about 2 thousandths.    If you google 'Nano Gigapan' you'll find our project, along with examples of using the KT70 in scientific applications.

B002ZG997C|1.0|I won't give away the ending of this movie or spoil the content.  It is worth seeing one time, for the twist at the end and for the specials effects and storyline, but just like the movie Sixth Sense, in which when you see the astonishing ending, you actually lose any interest in seeing the movie again [because you will then know why the actor does everything he does].  Thus, in the Book of Eli, the ending is astonishing and spoils any desire to see the movie again.  My reason for giving it a \\"one\\" rating is because the movie concludes with a defense of terrorists teachings.  You will see many killings [see previews] throughout the movie which is actually justified because it is always done in self defense.  But, I was very disappointed with the ending because here was an opportunity, though a fantasy, to reduce considerably the teaching of terrorism and direct hatred towards certain religions from a god or God.  Instead, the movie equates all major religions as being peaceful and necessary - a fallacy.  If you compare the religions today [please don't build straw men by citing offenses over 100 years old] and see the movie, you too will see the stupidity of the ending and why some of us were left with an empty feeling.  The only reason for the fowl promotion is that the white man at the end of the movie must be a liberal [in keeping with Hollywood standards].
B0021L8V1G|4.0|Robert Downey, Jr. dons red armor once again as Tony Stark in this second go-round for Iron Man.  With all of the primary cast returning except for Terence Howard (replaced by Don Cheadle), this sequel opens with Stark living up his superhero life and enjoying the relative world peace that his armor's strength has brought to the planet.  In the public's eye, he uses smart aleck remarks and blistering evidence to fend off the demands of the U.S. government to obtain the technology he used to create his armor.  The government believes that other countries might soon have the same technology and weaponry that Stark created, but Stark insists that enemies are years away from developing such things.  He also brushes off his biggest rival in the weapons market, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), in exceedingly embarassing ways.  Privately, however, the technology that saved him in the first film is slowly killing him now.<br /><br />With his death in sight and no remedy in the foreseeable future, Stark hits the bottle hard, parties it up, and pretty much alienates himself from the woman who cares for him, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his best friend, Rhodey (Cheadle).  S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his ever present co-worker, Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), are also disturbed by Stark's behavior and keep a very close eye on him.<br /><br />Stark appoints Potts as CEO of Stark Industries knowing that she'll be able to maintain the company after he is gone.  He also picks up a new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) to do little more than damage control.<br /><br />Stark begins to take huge risks with his life, including racing in Monaco.  It is here that he first confronts Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a vengeful man who blames Stark's father for the demise of his own father.  Little does Tony know that Vanko not only understands and can utilize the arc reactor technology, but has made what seems to be a better version of it.<br /><br />Soon enough, Vanko joins forces with Justin Hammer and the duo set out to destroy Tony Stark.  Who wins in the end?  Watch \\"Iron Man 2\\" in order to find out.<br /><br />I loved the first \\"Iron Man\\" film.  I believe part of the reason I enjoyed it so much was that I really didn't expect it to be such a great film.  As far as comic book films go, it is one of, if not the best, that's come along in a long time.  In the first film, greed and a hunger for power drove Obadiah Stain to want to put an end to Tony Stark.  In the sequel, all Vanko wants to do is destroy Tony Stark in an act of vengeance.  It's a more sinister motive in my opinion.  Granted, Hammer is jealous of Stark and wants his fortune and fame, but he is merely a tool used by Vanko in order to exact his revenge.<br /><br />Pepper Potts takes on a much larger role in this film, attempting to keep Stark from destroying himself and trying to maintain some level of respect for the Stark Industries name.  Rhodey is affected in a similar way, struggling with himself on where his loyalties lie with his friend and his country.<br /><br />Stark's tailspin into oblivion is disturbing to watch on the screen.  He does an excellent job of showing how a man who seemingly has it all can quickly destroy himself.  With that said, Downey also delivers some of the funniest lines in the film, and Rockwell is usually on the receiving end.  The two actors play well against each other and I'd love to see them spar in another film soon.<br /><br />Johansson does a wonderful job in her role as Rushman.  I especially enjoyed her interaction with Jon Favreau, who reprises his role as Happy Hogan.  Paul Bettany returns as the voice of JARVIS, as well as Leslie Bibb in a brief stint as reporter Christine Everhart.<br /><br />Overall, the film is very good.  It's not quite up to par with \\"Iron Man,\\" but I really didn't expect it to match its predecessor.  At times it felt a bit rushed and there is a brief lag in the film while Stark is trying to get himself back together.  Still, I highly recommend this film.  It brings us one step closer to the heavily anticipated \\"Avengers\\" film, and sets the table for the upcoming \\"Thor\\" film next year.  Be sure to watch for a certain Captain's shield to make a swift and funny appearance, a glimpse of a certain green guy's destruction, and a nod to a particularly thunderous hero after the credits roll.film.

B0007O38XU|4.0|Seeing Spaceballs after the passing of some twenty years is a vastly different experience than seeing it in the theatre was all those years ago. After spoofing the western, the horror genre and silent film, Brooks set his sights on spoofing the big science fiction adventure with somewhat mixed results.    Spaceballs is essentially a space fairy tale and plays best when viewed as such. Brooks says in his commentary track that the film plays its best to a children's audience who have made it a cult favorite. The plot is simple enough. The citizen's of Planet Spaceball are running out of air. In order to remedy this problem they decide to kidnap the Druidish princess and hold her hostage in order to get the combination to her planet's airshield. What follows is a parody of Star Wars played against a movie marketing blitz. The results are  mixed and a little dated but the humor works    The Collector's Edition features a commentary track, three featurettes including a memorial to John Candy, and an assortment of trailers, galleries, and small features that make this a fun watch. While not the greatest of Brooks'film this one is certainly worth watching.
0765318741|4.0|It seems that I am not alone in giving editorial praise for this unique novel written by one of the most prolific and influential writers of not only the zombie genre but of science fiction and horror as well.Mr Matheson,instrumental in influencing such other'minor'writers along the way such as Rod Serling,Steven King,Anne Rice to name a few has perhaps written the defining literary vision of what others dealing in books and movies have relied upon to give life and form to the creatures that tend to lack them both,what we call the undead dead or simply the zombie.Its place in history is,I think, sealed forever in the minds of those who read it or of those who have ever seen \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" with Vincent Price who comes closer to the story of Robert Neville than Will Smith does in the later version.The story is one of survival and danger in a world gone mad.Vampirism touches upon the story with its garlic and crosses and adds some spice to the mystery of just what is the underlying nature of the enemy and how or if it can be killed, controlled or remedied.All in all it is depressing to think that despite ones best efforts to remain alive,eventually you find yourself so totally outnumbered that your will to live slowly dissipates and death seems a welcome relief.Such is the daily grind of Neville and the ending is for you to ponder upon.Some could even compare the theme to the rapid encroachment of the worlds population upon the U.S.A as a zombie like horde determined to take over and start over,their way.Some may see the viral attack scenario as a visonary warning.Either way you look at it or come up with your own interpretation the book serves as a paradigm of horror and the mindboggling confusion,shock and terrible times one would have merely surviving such a trauma to mankind.If you like this stuff than this book should be included in the canon of its type and read at least once.There are other stories included which range in their ability to register on one's spookiometer.Anyone remember Karen Black being chased around by that homicidal,overly dentitious,tribal doll with the Al Sharpton hairdo and a fancy for knives included on Trilogy of Terror,well Matheson wrote it.From Star Trek to the Twilight Zone this guy's done it all just check the credits.I'll stop here because you don't need my approval just look at what the other 500+ reviewers have to say and read it.Unfortunately, by todays standards I'm afraid it probably won't grab you or scare you that much but it was fun to read.Somewhat draggy in the middle to late scenes but keep going,it's worth it.Then compare movies and see who comes closer to what Matheson invisioned.You might be suprised.I gave it 4 stars for its impact on so many and its place in the history of what we now delight in calling the modern day world of the zombie. Just think, if George Romero had never read it we would never have had \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".They're coming to get you Barbara,look there's one now.They're coming for you too,they might be right behind you,don't turn around,keep reading my reviews with some garlic knots and chianti.That'll keep em away.Enjoy!!e's spookiometer.Anyone remember Karen Black being chased around by that homicidal,overly dentitious,tribal doll with the Al Sharpton hairdo and a fancy for knives included on Trilogy of Terror,well Matheson wrote it.From Star Trek to the Twilight Zone this guy's done it all just check the credits.I'll stop here because you don't need my approval just look at what the other 500+ reviewers have to say and read it.Unfortunately, by todays standards I'm afraid it probably won't grab you or scare you that much but it was fun to read.Somewhat draggy in the middle to late scenes but keep going,it's worth it.Then compare movies and see who comes closer to what Matheson invisioned.You might be suprised.I gave it 4 stars for its impact on so many and its place in the history of what we now delight in calling the modern day world of the zombie.

1848876599|5.0|See the Movie, THEN Read the Book!  And no, it's not all about rugby and the team. Sure, the book begins on the day of the Springboks' Rugby World Cup game against the New Zealand All-Blacks (so named for the color of their uniforms). Sure, it introduces us Yanks to the Springboks. But, in the following chapters, it retraces Mandela's life, 27-year imprisonment, his election to President, and finally to presenting the 1995 Rugby World Cup to the Springboks. It shows us a South Africa we thought we'd never see, let alone believe in. In fact, about two-thirds of the book covers Mandela's and others' lives, and much fascinating history, how Mandela turned a 27-year sentence into not bitter revenge but change, reconciliation, and uniting South Africans. While in prison, a rare strong seed was planted in the brain and heart of a man who had every reason to plot revenge against the injustices done to him, but the seed was nurtured and finally blossomed a few years before his release to make him speak truth to power as the world's most famous prisoner whom everyone wanted to free. Actually, he was still in effect the African National Council (ANC)'s leader.  In the 27 years he aged from a young, husky warrior with a powerful Muhammad Ali-boxer's physique into a mellow, slender, and gracefully aged yet strong Xhosa elder (he was of chiefly ancestry), whose handsome Xhosa features were framed by a full crown of crinkly silver hair. He looked tired when he left prison but some of those wrinkles left as he became accustomed to freedom. As in the poem Invictus he was the master of his fate and the captain of his soul, prepared for anything and anyone, unfailingly courteous and respectful and even courtly to friend and foe, high and low, and, when necessary, he was blunt and straight. Like America's great man of peace, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mandela had a dream, so he did not flinch from  presidents such as Botha, de Klerk, old biAfrikaner generals, who could have lethim rot in prison until he died but listened to him instead, even while he was in prison.  Even there, he had a special power, which he used for the good of all, and by sheer will and desire to reach out to all including the Afrikaners and African opposition leaders to the ANC.  If another, earlier book and subsequent film were not titled \\"The Power of One,\\" it would be supremely apropos to Mandela. As it was, his theme \\"One Team, One Country\\" is \\"close enough for government work!     Carlin reviews the lives of many other prominent people--the mighty Springbok captain Francois Pienaar and other hulking Springboks as well. A man who was on Death Row and innocent of a crime was freed at Mandela's request while Mandela was in jail!  At first meeting, ignoring advice, he even asked the Great Crocodile, P.W. Botha, to release his friend Walter Sisulu, who was in bad health, and Botha complied.      One must read this book twice because it is such an incredible story you won't believe it the first time you read it. Absently reading it aloud in my living room (I live alone with three very stoic, baffled cats who already doubt my sanity), I had to hear the words I was reading to believe them. A myriad of emotion, tears, and laughter leapt out at me, and I was caught up in it. Some details necessarily absent from the two-hour film were covered, so Carlin answered every curious question I had.     Mind you, though Carlin's love, frank awe, and admiration of Mandela are obvious he doesn't glorify Mandela, or make Mandela a Pollyanna, or a saint.  Nor should should this be mistakenly called a feel-good book. It makes him very human, with manipulative skills (and a bit of a showmanship), but what a guy!  Mandela makes everyone he meets feel welcome. This author took me to the heart of South Africa with Mandela, in prison, to the halls of the last bastion of Afrikaner Nationalism where the old warrior amazed the leaders, and finally with the man as he took old guard South Africa into his embrace and then offered HIS idea: One Team, One Country. Carlin tells of how Mandela removed fear of Black retribution from the Afrikaner and hate and resentment from the Black majority, and replaced it with inspiration for a victory for all of his countrymen, women,and children, meeting and talking to the Springboks' captain, Francois Pienaar, using sports as the master key to winning first the World Cup, then South Africa for all.  It didn't happen overnight--it took years, and Carlin tells us how it was done by Mandela, first as negotiator from prison, advisor out of prison, and then President and co-Nobel Prize winner with F. W. de Klerk, then presenter of the World Cup to his \\"boys\\" the Springboks.    At last (and by this time I was so caught up in it as to be sweating with exhaustion and my three cats were sitting up staring in dismay at me!) with Mandela striding onto the field, and get this--beaming ear to ear and wearing the Springbok #6 (Pienaar's number) jersey and the green and gold cap, presenting the World Rugby Cup to the Champion Springboks--to the Captain, towering three inches over six-foot-one Mandela--Francois Pienaar--who, overcome with emotion, was afraid to speak for fear of breaking down in tears. All they could do for a moment or two was burst into laughter and joy.  Pienaar and the Boks had bonded with Mandela who became their number one fan over the past year and had come to love him like a father. Pienaar knew this was also a political moment of triumph for all of South Africa--his own people, the Afrikaners, as well.  The entire stadium burst into ear-splitting cheers, song, and screams of laughter, and unashamed crying by (1) people who never thought they'd ever live to ever be admitted into the sacrosanct Springboks stadium and (2) people who once felt they'd be contaminated if they even bumped into an African. Somehow, they were realizing that the invisible racial and cultural barriers were of the mind and heart, and theywere nonexistent. No, there weren't 60,000 spectators who cheered the Boks and the architect of all of this glory--Mandela--that day, it was approximately 45 million South Africans.
1416550550|3.0|I really don't understand the rave over this long-suffering novel.  I found the back and forth between 3 different time periods in EVERY chapter to be boring.  A really good editor would have cut 1/4 of the length and told this story better. I didn't hate it but I wouldn't recommend it either.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is definately her best since Ray of Light although Music was pretty good. After American Life, she came back on top and Hung Up went to #1 in many countries in the world! It was amazing how that song had such a massive appeal worldwide. When I listen to Hung Up, it brings memories of my senior year. The album cover is one of my favorites! I love her sequin belt and sequin shoes. It was so cute. Every Madonna should add this to their cd collection. It's the best electronic/dance album. It should have been certified a lot higher in the u.s.<br /><br />FAVORITE TRACKS<br /><br />*Hung Up<br />*Sorry<br />*I Love New York<br />*How High<br />*Forbidden Love<br />*Push<br />*Like It Or Not

What I learned from this book is the importance of pacing and breathing.And most important point is to enjoy running. I love the way,the author writes and the interesting characters,  the tribe, caballo blanco, the surfer and his pretty girl friend and the coach. It didn't read like a non-fiction. it had plot ,pacing and even conflict.<br />i highly recommend this book even if you not a runner , its a compelling story of people who happen to love running.

B000001F4V|5.0|In my opinion this is The Scorp's 3rd best album,  behind Love drive and Blackout. This CD defiantly catches them in their prime. The Scorp's have alway been a guitar band with killer riffs, and this CD is no acceptation. There are a couple of filler songs on this CD which keeps it from being a \\"perfect\\" album, but besides for the hits, (Bad boys running wild, rock you like a hurricane, Big city nights) this CD has other great songs like like 'Leaving you', and my personal fav 'Coming home'<br />Although their follow up album, Savage Amusement, was decent, this was the last great Scorpions CD.<br />Buy it.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I've been using variants of this headphone for years now. For the price, the audio quality is absurdly good. It won't replace $100 studio headphones, but for listening to music in most situations it is all anyone but the most snotty audiophile will need. Even modest (but cheap!) audiophiles like me are still impressed, again, especially for $10. This is almost certainly the best $10 headphones available in terms of sound quality.    However, the complaints about lifespan are valid. But they are surprisingly easily addressed. The root problem is that if you stand up accidentally or otherwise rip them off your head, you put a lot of stress on the ear bud connections. The solution is to make it so the stress is never transmitted so strongly. When you get these headphones, before wearing them, slide them to their largest size. Pick a side. Look at why they can't slide any further; you'll see a little bit of plastic on the inside that catches on a hook in the sliding earbud part. Using a sharp knife and some care, remove that bar on one side. Ideally, if you leave a bit of the bar behind, it will still catch on the settings so you can size it, but will fairly freely slide entirely off the top; in all the times I've tried this this happens \\"accidentally\\" anyhow, since a clean cut is very difficult. Now, if you accidentally stand up or whatever, instead of putting a lot of stress on the headphones until they pop out of the eigth-inch jack, they will simply come apart without much force being applied to the ear buds. Perhaps counter-intuitively, it is actually better that the headphones just come apart instead of resisting. This also helps prevent a lot of force being applied to the jack of whatever they are plugged into, which isn't good for whatever that is either.    I've had three of these things over the years. Two failed after 5+ years of service, which I can't complain about, one of those failures because the *jack* end got worn down. I lost the third (which is alsolooking at 5+ years of service, note there's some overlap in these years as I've had them in more than one location), which is why I'm looking to replace it and writing this review. Do yourself a favor, three minutes with a knife will go a long way towards turning months of service into years of service.
B003EVBCW2|5.0|I cringe whenever the critics label an up and coming musician \\"the next Dylan\\". However benevolent one's intentions may be, comparing any up and coming performer to Dylan is usually the kiss of death for the the performer. When critics play \\"Dylan card\\", it creates an impossibly high set of expectations and usually results in sort of critical backlash that can kill the career of an aspiring artist. There is only one Bob Dylan and Dylan himself has rarely lived up to the heroic expectations of his fans and followers. Over the years, \\"the next Dylan\\" has been used on  preformers as P.F. Sloan, Barry McGuire, Bob Lind, Peter Mulvey & Lloyd Cole and look what it did for their careers. Dylan's earliest peers like Dave Van Ronk and Phil Ochs both played out their careers living in the shadow of Bob Dylan. Bruce Springsteen was about the only survivor of \\"the next Dylan\\" tag and as it turned out, Springsteen turned out to be something very different from Robert Zimmerman. The Tallest Man on Earth is Latest entry to the \\"next Dylan\\" sweepstakes and his abundant musical talent makes it even harder to sidestep use of the Dylan analogy.<br /><br />On his second full album the Tallest Man on Earth (Swedish folk singer Kristian Mattson) is moving out from under Dylan's long shadow to craft his own body of work that stands both aside and apart from Dylan's. Dylan was and still is. capable of doing a lot with his reedy and nasal voice, and by my ear Mattson's voice has a similar expressive and passionate quality. But the Tallest Man enjoys at least full octave advantage over Mr. Zimmerman in his vocal range. Mattson's guitar playing is ragged, strident and far more self assured than Dylan even at that height of his early coffeehouse days when Dylan was absorbing the complex finger picking styles of Bleeker St. guitarists Dave Van Ronk, Rev. Gary Davis and Eric Von Schmidt. I'm not going to deny the striking similarities between Mattson and Dylan either, but I'll also remind you that Mr. Dylan was often accused of channeling Woody Guthrie for the first 4 or 5 years of his music career.<br /><br />Mattson performs without a backup band and he almost seems like an anacronistic approach in the age high tech electonica, but it works in his favor because it gives his music a timeless quality. Except for the clear fidelity of the recording, there's little to suggest that these tunes weren't recorded in the American South in the early part of the last century, on the porch of some particularly contemplative backwoods poet. \\"Wild Hunt\\" is simply as good as any album I've heard in 2010 and I hope the Tallest Man on Earth survives \\"the next Dylan\\" label and keeps making great music own his own terms.<br /><br />NOTABLE TRACKS: The Wild Hunt, King of Spain, Love Is All & You're Going BackDylan was often accused of channeling Woody Guthrie for the first 4 or 5 years of his music career.

B002FGU46C|5.0|First off, let me state that I had a pair of the original Teva's that were the predecessor of the Terra Fi's.  They lasted me 8 good years, and only broke because my Great Dane puppy stepped on my foot at the park, breaking them!  I tried a few other brands, and wasn't thrilled about the reviews for the Terra Fi 2's, so I never bought them.  I finally decided to try the 3's, and am so glad I did.  They are every bit as good as the original's, and even a bit more comfortable.  So far, I do the dog park, mild hiking and lots of beaching it.  I would (and do!) recommend these to my friends, and would definitely purchase them again.
031606792X|5.0|I read quite a few of the reviews on Amazon that said this book was terrible, but I bought it anyway. Having finished it, I thought it was an entertaining read. Stephenie Meyer showed a lot of progress as a storyteller and a writer in this book from the previous volumes in the series.    I think she told a good story that was appropriate for her young audience and that was also clearly in line with her personal values, which I appreciate. I don't have teenagers, but it's nice to know that there are stories out there for young adults that I'd feel comfortable having my niece or nephews read.     The Jacob-imprinting-on-Reneesmee story line was kind of strange, but it was within the context of the story, so it wasn't a huge surprise. Overall I thought this book was really entertaining and I enjoyed it. I hope Meyer will write more about these characters!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|I must admit I was not expecting much with Ozzy's new album.  It exceeded all my expectations.  I heard Scream on the radio, and I must say that almost every song on the album is better than the single that was released!  My favorite song by a big margin is Digging Me Down.  This could have been a Black Sabbath song!  The tempo changes, the lyrics, this is just an outstanding song!  I loved it.  Crucify could have been a Sabbath song as well.  Honestly, not a bad song on the album.  I give it a no holds barred 5 stars!

B00275EHJG|5.0|Completing one of the greatest trilogies in movie history (joining Star Wars and Lord of the Rings), Toy Story 3 is everything one could wish for and more.  These familiar toys that come alive with feelings and interplay became the cornerstone of Pixar Studios and a string of superlative animated gems.  Disney should be thanking its lucky stars.    Picking up from the previous films, Andy has played with his beloved toys for years and explored imaginative adventures and thrills that are the stuff of a rich, wondrous childhood.  The old gang is back with Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and the others.  As Andy approaches college age, it is a time of change, and the toys lament at not being played with anymore.  They are destined for the attic or the trash dump... or maybe a chance to entertain kids at a day school.  Lest you think the field of toys gets too crowded (Little Bo Peep and Etch a Sketch have moved on), there are some nice additions (Barbie doll gets to romance Ken), and some not so nice ones.      Sunnyside Daycare seems to be an ideal situation with children who want toys, and toys needing to be needed (a kind of schoolyard version of `The Island of Misfit Toys'); it appears to be a match made in heaven.  There's even a connection between Andy and a daycare staffer whose daughter, Bonnie, is beginning to play with her first toys.  But a mysterious leader emerges in the form of a stuffed bear, Lotso (a charming Ned Beatty), who has a rigid pecking order or hierarchy for the toys, and that leaves our newcomers at the mercy of the youngest, most violent kids who abuse them.      As Woody finds a temporary home with Bonnie and tries to make it back to his friends, Buzz attempts to find out the truth of the daycare and is captured.  From there, the film becomes an escape story as the toys struggle to flee their daycare prison. Last minute rescues are trumped by surprises and betrayal, and salvation can come from the most surprising source.  Will Woody and Buzz save the day, and what will become of their toy brethren?  Will the toys find happiness somewhere perhaps?    What has never failed is that the filmmakers treat their audience with intelligence and respect.  It also does not depend on one seeing the past films, but it does help in order to appreciate certain references.  The Pixar team led by director Lee Unkrich and screenwriter Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) should be commended for never losing sight of the story.  The cast of voices including Joan Cusack, Don Rickles (priceless as Mr. Potato Head), Estelle Harris, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger (who has voiced in every Pixar film), and newcomer Michael Keaton (as Ken) are terrific.  They do a better job of acting and emoting than many a live actor.    The film's first hour or so is good but not great.  It is in the final scenes that the themes of loyalty and sacrifice take on a deeper meaning, and the film blossoms with pathos.  The notion of abandonment and wanting to belong resonate universally.  As the toys learn that they can make other children happy and feel a purpose again, Andy also learns a lesson in life: passing the torch from one child's happiness to another.  It's about growing up and letting go while finding closure amidst a time of uncertainty and change. Imagine that-a kid's film that is affecting to adults!      If this is the end of the precious series (with record box office grosses, I find that hard to believe), it has ended on a very high note.  Do stay for the end credits as you learn a bit more about the fate of our beloved toys.  As much as I would hate to see these animated friends go, I should remember that these jewels are to be shared and cherished by future generations.  How's that for life imitating art?
B00005JPS8|4.0|It was good, But I would have prefere it to be lighter in the background of the movie it was dark.there were scritches on the DVD, but didn't seem to interfere with the movie. The rest of the movie was good....
B0015XHQTY|4.0|this is Dirty harry we're writing about here right ? the script's got everything . a solid cast and very good direction . if this is the weakest Dirty Harry picture , it's still better than 85% of what's passing for film these days . thought Tyne was great (as always) and pretty . Eastwood owns this role and has a ball with it this time out . two thumbs up the establishment's......Powell . great fun .

B00006AUIG|5.0|Few films are capable of producing an atmosphere that is truly haunting in its own regards, despite any of the onscreen action that may be occurring.  Well, Session 9 is one of those films.  The overall filming environment simply reeks of an eerie, haunting tone, setting up the feelings for the forthcoming events that are bound to unfold.  The film takes place in an abandoned Psychiatric Hospital, Danvers State Mental Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts.<br /><br />The hospital has been abandoned for several years, closing in 1985, but the owners suddenly decide it's time to clean the building up after all these years.  They begin by hiring an asbestos removal crew.  Enter Gordon Fleming and his team known as The Hazmat Elimination Company.  Gordon and his teammate Phil are given a tour of the abandoned hospital, in order to secure a bid for the removal job.  Upon receiving the tour, the audience is greeted with disturbing environments at every turn.  From dark corridors, to abandoned lobotomy  tables along with other surgical and mental tools, the entire hospital radiates with a supernatural feeling.<br /><br />The feeling grows as the tour is almost completed, with Gordon and Phil being shown the floor in which the hospital kept its most dangerous inhabitants.  At the end of the hallway on this floor, the two see a small wheelchair laying in the darkness at the end of the hall.  However, getting to the end of the hall may be more difficult than it seems, seeing as Gordon is told that the floor is weak in this hallway due to water damage.  Mesmerized by the wheelchair, Gordon is greeted by a voice with a haunting tone saying \\"Hello, Gordon\\".<br /><br />Gordon puts a bid in with the owner that they can complete the project in a week, despite the fact that Phil states it's a two week job, stating that he desperately needs the cash since he recently became a father, and then gathers his team for the first day of work.  Things start off slow enough, with the team members simply enjoying themselves and taking the job slowly.  However, as the days progress, things become a little disturbing, and it seems like all of the workers are slowly losing their sanity.<br /><br />Mike (one of Gordon's crew members) becomes obsessed with a series of audio files he found which contain mental evaluation sessions that the doctors performed on a woman named Mary Hobbes.  Each night, Mike listens to several of these sessions.  Each session slowly reveals more and more about Mary and her alternate personalities, however it also appears as if the events within the film are also determined by the number of sessions that Mike has listened to.  After each session is played more disturbing events begin to occur at the hospital.<br /><br />By the time Mike reaches session 9, the final session given to Mary, it is obvious that all of the workers have lost their minds.  With their actions becoming more disturbing with each passing day, until the dramatic build up at the end, the film keeps the audience on their toes, slowly watching in anticipation of the next haunting occurrence.  The evil entity that existed within Mary all those years ago has found a new host.<br /><br />The overall presentation of the film is extremely well done.  The acting is spot on for delivering a believable, spine-shivering viewing experience.  The pacing is perfect and does a fantastic job at showing the slow transformations that each asbestos removal worker is experiencing with each passing day without feeling too drawn out.  The ambiance and entire atmosphere of the film simply radiates of supernatural and haunting tones. The hospital environment alone is capable of producing spine shivering chills, but the ending is chilling and twisted, revealing the true evil that resided within the hospital all these years, just waiting for a spirit weak enough that it could control.  An overall amazing film from start to finish, one that should not be overlooked if you're a fan of horror and psychological thriller movies like \\"The Shinning\\".ing\\".
B00129I5SM|5.0|This is an awesome version of the DVD. It contains lots and lots of bonus material that is very gratifying. It's also a very good movie. This is the biggest the infection has gotten in the series and it pulls a lot of references from the games. very well directed and written and the ending gives way for the next sequel.
0307594777|4.0|I had already read this trilogy and bought it for my husband as I thought he might enjoy it.  I read the 2 first ones last winter, then there was a long wait before The girlwho kicked hornet's nest was available. As a result, I had a hard time remembering all the references to the previous 2 books and some names were so close to each other, it was difficult distinguishing them.  In spite of this, and in spite of too much political content, they were real page turners and the main heroin was unusual and intriguing.

B003NFM3JU|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with those who have given this a low rating. I saw this movie in the theater, in 3D and thought it was one of the better movies of the holiday season. Although I couldn't quite understand why it was released so early, it should have been more of a Christmas time release instead of Thanksgiving. As far as the film itself I thought it was a good update on a classic story. While I don't consider myself an aficionado, I do know the story well and found it stayed true enough to it. The warmth and humanity of the characters is definitely still present. Then of course there is the 3D aspect, which completely blew me away. I've seen most of the 3D releases in the last year or so, and with the exception of Avatar this movie did the best job of utilizing it. Actually, I am more excited about this movie being released in 3D than any other movie, including Avatar. I'm just happy you'll be able to buy this movie alone and not bundled along with a TV. Hopefully this is the start of 3D Blu Ray movies be released minus the bundle. And I know Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is currently available but it's no where as good as this movie is.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|For unabashed, unapologetic pop music fun Kylie Minogue albums are often the answer. With the Aussie singer's 11th album \\"Aphrodite\\" this fact is blissfully reaffirmed.<br /><br />Precision-tooled to blare out of speakers everywhere from San Diego BMWs to overpriced Parisian boutiques to Caribbean nightclubs, this clever, infectious baker's dozen of pop tunes flies out of the oven aimed squarely at the pleasure zone of Minogue's core audience. It is a thing of beauty.<br /><br />The album has a very appealing sonic marriage of 2002's heavy-handed dance of \\"Fever\\" with the upbeat yet cool-as-cucumber lounge-ready pop of hits such as \\"I Believe In You\\" and \\"Chocolate.\\" The result is an uptempo but unserious sound that is often quite European and always danceable.<br /><br />Lead single \\"All the Lovers\\" is an ideal example. Its ceaseless beats have the resonance of disco yet are laser-like and modern. As with other key tracks such as the blissful eureka moment of \\"Everything Is Beautiful\\" or the high-BPM \\"Put Your Hands Up,\\" a confident kiss goodbye to sadness courtesy of the dance floor, the song has a smart, sunny Euro-pop sheen that immediately ingratiates itself. Minogue's smooth, sweet, feminine vocals lead the way.<br /><br />The diva-comeback theme of the cheeky, delightful, softly rambunctious title track can be seen coming from a mile away, but this upfront lack of pretense is part of Minogue's effortless charm. \\"Better Than Today\\" also impresses with its sharply-chiseled synthesizers buoying her jubilant vocals.<br /><br />Unlike 2007's \\"X,\\" there is a track or two that do not impress as much as those that surround. Although its lyrics are well-written, \\"Closer\\" is essentially a less appealing sequel to 2004's slick, sexy \\"Slow\\" and the closing \\"Can't Beat the Feeling\\" flies by without calling attention to itself.<br /><br />\\"Get Outta My Way,\\" the album's high point, is a declaration of intentions to savor all of life's transient pleasures whether or not company joins in. Its frenetic energy and sugary-sweet pop hook make it destined for the upper reaches of the charts, although comparisons to Minogue's 2000 hit \\"Spinning Around\\" are certainly justified from the title alone.<br /><br />\\"Put your hands up if you feel love tonight,\\" \\"Take a chance tonight and try something new,\\" \\"I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty, I'm an aphrodite\\" and \\"Can you feel me in the stereo?\\" are some of the album's best lines and indication of themes listeners will find and enjoy.<br /><br />\\"Aphrodite\\" is expertly crafted, low-brow yet sophisticated and endlessly listenable. What more can a pop music fan ask for?eet pop hook make it destined for the upper reaches of the charts, although comparisons to Minogue's 2000 hit \\"Spinning Around\\" are certainly justified from the title alone.    \\"Put your hands up if you feel love tonight,\\" \\"Take a chance tonight and try something new,\\" \\"I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty, I'm an aphrodite\\" and \\"Can you feel me in the stereo?\\" are some of the album's best lines and indication of themes listeners will find and enjoy.    \\"Aphrodite\\" is expertly crafted, low-brow yet sophisticated and endlessly listenable.

B003ELOQCK|5.0|U2 360 is the best U2 concert video to date.  The camera angles and clarity help you feel as though you are at the concert.  I know this because I attended two of their concerts.  The extras help explain the philosophy of building the \\"spaceship\\" in order to attempt to increase intimacy in a large, outdoor venue.  Like all U2 videos/dvds, it's the music that has the most impact.  After 30 years, U2 remains at the top of their game and the most important band in the world for the 3 decades.  I can't wait to watch it again.  The only thing I would have changed would be to put \\"Breathe\\" on the main dvd since this was the actual song that they opened with on tour. At least they included it on the extras dvd.  I recommend this package for anyone who enjoys live rock music.  It'll take some of the sting out of having the third leg of the tour cancelled due to Bono's back problems (get well soon, Bono!).
B000VE439Y|4.0|I saw this movie years ago at the theatre when it came out. It was oddball, off the wall and to me and my good friend who was also a fan of Monty Python, hilarious. I don't see it on tv much and it is nice to see the movie now and then. And it was a good price.  If you like Monty Python, you'll enjoy this movie.
0545091020|4.0|The Hunger Games takes place in a future where the United States has devolved into a nation called \\"Panem\\" with 12 tributary states surrounding it.  The states (originally there were 13) had rebelled, but have since been pacified and as a result are required to offer two of their young people (ages 12 to 18, I think) as \\"tributes\\" to compete in the \\"Hunger Games,\\" a televised gladiator-style fight to the death.  Katniss, a 16 year old from District 12, volunteers when her younger sister is chosen.  But things become more complicated when the boy tribute from her district is Peeta, a slightly older boy who had once saved her and her family from starving.<br /><br />This is a plot-line which has been used many times before, but I liked the way Collins used the reality-TV aspect to such great effect (although I wonder if many young readers will truly appreciate it).  To emphasize the connection with the Roman gladiators many of those involved in producing the games have Romanesque (or perhaps Greek?) names.  I also wondered if \\"Panem\\" was perhaps a nod to Edgar Rice Burroughs' similarly post-apocalyptic [[ASIN:1592244963 The Lost Continent]], where America had become \\"Pan America.\\"  But although some aspects of the plot feel a little contrived, the characters are sympathetic and it keeps you interested to the end (even if the romantic subplot was overplayed to the point of sappiness).  I didn't care for the first-person-present voice, and while the violent subject matter made me question if this would be wholly appropriate to younger teenagers (in particular, my 11 year old daughter who desperately wants to read it), the actual violence was generally somewhat muted.  But still, I find myself wanting to read the rest of the series to find out how it ends.
B0036RPM8E|1.0|Just watched this Bluray last night and was not impressed at all. The sound was below par compared to most concert releases. Total waste of money. The sound does not have the concert feel. Better sound can be had from cassette tapes of 30 years past. It just lacks everything. Even the 2 channel audio was done in dolby digital when there is ample space on the BD to make it PCM. This is an example on how to make a horrible concert audio mix.
B0039TD826|4.0|I had this on record when I was a kid, but never bought the CD.  A fellow Stones lover recommended that I just buy 'hot rocks' when I first started buying CDs.  Boy was he wrong!  The beauty of listening to my old records is that you developed a fondness for the whole record.  In listening to this 'exile' CD, I forgot how bluesey and gritty the record was; great riffs, strong lyrics and the tightness of the band plus extra songs that weren't on the album .  I happy I added this to my CD collection.
B000MRA5EM|5.0|This is a gift for my son's birthday who will be 16. He really enjoys movies about earth and science etc. I saw the dvd while waiting in a doctor's office for my husband and was impressed. I knew my son (who hasn't received it yet) would really like it. It's informative, interesting and entertaining. I recommend for almost anyone of various interests and various ages. The narrators did an awesome job. The photography is spectacular.
B001CTDH4Y|3.0|Trying to complain about Disney's obsession with movies about talking animals is self-defeating.  Like taxes, they will never go away, and we'll see more them in the future.  As long as kids eat this stuff up, there's an audience for this cheap marketing scheme.  This might sound like I'm already hating \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\", but I can't for the life of me say it's awful.  It's just another silly talking animals movie, but at least no one's singing for its own sake or people throwing arms at verbally-understood creatures like hypnotized drones since the dogs and humans are in their own communicative world.  Already, the movie's a step up from \\"The Country Bears\\".<br /><br />Chloe is a selfish, materialistic spoiled chihuahua raised by a rich Jamie Lee Curtis.  While the dog's under the care of a babysitter (the barkeep/diver from \\"[[ASIN:B0000524E5 Coyote]] [[ASIN:B000BUNZY2 Cave]]\\"), the neglectful babysitter and her friends go off to Mexico, where Chloe will eventually be dognapped by a crime lord who controls the dog fights.  She escaped with her allies, and while she tried to head home, she learned about the flaws of her character, realized what's important and all that typical Disney schlock.  Even she eventually gets better, I just can't stand this dog: not because of how self-absorbed and demeaning she is, but how obnoxiously chatty she is.  Always has to worry about what she wears, often making sly comebacks, and frequently pointing out the needs of her rich style.  She's the benefactor of my disdain for animal chatter.<br /><br />Delgado, on the other hand, is an upside to the verbal animals concept; he's the main protector Chloe met before she escaped with him from the villain's hideout.  Cool name aside, he's not much of a chatterbox, can't tolerate Chloe's high-strung behavior, reliable, and takes a direct approach to everything.  I actually like tha dog, since I can sorta identify with him in a non-species manner. Too bad, much like every other combative stray in many romantic films, he has to grow all caring about Chloe even though he shouldn't; at least he didn't fall for her, but he still worries for her.  As you can see, talking animals has never been annoying because of the concept of talking; it's how much they talk and the attitude they have when they speak that can be damaging.  For Delgado, he's a tolerate exception.<br /><br />The movie was fine enough with just dogs with obvious CGI lip-synching, then it had to bring in the rat and iguana.  I never liked them, because they represent they are bad habit of Disney.  Because it's a requirement for Disney movies to have a comic relief (and the George Lopez-voiced Chihuahua doesn't seem to be good enough, apparently), there has to be two bumbling thieves to crack jokes and cause chaos.  That's just peachy, an obviously CGI rat and reptile doing forced laughs to bug me.  But the movie does have other interesting characters.  It does surprise me that the main human antagonist, in a movie about dogs talking in puns and accents, actually appears threatening and not a corny villain desperate for laughs (I'm looking at you, clown from \\"Air Bud\\"), and the nefarious doberman named El Diablo ain't that corny either (though I wonder why dobermans always have to be bad guys).<br /><br />What else can I say? It is what it is, nothing to get enraged about.  \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" has a story that plays it straight: it's a dog who lost his way, facing challenges and peril in an exotic scenery.  Is it really best Chihuahua movie ever made?  Close, but it sure didn't beat [[ASIN:B001ILFUD2 \\"Oliver and Company\\"]]; sure, that movie is about a cat, but it does have a chihuahua playing a racist stereotype.any romantic films, he has to grow all caring about Chloe even though he shouldn't; at least he didn't fall for her, but he still worries for her.

B000VR824S|5.0|I've watched it twice and will probably make it a habit, a very GOOD habit.  I've watched a number of concert videos, but the quality of the players, the quality of the production, and the quality of the sound on Crossroads 2007 is superior in most cases. One of the few I have that i'll actually watch over and over again.
1423113381|5.0|There are so many things I like about this book. The story is told from both Carter and Sadie's point of view, and the voice for each is developed perfectly. While each chapter starts with who is telling, after the first few chapters I didn't have to look at the name to be able to identify who it was. The creativity that I adored so much with the Percy Jackson series is still here, still strong and the description accompanies harmoniously. Furthermore, the research Riordan has done to be correct in his dealings with Egyptian gods is as precise as it was with the Greek gods. Needless to say this was a fun journey. It is quite a bit longer than any of the Jackson books, but never feels tedious or drawn out. Don't know when the next one is coming out, but I'll probably be pre-ordering again :)

However, after pondering on it for a day or so, I decided that it would be wrong not to read Lehane's book \\"Shutter Island\\" first, since I already knew he was a first class author/story teller from previously reading \\"Mystic River\\" a few years back (again, before seeing Clint Eastwood's film based upon that title). So, I did read the book, and then I became really worried that the film would not/could not live up to this absolutely jaw-dropping, heart-racing, horror story from hell and beyond; and so I waited until the dvd came out to see it. I'm sorry....to have seen this film in the confines of a blackened theater, with thx sound, etc., must have been overwhelming!<br /><br />The horrors of this story are multifold, and bounce all over the place....stricken victims in the Nazi death camps, horribly-realistic revenge executions thereupon, booze, depression, drownings, murder, suicide, schizophrenia, experimental drugs and surgery on mental patients, and more are all alluded to here...and given a terrifying \\"mix\\" that will grab you and keep you locked in suspense and horror until the final gasp of the story.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese deserves great thanks for NOT spoiling or watering-down this story in order to get it onto the screen...he has done a very commendable job here. Naturally, an entire book is difficult to \\"translate\\" and \\"present\\" in a movie, and certainly much is missing here....but not so much that the story does not work, nor carry the \\"punch\\" of the book.<br /><br />I am not a DiCaprio fan, but I must say the man certainly has done his homework and applied it into his portrayal of Teddy Daniels....believe me, you WILL believe!<br /><br />There are wonderful cameo roles throughout the film, certainly the stellar job done by Ben Kingsley, and those of Michelle Williams, and a great turn by Max von Sydow that will chill you deeply.

1595141715|5.0|This is the story about a boy, Clay, who has a package arrive at his house and opens it to find seven tapes. Upon finding a place to listen to them, he discovers that the voice is recognizable - it is the voice of a classmate, Hannah, who killed herself several weeks earlier. She is explaining that if the tapes arrived at the listener's house, it is because he had something to do with her decision. The rest of the book is a mixture of Hannah's voice on the tapes and Clay's journey with her to the places that were significant. He has his memories mixed with hers, shares many of her opinions and learns things about his classmates that changes his viewpoint of them.    Suicide is undeniably one of the most sensitive issues to base a book on. I really did have many doubts about this book, but after reading, I can say in all honesty that is truly depicts the conflicts in quite possibly one of the most socially challenging times - high school, and helps the readers understand what kind of an impact one person can have on another. Since I got copies of this book in my room, I could not keep them there for long. Some may have hesitations that this would encourage suicide or depict it in a positive light, but that's not it at all. This book would open all kinds of discussion between parents and kids, has depth and is written beautifully.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Read this, and then re-read this.  You will see elements to most every romance novel, play and movie produced since this work was published.  If you're a bit obsessive, you may even become an Austenite, seeking P&P rewrites, continuations, movies derived from it, etc.  My faves of these are Bridget Jones's Diary (the first book and movie), The Bar Sinister (book continuation), and Lost in Austen (movie).  There are TONS of these types of adaptations and explorations of the original novel, and for good reason: it is excellent.

B000AWYOGE|4.0|I started watching Dark Water a few times in the last five years only to find myself a little bored half way through, or maybe i just wasn't in the mood for a slower paced film. But it always did stick out when i went through my movie collection to watch other things, i'd think ok, umm nah. So finally i popped it in a few nights ago and said ok i'm gonna get all the way through it. The first time it by no means sucked but i couldnt really remember a whole lot about it. Jennifer Conelly is great in every role i've seen her in, this one is no different, also she's really cute, lil to skinny in this film but i won't hold that against her ha. The atmosphere is great, dark, wet, creepy, and old, u can almost smell the dank air and mill dew in the apartment complex of the film. Dark Water mainly revolves around the complex where Jennifer C moves with her estranged daughter, who really doesnt have any issues until after they move in. The leak in the ceiling, the creepy upstairs apartment thats flooded with dirty brown water, but full or furniture, these all play a big part in the whole premise of the film. I won't say much else but the front desk gentleman might not be quite who u think he is, and James C. Reily as the landlord is just classic here. Very realistic. So the movie is by no means terrifying as i said, but indeed, unnerving, creepy, and very weird in some cases. But at the end you'll be glad you finished it, it might not be what you thought, or how you thought it would end, but hey i was satisfied once i finihsed it.:D

0316017922|3.0|A friend of mine told me the story from \\"Outliers\\" about the Hockey player's birthdates and how they could contribute favorably to future success.  As a parent, my friend's brief description about a seemingly unimportant statistic and how it can attribute to ones success intrigued me enough to buy the book.     Unfortunately, the thought provoking Hockey observation was the only really compelling section of the book.  The remainder of the information used to reinforce his thesis about how success in based partly on randomness, is just not convincing.  The information and stories presented are all very interesting but Gladwell's observations dance along the edge of an idea and then he flits to a new observation before looking deeper into his first.    \\"Outliers\\" offers up some very entertaining and interesting observation on the randomness of success, but there is very little meat to support these observations.  I have never read anything by Malcolm Gladwell so he may only offer interesting observation as a gateway to bigger discussions and not offer conclusions.  If so, then the book succeeded. It got me thinking and reaffirmed some observations I have made.  However, it still left me only with a sample of something I wish I had more of.

All the characters fit right in (although I wish they would bring Zach back).  I have all the prior seasons and pre-ordered the latest.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Wow Wow - HIGH ENERGY - Fantastic Concert! A Must Have! I knew I was going to like this DVD, but I really had no idea just how much! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!    I have purchased so many Live Concert DVDs over the years, and we love to watch them over and over. But I have to say that this Concert DVD has to be the very best that I have ever bought.    Right from the jump they have the whole place rockin'. The Music is excellent through-out and you can tell that the musicians are really having a fantastic time.    Chicago is Awesome. Earth, Wind & Fire is Amazing. And when they play together you will not be able to sit still!    Can't wait to share this DVD with all my family and friends. Will definitely have it playing at my next party!    I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough!
B003HLM2QO|1.0|This Scream album is mediocre and packaging & artwork are terrible. If you don't already own them all, go back and buy the first 5 Black Sabbath records. They are all you will ever need.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I find Castle and Beckett are a dynamic duo in this entertaining series.  Watching them catch the \\"bad guys\\" is fun to watch.  All the characters are great!  I have the first season and pre-ordered the second.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Chapter by Chapter, this is by far the best musical documentary I have seen, since Metallicas \\" Some Kind of Monster\\". What a treasure chest of \\" Back in the Day\\" clips, with current views from bands that Rush has opened for, ( Wish the U.F.O. guys could have chimed in), Gene Simmons by far takes the cake in giving his thoughts of the group. To this day you can still see the respect that each band has for each other.<br /><br />You can't go wrong in purchasing this, you will watch it over and over and over.<br /><br />Viva RUSH!!!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Nothing bad to say about this collection. Yes they changed the music but since mtv was too stupid to get the rights for it in the first place, that is the only way they would be able to release this in the first place. Its loaded with features- Daria and Jane introduce some episodes from Daria Day. It has both of the movies as well which I was reall glad to see I didn't have to make an additional purchase for them. Great show then, great show now.
B002VECLVO|4.0|When George (Colin Firth) loses his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) after sixteen years together, the color has disappeared from his life.  He goes through the routines, thinking often of the past; his primary connections are his students at the small university where he teaches and an old friend Charley (Julianne Moore).<br /><br />His next-door neighbors have two small children, and the occasional noise and other activities sometimes feel like an intrusion into the quiet life he now lives.<br /><br />Then one day a student seems to connect to George and a dialogue begins.<br /><br />Meanwhile, however, George seems to be going through a process--getting his papers in order; picking out a suitable outfit; and buying bullets for his gun.  As he moves slowly forward toward some kind of conclusion, we see fewer flashbacks into memories.<br /><br />What happens ultimately, however, is a surprising \\"intrusion\\" that is unexpected and perhaps fortuitous.  But then, just when we believe we know what will happen, another unexpected event turns everything around again.<br /><br />Throughout [[ASIN:B002VECLVO A Single Man]], I noticed the visual effects that set the past and present apart.  The film makers displayed the past moments in vivid colors, while the present lacked the depth of tone.  The present seemed almost cloaked in sepia tones, but not quite.<br /><br />The setting for this movie was 1962 LA, with the Cuban missile crisis casting its own pall over the characters' lives.  There were many things that showed us this time period--rotary telephones; older cars; clothing; hairstyles; and, of course, the sense that the characters were grabbing life's pleasures when impending doom seemed to lurk.  Another telling aspect of the times was the \\"secrecy\\" surrounding George's homosexuality, a definite pointer to a less accepting period in our history.<br /><br />After I watched the movie, I felt depressed and cloaked in the futility of life and any kind of a future. It reminded me of how I felt during that year, when as college students, we listened to our professors as they vividly described the political climate in which we lived.<br /><br />I gave the film four stars, primarily because I didn't really like it.  I got the message and I thought the different shades of color were a clever way to distinguish past and present.  But aside from that subtle distinction, there was little about the movie that would linger on in my mind or add anything to my repertoire of memories.e of how I felt during that year, when as college students, we listened to our professors as they vividly described the political climate in which we lived.<br /><br />I gave the film four stars, primarily because I didn't really like it.

B00005JXY3|5.0|With the new Karate Kid movie (with Jaden Smith) in theaters now, I took it upon myself to purchase the original Ralph Macchio movies and watch them with my son.  Karate Kid 2 is wonderful!    If you're lucky enough to find them in your local store, like I did; you will find coupons for a movie ticket to watch the new Karate Kid (with Jaden Smith) and/or concession stand food ($10). so, in essence, you're getting the original movies FREE!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|This one has been trashed by most fans, maybe marketing Venom who only has maybe 20 minutes screen time as a major villian was a bad idea here, I don't know, I fail to see where the overated \\"Spiderman 2\\" is considered the best one, this one to me is the best one because it pulls no punches, Tobey McGuire really gets to let loose with Peter's dark side here, which was fun, & Kirsten Dunst really looks her best here, she was pretty in the first two, but here, she really shines in her beauty, also, Bryce Dallas Howard is also nice to look at here & looks just like her comic book character, Topher Grace was the last guy I pictured as Venom, but I think he pulled it off in the end, he was really having fun with it no doubt, but I think what I really liked was how the characters developed more here, Harry as the new Goblin was a bit underused, but no doubt effective, however his teaming up with Spiderman in the end never happened in the comics, but there teaming up here was a nice change of pace, this ending was much better than the first two films ending, the building construction sequence with Mary Jane's fate hanging in the balance was a bit more intense & threatning that what we were given in the first two films, although I think they probably could have done without Sandman, still, he too was a fun villian, of the 3 films this is my favorite, J.K. Simmons once again chews up the scenery as Jonah Jameson, talk about having fun with a character, all in all, the best of the three in my view..
0800179501|5.0|The original is where it's at!  I recently purchased all 3 of them and I am thrilled that my son is loving them as much as I did back in the 80s.  While I did watch the new Karate Kid movie with Jaden Smith; the original will always have a special place in my heart.  So, what are you doing here??  Got get a copy; and if you're lucky like I was...you will find attached coupons to get either free admission to the new movie or free consession food (worth $10).
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I have read most of the reviews on this one good & bad, & most are well defined, so I will try to give an honest viewpoint, first off, I don't hate this one, but I couldn't help but feel that it was trying too hard, below are my Pro & Cons on this one    The Pros...(Good stuff)    Cate Blanchett was a good villian, a step up from Allison Doody's Elsa in \\"Last Crusade\\"  The Area 51 sequence in the opening moments were fun, the blink-you-miss-it shot of the Ark was played for laughs no doubt    Shia LeBeouf as Mutt & his appearance was accurate to the time (the 50's)    Harrison Ford as a aged Indy was no different than a aged Obi-Wan or Captain Kirk    The feel of the previous films was there...    The action was definately on par with the previous films    Now for the Cons...(Bad stuff)    The return of Karen Allen was a bad idea, I have nothing against her as an actress, & loved her in the original, but, I just didn't see the point of bringing her back, she really wasn't attuned to her character in the first film, nothing about her in this one reminded me of her in that one...& why not bring back Willie Scott & Short Round too...    Indy's sidekick constantly switching sides, if Short Round or Sallah had done this, Indy would have shot Sallah, & left Short Round in the \\"Temple of Doom\\", here he just goes with flow in the hope that his sidekick is on his side....    The hypnosis scene involving the Crystal Skull.....what was that all about??...did I miss somthing?..    The alien angle did seem out of place a bit, but not inconceivable considering that the Mayans were said to be super intelligent, & that many of the world's ancient places such as the Pyramids in Egypt are still a mystery, Lucas & Speilberg apparently are fans of the film \\"Stargate\\" with Kurt Russell, because they borrowed this aspect from it...    Overall, I liked this one, but I feel that it could have easily ended with \\"Last Crusade\\", It is pretty clear that Lucas, Speilberg, & Ford all had different ideas here, & at times I felt that they might have been trying to accomplish different things, whereas in the previous 3 films there was a continuous flow, here, the flow seems to be going in different directions,      & why end it with Indy & Marion getting married, you can't reconnect that fast, can you?    This one to me is a mixed bag, after repeated viewings, these minor points are starting to bug me, I hate it when films I like do that to me, overall, this one is just as fun, but given Shia LeBeouf's recent comments about him & Ford being a bit displeased with it, you have to wonder if Lucas, Speilberg, Ford, & Shia are even speaking to each other right now...
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This download contains a handful of mysteries that can be read independently.  Each is a good quick read, and they are great when you have a little bit of time to kill.  I would highly recommend Sherlock Holmes to everyone.
0385732554|5.0|I picked up this book because I wanted to compare Utopian to the Dystopian literature I've been reading lately. A Newberry award winning novel published in 1994, Lois Lowry's, The Giver, tells of a world in which choice and free will are virtually unknown by it's inhabitants--There is also no crime, hunger, pain or poverty. This seemingly perfect existence is appealing on the surface, but all a reader needs to do, is explore the world that Lowry creates in The Giver, to understand the concept of a Utopian society is a misnomer.    The plot revolves around the novels young protagonist, Jonas, as he approaches his twelfth birthday. Upon the twelfth birthday, all children begin the transition into adulthood and are assigned their occupational roles in the community. Jonas is chosen to become the next Receiver of Memories, the most honored position in the community and a skill no other member of the community has. During his tutelage, Jonas gains the memories of centuries past, of those that lived before, that go \\"back and back and back\\", and the facade of his safe existence crumbles around him as he learns about choice and free will.    Some of the imagery that Lowry creates reminds me of the 1998 Hollywood blockbuster, Pleasantville, staring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon. Jonas, the 12 year old protagonist in the novel is like a younger version of the character, Mr. Maguire played in Pleasantville, and he wins you over with his upstanding moral character, innocence, compassion and curiosity.    The Giver is a very short book at only 180 pages, but complete in it's message. Supporting characters never fully get fleshed out, but they're not the driving force behind the authors message. The world building is--it's precise and genius in it's simplicity. I found this book a quick, utterly fascinating read--the ending, disturbing yet thought provoking. Thousands of reviews demonstrate why this novel is a must read for those interested in Utopian or Dystopian Sci-fi.
030726999X|5.0|This is book three of what was suppose to be ten on the saga of Lisbeth Salander, the fearless  unclassifiable hacker with the dragon tattoo and  investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />These first three cover the circumstances of their meeting, working together and Salander's  life.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson uses his life long experiences, passions and knowledge in the fields of journalism, the magazine publishing business, political activism and  extremist groups (nazis)<br /><br />All three books are stellar.  Prepare to get involved.
030726999X|5.0|As engrossing as the previous two. This third and last installment fulfills expectations and ties up most of the loose ends. This trilogy is surprisingly addictive. Relax and enjoy.
B00005JPD0|5.0|This isn't an overly deep movie, but it deals with issues of time travel, causality, determinism, destiny, limits of science, and multiple universes in a manner which I found both new and intriguing.  The science is surely flawed in ways that a cosmologist would be quick to point out, but any such flaws aren't glaring enough to ruin the movie.  Related to this, the time travel aspect created the usual logical paradoxes (if not outright contradictions), but they weren't severe enough to render the plot incoherent, and I like the way the movie kept me trying to figure out what was going on and what might happen next, right up to the very end.<br /><br />Regarding the acting, as always, the character portrayed by Denzel Washington comes across as smart and commanding.  I can't recall Denzel ever having disappointed me.  I suppose Val Kilmer was also OK, though his role was very minor and dispensable - probably just there to help bring in revenue.  The other actors were also adequate, except that the character representing the co-star's father was implausibly unemotional, whereas the co-star herself was pretty good (and pretty too).<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone interested in an action-packed detective movie which covers some rather intriguing themes.  Though it won't become a classic, this movie was still entertaining enough to warrant 5 stars in my book.
038073186X|4.0|I read the book in two days and couldn't put it down.  The ending was brilliant.  Until the very last few pages I didn't know which way it would go and I'll say no more about that.  The evening I finished the book I watched the movie.  I was so excited...  and so disappointed.  The movie was pale and uninspiring.  Was it because the book was so excellent?  I highly recommend this book.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|After having read all the Percy Jackson books, I had high hopes for this movie.  Was I ever disappointed!   The story deviated almost immediately from the book.  It left out crucial parts of the book that create the overall story carried throughout the entire series.  I was tempted to stop the movie multiple times.  Hopefully they will not make any more movies in the series.  I don't see how they could even if they wanted to since they left out all the parts concerning the Titans.
B001FB5634|5.0|I never really recall hearing much about this movie, and I can see why. It seems to me that often, when a movie is dark and serious with little to no humor to be had, little is said about it. Being a huge fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, I'm decided to take a look into what this movie had to offer when visiting my local movie rental shop. Probably the best money I've spent to rent a movie in quite some time. This movie takes a realistic look into a ruined world. For those who tend to look for expensive CG effects and car chases, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. The length of the movie is just right, has a satisfying ending, and does an amazing job at drawing you into the world it creates. Do yourself a favor, check this movie out as soon as you get the chance.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This is the first time in my life I have listened to music (track 13), and it has truly lifted my spirit and made me want to be a better person.  This album is among the best I have ever heard, anywhere, period.
0385523386|5.0|I'm going to cut to the chase and just say how much I enjoyed this book. It was a quick and easy read and I thought it was a compelling tale of the author's experience in prison. Many of us - fortunately - don't know anything about that life and it was entertaining to read about what she went through. The vivid portrayals of fellow inmates were particularly interesting, as well as the survival techniques that she develops. Enjoyed this more than, for example, Eat Pray Love.
3795753384|5.0|Orff's \\"Carmina Burana\\" was and is just a monumental creation, and one of the most fun works to perform.  This vocal score has always been a must-have for the serious choral musician.  Until now, my main complaint with the score has been that the text (hand-written, or in an italic font made to look handwritten) was quite hard to read.  This new engraving has totally eliminated the problem.  The spacing of the music has been improved as well.  The actual music remains the same, of course, but now it's much more readable.  Thanks, Schott Publishing (and Hal Leonard), for making a great score even better.  (Plus, Amazon's discount off the high list price was the best I found on the web.)
B0000TG9E2|4.0|What is there to say... I grew up watching this version of Alice and watching it again was a trip!  The female lead can NOT sing, even though Alice sings a bit, but the animation is still beuatiful and the songs are still fun.      A great trip down memory lane, even if it is not a movie I would seek out now!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I absolutely adore Jillian Michaels.  If I were rich, I would hire her to be my personal trainer.  This video is the next best thing.  It lasts less than 30 minutes and gives a fabulous workout, but I don't think it's feasible to do this workout EVERYDAY for 30 days.  This is an extremely hard workout for beginners. I am not new to working out and it kicked my behind.  I first tried to do this video one day and alternate it with the elliptical machine. I didn't loose an ounce. In fact, I gained some weight. I read a review that said that your muscles retain water after the workout and that explained the problems I was having.  I left it alone for a few months.  I just started back. I did the workout for four days straight last week and had the same problem.  But when I rested over the weekend, I found I had lost 3 pounds!  This workout works, but you really need to let your muscles rest some.
0679731369|5.0|Created from a jumble of non-narrative forms--from anecdote to glossary to literary criticism to timetable--Flaubert's Parrot is a showcase of postmodern fiction and its devices. What makes it so special and so rich is its central character, or rather the respect and sensitivity Julian Barnes brings to the creation of that character. In many ways, the pyrotechnical brilliance that shapes Flaubert's Parrot can be seen as an ingenious method of description created for the sole purpose of NOT belittling the novel's central character, Geoffrey Braithwaite. Much like Flaubert, Barnes champions the butt of jokes. But where Flaubert could only see unhappy endings, Barnes finds it in his heart to imagine Geoffrey Braithwaite a meaningful if eccentric survival. No cynicism, no surprise endings, just a firm and gentle belief that acceptance is a measured life's crucial virtue and a life story to prove it. I'm not so sure that I love Geoffrey Braithwaite after reading Flaubert's Parrot, but I adore Julian Barnes for taking his side. In doing so, he gently proposes that the interconnected narratives of life and art find ways to sustain each other in the humblest of circumstances and through the least auspicious among us.
B002ZG997C|3.0|Because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews posted here I expected to love this movie. I didn't. This is just another action movie set in a post apocalyptic future. If violent action movies are your cup of tea then you will probably love this movie. If not, then you'll want to skip this one. It was okay but this genre of fiction has been done much better. I don't consider this one a must see. On a positive note, I found the soundtrack very evocative.
1439175640|5.0|This is a great cookbook, with recipes from the famous Magnolia Bakery in New York City! I have been to NYC several times and my family and I have waited in line and hour and a half to two hours to purchase wonderful baked goods! First of all, well worth the wait!!! Secondly, those very recipes are in this book!<br /><br />OMG the \\"Peaches and Cream Pie with Sugar Cookie Crust\\" on page 171 is the best pie I have ever eaten! If you want a fabulous addition to it: reconstitute some dried apricots in apricot brandy, chop them and put them on top of this pie!!! Out of this world fabulous!!!<br /><br />All the recipes are easy to follow and wonderful to eat!!!
1439148953|3.0|The book jacket is filled with reviews with accolades for this book but I did not find that it lived up to these rave reviews.  For one thing, this book is very DULL.  Literally nothing happens for about 100 pages.  The main character, Eilias has no spark, no passion and is quite one dimensional.  So much so that the events of the last 20 pages seem incongrous with her personality as depicted thoroughout the story.    The story of immigrants' assimilation into a new culture is a familiar one. I was disappointed by Toibin's inability to bring any new interpretation or spark to this discussion.  The characters seem to lack depth and are not very formed which makes it difficult for the reader to care very deeply about them.  This is especially true of Eilias herself as well as her boyfriend and the boarders with whom she lives.  The relationship between Eilias and her sister, Rose, is central to the plot yet, the author does a very poor job of developing Rose's character to the extent that the reader has a sense of why that relationship is so important to these sisters. I never got a sense about any of these folks beyond the most superficial of details.    I did finish the book but was greatly disappointed by it. I agree that Toibin is a good writer but his character development is poor and that, coupled with a thin plot, makes for a very lackluster read.

0525423842|4.0|Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer by John Grishman is not up to par with Grisham's other work. John Grishman has long been my favorite author and I think I've read and collected everything he has published. This book was unbelievable and a letdown for me. I don't recommend it.
0385333846|5.0|This was one of the most innovative books I read in American literature. It deals with a subject as touchy as the killing of 100,000 people with graceful sarcasm. Highly recommended.
030745455X|5.0|not too much that i can say that hasn't already been said.  if you liked the first one, you'll like this one too-it is a trilogy and all 3 r great!
B002BJGYUS|4.0|My wife and I recently started watching this series and have enjoyed it quite a bit.  The fast talking antics of Lorelai and Rori Gilmore keep us entertained for hours.  While the show can roam into the \\"girly\\" drama, as a man I have no problem saying I enjoying watching this show.  Some of the peripheral characters can be too much at times and the plots often revolve around cliche relationship dramas, but the quick dialog and witty banter of the leads helps keep this show out of the one-note realm toward which too many TV shows tend these days.
030745455X|5.0|I enjoyed this one better than the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The pacing and plot has more twists and more action than the first. I'd say one reason is there is more of Lisbeth in this book than the last. Good thing is it is not necessary to have read the first one to enjoy this one, it is helpful though. Larsson's Lisbeth character is well drawn as our hero but she is not your typical hero, far from it. She extracts her own form of justice in this one. This book is well done and my fav so far of the two I have read. Of course I have just begun reading the third book and will report on that later. I just watched the movie adaptation of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and must say it was well done! I understand the other two movies will be released in the US later this fall, dubbed in English.<br />If you like action, mysteries and thillers this is a good one for you. Unlike the first book you won't have to wait 350 pages before you can sink your teeth into the story.
B001WCN232|5.0|Most of the reviewers are so nuts over a few missing cuss words in the last song that I got the earlier version of this. I wish some people who have both could address whether there in any improvement in sound on this release. I love the album but I wish it was a little less murky on the re master before this one. Also by the way, I really think the Rollings lost a lot when they lost Taylor. He kept them in the blues. Before he left it seemed like they were going to go on forever, after he left they fell apart in the studio and the band even broke up for a while. PS the \\"Goat's Head\\" is supposed to be a devil reference.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Halloween. This is one of those horror films, started on a very low budget, now is one of the biggest movie and film phenomenas ever. Having been remade, 7 sequels, thats pretty popular.<br /><br />But now, lets get into this story.<br /><br />The movie begins years back when Michael Myers was a kid, dressed up as a clown for Halloween. He violently murdered his sister, and has been screwed in the head ever since. His doctor, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is on to him after he gets out of the institution. The main movie focuses around Laurie Strode (Jaime L. Curtis) who has to babysit a young boy named Tommy. Michael Myers tracks her down, and the night of Halloween really begins, changing the aspect of the holiay for most horror fans.<br /><br />This movie, as low budget as it is, does not show awhole lot of gore, but thats the golden part, the suspence, mystery, and imagination on how he can kill these people.<br /><br />I'm sure most people know that the actual mask for Michael Myers was a Shatner mask, spray-painted white. The mask works perfectly for the character of Michael Myers, because he has no face, blank face, no personality, just a violent soul if you will. The theme song is a big part of pop culture now, that piano/synth. If you hear that song you will instantly think of Halloween or Michael Myers. So the original Halloween is a giant recommendation for anyone who has not seen it yet, its way better than the new Rob Zombie version, which in my opinion sucked.
B000OPPSXK|5.0|If there ever was a set that deserved five stars, this is it. It's the best Mozart around bar none. Until I discovered these recordings Mozart didn't even figure very prominently in my playlist (which is much more geared towards 20th century repertoire). But, frankly, this is 'desert island' stuff. As a septuagenarian, shortly before his death, Krips was able to infuse this music with extraordinary vitality and warmth. The Concertgebouw Orchestra play with supreme command, sparklingly, lithely, wholeheartedly, like a band of friends. Ideological battles between period and old style performances simply evaporate in the face of such exalted, timeless music making. The Decca transfers, dating from the early seventies, are simply wonderful. Despite the wizardry of today's high-resolution recordings, this level of engineering has never been surpassed. Obviously, this set deserves the strongest recommendation.

B002CX99PA|3.0|I purchased these headphones because they were recommended by a friend. He said that they were really good specially for the price they were. I never tried them on before, I just took his word for it. So I decided to give them a try and purchased them. As soon as I got them, I put them on and tried them out with several devises. I tried them on my iPod, with my Korg M3, for watching a movie and in Youtube. The one thing that I quickly noticed was that the noise cancellation on these headphones was very poor. Personally I care for this feature because there's always a lot of noise around my house and its hard when I'm trying to record something (since I record or pay attention to a particular piece of music. They are comfortable, I think because it almost feel like I didn't have them on... maybe because of my puffy hair. They put almost no pressure on you're head at and feel like of you move you're head rapidly they could slip off. The sound quality is decent, but its nothing to go crazy for. In fact I had previously just tried some Auvio Concert Class Stereo Headphones and I have to say that i liked those a lot better. The reason being is that they do a significantly better job at exterior noise cancellation and you can find them in RadioShack for about $49.99. Personally these K99's are okay headphones but I wasn't satisfied with them. I was looking for somethings that did the noise cancellation and that didn't feel so hollow. I say this because they are really light! and its because they are mostly made from this very light plastic. Im not necessarily saying that this is a bad thing because I'm pretty sure some people dig light headphones but I'm not into that feeling. If ambient noise is not a problem for you, if you like really light headphones, for this price they are okay headphones. They just didn't satisfy my specific needs. I went to Best buy to try some Sony-Extra Bass Over-the-Ear Headphones and they were really good. I was quickly impressed by them and as soon as I return these, I'm going to purchase those.s soon as I return these, I'm going to purchase those.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is a great. All rush fans feel like they are part of the band. With this blu you just to know them better. Alex is just one funny guy. I wont get bored watching this. They truly are like family with each other and invite you in.
B0016NF06O|5.0|If you close your eyes and listen to this CD, you can imagine how it must have been created.  You can picture Willie Nelson's tour bus stuck on the side of the road.  You can picture Wynton Marsalis' bus pulling over to help out.  You can picture the musicians meeting, introducing their bands.  And then Willie says \\"Hey, man, while we wait on the tow truck, let's jam for a while.\\"<br /><br />And that's the album.  It isn't a groundbreaking, historic summit of two great artistic minds.  It is two phenomenal musicians getting together and having a good time.  The tunes are standards - the kind you don't need to read music for.  These old country, jazz, and blues charts aren't brilliantly reinvisioned.  They are just played with tremendous skill and infectious good-humor.  Wynton even sings a few verses himself.<br /><br />This album is fun. That's all. It is good to hear Willie and Wynton, their bands mixed together and exactly on the same page, just having a fine time.  I know I had one as well.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Michael Haneke's supreme masterpiece \\"White ribbon\\" is - without hesitation - one of the three best films of 2009. Let's leave aside the undeniable influence of two giant filmmakers like Dreyer and Bergman along its impeccable cinematography and splendid visual refinement.<br /><br />If we take a backward glance, this film follows the steps of three memorable and historical films. \\"Pandora' box\\", \\"M\\" and \\"The raven\\", who worked out as a real cathartic device to state the inner demons who nestled underneath the collective conscious as product of the oppressive years of the WW2.<br /><br />But the fundamental difference resides around the allusive metaphor about the horrors made by the envy, apathy, resentment around all sort of hierarchy which denoted a symbol of intellectual preeminence or social status.<br /><br />The victims are the son of the Baron (just a precognitive alarm of the Archduke Fernando in Sarajevo) and the fall of the doctor of the town (a nasty strategy) from a horse due its execrable intimate behavior as human being in his double condition as couple and father, seem to reveal that before the Nazi ideology arrived, the ideal conditions nestled into the spirit of many people. The repulsive and abominable behavior of the Protestant pastor treating and blackmailing the denounce and suspects of the ethical conscious conform a first-order and mature drama that carves in relief a courageous and bold film.<br /><br />The voice in off not only works out as a perfect device of the inner voices of a desperate and noble spirit who intimately seem to anticipate the dark clouds which would sift over Germany into a very near future.<br /><br />A masterwork all the way through...
030726999X|4.0|The remarkable character of Lisbeth Salander greets the reader, so to speak, at the beginning of this book.  This time she is in hospital with a wound in her head.  Why does she always get into trouble?  If someone starts digging into her life, it seems that everything she says creates havoc among important and mysterious monitoring authorities.  She seems to be a menace and she must disappear at all costs.  Better locked up in a mental asylum than to have her around.  The conspiracy surrounding her continues.<br /><br />Meanwhile, journalist Mikael Blomkvist is able to unravel part of Lisbeth's terrible past and decides to print an accusatory article on Millennium magazine which could shake to the core security services, the government and the whole country, in a whirlwind of obscure plots and corrupted secret services.<br /><br />Another edge-of-the-seat thriller.  Perhaps, out of the three books, this is the one that I found a trifle too far-fetched.  However it captures the rhythm of our times and shows what could happen if perversions take over in an unhealthy, unsound system; another statement about violence against women.<br /><br />I cannot but reiterate that it is so sad that the author did not survive to see how successful his Trilogy has become.  A final note is, if you have not yet read the first two books, do not start with this one, you would spoil the reading of the others.  Get the first book and carry on from there.  If you like this genre, you can rest assured that you will not be able to put any of them down!
B0021L8UPS|5.0|The orphan is a very smart suspense film. It's pleasant to watch such doses of mystery about this execrable child who leaves behind the well reminded motion picture \\"Bad seed\\" in the late Fifties.<br /><br />The dramatic narration work out as a well deserved homage to the great Dario Argento and Mario Bava  two magisterial Italian directors during the sixties and seventies respectively.<br /><br />Suspenseful and terrifying movie. Not recommended for squeamish.
030745455X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are linked once again in a terrible story of the sex-trafficking industry in Sweden.  In this book we start to learn a little more about Lisbeth herself.  She is an extremely independent young woman, relentless when it comes to abuse and corruption, especially the ones related to women.  Her amazing computer skills make her an incredibly clever hacker and this helps to reveal a lot of cover-ups.  But she has a side that remains mysterious...<br /><br />One day a couple living together in a nice neighbourhood is found dead, murdered by the hands of what seems a professional killer.  One of them was currently working at the Millennium magazine.  What could have happened?  Why this senseless murder?  Lisbeth Salander is linked to this murder and a nationwide search takes place.  She seems to have vanished.  Mikael tries to contact her to no avail.<br /><br />Here we go again, glued to the pages.  Twists & turns at every corner.  Incredible entertaining!  And just like with the first book, I could not wait to dig into the next sequel as soon as I finished this one.  Enjoy!

0307454541|5.0|It starts off quite slowly. But then an incredible escalation of events takes over. If you like this genre, you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />This is the story of the Vanger family. A long, intricate story of hate, love and family feuds. Famous journalist Mikael Blomkvist -well known for heading the Millennium magazine specialized in reportages about corruption in the industrial world- is the recipient of this story, involving the disappearance, long ago, of Harriet Vanger, grandchild to Henrik Venger, a very powerful businessman. Since her disappearance, Venger receives, each year without fail, a gift. No sender, no clues. Just an anonymous gift which reopens his wound each time. Before he dies, he needs to know what happened to Harriet.<br /><br />On the Baltic coast, Blomkvist, aided by young, mysterious and rebellious Lisbeth Salander, who's also a very capable hacker, investigates the story and the more they learn about it, the more horrendous everything starts to look.<br /><br />An edge-of-the-seat thriller which will keep you glued to the pages. The secondary story -involving Blomkvist's charges against a local tycoon - is also incredibly well positioned within the book and it doesn't spoil the main story involving the Vanger family.<br />As soon as you finish the book, you want to open up the sequel and continue reading. It is that brilliant! And what a sad, sad occurrence that Mr. Larsson did not live long enough to see the fantastic success his books are generating.<br /><br />P.S. I've recently seen the movie version of this book. Forget it! It is neither incisive nor does it capture all the main points so finely analysed by a great narrative in the book. Quite dull I'm afraid. The printed matter is SO MUCH better!

B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love the new Doctor and the series.  I have followed Doctor Who since the third Doctor, JP.  I think he brings a charm and a fresh change.  Although, Tom Baker will be my favorite and CE. the 9th; Matt has grown on me and gets the Doctor. I like his new sidekicks and Karen Gillian plays off him very well.  I will be buying this series when it comes out, and I highly recommend this, coming from a long time fan!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I was well pleased with the product. My only complaint would be the fact that each disc came a dvd case of its own. Each disc was new, and each case had the proper case covering. Discs play great! I would recommend this seller. Plus, they sent me a free dvd with my purchase. The dvd was Stardust. Strange movie, and it made me laugh throughout even though it was not the intention of the film.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|I enjoyed Roman Polanski's adaptation of Robert Harris' novel [[ASIN:B000XTGFTS The Ghost: A Novel (HARDCOVER)]], renamed 'The Ghost Writer' for US release.  The movie, too, takes the name of the US book release.  Shame that, because 'The Ghost' is a more apt title - Harris' trick is to never provide a name to the Ewan McGregor writer character...a feat Polanski pulls off as well.  The Ghost role was originally supposed to go to Nicolas Cage, but passed to McGregor.  That was a major upgrade - Cage has become a cartoon.  Harris' protagonist is short on ego and confidence and has a bit of marketing and Fleet Street in him.  McGregor is perfect.<br /><br />Harris' book is a thinly veiled broadside at Tony Blair.  Harris had been a supporter of Blair's, but soured on him over Iraq.  Here's where the movie excels over the book: Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang is positively Blair-ian down to his fiber.  No less subtle is Harris' depiction of Lang's wife, Ruth, as shrewish and scheming (and more), pretty much hitting and playing up the worst rumors of Cherie Blair's behind-the-scenes role at 10 Downing St.  The Blairs can't be at all happy with this portrayal, most notably with Harris' denouement as it comes to the Adam Lang character.  And, if anything, Polanski's version is even more shocking as it comes to its treatment of Lang in the end.  It seems almost incendiary.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film a bit less than the book.  The book's tone is superb.  I was hooked right from the first line - \\"The moment I heard how McAra died, I should have walked away.\\"  That's one of the best opening lines ever for a novel.  I have to admit I was fairly obsessed with cataloging the differences between book and film, mostly those due to what I'll call \\"Polanski-induced restrictions.\\"  The book takes place mostly in three locales: London; Martha's Vineyard and New York City.  Polanski can travel to none of those places.  So, Berlin serves as London.  A bleak island in the North Sea serves as gray, wintertime Martha's Vineyard.  And Harris and Polanski - as adapters of the novel into a screenplay - conspire to write NYC out of the plot all together.time Martha's Vineyard.

Worth more than one viewing for sure.<br /><br />  Dont be thrown off my people who rate this film poorly due to religious views (obnoxious). If the book was hiding the secrets to an alien race of cyborg soldiers, nobody would complain.<br /><br />  Great movie. Cool concept. Original story. Great acting. Awesome action. Enough said.

1594488916|2.0|Perhaps in better hands this story would have become a thoughtful examination of the object versus knowledge, genuine wonder versus pretentious greed, or even the art of the published word and those who dedicate their lives and time to its preservation in an increasingly electronic world. This book is none of these things. I expected a thoughtful literary story similar to Laney Salisbury and Aly Sujo's \\"Provenance\\" but instead we are given all of the idiocy and selfish literary depth of \\"Julie and Julia.\\"     Ms. Bartlett tries to stretch a mildly interesting but repetitive magazine article about credit card fraud into something more, but unfortunately there is no there there. Her subject is a boring clod of a con, so the author fills each moment with her own shallow feelings and assumptions about the feelings of others within her weak story.     In the end we are left questioning, with all of this wonderful literary content available to us in these struggling bookseller shops, why in the world have we wasted our time reading this empty bloated nothing?

1847242537|2.0|I\\"m giving this book two stars. It was a huge disappointment to me, as it was recommended by a couple of people who I generally consider reliable in matters of taste.<br /><br />As has been correctly observed already by many reviewers, the book suffers from poor writing. I suspect that this is mainly due to bad translation, but I don't read speak/read Swedish, and even if I did, I wouldn't put myself through this story again just to see if it's better in the native language.<br /><br />Some of my big criticisms are;<br /><br />1 - Boring main character. Mikael Blomkvist is terribly dull. Yes, he's the main character, not the girl of the title. She's maybe slightly more interesting, but only maybe, and only slightly.<br /><br />2 - Too many sub-plots. I won't bore you with the details, but suffice it to say that there are a number of sub-plots that literally have nothing to do with the main mystery.<br /><br />3 - Takes forever to get to the point. The first 200 or so pages don't deal with the main mystery in any way. That's a third of the book that doesn't have any bearing on the main theme.<br /><br />Beyond those main criticisms, the book is filled with cliches and awkward writing. The editor and translator should be made to read this book 50 times over as punishment.<br /><br />Back to the main character, Blomkvist. The more I think about him, the less I like him, and that's a really bad thing for the protagonist. He doesn't DO anything in this book. Things happen TO him, but he is reactive only. Yes, he starts to piece together a decades old mystery, but it's so drawn out, and ultimately uninteresting, that I didn't care.<br /><br />Blomkvist is a poor father, a poor husband, a poor journalist, and a poor detective. Only through an embarrassingly coincidental and fortuitous meeting with his daughter does he receive the key to the mystery. If she hadn't miraculously popped in to make her comment, he'd have never figured it out. So he's literally a failure in all facets of his life. Why should I like him?<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, the girl of the title, is also deeply flawed. She's a complete social misfit, yet late in the book we are asked to believe that all of a sudden she can pull off a series of complicated deceptions involving disguises. She's suddenly completely at ease with strangers, and not only competent in social interaction, but excels. This is too much to believe. I found her off-putting, cold, unlikeable and quite unsympathetic.<br /><br />I got the feeling that Larsson wrote this novel as a means of glorifying his profession. Unfortunately, he may have been a decent journalist, but he was a poor novelist.r, the girl of the title, is also deeply flawed.

B002VPE1YS|4.0|Description:<br /><br />The AmazonBasics Quilted Case is designed to hold small electronics such as digital cameras, small video cameras, GPS units, MP3 players, cell phones, and more.  It has foam padding, a drawstring closure for security, and a caribiner so you can clip it on your belt, pants, backpack pocketbook, etc.  It measures 4.5 X 2 .75 X 0.75 inches.<br /><br />What I like about the AmazonBasics Quilted Case:<br /><br />It is a great carrying case for small electronics.  I walk a lot and I'm always seeing things I'd like to take a picture of but hate carrying around a digital camera in my hands so it is good to have the case to carry it in that I can clip on my belt.  Besides the digital camera, the quilted bag can hold items like my glasses, IPod Shuffle (including the earphones and stand), my Flip video camera, my cell phone, keys, money, and more. The padding keeps items from getting scratched. The drawstring closes the bag up nice and tight.<br /><br />What I don't like about the AmazonBasics Quilted Case:<br /><br />It is not quite big enough.  I have an older, somewhat large, digital camera and it is a struggle to get it to fit in the bag and a struggle to get it out of the bag - not what I want when I need to take a quick picture.  There is very little give to the bag - it doesn't expand much.  My GPS unit for my car doesn't come close to fitting in the bag either.<br /><br />Bottom-line:<br /><br />While I wish it was a bit larger, the AmazonBasics Quilted Case is a nice, inexpensive carrying case for small electronics.
B000NU2CY4|3.0|I don't have to say it, since everyone knows, but just wanted to add my thoughts to this release. Paramount needs to give those of us who purchased this a free trade-in for the re-release that's supposedly coming out that fixes this quality control problem. On cable and satellite, the broadcast version is actually the way it's supposed to look, it's true 1080p as opposed to this upscaled DVD-looking mess. I'm sorry for all of us, and very disappointed. :(  Get with the program, Paramount!<br /><br />UPDATED 8/28/2013: Forgot to update this! Ever since I got the regular version replaced using the actual HD render, it looks great! I will give back a couple of stars because of it, however their customer service stinks, sadly.

B001VPJZOK|4.0|2006's \\"Scoop\\" features Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Ian McShane in a comedic murder mystery set in present day London.  As the movie opens, recently deceased journalist Joe Strombel (Ian Shane) gets handed the scoop of a lifetime, that rising young politician Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) may be a notorious serial killer.  Strombel manages a ghostly appearance in the middle of a magic act to American college student and aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), convincing her to pursue the scoop.  Pransky enlists the aid of magician Sidney Waterman, alias the Great Splendini (Woody Allen), and goes in search of her story.<br /><br />Masquerading as wealthy Jade Spense and her father, Sondra and Sidney insinuate their way into Lyman's confidence.  Jade promptly falls in love with the charming and handsome Peter; Sidney becomes increasingly suspicious on the basis of a handful of clues.  The mystery will twist back on itself before a foreseeable finale.<br /><br />\\"Scoop\\" has an interesting premise with potential for both comedy and suspense.  Jackman, Johansson, and McShane turn in solid performances.  Unfortunately, the movie suffers from a lazy plot, a too-clever ending, and entirely too much screen time for a whiny and irritating Sidney.  \\"Scoop\\" is moderately entertaining and may be of most interest to die-hard fans of Woody Allen.

B003JLA4KS|5.0|Ever since I picked up 2112 in 1976 at a Kerr Drug store in Cary NC at the tender age of 14 I've been mesmerized with this band. I've always wondered back then through A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, etc. who these guys really were and from 'Canada'? I use to sit night after night listening to their albums throughout middle school and high school. I did lose some interest in the 'keyboard' years as I believe others had, but in 1989 while in Grad school I picked up Presto and it was like meeting old friends again. This movie showed me things I never knew about these guys. I thought it was great to see their parents in the movie. It really brings home the fact these 3 guys are really just regular guys who wanted to play music. I was the same way many years ago, but never pursued it, but at least I could live it through Geddy, Alex and Neil. Been waiting for a documentary on this band and this hits a home run.

B002ZG98J6|1.0|I had hopes for this film.  It had a good book [[ASIN:B001E4F5RO THE LIGHTNING THIEF: Percy Jackson & the Olympians, Book One]] and, with Chris Columbus as director, I hoped to see some adherence to the original plotline.  Boy, was I wrong! The book plot centers about a series of mysteries -- who Percy is, why the Gods are trying to kill him and who actually stole the lightening bolt.  The book also establishes via its subplots several lead-ins to the future sequels. The movie solved the first two mysteries in the very first scene, ignored the subplots and many of the rich characterizations that made the story half-way believable.  We're left with some good CG monsters and a cast whose talents are totally wasted on a really banal dialogue.  One is left with the impression that the studio refused to come up with the money for a good script writer after spending its wad on its animations.  I feel cheated.  This is one where I'd like to go to Fox and Chris Columbus and demand my money back!
1593082800|5.0|I had never really heard of Wilkie Collins before picking up this book. It seems that today, he has been overshadowed by his friend and contemporary Charles Dickens, much like he was in his own lifetime. Last summer, I was casually browsing the Classics section at Barnes & Noble, and came across this, \\"The Woman in White\\". I had heard that Andrew Lloyd Webber had made a musical version based on this work some years before, but never anything beyond that. Curious, I decided to go out on a limb and give it a try.     It was such a thrilling, captivating page-turner that I devoured it in less than a weekend, and when I finished, I was wishing that it had gone on longer. At 600+ pages, it's big, but I'm a fast reader, so I didn't mind. I have since reread it once, and plan to read it again this summer.     Set in mid-1800's England, the plot concerns a young drawing master by the name of Walter Hartright. He is on his way to Cumberland to tutor two half-sisters, Laura Fairlie and Marian Halcombe, who live at Limmeridge House, the family estate, with their hypochondriac uncle. On the way there, Walter meets a strange woman named Anne Catherick on the high-road, dressed completely in white, who acts visibly distressed and asks for his help to find the way to London. She tells him of a secret she has, and makes him promise not to let her pursuers find her. She will not tell him her secret, and leaves for town, with his help. He later discovers she has just escaped from a mental asylum.    Without giving the whole plot away, the entire book is completely wonderful, and had me hooked from the very first page. It has just enough mystery to keep the reader constantly interested and wanting to know what's next, but does not run at such a breakneck speed that you don't have time to catch your breath. There is deceit, secrets, kidnappings, secret societies, romance, adventure, humor, and yet glimpses of everyday scenes from home life in 19th century England. Anyone who loves history would adore this book, simply for the insight it gives for what it was like to live in that period.    There is something about the way Wilkie Collins writes that I find extraordinarily easy to comprehend. He has a gift for making the most complicated plots seem simple, and that, along with his unique gift for crafting a genuinely good story, places this book in an important place on my shelf. He was a master at recreating the \\"secret theatre of the home\\" as he called it, staging unsettling stories of crime and the like in a familiar setting. He was a keen observer of people, and was skilled at putting that knowledge down masterfully on paper. The moody atmosphere he creates with his vivid descriptions is nothing short of magical. Unlike Dickens, who makes such grand allusions to things that you forget what he was talking about, Collins tells it how it is, but does so in such a way that you feel like you're living it and seeing it yourself with your own eyes. Although the action takes place over more than a year, the largest chunk takes place during the summer, and for that reason, every time I read it, my mind conjures up images of drowsy summer days, and eerie sunsets over dark, mysterious lakes.    Essentially the precursor to the modern detective story, this book thrills, suprises, and excites in a way that no other book I've read has. Set up in the epistolary style, the book is carried by several narratives, and brings multiple perspectives onto the scene, which allows you to be in posession of almost all of facts right up-front. There is \\"fair play\\", so to speak, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of red-herrings to mislead you. It's fascinating to try and mentally unravel the ingeniously wound plot as it unfolds along the way. It's like putting together the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle, where every hint means something, but you'll never know the answer until the very end.    Victorian novels have a reputation for being rather formal, melodramatic, and unrealistic, but \\"The Woman in White\\", as well as Collins' other stories, are far from being quaint. On my first reading, I was surprised at how modern the language felt, and how very easy it was to relate to the characters and going-on that take place in the time-span that the book covers.    The characters themselves are just as interesting as the story. Walter Hartright and Laura Fairlie may be the usual, wide-eyed young lovers, but the others are downright unique. The heroine, Marian Halcombe, is atypical a Victorian female as you'd expect to find anywhere. She is clever, resourceful, and strong-willed, though older, and less-than-attractive than her younger half-sister. I find she is actually a stronger personality than any of the male characters. Anne Catherick as the Woman in White is mad, frenzied, and somewhat odd, though her situation is pitiable, and she draws a good deal of the empathy from the reader. Sir Pecival Glyde is a suitably despisable antagonist, with a slimy, love-to-hate aura about him. He starts acting the well-born gentleman, but as the novel progresses, you eventually see as him as he truly is: a ruthless, cowardly villian, who will stop at nothing to arrive at his own selfish ends.    But let's not forget the real star of the show, Count Fosco. The obese, sensual, animal-obsessed Italian nobleman steals every seen his is in, and the humor his character radiates often makes me burst into uncontrolable giggles, helping to alleviate the gravity of the other parts of the book. But, in typical Collins fashion, here, in the person of the Count, is another anomaly; despite his geniality, charismatic magnetism, and ridiculous weight, he is even more of a devil than Glyde, and makes the cruel baronet seem innocent compared with his own devious designs. He seems a man without fault, but has a weakness, in the form of an attraction to Marian Halcombe.    It has been a long time since I've gotten this excited about a novel, and even after reading some of Collins' other books, this one is still my favorite. Don't be daunted by the size of the book--you will be duly rewarded when you reach the end. Read it, and I'm sure you'll be riveted as I was.    It's sad that more people don't read Wilkie Collins' works. It is partly due to the fact that bookstores and libraries don't carry a huge selection, if they carry any at all.    In closing, read this book. You won't be disappointed.
B00371QQ0M|4.0|... the overall image quality isnt really good! Movies like STARMAN which is also avaiable on BLU RAY demonstrate whats possible in forms of image quality.   Besides this, the extras like the \\"making of\\", the \\"custome design\\" ec. make up for a lot.   That said, the DUNE BLU RAY Version is a must have for every FRANK HERBERT'S DUNE (the books ;) fan and everyone who loves a great SIENCE FICTION movie with a great cast (Sean Young, Kyle McLachlan, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow, Jürgen Prochnow) and a very good sound design / score.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|Great summer Dance/Pop album...nothing serious or innovative...but still catchy as hell! All tracks keep a positive mood and they are sure to motivate you to want to go out and dance.  If I could use one word to describe this album it would be \\"Euphoric\\", which is a pleasant departure from the dark electro pop being purged by Xtina A. and Lady Gaga. It's nice to have something uplifting to listen to in this rough economy. Best Kylie album since Fever era!
B003AO1SVS|2.0|Overproduced.    It gets a star for Ten Cent Pistol and She's Long gone.    Danger Mouse was the wort thing to happen to them.    I hope the Keys dust off that old 8-track mixer in Pat's basement and get back to their roots for their next album.
B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|Reacher can work miracles. How does he do it? Simple, he is a character in a book, and the author says he does it.<br /><br />He is good at math, so his pals can send him messages using math concepts. For example, a captive wants to tell him how many people make up the bad guys. So the captive simply finds a prime number to get Reacher's attention, and not just any prime number, but one that the digits add up to the number of bad guys! Then the captive puts that information into a message and Reacher instantly decodes it!<br /><br />This would be difficult to do as a captive, but it's easy to do as an author.<br /><br />Reacher is closing in on the bad guys in a location that is almost flat except for one big object -- a helicopter. Since it's dark, the bad guys flood the area with light, so they can see everything in the area except the helicopter. Guess where Reacher hides? The helicopter -- the bad guys don't think to look there.<br /><br />So, this stuff is easy to write. Five guys are fighting Reacher, so how does Reacher beat them? Easy -- bam, he gets the first guy, pow he gets the second, bonk, he hits the third guy, oof, there goes the fourth guy, crunch, the fifth guy. I bet he could get a hundred guys that way, if the author didn't get too tired.<br /><br />So, it's a lazy way to make a living -- but it works.<br /><br />This is my 11th Reacher novel, and I'm about to start the 12th. Why? I'm getting less sure as I read each new one.

006145205X|5.0|This book explains how and why things keep getting better for humans.  The premise of the book is that man has been using trade and interdependency to improve our living conditions.<br /><br />The author shows that we sets us apart from the Neanderthals and other humanoids is that we traded with each other.  This set off an explosion in technology by having having job specification.<br /><br />Eventually he goes on to show that where and whenever trade is allowed to flourish that human prosperity, art and technology follow behind it.  And whenever trade is stymied by rulers, thieves, and corruption (aka bad government) those nations languish.<br /><br />During the latter part of the book he goes on to give a detailed history of pessimists throughout history and in present time.  He shows how pessimists from have been wrong when predicting doom for the planet.  Many examples from long ago to a few years ago are provided.<br /><br />The book might come off as being pro-right due to its warnings that global warming might be another one of these cases where all the doom-sayers are wrong.  In the end the book turned out to be an excellent history book and I worry less about the environment and our country because history shows that everything is going to keep getting better.
030745455X|4.0|After reading 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' I had very high expectations of 'The Girl Who Played With Fire'.  Unfortunately these expectations were not met entirely.  But thankfully the sequel is still an excellent read.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessor, 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' is really an action thriller.  Loads of violence with only a moderate amount of plot to hold it together.  Yes, it works.  And I would imagine it would make a much better film than '...Dragon Tattoo'.  But '...Dragon Tattoo' had a much richer story, complete with very interesting secondary characters.  It would appeal more to adults whereas its sequel would be a smash hit with younger readers (late teens).<br /><br />Oh, without a doubt one must read these two books in sequence.  I think 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' would be a very shallow and perhaps confusing read without all the background information presented in the first book.<br /><br />Bottom Line: a very enjoyable sequel that didn't quite have the same magic as the original.  I eagerly await reading the last in the series.
0385341008|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is one of my new favorite books--it is written in letter-style (like 34 Charing Cross Road); the characters are well-developed and believeable, and the historical aspect of the book is fascinating (I did not know there WERE islands in the English Channel!). Guernsey is easy-to-read, but not mind-candy.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I finally got around to watching this show, and loved it!  The idea of a serial killer who only kills other killers is rather intriguing, and this show presents it in such a fun way.  The characters are all great and the dialog is brilliantly witty.  The first season had a slight flaw of being rather predictable, but that really doesn't detract from my over all rating.  This show is also strangely  addictive!  The only way to really watch it is by DVD or somehow streaming it from the internet (I watched it on Netflix, but I enjoyed it enough to buy on DVD once I get some extra cash!) so you can watch the episodes back-to-back, as most every one ends as a cliff hanger.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|For many years I have wanted a greatest hits album for AC/DC.  This soundtrack is the best that I have found in that regard.  While it may not have all of the best songs of the group (such a collection would not fit on a single CD), it is a great mix of both old and new from the group.  I recently put the cd in while I worked on a landscaping project in my yard and was able to let it cycle for hours without getting tired of the songs.  That is unusual for me, and I would recommend this album for anybody!
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I checked this out to see what all the hype was about.  Horror movies and even vampire stories have always been my favorites.  Campy TV shows like Buffy are right up my ally.  This show, however, reached a level of absurdity that I cannot tolerate.  I begrudgingly made it half way through the third episode before I had to turn it off.  My initial reaction to the first episode stuck through out.  I didn't really care for any of the characters, the dialog was awful and the whole \\"forbidden romance between a girl and a vampire\\" idea has been played out, beaten up and burned down to the ground already.  To be open minded, I did try to stick this out.  I made it to the third episode hoping that the negative vibe I got would grow a bit.  That didn't happen for me, however.<br /><br />Over all, this show feels like it's made for teenagers with a vampire fetish.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Well, It's not the Wolverine I grew up with, I don't think. Hollywood really Hollyized the X-men. It fits in well with the Hollywood version or the X-men. It makes a good movie but it's not the Wolverine I grew up with. Still, I watch it over and over. I hope they keep Avengers close than they did the X-men. Spiderman was real good and the changes to Fantastic Four were brilliant. Nothing was as close to the books as Daredevil and Electra, I thought Electra used the comic for storyboards. Why didn't the ecknowledge Frank Miller? Sad.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|When this album came out it was a remarkable collection of Singer/Songwriter guitarists.  This Album contributed to the resurgence of Roy Orbison and new work from him.  It also gave Dylan a place to showcase his poetry.  All in all some selections are a little cheesy but the historic value more than makes up for it.  This is a must have for any Adult Contemporary collection.  Also real Songwriters can use it as a great example of collaboration between 5 giants in the industry.
1439153663|1.0|Having read the 5 star reviews here on amazon, I decided to give this book a try. I rarely hate books but I really hated this one. It was almost painful to read because it is nothing but bad situation after bad situation. There is nothing positive about this book at all. I understand the hard times presented in this book and I'm fine with books that are hard subject material but you don't even get 1 thing to hold on to. There are no characters to like, and the ones that are likeable you don't hear from them very often. And this book had hardly any dialogue between characters. I just got told everything that was going on. No dialogue makes a book boring and painful. I got to about 50% way through and I found myself just hating this book and hating the characters and having no motivation to finishing it. The end of the book isn't any better. Skip this one. I won't be reading another book by this author.
B001W6S0C6|4.0|They did an amazing job coverting it to blu ray escpeically since it's 21 yrs old.  You can immediately tell the difference between the blu ray and dvd versions.  If you have the dvd already give it to a friend and definitely buy the blu ray version. It only gets 4 stars because the 20th edition book that comes with it is not really worth spending the extra cash.  Skip the 20th edition version and buy the regular blu ray.  It's exactly the same with all the special features.
0312323867|3.0|The seller did not tell me the book had water damage on the front cover and first 30 pages. I picked standard shipping from a place in my state and it took two weeks to get it. Long time in my opinion. I kept the book, but would like to know when there is damage before I buy the book.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|A film like this can make it in and out of theaters so quickly that I, for one, wasn't aware that it existed. Even after I rented the DVD I put off watching it almost past the 'return' date. Thus, it was a shock to find myself totally engrossed in this riveting film.    Does this film have a `political' message. No. If by political one means the whole left-right `thing.' But it does have a message; or, more correctly--`messages.'    1) War should be, truly, a `last' resort.  2) Don't consider war without triple checking sources and making certain that sources are independent of each other.   3) Don't depend on people who have reasons of political or financial gain as a primary, and certainly not an `only' source.  4) Torture is not the way to obtain reliable information; also, it's barbaric; also, it (in the case of Iraq) damaged America's international reputation.  5) Make certain that `you' have the resources in place to maintain peace after the battle has `ended.'    Not a `complete' list; but these points are all intelligently made in this excellent movie.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|I've always been curious about the events at Munich in 1972 and the ensuing Israeli response.  \\"Munich\\" provided me with a worthy account of both.  In addition, it offered a perspective of those individuals who were thrust together to operate as a retaliatory cell, some members of which questioned their own methods and actions.<br /><br />While the ending was cinematically fitting and suitable, it left you hanging as to the outcome of its main character.  Normally that would be fine, but in this case we're talking about a real person.  At the end of \\"Serpico,\\" for example, we get told that he moved to France, but we get nothing like that here.  Some closure would have been beneficial.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|Kylie Minogue returns to her dance music roots with this fun, melodic album of catchy tunes and pulsating beats. The highlights are the midtempo \\"All The Lovers,\\" the title track \\"Aphrodite,\\" and the lovely piano-laden \\"Get Outta My Way.\\" Also worth noting is the club-thumping \\"Too Much.\\"<br /><br />This is a celebrated return to form for Kylie, as this album is reminiscent to 2000's \\"Light Years\\" and 2002's \\"Fever.\\" The songs are more of the classic dance-pop varitey than they are an attempt to use auto-tune, futuristic glam-pop beats, and bombastic power-pop. And Kylie is all the better for it. As some other dancefloor divas have got it right recently (like Donna Summer's \\"Crayons\\"), Kylie sticks with what works and comes up with a set of songs that might just be her catchiest overall work yet. While there may not be a song with as catchy a hook as the famous \\"La La La, La La La\\" from \\"Can't Get YOu Outta My Head,\\" there is plenty to love here from an artist who has overcome great obstacles in life and is now at the pinnacle of her crowning musical achievement.<br /><br />\\"Aphrodite\\" just might be her best collective work yet. It plays like a great dance-pop album, stright through, and is not just a collection of two or three singles.
1423113381|4.0|I just finished this book and I LOVED it.  My only complaint is that following all of the \\"reincarnations\\" of the Gods when they kept changing hosts got really confusing.  That being said the story was fantastic and all of the Egyptian mythology was really interesting.  Interesting to the point that I've ordered another book on Egyptian mythology.  The story being told from both the main characters points of view was great too.  (Sometimes when authors switch POV it gets really sloppy but not the case here at all!)  The way Riordan combines mythology with current times makes it all the more current and fun to read.  He really has a talent for it.  I hope that in the future books we find out more about Bast  I have to say, she was my favorite character!  I can't wait for the next book in the story.

0446563048|5.0|Delivery Happiness started as an informal autobiography, with stories of Tony Hsieh's multiple failed business attempts as a child as a result of big dreams, great concepts, and lack of experience and research. Hsieh's desire to make big money by owning a business was not deterred by his failed attempts, and eventually one of his business ideas (custom buttons) actually succeeded and generated good income for the teenager. From there Hsieh continued to have different businesses. He became a milti-millioanaire after selling LinkExchange (which he co-founded), got involved with Zappos as an adviser and investor, and then eventually became CEO. Within 10 years, Zappos grew from almost no sales to $1 billion in gross merchandise sales, and was eventually acquired by Amazon in 2009 in a deal valued at over $1.2 billion on the day of closing.  Just like many other great success stories, Hsieh's success almost seems too glamorous and too easy -- that is, if you don't read the book Delivering Happiness, in which Hsieh candidly shared his roller coaster ride with the readers. There were ups and downs over the course of 10 years, and it took a lot of courage, passion and wisdom to create an empire.   Half way through the book, just when I was about to start wondering, \\"ok, so this book is about the background of Hsieh's success story. And what does it have anything to with 'Delivering Happiness'?\\" the direction of the book suddenly changed.  The book was divided into three sections...  Section I - Profits  Section II - Profits and Passion  Section III - Profits, Passion, and Purpose  These three sections symbolically represent different periods of Hsieh's life. Before his business succeeded, all Hsieh wanted was profits -- \\"I just wanted a job that paid well and didn't seem like too much work.\\"(p.29) Then, after his success with LinkExchange, the young millionaire realized that money alone couldn't bring him happiness -- \\"I didn't know exactly what I was going to do, but I knew what I wasn't going to do....I had decided to stop chasing the money, and start chasing the passion.\\"(p.54)   A turning point of Zappos was when Hsieh and Mossler(Fred) decided to make the Zappos brand about the best customer service --  \\"...in the long run, little things that keep the customer in mind will end up paying huge dividends.\\"(p.128)This is where \\"Delivering Happiness\\" came in --\\"As we rolled out these additional services, we slowly realized that we were becoming part of a bigger movement. It was no longer just about Zappos. We were helping change the world.\\"(p.208) Hsieh talked about how Zappos delivers happiness through their unique culture/core values. Not only does Zappos try to make customers happy, it also ensures the employees and vendors are happy.  I had started reading \\"Delivering Happiness\\" hoping to learn to make profits, and it was nothing like what I expected -- It was much, much more.
B003IPC5SO|3.0|The first time I listened to APHRODITE I loved it, as I was happy to simply hum along to the lively, retro styled synths, but the disappointment started when I really listened to the lyrics and from that point on I found it good, but not like 'oh wow'.<br /><br />My main issue it that there's just not a lot of variety in the style of the lyrics shown here - the tone and content of the songs are all one of three themes from beginning to end. They really needed to mix the lyricial content and style up more since the pace of the 80s dancehall music is the same thoughout the album. Everything flows together too well; making a lot of individual tracks forgettable in the jumble of loud noise the album becomes.<br /><br />A track by track breakdown isn't needed for this review: The whole album is a musically monotone Kylie love letter. Basically Kylie's hot, her life is great and her boyfriend is the best ever. The end. I can't believe that it took the talents of Stuart Price, Calvin Harris, Jake Shears, Nerina Pallot, Lucas Secon, Tim Rice-Oxley and Kish Mauve to write this. Kylie herself has only co-wrote three of the tracks this time; Illusion, Too Much and Looking For An Angel [But that's not a bad thing, since I think two of her self-penned tracks are the weakest links on the album].<br /><br />The other thing that bothered me; Kylie's vocals. She's famous for her sweet, innocent, almost childlike vocals, but at times this effect seems too forced and nasal. It doesn't bother me on her past albums, but it has now become very obvious.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; When APHRODITE is at it's best we get what I think is some of the strongest material Kylie's released during her time with Parlophone Records [Closer and Too Much], and some above-the-Kylie-average tracks that can stand up against her Light Years material [All The Lovers, Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love), Aphrodite and Cupid Boy].<br /><br />This is why the fillers [Get Outta My Way, Everything Is Beautiful, Illusion, Better Than Today, Looking For An Angel and Can't Beat That Feeling] are a huge let-down for me as there is a clear contrast between the quality of the material, that once I'd noticed doesn't go away again; It ruins my overall enjoyment of the stronger half of the album.<br /><br />I do partly blame Stuart Price; He's the one who cut any songs which showed more variety, opting to keep APHRODITE as a 'classic disco Kylie' to simply please original fans, rather than to show any personal growth and change - so uninspiring. He also picked the tracklist's running order for 'better flow', but all this has done is jam the stronger tracks too close to the weaker one's, dimishing the impact they make.<br /><br />Overall: Half potential singles, half empty noise.<br /><br />It seems as though they just became bored halfway through the making of the album, so just padded it out with any old tracks that were laying around, confident that her fanbase will buy it and love it regardless. This is sadly becoming common with Kylie albums.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />Bonus DVD<br />[Special edition album only]<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />Making of 'All The Lovers' music video (12 minutes)<br />Behind the scenes of the Aphrodite photoshoot (2 minutes)<br />Aphrodite photo gallery<br />White Diamond Theme [Live in New York]<br />White Diamond [Live in New York]<br />Confide In Me [Live in New York]<br />I Believe In Me [Live in New York]<br /><br />The Special edition comes packaged as a 28 book, with plenty of pictures of Kylie looking stunning, but with no song lyrics or extra album information it's pretty but also rather pointless.

B003JHKORK|1.0|Way too much of a break from the story line of the book, all of the complexity drops out and we are left with tired cliches.  Plus, the books are accessible to my third grader, but the movie, in an attempt to appeal to the teen crowd is something I won't let my kids see for years.  Honestly, Hollywood should throw this attempt on the scrap heap and try again, or better yet, let a British film-making crew have a go at it, because that's the only way the project gets handled with the finesse and tact appropriate to 3000 years of civilization.  This is just awful stuff.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|I 100% agree, this movie was garbage and I am glad that I did not buy it.  This movie was nothing like star trek.  The writers came up with their own version of star trek that is as much like star trek as cat is to a  a dog.  The plot and storyline of this movie was laughable at best.  They should have named it something else but not star trek.  Here's one little example:  kirk is put in charge of the ship's bridge and in a few short minutes goes from being a recruit to being the captain of a ship.  That is absurd as captains get to be in their position after many years of military experience at a minimum of ten to twelve years on the low side.  That is just a small example.
B0030Y11XS|2.0|I have been a big Michael Moore fan in the past and have seen most of his movies as well as most, if not all, of TV Nation and The Awful Truth. In most all of these efforts it was really refreshing to see Moore as a fearless scrapper trying desperately to speak truth to power; of particular merit was Roger & Me, where Moore presented in blistering clarity the disparity between GM's upper management and its work force. Other notable efforts include Fahrenheit 911 and Sicko (you can kinda take or leave Bowling for Columbine and The Big One.) It's important that we have people willing to do this and I generally applaud his efforts, even in the areas that I do not necessarily agree.     However, the whole point is that it must be TRUTH that is spoken and that is where this effort goes off the rails. I saw Capitalism: A Love Story last night and was really taken aback by how far Mr. Moore went beyond advocacy documentary into outright distortion.     A couple of notes on this:     (i) A huge segment of the film is spent on TARP and what is called repeatedly the \\"Bank Bailout\\". However, in none of this coverage was it disclosed or mentioned: (a) TARP to financial institutions was a loan, not a gift, which required payment with substantial interest; (b) most major FIs did not want the TARP funds and many took it over objection; (c) TARP recipients were required to post collateral (convertible warrants) against the TARP funds; (d) all major TARP financial institutions (other than AIG and Regions) have, in fact, paid back the TARP funds; and (e) the government made a profit on TARP to FIs.     (ii) Who has the government not recouped TARP funds from? You guessed it - the auto industry (Chrysler, GM, and GMAC). It kind of ruins Mr. Moore's thesis that the pension obligations of all those salt-of-the-earth folks back in Flint were a major contributor to TARP non-repayment.     (iii) Throughout the film, foreclosures are blamed exclusively on banks and FIs; Mr. Moore makes a show of making \\"citizen's arrests\\" and covering banks in crime scene tape. However, the reality is really a lot more complicated than that banks tricked or otherwise defrauded people out of their homes. There is a little segment regarding how some banks induced homeowners into leveraging equity in their homes, but beyond that not a whole lot of analysis. In reality, home prices actually did rise throughout the 2000's, due in no small part to historically low interest rates. Homeowners acted perfectly rationally in leveraging the excess equity in their homes, as long as home prices continued to rise or even to stabilize at the higher levels. It was the collapse of the real estate bubble that hammered so many homeowners, not fraudulent loans. One could make the argument that banks should have advised more caution than they did, but again that's not what Mr. Moore is arguing. To say that banks defrauded homeowners on a large scale is just incorrect.     (iv) The section on Dead Peasant insurance seemed pretty dishonest to me. The whole idea about companies taking out life insurance on its employees is that a company is materially affected when key employees die and needs to have some kind of risk mitigant against this. An analogy would be if in days past, a business has a key piece of equipment or capital (say a factory); if the company loses that factory unexpectedly, it will need immediate money to get back on track after the loss. Today, human capital (especially at higher levels) is really the key investments of modern corporations. If a company loses a key employee, it will (a) lose all of the resources that it invested in developing the employee; (b) lose all of the specific knowledge, plans, strategies, etc. that person had; and (c) have to find and develop someone new quickly. It is not fraudulent at all to want to plan ahead for this kind of expense and buying insurance on an employee really does not implicate a fraud at all (there is no trickery or detrimentalreliance). However, Mr. Moore depicts this practice (quite strongly) as fraud on the employee's family and as attempts by companies to profit off the deaths of their employees.     (v) There is a strong implication that the crash of an airline flight causing 50 deaths (I think it was Comair Flight 191, but am not sure) was a result of financial hardships put on its pilots. This naked assertion is back up only by the fact that the pilot and co-pilot had discussed financial matters earlier in the flight and that the co-pilot had a second job in a restaurant. This was a pretty weak thread to hang the whole argument that pilots are paid too little on.  Even if one agrees with that pilots should be paid more (and I find some merit to the argument), this seems like a pretty weaselly way to frame the question.    (vi) The Black-Shoals Formula is shown on the screen with Mr. Moore explaining that the formula was specifically designed to be too complicated for everyday investors to understand. Absolutely factually inaccurate. BSF was created to model (imperfectly) the pricing of fairly simple concepts (rights to buy and sell as specific prices in the future called put and call options). It was created by academics to approximate the best way to price existing instruments, not to confuse or mislead anyone.     Also, not really an inaccuracy, but.... While complex derivatives are pretty hard to explain, calls and puts are not. Mr. Moore presents these basic ideas like they are so complex not even experts can explain them.     Conclusion   So, at the end of the day, would I recommend this movie? Probably not. If you are already pretty knowledgeable about TARP and the financial crisis, the lapses in fact and analysis will probably be too striking for you to enjoy the film. If not, you will need to go in understanding that you should beware that you will be mislead in some areas and that you should probably consult a counter-point to balance out some of the misperceptions presented.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|After my not so stellar review of (X-it did grow a little more on me later down the road) and lackluster support (I did buy it though) of the (Body Language) project I thought I needed to redeem myself and apologize for not giving Kyle's her props...She's back with a vengence..Mighty Aprodite as someone else coined it....all the current, hip dance music producers with slick production...always stellar pitch perfect vocals....clever fun lyrics...beautiful cover/cd jewel artwork...it's a total package all the way around...gone, thankfully is the R-N-B American influenced Body Language tracks and back to the Kylie we love to love. I truly believe this sound to be the perfect marriage if you will of her voice and pop dance music...it's almost like Donna Summer...you may not like the disco sound and it is definatley a thing of the past but when Donna does it you just don't mind or even think of it as disco...well the same can be said for Kylie and dance pop music...you may not love it but when she does it, it all somehow just sounds right and brings a smile to your face...here's my thoughts on some of the tracks:    1.  All The Lovers---reminiscent of \\"I Believe in You\\"...I don't believe it should have been the lead track...good solid song but it seems as though the popularity is going towards the next single release with good reason, which coincedentally is the next cut on the CD.     2.  Get Out Of My Way---as the song suggests, get out of my way and the reason is it sounds as though they channeled the \\"Fever\\" CD for one of the stongest songs since that release, although \\"The One\\" from the (X)cd is equally as good. After this song you'll be ready to do what track 3 says:    3.  Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)....very On A Night Like This from the \\"Light Years\\" CD.     4.  Closer....in my opinion and we all know everyone has one of those....is just an ok track...sounds like a GaGa reject, overall it is still not a bad track and who knows may grow on one down the road.     5.  Everything is Beautiful...closest thing to a ballad you'll find on this CD and ok overall, a bit on the boring phoned it in way.     6.  Aphrodite...great chorus    7.  Illusion     8.  Better Than Today      9.  Too Much...channeling the \\"Fever\\" formula again to great delight.     10. Cupid Boy...sounds like a bit bouncier Speakerphone from the (X) cd.      11. Looking For An Angel...a bit like The One from (X), very Freemasons sounding, strong track.     12. Can't Fight the Feeling...yet another (Fever) sounding track....are you getting a theme here..all the tracks have the funner bouncy side of the (Light Years, Fever, and X) releases.     Bonus track from I-Tunes Aphrodite Deluxe is: \\"Mighty Rivers\\", and Amazon Deluxe (exclusive)bonus cut is: \\"Go Hard or Go Home\\". Both tracks are very good and easily fit the mold for Aprodite..for those who don't follow Kylie as avidly as some of us I will tell you that there is always things not released on the \\"regular\\" cd that end up on the deluxe versions as well as b-sides on the cd single releases...that's why I love her new releases, there's always more suprizes around the corner...Kylie's marketing rocks..it's always more fun to spend you hard earned $$$$ on Kylie stuff.     Reviewers note: with I-tunes you cannot get the bonus cut without buying the whole digital cd and with Amazon if you only want to buy the bonus track you can do that, as well Amazon's digital download price is much better both for the whole CD as well as individual downloads...Love you AMAZON..you're the best.

B003IPC5UC|5.0|Kylie is back full force with Aphrodite! Aphrodite is a solid dance pop album from beginning to end. This may be her most cohesive album yet. Every track is beautiful, euphoric and fun. Stuart Price's production shows, but modestly. You can hear his dance style on the tracks, but it is subtle enough that the album still sounds like traditional pop as well, and not just dance music. Every track is great and deserves its place on the album. Dare I say this album is perfect! Her last album X had many highlights, but was not the true comeback Kylie deserved. This album is a true return to form--but without being more of the same. Another plus is that there are less vocal effects than X, which I do like, but this album sounds a bit more natural and organic because of Miss K's clear, beautiful vocals. Highly recommend! A+

B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I believe at this point I have read enough fantasy books that I realize I like them a little more on the \\"dark\\" side.  How I would define \\"dark\\" is that there really is no clear hero to root for as just about anyone in the book has their own valid perspective of right and wrong.  In addition, just because you have taken a liking to a character, it doesn't mean that character is going to survive the story.  So..having said that, I like this book!<br /><br />Here's the part I get afraid of as I never want to tell too much of the story and ruin it so I'll do the best I can to be vague -<br /><br />The book is a political war story set in a fantasy setting.  It reminded me a little bit of George R.R. Martin's work - A Song of Ice and Fire but a lot more \\"fairy dust\\" going down.  Normally, I don't like too much magic as I think it's used to conveniently overcome impossible scenarios too often and offsets the balance of a story.  However, this book is knee deep in magic and not the traditional way magic is put forward.  The author has created a real unique \\"system\\" for lack of a better word.  Two wizards (and there are way more than two folks in this book slinging magic) do not necessarily have the same base of powers as they are linked with new magics or maybe those of ancient powers.  I found it all really interesting and the author does not leave you lacking for understanding of how it all works and thus makes it more believeable.<br /><br />This book requires you to immerse yourself into the story.  There is a lot going on in this book  - a lot of history that gradually unfolds in the book and a lot of different players involved.  I have to admit, it took me a while to be able to keep track of whom was whom.  However, once I was there, the book was also in full motion and taking me for a ride.  It was as if the author knew that was the proper time to put the heels to the book.<br /><br />The author did not slack off in character development either.  As I said, there are a lot of different players in this story but yet all of them are interesting and unique.  Sure, he only lets you know a little bit at a time but the way things are presented makes it a puzzle you are working out in your brain until facts are fully revealed that you never knew you would need but are excited were revealed.  Consider it icing on the cake!<br /><br />In all, the characters each have their own mini-story and it all ties together in the end for an ending that actually gives you some mental closure as you await the next one.<br /><br />I am looking forward to book two and have already purchased it and am ready for more!
B00000F169|3.0|The catch point is that the comedy is slow to develop, though after it builds up the movie becomes quite amusing.  A few scenes will get you to burst out laughing, but for most of the movie you will be waiting for the punchline.  I'd recommend seeing it at least once though.  Definitely low budget, but that does not detract from it at all.
0307266303|5.0|I first read the article in Men's Health about the Tarahumara Indians and this awesome footrace through the Copper Canyons.  It really stuck in my head, and that was a few years ago!      Well, I come across this book, and it is very well written!  It is like reading that Men's Health article in book form!  I started up running again, and love it!  I used to only be able to run 2-3 miles at a time.  Now, I'm easily doing double that..and hope to stretch it out to my first marathon.    Read this book!  It will open up your mind to the awesome feeling running can give you.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King's On Writing is an honest, gritty book that gets to the point and doesn't over-dramatize or sentimentalize the act of writing.  Other books on writing do that - they try to coddle and encourage the writer by appealing to the emotions or perhaps to the writer's sensitivity.  King does not do any of that.  He gets straight to the point and provides advice the way a master plumber may provide advice to an apprentice: do this; don't to that.  It's all straight-forward no nonsense advice.  For example, King's most important gem: to be a good writer you must read a lot and write a lot.  Nothing about finding your muse or your voice or anything fluffy.  Another bit of advice: increase your vocabulary and know your grammar.  These sound very rudimentary, almost mechanical, but it's what worked for King.  The writing advice is sandwiched between his story of how he came to be a writer in the first place and the tragic accident where he was hit by a car while taking a walk near his home (he was in the midst of writing this book when the accident ocurred).  These memoirs are interesting on their own and illustrate King's writing lessons.  If you want to be a better writer, read this book.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I saw this decades ago - then read the book.  Hepburn's \\"Sister Luke\\" is convincing - a powerful performance.  Very emotional treatment - takes you inside a hidden world.  Beautiful.
1577314808|4.0|If you are after the spiritual enlightenment, this is a good book, written very clearly.  It focuses on the time related conditioning in human mind and its costly results.  If you like to go into deep meditative states in this subject including almost all aspects of spiritual enlightenment,then I would highly recommend  The Universal Mysteries by Ahmed Hulusi.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|Completely devoid of any value.. unless I wanted to feel the need to vomit.. not a feeling I am prone to feel.  I admit reviews generally should be written by people who liked whatever it is they are reviewing but I felt the right and need to bring myself some closure after enduring ben stiller and owen wilson spasm their way across the screen in a movie that left me feeling that somebody owed me that portion of my life back.. not just my money the actual time I spent viewing the movie which is imposable as that is to ever repeat EVER get back or be properly be compensated for.  I admit I did not finish the viewing of this film maybe it got better in the second half however I would sooner watch 'Shock Treatment' again than ever finish this film.

B000N6TYLW|4.0|I am, of course, a Gilmore Girls fan and so this product was extremely straightforward. I bought it to conclude my collection of seasons as well as conclude my viewing of this series. It is a great season and leaves you sad to see them go but happy with where they end up.  If you like the Gilmore girls and you have shared the past 6 seasons with them then I encourage you to buy this product.
1416550550|3.0|Or maybe I should say, it became too predictable towards the end? I never could get into the \\"House at Riverton\\" but this one had me hooked right away. Then...nothing. Nothing on Nell's life between ages 4-21, just little snippets. And I found it somewhat odd that finding out she was a \\"foundling\\" would make her change all her plans. I can empathize with the shock, but at the same time, I personally would have been grateful and happy that such a wonderful, warm and loving family took me in and gave me a home! I can't understand Nell's thinking in turning from the sisters she has always loved and the man she plans to marry. That seems ungrateful somehow. I can understand her being curious, but I don't understand the big secret or the shame she somehow feels. I suppose if she'd accepted it gracefully, it wouldn't have been a story. Then we have the story of her daughter and their relationship, which is only barely touched upon, and then her granddaughter. I have to admit that the only compelling story to me was of \\"The Authoress\\" as a child and Rose, at least for awhile. But then that fell apart as well and *spoiler alert*!!! the way the Authoress dies is just..wrong somehow. It didn't fit the story. Let's just kill everyone off before they can learn anything about themselves. I plodded through until the end, and I will probably read her next, in hopes of improvement, but I admit I skipped a lot of Cass's time in England and the new boyfriend. If she'd just stuck to one time period and one woman's FULL story instead of bits and pieces of everyones, I think it would have been better overall.

0307474712|2.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of People Magazine.  I thought it was terrible...it took the entire first half to even get me interested.  It wasn't funny, the story never really developed well.  Save your money.
B00003CXA6|5.0|While GETTYSBURG has a few drawbacks--mainly the sprawling amount of time taken to depict the fierce Civil War battle with two viewpoints and philosophies--it compensates with its historical accuracies in depicting the battleground while at the same time compressing the three-day battle into the framework of a lengthy film.<br /><br />Its major asset is the sincerity of all of the major performances--and that includes TOM BERENGER looking magnificently scruffy behind his impressive beard, MARTIN SHEEN as Robert E. Lee, STEPHEN LANG as George Pickett, JEFF DANIELS and C. THOMAS HOWELL as Union brothers, RICHARD JORDAN as Lewis Armistead and SAM ELLIOTT as John Buford.<br /><br />Another fine asset is the stirring musical background with patriotic war themes and drum beating exercises adding flourish to the drama. The sets, costumes and color photography are all first rate, but some will be impatient with the talk between battles which is sometimes a little too extensive. All of the battle scenes look like a re-enactment, a soft core version of the more graphic horrors of war that are rampant in many more recent war films.<br /><br />Still, it's an impressive film from start to finish and the performances are all admirable.<br /><br />The most haunting exchange of dialog occurs at the end of the battle with Pickett being told by Robert E. Lee to keep an eye on his division.<br /><br />\\"Sir,\\" says a tearful Pickett, \\"there is no division.\\"

B00005Q5WC|5.0|The brilliance of the album and bonus material goes without saying. The mastering is impeccable. Yet like others here, I had difficulty getting a correct CD set. My first order had the Exodus packaging, but the actual CDs inside were for Legend. The replacement set was closer: the second CD was Exodus, but the first CD was missing entirely.    In this case, third time was the charm. I obviously don't hold Amazon responsible for the contents of a shrink-wrapped package--and they were great about the returns--but Island Def Jam needs to pay serious attention to their quality control.

B001P3SA8U|5.0|If Jeffrey Wright has ever given a bad performance on film, I have never seen it. He is a master at becoming the character he plays. In the 1950's biopic, Cadillac Records, Wright gives us a Muddy Waters portrayal that is worthy of Academy Award consideration. But his performance is definitely not the only award worthy performance on display here. Relative newcomer, Columbus Short, 26, turned in a stellar performance as blues harmonica man, Little Walter. Earlier he won acclaim for his role in Stomp the Yard. But the biggest surprise for me was the portrayal of Etta James by Beyonce Knowles. The former \\"Beyonce\\" is truly deserving of every accolade she is sure to receive for a heart-wrenching performance of a strong, yet self-destructive blues singer. Her acting is superb, and her singing will bring tears to your eyes.<br /><br />Mos Def is a believable Chuck Berry and, with more to do in this film, could have easily handled it. Eamonn Walker, whom you'll recognize from The Wire, is a haunting Howlin' Wolf. Gabrielle Union is given a meaty role as Muddy Waters's woman, and she shows us a depth of feeling that most actresses worth their salt would die to sink their teeth into. Cedric The Entertainer, playing songwriter Willie Dixon. The Dixon part of the story is vital because it flies in the face of the scenario that white men were the only people who made money from early black music. Tying all of these brilliant performances together is the central character of Leonard Chess, the owner of Chess records, as played by Adrien Brody.<br /><br />This film far exceeded my expectations in every respect, because it tells an untold story that pulls no punches. It is a human story, complete with genius, flaws and foibles. It is the story of Leonard Chess, Muddy Waters and the birth of the Chicago Blues. It tells the story without losing its entertainment value. It also shows how white artists of the day, ripped off black music. Chuck Berry, for example, sued the Beach Boys for copyright infringement... and won.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to those who want to be connected with the foundation of Rock `n Roll and Blues. 5 Big Stars - one each for Wright, Knowles, Short, Mos Def and Union.fringement... and won.

B002ZG9846|2.0|Yes, the film/book is decidedly and wonderfully non-PC. Yes, Matthew Vaughn has a distinct visual style and has a sense of humor when it comes to musical cues. Yes, Chloe Moretz is great as Mindy/Hit-Girl. And yes, you can make a successful film based on a comic without sticking straight-up to the source material.<br /><br />But here's the problem. KICK-ASS (at least this volume) is a limited series. When you have decades of mythology, you can play with that a little and still make a great film (SUPERMAN 1 and 2, The Nolan BATMAN films, the first 2 X-MEN films, the first 2 SPIDER-MAN films... and more). But when you have a mini-series, like WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA, LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, FROM HELL (basically anything adapted from an Alan Moore original work)... and you screw around with the plot, characters, and the moments that make those comics transcendental of the four-color genre, you lose most of, if not ALL of the things that make those titles great... which all of those afore-mentioned films did. KICK-ASS, as a comic, lasted for eight issues and those eight issues were great fun. It didn't take itself terribly seriously, and it made you laugh at its extremes. But it worked. There was no futuristic technology, no powers... just people with tazers, clubs, guns and swords. And that was it.<br /><br />Now, as we follow Dave Lizewski on his journey to become the first fanboy-turned-superhero, we're intrigued and amused at how much he sucks at fighting crime. Then when he does something sort of right, his antics are caught on YouTube and masked heroes become a sensation. Satiricially, this is a brilliant setup.<br /><br />But then the filmmakers, and to some extent, the original writer Mark Millar himself, decided to screw around with this story, and add, change, or remove  elements that took away from some of the things that made the book great.<br /><br />And I was lost. I couldn't for the life of me understand why this film decided to stray from the source material so heavily in three major moments: The actual origin of Big Daddy (which is VERY different in the book), the \\"love\\" story between Dave and his crush, and the finale. Well, one particular moment in the finale that COMPLETELY took me out of the film and just made me shake my head in disappointment. Hint: it involves technology that does NOT exist in our real world.<br /><br />And Christopher Mintz-Plasse? Trying tooooooo hard. And I'm just so tired of Nicolas Cage. He should have retired after he won his Oscar, because he hasn't turned in anything vaguely resembling a good performance since then, with the exception of FACE/OFF.<br /><br />These were all things that hit me after the credits for the film rolled and I was on my way out to the parking lot, but they were major differences that were done for purely stylistic purposes, and did nothing but hurt the chances for this film to be everything it could have been.<br /><br />I try really hard not to be a purist, because I know that films can stand apart from their source material, but when you change things that work in the place of things that don't... that's when you really screw your film up.

0439023483|5.0|I wasn't sure when I picked the book up that I would like it, but I was WRONG. I love it. I was hooked by the second chapter. Suzanne Collins created a futuristic world that is hard and gritty, but not without heart. A lot of heart. The heart lies with the characters. Katniss's devotion to Prim and Peeta's devotion to Katniss is so touching and heartwarming. The other characters Suzanne Collins created were very memorable too, Rue especially. A few times tears came to my eyes. The Hunger Games is like survivor to the extreme. It made me angry that people were forced to watch and bets were placed on the tributes. The Capitol treated the twelve districts like they were not even people. I could not help but make comparison between the world we live in today and the futuristic world of Panem. It kept me up thinking about it. Is the US the Capitol? I know there are many \\"districts\\" all over the world that don't have a voice. Some parts of this book was not easy to read but ultimately it's a compelling story of love, survival, and friendship. I loved it from beginning to end.

0307454541|1.0|I feel like the little boy in The Emperor's New Clothes. This book was awful! Over a one year period, I tried reading it twice, abandoning it after 60+ pages each time. I then finally decided to listen to it. Someone is laughing all the way to the bank. I think it's a spoof on every type of novel printed today. Is the title a spoof on The Girl with the Pearl Earring?? It's nothing but pulp fiction.
B002SZAU1Y|3.0|The novel is based on a very good idea, and when I started reading it, I was immediately drawn into the story. The passages dealing with Holly's memories, loss and grief are very moving.<br />Another good point: the ending is not as trite as I had expected.<br />Unfortunately the author felt humour should counterbalance this emotional impact of the story. So people are giggling, cracking jokes and laughing all the time.<br />With the help oft he\\"Search This Book-function\\", and just for the fun of it, I counted the number of times certain words appear:<br />  - giggle/giggles, giggling, giggled:  105 times<br />  - joke/jokes, joking, joked:  46 times<br />And, believe it or not:<br />  - smile/smiles, smiling, smiled:  333 times<br />  - laugh/laughs, laughing, laughed, laughter:  410 times<br />All this squealing and squeaking, choking on drinks and doubling over got on my nerves and annoyed me so much I kept rolling my eyes (expression used 43 times).<br />It is just not possible to write a really amusing story about the themes of death and mourning.<br />So, by trying to make the story funny, the author ruined it. What a shame!
0307454541|5.0|When you first start this book you might be a little overwelmed with all the names and places that are pretty much all Swedish, but deal with it because this book is amazing.  Once I had all the people and places figured out I couldn't put the book down.  It is a great setup for the other two books and you get to know the two main characters without knowing their histories yet.  I recommend this book as a great book to just sit down and read, once you're done you will want to read the next one.
B0037W68F4|4.0|I liked the band's first album and wondered if they would go into a term I don't understand, sophomore slump. I think a sophomore slump is when a band comes out with a great debut cd but the second album just doesn't do the trick.<br />Well, in case of MGMT's \\"Congratulations\\" , I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and awed by how much the band has changed. You can say that the band is trying to be more minimalist and there aren't many songs like we had on the first disc. The band tries hard to stay within context in this album and it worked like a charm I thought.<br /><br />Like many formuliac albums this one can grow on an eager listener like me. I listen to MGMT all day nowadays.  Sometimes I play this cd along with the debut cd and go for a workout session at the gym. While Oracular was a better disc, the band sees some impossible growth on their second disc.<br /><br />Of the 9 tracks the cd has so far, \\"Someone's missing\\" and \\"Congratulations\\" (last track) are my favourites.<br /><br />I don't know what to make of \\"Ladydana's nightmare\\" , the sound is powerful but at the same time a little disturbing because you hear someone howl. Still, quite an unsettling track and I definitely would not recommend repeated listens to anyone because it's just impossible to sit through.<br /><br />\\"I found a whistle\\" and \\"Brian Eno\\" are some other forgettable tunes. Atleast for now.<br /><br />\\"Siberian Kick\\" is a 12 minute song that seems to be the most fruitful produce of this cd. It sounds like the best of Pet Shop Boys and Tears for fears with floyd like vocals.<br /><br />Song for Dan Traecy is a contemporary \\"Strokes\\" like song I can hardly get myself to listen to.  For some reason beyond me, Flash Delirium is the most famous song on the disc, I don't understand why.<br /><br />Now that I have heard their second cd, I respect MGMT a lot more than I did for their first disc. I also wish the band doesn't take until 2014 to produce their third disc.
030745455X|5.0|Out of the books in the Millinium Triology this is my favorite.  In this page turner of a book you start to understand the actions of Lisbeth Salander and why she does the things she does and you find out quickly that she is a modern day hero.  I loved this book and was sucked in instantly by it.  This triology of books really are in two separate sections, in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo you meet the two main characters but the story is about something completley different the last two books focus on those two characters and don't have a lot to do with the first book but you can't read the second book without reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest next so be prepared to have that book waiting right next to you when you finish this one.
0790733226|5.0|Fantastic Movie. If you watch it again, Jodie Foster's experience passing through the wormhole and her testimony before Congress about her \\"trip\\" is an uncanny description of a classic Ayahuasca/ DMT experience. You don't need the trillion dollar machine, just some DMT or 5meoDMT. \\" It's so beautiful. I never knew,\\" etc. Listen to Foster as she \\"comes on to the drug,\\" or falls through the machine. Even her visitation with her father is common interpersonal psychology being played out under the influence of DMT, mescaline or even psilocybin. It's all about multi dimensional consciousness as experienced through these drugs/plants. The questions posed by the congressional committee are questions you'd pose about some of these shamanic experiences. Interesting.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|Stuart Price was a little-known music producer...until he joined forces with Madonna and eventually helped craft her spectacular Confessions on a Dance Floor.  Since then, artists have been lining up to seek his production services ever since...most notably Seal, The Killers, Scissor Sisters, and now Kylie Minogue.  However, aside from the undisputed Queen of Pop, Kylie's playful style is probably the best suited for Price's infectious grooves.  The result of their collaboration is Aphrodite...and it is hands down the best pop/dance album ever to grace our ears this year, and one of the best albums Minogue has ever given us.    Kylie's last outing, X, was a fantastic album though it was also very haphazard and not very focused.  Aphrodite remedies that.  You get 12 catchy, euro-electro-dance numbers that truly showcase a growing artist.  The album is much more mature than her last couple, and Kylie has never sounded better for it.  The perfect song to sum up the album is lead single \\"All The Lovers\\".  As good as that song is other gems on the album far out-do it, namely the title track \\"Aphrodite\\", the thumping \\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\" and the dancy-yet-gentle \\"Looking For An Angel\\".  If you snag the iTunes version, you'll get the bonus track, \\"Mighty Rivers\\", which is definitely worth getting your hands on as well!
B002PEP4HI|4.0|I think that Mitch Albom can sometimes be a little cliche in his approach to faith... I'm not sure if it's an attempt at mass appeal or if there's a lack of depth in general, but I'm also not sure it matters.  He does make faith accessible and that's really what matters.    Overall this was a pair of great stories of deeply religious men and Mitch's journey towards reconciling the similarities rather than accepting the superficial differences.    It's a great start towards understanding our tendencies to focus on the messenger rather than the message, to focus on the appearance rather than the substance, not just of our own faith but of others' faiths.    It's well written and an easy fluid read, total read time of a few hours.

Adrien has other options but I'm completely loyal to Jake and don't want him to even consider them,  but of course Adrien has to do what works for him.

030726999X|5.0|How sad it is to race to the end of this book, the third in the now world-famous Mikael Blomqvist/ Lisbeth Salander series. Sad because Larsson died just before these books made him rich, and sad because now there are no more thrillers involving this cast of characters. But what a great finish it is.<br /><br /> Hornet's Nest picks up just where The Girl Who Played With Fire ended, with Salander fighting for her life after surviving being shot and buried by her own father, Alexander Zalachenko,but not before trying to do the old man in with an ax. Blomqvist is taking his turn again as rescuer (as she had rescued him at the end of the first book) and defender, and he sets out to solve yet one more mystery, one that will involve intrigue up to the highest levels of Swedish government. To save Salander from wrongful trial and possible imprisonment, Blomqvist, his journalist and research staff,  Salander's loyal former employer Dragan of Milton Security, and a few solid police and government believers, must uncover the truth about Zalachenko and the shadow wing of the government responsible for bringing the Russian in from the cold and supporting his deadly dealings for all these years.<br /><br /> Salander's recovery is slow and painful, but she has the help of a new lawyer, Blomqvist's sister, and a sympathetic surgeon who enables Mikael to get the skilled computer hacker once more connected to her universe. Once up and functioning, Salander can play a part in her own defense, although it will eventually mean coming completely clean about secrets of her own.<br /><br /> I found this final novel satisfying in every way. The big theme of violence against women is given the full treatment here that Larsson has been carrying all along. Salander and Blomqvist, apart throughout most of the book, arrive at a relationship that is believable and touching. The new characters introduced here are integrated well and make for some interesting relationship switch-ups. The one \\"flaw\\" I might mention is that a subplot follows along with Erika Berger as she starts her new job at a rival magazine, and it's related to Larsson's theme, but literally nothing else in this book. Annoying, but not really distracting from the book as a whole. A great finish that leaves the reader wishing for more. Sigh.that a subplot follows along with Erika Berger as she starts her new job at a rival magazine, and it's related to Larsson's theme, but literally nothing else in this book.

0140620427|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

0307592839|3.0|I have been reading rave reviews of this book online and elsewhere, but I cannot join the party quite yet. Egan must get credit for moving into more post-modern fiction writing, with the chapters giving voices to a variety of characters who are all connected to the past, present, and even future of two disparate protagonists. Bennie Salazar is a record producer whose midlife is nowhere near as successful as his younger years were, and Sasha, a kleptomaniacal younger woman he employs, are both at a bit of a nadir when the book opens. As chapters follow, sometimes in first person narration, sometimes third and even second, we come to know the younger, wilder, sadder and happier Bennie and Sasha, in vignettes that reveal their pasts, their intersection, and what lies ahead.     I guess my complaint is that the characters are just not fully on the page. In Olive Kitteredge, a far superior collection of stories that all tangentially connect the dots in the title character's life, the writing is just more fluid, more connected to the heart.... Perhaps I couldn't LIKE these characters much; that's true, and that can change the whole experience. Anyway, good marks for doing something different for Egan. My favorite chapter is an adolescent's chart-like journal that succinctly reveals a family's dynamics in a truly remarkable way. That girl could have narrated the whole book, in my opinion.
006145205X|5.0|\\"On what principle is it, that when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?\\" Thomas Macaulay, 1830    Finally, we have a breath of fresh air from all the \\"Great Depression Ahead\\" and apocalyptic titles warning us that plastic water bottles spell impending doom.  The relief from the spate of pessimism is the well-written \\"Rational Optimist\\" by Matt Ridley.    Writer Matt Ridley firmly states his case: living standards are better today than at any point in our history, and over the long run will continue to get better in the future. The excessive pessimism of the popular doomsayers is not new, but their ideas are just as wrong because they do not anticipate technological changes that will rapidly occur. He first shows that by every conceivable metric we are living in a \\"better today: the unprecedented present.\\" Our current wealth and comfort came about due to exchange of ideas and labor specializations that took centuries to develop but have been accelerating over the last century. Barter, trust and societal norms of behavior helped speed this process.      Advances in farming have enabled us to feed the 9 billion inhabitants of this planet despite numerous \\"experts\\" predicting disaster. This was due to unforeseeable advances in farming technology. As humans began to organize themselves in cities 5000 years ago, exchange of ideas and specialization of labor lifted living standards even higher, despite many popular images to the contrary.     Malthus, predicting widespread famine due to overpopulation, missed two key factors: first, advances in farming, and second, decline in birth rates as death rates declined and nations became wealthier. The release of slaves after 1700 was a huge boon to worldwide living standards as productivity increased and we learned to use fossil fuels instead of human beings to do manual labor. After the 1800s, inventions fed on themselves, yielding more and more advances.      Despite all of the obvious improvements in life standards, pessimism has been in vogue during all of this time, but reached a fever pitch during the 1900s, looking constantly for the \\"turning points\\" in which everything would collapse.     The two great pessimisms today are Africa and climate warming.  The author argues that although they are potential problems, they are not insolvable. Scientists do not universally recognize global warming and many of the doomsayers' solutions such as ethanol and \\"renewable\\" energy are actually counter-productive.  Technological advances will likely solve our dependence on fossil fuels; the bottom line is there are more oil reserves today than there were 50 years ago and enough cheap oil to fuel world growth for a century. Africa is a sticky problem, but there is reason to be optimistic even there as some isolated incidents of progress are occurring and birth rates are declining.     The author concludes that there is reason to be a rational optimist going forward as long as idea exchange still occurs.  Innovations have occurred not due to science or government, but due to industrious humans trying to find a better way to do something.    The intensity of the reviews of this book on Amazon is a testament to how entrenched people are in their negative thinking.  It reminds me of the old saying: \\"Don't confuse me with facts; I've already made up my mind.\\"  Die-hard pessimists who read this book will have to acknowledge at the very least, the fact that life today is much better than it was 100 years ago, even if you were the king of France then and you are at the poverty line today.

B003IB38UM|4.0|I am a contemporary of ABBA.  However, when ABBA were performing and touring, I was too cool for their purely \\"Pop\\" music.  If you asked me in the late 70's - early 80's, to name an ABBA song, I would have been hard pressed to come up with anything other than \\"Dancing Queen\\" or \\"Fernando\\".  It's not all my fault though - Top 40 radio played very little of their music.      Now 30 years later, thanks to the play and movie of Mamma Mia, I have become thoroughly aware of ABBA - finally.  But I still feel cheated that I wasn't aware at the time.  In 1979 I was living in St. Louis, MO, and although ABBA did not play there, they did play in Chicago, which was close enough to drive.      After seeing both the play and the movie, I first bought the ABBA Gold CD.  That was a good start as it contains all of their really big hits - many more than I was aware of.  But it wasn't enough - I wanted more.        This remastered version of their Voulez-Vous album is well worth the price.  Not only is the sound great, it has brought me new ABBA music that I never heard before.  My new favorite is \\"The King Has Lost His Crown\\".  I guess there are advantages to being late to the party - what is \\"old hat\\" to original fans is all new to me.      The DVD includes a television special that ABBA filmed in Switzerland in 1979 that is great.  Even though they are lip syncing to a playback of the recording, it is great to see them up close - since I missed the real concert (Darn it).
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This CD and the accompanying DVD are such a welcome pleasure for a JT and Carole K lover dating back to the 60's when they first joined their musical styles at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Their voices continue to sound smooth and confident. The joy of the collaboration between the two artists is so clear as they introduce songs and reminisce about times they sang together and take you through the decades. Their individual talents are brought to light in JT's songs like the one about his little nemesis nephew, \\"Sweet Baby James\\", Fire and Rain, the great guitar and voice riff \\"Country Road, Carolina In My Mind\\", and \\"Blossom\\". Carole K's talents are so beautifully showcased in \\"So Far Away\\", It's Too Late\\". \\"Something In The Way She Moves\\", \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"I Fell The Earth Move\\". Together it was great the way they sang and meant it on \\"You've Got a Friend\\". This CD/DVD was the real deal for me, providing a totally satisfying performance experience by two favorites.

0891419063|4.0|Following on from the excellent Pacific series on TV I thought how accurate the writer was in his description of the Marines privations during the battles. I was immediately drawn to the accounts of the Somme conflicts in the First World War where participants found similar conditions. It was quite shocking how little had changed in tactics and conditions. I am sure things in Afghanastan would not have altered that much either. No matter what technology it is the infrantryman who takes the toll.<br />This is described in fantastic detail by Eugene Sledge and I was especially taken with his accounts of how morality disappears once killing starts, and how attrocity begets attrocity.<br />An extremely well written book.
0312370849|3.0|I was disappointed in this novel.      The original premise was interesting: A 10-year-old girl, Sarah, tries to save her 4-year-old brother from being taken away by the French police during the 1942 round-up of Jews by locking him in a secret hidden cupboard of their home.  She takes the key, promising to come back soon to release him. She does not realize the family's ultimate destination is Auschwitz.  Although she finally manages to escape, she returns too late to save him.      In alternating chapters, a second story line concerns an American-born French journalist who learns about this tragedy and tries to find the girl 60 years later.  The journalist's attempts to find Sarah, who would now be an old woman, become so obsessive that her entire life revolves around it: forsaking her marriage, traveling to other countries in search of Sarah, naming her new baby Sarah, etc.     Sarah's voice ends as the book focuses on the journalist, whose whole life's mission has become to tell Sarah that \\"she remembers\\" what happened to the Jews.  The story line falters and is finally overwhelmed by this inauthentic rationale.  By the end of the book, I was more interested in the author's own obsessive-compulsive disorder than I was on how the story concluded.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I have to say this is one of the few mainstream albums this year I've actually wanted to cop and listen to. People have been talking about Hip Hop not being dead. Even Nas weighed in and said Hip Hop is no longer dead. Talib was the first to say \\"hip hop is dead\\" before there was an album. I have to say that the \\"Hip Hop Is Dead\\" and \\"Untitled\\" albums re-engaged my attention with Nas as an artist and lyricist.  Nas and Damian Marley are a formidable pairing, seemingly on the same level throughout most of the album in thought and overall presence. Distant Relatives is an important reminder that we are all one together, no matter how different the background, and thus proving Nas and Marley's `hypothesis' that even though they are hardly similar, they can join to create fantastic music, even if it's a track or two too many. Granted, they completed this album in a relatively short time, it begs the question how much they could grow if they worked with each other on future albums. At that point, they may not be such distant relatives.

0439023491|5.0|The sequel to The Hunger Games, Catching Fire improves upon Collins' first foray into Katniss' dystopian, post-apocalyptic world of the Districts. I've been waiting to read this one for awhile and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />After having won the Hunger Games with her district partner Peeta, Katniss should be living the good life. And she is. In high contrast to the horrible poverty she and her family lived in before the Hunger Games, Katniss now resides in the Victor's Village in District 12 and never wants for anything. Her family has everything they've ever wanted now-a nice house, new clothing, medicine, and most importantly, food. As a victor of the Games, Katniss has got it all.<br /><br />Except, of course, the company of her best-friend-maybe-more Gale, who is understandably upset. A large part of Katniss and Peeta's victory in the Games depended on them tugging the heartstrings of the TV viewers by putting on a very convincing act of two young, desperate survivors head-over-heels in love with each other. In reality, they're friends (although there is a large amount of unrequited love on Peeta's side) and Katniss wishes everything could go back to the days where she and Gale were still best friends, and worked together to hunt game for their families.<br /><br />What Katniss doesn't know is that unrest is brewing in the Districts, which have long been held under the cruel, tyrannical rule of the Capitol. Because of her defiance in the last Games, she has become an unknowing symbol of the rebellion, and her family and friends are under threat of death from the Capitol's President unless she can find a way to quell the rebels. How to do this? Put on the biggest, final act of her life by appearing as one part of the happiest, most romantic couple with Peeta that the world has ever seen. Marriage is on the horizon, and kids aren't sure to be far behind. That is, until an even greater twist sends Katniss and her friends back into the Arena of the Games...<br /><br />Wow. I don't often write summaries myself (I'm so lazy!) but I think I made that one suitably exciting without giving TOO much away.<br /><br />I really thought Collins came through with the sequel, because while I enjoyed The Hunger Games, I wasn't as thrilled or in love with the story as most bloggers have seemed to be. But with Catching Fire, I felt that the events following Katniss' victory were definitely believable, and the stakes were even higher.<br /><br />Collins did a great job of evolving the character of Katniss-you could tell she was the same character, but had also gone through some changes due to the events from the previous novel. Very realistic and easy to believe. I also thought that her conflicting and confused feelings regarding Gale and Peeta were well written. The whole plot was very exciting and had some great twists that I definitely did not see coming. Collins is very imaginative and inventive about the situations she puts her characters through. I can't wait to read the third novel in the series, which the author is apparently working on presently. I wonder how many more books there will be about Katniss and her friends./><br />Wow.

B001KWZ796|5.0|Even my ex, a non-emotional guy from the eastern bloc, loved this movie, which is even more amazing than the movie itself. I thought the story of Cinderella would be retarded done as anything but animation, but this is intelligent and funny and different and gave me a completely different result than expected. Drew Barrymore and Angelica Huston are both simply great in this, although AH's role was more two dimensional (by writing, not by her acting; a deeper part would have done her and the movie good, as she's capable of so much more). I've actually watched this movie several times, which is very rare for me for anything that is not 'intelligent sci-fi' genre. I prefer action movies but this was interesting all the way through. Having had plenty of step-siblings growing up, I found both the stepsisters and their differences to be surprisingly believable. Overall it's a really nice film, watchable by any generation, worthwhile to widely different kinds of tastes and people. Very recommended.
0545123275|5.0|I have heard a lot of good things about Stiefvater's writing but avoided it for awhile because she writes about two of the most overdone things in fiction today: fairies/faeries, and werewolves. Nothing especially against these two subjects-there's some very good stuff out there (Holly Black, Emma Bull, Annette Curtis Klaus) but there's also a lot of very badly written stuff brought on by the Twilight and mass urban/paranormal fantasy craze, which I dislike generally.<br /><br />I finally picked up Shiver because I read some really great reviews, and I'll admit, the cover design is pretty and intriguing. Good decision!<br /><br />It's hard to write a summary for this one without sounding super cliche and Twilight-esque. And I'll say the story itself could have progressed in that vein, if not for Steifvater's great writing. She is very poetic and sparse, does a nice job of writing first-person from our protagonist Grace's point of view. Anyway I should say a little more about the plot before anything else:<br /><br />Attacked by wolves as a child, Grace has nevertheless always felt an affinity for one particular wolf that frequents the woods behind her backyard-this one has yellow eyes and is there in the trees every winter.

This wolf is Sam; he was completely human once upon a time, but every winter when the temperature drops, he is helpless against the change that comes upon him and other members of his pack.

B002NXSRX4|4.0|Hopefully the next one has more storyline and also hope Marlon Wayans stars in it as well cause he was good and serious(prefer him over Shawn anytime anyday!)
B00000DLVA|5.0|I like the new direction they took.Even though songs are slow, Nina's singing is at its best and I love the way the album sounds. Not only are the lyrics dark now, but the music too. Can't really tell if you'll like it  Buy it and see.
B001FB4W0C|1.0|The product was sold as NEW, however the case itself was broken on the inside. DVDs worked fine, but I would not classify this product as \\"new\\" and will not purchase from this seller again.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I remember last year I didn't wanna watch this movie.But I was so bored one day and just decided to.  I loved it!  The songs are awesome, the acting is awesome, everything is well done!    Some people don't like it because most characters in the movie are evil and you feel no sympathy for them, but I still enjoyed it. Does that make me a bad person?
B001NESPHC|4.0|Great cd.  I am a fan of the standards, and her voice is fabulous.
0385504225|4.0|I was given the Lost Symbol as Christmas gift because I had expressed interest in the book. Outside of this book, I had read none of Dan Brown's books--just watched The Da Vinci Code which I enjoyed and Angels & Demons which I didn't care much for in the end. I had heard many criticisms of Brown's \\"writing abilities\\" so I was prepared for what lay ahead, especially after reading many negative reviews.    The moment I opened the book and read the first page... I could NOT put it down. When people use the expression \\"it's a page turner\\" or \\"you won't want to put it down\\", I have had very few books do that for me. The Lost Symbol is a book that was delightful and thrilling to read. Some reviewers noted little history or the way characters responded and went on and on and I expect a minority actually read the book.     I won't spend my time explaining the plot because you can look it up elsewhere or just read it here. If you buy this book, you will not be disappointed. It really is thrilling and interesting and the twists--yes there are twists--but they are so good! Maybe I'm lame for liking this book, but then again, the Twilight Saga exists--and trust me when I say: this is not as bad (or bad at all in my case).
B003N7GATM|4.0|If there is one thing I was hoping for with the release of the eponymous EP from How To Destroy Angels it was for something completely beyond the norm for Trent Reznor. I'm a HUGE Nine Inch Nails fan, so as far as I am concerned, anything the man touches is solid gold (and I haven't been let down yet). HTDA is no exception; it's a quality record from a quality group of musicians. My only complaint would be that it does sound a little too NIN-ish. Some of these tracks sound like they could have been b-sides or unreleased tracks from Year Zero, which wouldn't have been a bad thing if this was a Nails release. It sounds as though Trent is trying to get out of his comfort zone here but just can't seem to get all the way out. Some tracks are stellar standouts that offer a lot of hope that some amazing things are in the works; \\"Fur Lined\\" in particular has a very unique feel that sets it apart from Reznor's previous work. \\"The Space In Between\\" is a bit out there for him, but still manages to toe that line of comfortability. The addition of Mariqueen Maandig-Reznor certainly adds an interesting element to the equation, her vocals are haunting and breathy which does wonders for the music; Reznor singing would have not made quite the impact.    All in all, this is a good record; not a great one, but a good one. If Trent and company can find a way to get themselves out of their comfort zone, they could deliver a truly amazing album.
B003GDYN24|5.0|\\"Flesh Tone\\" is a deliciously perfect blend of electro-house pop. I bought the album today  and I have been playing it non-stop and now I'm waiting for my hard copy so I can play it until it plays no more! The music is euphoric and the lyrics are beautiful. Yes, here is an electronic-pop album with deep and meaningful lyrics. I did not care for Kelis before, I just liked her \\"Milkshake\\" and \\"Bossy\\" hits like everyone else, but after hearing her single \\"Acapella\\" and \\"4th of July\\" I learned more about her and watched some interviews and performances--Tavis Smiley and saw her on Kimmel  and Leno. She is so amazing live that I already bought my tickets to see her in concert with Robyn! (YES!)    This album is like the ultimate lullaby to her son and a kind of declaration of her independence and strength as a woman. Her divorce from Nas did not turn her into a crying woman that cowers back and loses it all. With this album she picks herself up, pieces everything together and rises from the problems with strength!   The music is amazing. If this is her new musical direction, then more power to her! There are so many club stomping hits on this album, it is incredible. My personal favorites are \\"22nd Century\\", \\"Acapella\\", \\"4th of July\\", and \\"Song for the Baby\\". I just cannot get over the fact that this is a dance album with beautiful lyrics and for such a cheap price ($7.99) it is a STEAL! It is has gotten praise from critics and bloggers alike, and all I can say is that they hit the nail on the head. This album is HOT!    Finally, this is the PERFECT SUMMER ALBUM! Buy it NOW!
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|\\"Coldplay is catching a really bad cold the equivalent of the black plague, except it travels from money to music.\\"    The only aspect regarding highly rated reviews I don't concur with is, \\"What's for sure, however, is that this is their most interesting outing to date.\\"    This album is better than \\"X&Y\\" for a fact, but it's certainly not as creative and interesting to listen as \\"A Rush of the Blood to the Head!\\"  In my own opinion, Coldplay hasn't been producing \\"great\\" music; not to say that they don't have talent, which they obviously do.  What I'm saying is, their music is gradually getting infected by all the pestilences running through music now a day.  The radio, album sells, and commercials, etc... Kill music....  I want the way Coldplay use to be; \\"God put a smile upon your face,\\" songs like that!    The only bands that are known to have managed to avoid catching the disease are Radiohead, White Stripes, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Add to the list if anyone wants...    Evidence:  Radiohead never plays \\"Creep\\" live because they don't like playing \\"commercialized s*** (quote from the lead singer Thom Yorke).\\"  They didn't release any singles from their best album \\"Kid A\\" because they hate singles (they believe in albums).     \\"It would be nice if artists started to produce albums every year, maybe two albums a year,\\" Jack White in an interview regarding album making.  \\"Something solid, something you can hold like an album... even a CD is great.  We want people to have a tangible experience.\\"    Now, I'm not advertizing bands; I have better things to do than advertize bands...  If people think that's have I'm doing; they're missing the whole point.  Music isn't that way I use to be, because many of our artists don't have morals and believe that tin can throwing from the second story is beautiful music.    Not to end on a bad note, but Coldplay has some hope...  \\"Violet Hill\\" was a great song with distorted guitar work.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I really liked the beginning of this book. For a third of it, I was enthralled. Then it slowly began to turn downhill and rapidly degraded into an unfulfilled, uninspiring escapist story. It might be that I'm simply not spiritual enough for the pray and love parts, but I failed to travel along for 2/3rds of the trip.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|It's interesting that the ubiquitous negative reviews regarding The Lightning Thief come primarily from those who abhor the deviations from the book, while those giving the film positive reviews come mainly from those who haven't had the opportunity to read the book yet. I'm of the latter camp.    Why, for example, doesn't anyone give a film like the Wizard of Oz deplorable reviews because of its deviations from the book? In fact, I'm curious how many people are familiar with the Wizard of Oz through their knowledge of Hollywood's depiction of it, rather than Baum's actual book. Gone are the Hammer-Heads and China Country, as well as some of the Witch's machinations, just to name a few. The Wicked Witch of the West summons 40 Wolves to kill Dorothy and her friends. The Tin Woodman slays them with his axe. The Witch also summons 40 Crows to peck out the eyes of Dorothy and her friends. The Scarecrow defeats them by grabbing them and breaking their necks. Kinda bleak, if you ask me (and not a little violent). But both versions of the Wizard of Oz are immensely enjoyable on their own terms, and I wouldn't change either for the world.    As for Harry Potter, I only read the first of the novels. The travesty of the film version (The Sorcerer's Stone) was that it was nearly a carbon copy of the book. While the film attempts to do service to the book and its readers by being a faithful adaptation (way too faithful, in my opinion), it ends up being quite stilted and boring.    On the other hand, the Lord of the Rings film trilogy strays from a chapter-by-chapter accounting of its source material out of necessity; all the while, however, it maintains a devoted love and integrity to the book. The result is a visually brilliant and smartly crafted epic.    The Lightning Thief film may not have the artistic depth and merit of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, but it's also not the boring carbon copy that the first Harry Potter film was. And while the deviations from the bookmay, indeed, be sacrilegious to the many who had high hopes to see the story's characters and plot elements come to life straight out of the pages of the book, I found the film to be an enjoyable popcorn flick, nonetheless.     But that's just my two cents worth...    (Oddly enough, although I'm sure there are more than a handful examples, the one instance that comes to mind in which the translation to a different medium is actually better than the original source material is Wicked. Great musical to watch, but a ponderous experience to read the book.)
B003EYVXYG|1.0|Diary of the Dead was Romero's attempt to cash in on the shaky cam craze while putting his own zombie mastermind spin on it. Although technically his fifth film in the living dead series, I never really considered it on the same field as Night, Dawn, Day and Land. It seemed more like a spin off film, an add on, to make a gaming analogy Diary of the Dead was a bonus pack, not a new game in and of itself. For me, and for many, many other long time Romero fans, Diary was a bitter disappointment. It lacked the grit and realism of Day, and its characters were far from the well developed fleshed out human beings of Night and Dawn. Although not a terrible film, if failed utterly to live up to the greatness of Romero's other titles.<br /><br />Where Diary failed to live up to the living dead series, Survival not only does that, but pisses on everything Romero ever did right with it. I've been pissed off before watching movies by directors I once loved, but never like this. There is absolutely no redeeming quality for Survival of the Dead, nothing that could possibly save it from the dozens and dozens of hate reviews it will receive once the general public gets a hold of this piece of zombie trash. I've seen my fair share of bad zombie movies, anyone out there who can say the same knows that most are garbage, so you can understand the full meaning of when I say Survival of the Dead is probably, of its own right and not just compared to the original four movies, THE worst zombie film I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. Never before has such an idiotic film featuring zombies infected my DVD player with its idiocy the way this one has. Fine, think I'm exaggerating? Don't take my word for it, watch this abomination for yourself and see just how far the former master of living dead horror has fallen.<br /><br />The story starts out with the old line we know from Dawn of the Dead and reused in Diary of the Dead, &#34;everyone who dies gets up and kills, the people they kill get up and kill.&#34; Its a classic, is it not? Who doesn't remember those frightened and half panicked newsmen shouting at one another in a crowded room, as the world turns to hell outside their doors? To this day its one of my favorite moments of the entire series. So, in spirit of this great scene, Romero puts these words in the mouth of some emo Snake Pliskin from Escape from New York wana be chain smoking idiotic Army National Guard sergeant played by THE most armature actor imaginable who drolls out his lines like he'd rather be somewhere else, reading some other script that someone with more talent put a little more time and effort into writing. In the first two minutes we get to see zombies sneak into the Army camp, somehow undetected by the guards, and bite the cheek off one hapless victim. Soon after our emo idiot sneaks off into the night with stupid trailer trash fat white guy, a horny sexy tough with a sensitive spot Latino girl, and a womanizer god fearing panzy Mexican. These three amego's and the token tough girl go AWOL, meeting up briefly with the *cough* 'hero's' of that Diary movie I mentioned earlier, before adding a brooding hotshot thinks he's all that teenager to the mix and running off in an armored truck to meet an old Scottish white guy who the brooding hotshot thinks he's all that teenager saw on his iphone who's promising people a chance to live on an island free of the &#34;dead heads&#34; in his best car salesman voice possible.<br /><br />It only gets worse from there on, but I digress. The biggest strengths of the original four movies were their focus on strong characters who's survival and interactions with one another were the real drama of the movies and NOT the zombies, and an underlying political or social message that tackled issues like racism and consumerism. Sure, the gore in Day was fun, and the comedy in Dawn was appreciated, but they aren't the focus of the films. With survival Romero presents us with a group of characters who are not only badly acted (VERY badly acted) but uninteresting, boring, and clich&eacute;. There is not a single character in this film, NOT A SINGLE ONE, that could get me to feel anything but hatred for them. I sighed with relief every time one of them bit the dust, relished their moments of demise since I wouldn't have to suffer through their idiocy any longer. If only ALL the characters had died... early in the movie... before saying a word... yeah, it would have been good had this film not been made in the first place. As for underlying political messages, Survival has one I guess, but its so heavy handed and indescribably mixed in with the convoluted story line that I couldn't make heads or tails about what it's really about. Is it about family feuds? Is it about respecting the dead? Is it about never killing? Is it about, oh gosh, I don't really care; the movie is terrible so any message it was trying to get out was lost in translation.<br /><br />Quick question; how hard is it to outrun a Romero zombie? I know he seems to do this in all his films, where people are running from zombies and are somehow caught, but it just gets absurd in this film. Everyone just sort of sits there and waits for the zombies to surround them before trying to get away, and then there's always that ONE zombie they didn't seem coming from behind who grabs them by the neck and takes a bite out of it. I yearn for the days when this was funny. It was in Dawn of the Dead when that Mexican guy in the hat got eaten up in the blood pressure machine, not so much in this film.<br /><br />But I'm rambling; I'll end my review with this. George A. Romero is no longer a great film maker. Diary of the Dead mediocre, but Survival is just plain terrible beyond belief. I never thought I'd be giving the title of best zombie movie (Day of the Dead) and worst zombie movie (Survival of the Dead) I've ever seen to the same man, but that seems to have happened here fellow Romero fans. Despair, for the king is now dead.<br /><br />Replay value, VERY low.d (VERY badly acted) but uninteresting, boring, and cliché.

If this is the first Dan Brown one reads, then a great read.  BUT if one has read his other books than one would have expected more.  That being said, I am looking forward to his next book which hopefully will be better.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Showed up promptly, no scratches on disc. In fact, the disc and box looked brand new. Unfortunately it's one of those dvds with no menu or special features or anything, just the movie, but that's a problem with Disney/Pixar, not the seller :) Great find, great price.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I have to say, when seeing the trailers for this prior to the movie release, I had no desire to see it. I have not read the books. After seeing it on DVD and having no prior knowledge of the story line, I LIKED THIS MOVIE.<br />First, books translated to film always must be rewritten and altered for time/pacing.<br />FACT: You CANNOT put an entire book into one movie.<br />The only bad thing about it, in my point of view was, they rushed to get so much into the movie that it was, well, rushed. I guess I have to say that it was also not likely that Zeus would be so eager to falsly accuse Percy. He had absolutly zero evidence or knowledge who the thief was and was threatening war? Some explaination of this in the movie would have been welcome.<br />I found it interesting that because they couldn't tell Percy of his past, they had to explain his gift of reading or translating writing as ADD/ADHD or Dyslexia. His gaining control over this gift as he learned of his lineage was an interesting concept. I also found it interesting that he was a very fast learner and a natural leader. All it took was him learning the truth.<br />If they make any other movies based on these books and Chris Columbus makes the movie, I'll go see it.
030726999X|2.0|For those of you who eagerly await The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest, you may find the read a big disappointment. Knowing that the author died before publication of the trilogy, the poor writing throughout the book, especially in the first 300 pages, made me wonder how much of this book Steig Larsson actually wrote. The first 2/3 of the book dragged from the weight of too much useless information eg. a phone directory of last names, street and city names--serving only to bog down the story and confuse. I had to force myself to read to the end. Had I not invested the time and money in the 2 earlier book I would not have finished this one. I expect fans of the first two books to buy and read this one, but think that they too will feel disappointed. I was happy when this book finally ended. It didn't leave me wishing for a fourth.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|Special effects are just OK and that is not enough to make up for an insipid story.  Do not buy.
0743496728|3.0|I loved this book in many ways. However, It is the holes in the story that bother me.    Why is there no reaction from Alex when she realises what a bully Matt was? He was her daughter's boyfriend and Alex was charmed by the signs of love in her daughter. Then we find out what a bully Matt was (the real monster of the story). Alex should have been horrified that her daughter was involved with a character who was capable of such cruelty. Picoult tells us nothing.    Then, how could Peter's mother not have realised that he was suffering so much? When he \\"loses\\" his lunchbox for the third time in first grade, does it not even occur to her that he may be being bullied? Apparently not. Her reaction is to punish her little boy! Punish him for being bullied! The book encourages us to ask questions about the role of parenting (or failures of parenting) in the creation of a \\"monster\\". Yet, this particular failure slips by practically unnoticed. Not only does his mother fail to recognise that he is in trouble, she punishes him for the consequences. That must be devastating for a child. The one person on whom he should be able to depend to protect him and vindicate him, effectively joins the bullies in undermining him. I can't believe that any mother so loving as Peter's could be so blind.    Next hole. No one seems to react adversely to details of the bullying Peter was subjected to. There is no sense that anyone looks at these \\"jocks\\" as monsters, which they truely are. This is emphasised in the complete lack of reaction of teachers (symbolised by the absense of any instruction to teachers in the anti-bullying policy document) when Peter is humiliated. In the canteen, after the \\"pantsing\\" incident, both boys are treated the same by the teacher in charge. In any school I know, such an incident, witnessed by a teacher, would lead to either the suspension of the perpetrator or his total expulsion from school. Is it really the case that such overt bullying would be passed over so casually by American High school adminstrators?    Near the end of the book, there are several comments to the effect that \\"nothing has changed\\". I am not surprised. The book, while appearing to be trying to winnow out the reasons why a child would be driven to such appalling actions, fails to challenge the adults in the story. Where were they and where were they looking when their children were in such trouble? The story line seems to suggest that when Alex gives up her judge position and gets a man, she suddenly begins to develop a bond with her child Josie. Can Picould be serious? Despite being obsessed with the idea of being a good mother, Professional single mothers cannot connect with their children? Neither, it seems can professional married women or their professional husbands. Maybe they need to spend less time on the idea of parenting and more on actually being parents.    Are American High Schools such shark infested waters? I would love to hear from young people currently attending such schools. Is the picture created by Picoult accurate? Are children tearing each other apart like this on a daily basis (and I don't mean the shootings)? Are parents really so blind?    One final hole.  What was the purpose of Joey?  He existed, he was favoured by his parents, he was a jock, he bullied his brother and he died.  Why was he there in the first place?  Beyond a few passing references to his death, we at not time are given a description of Peter's attitude to his brother and, most importantly, to his brother's death.  Except for one incident, after being caught in a lift Peter mistakenly thinks (very briefly) his parents actually cared for and were worried about him, only to realise almost immediately that they were actually grieving for Joey.  We are never given any insight into how Peter felt about Joey, alive or dead.  One other thing is missing.  Not only do Peter's parents punish him for being bullied, they never instruct the older son, the favoured golden boy, on treating his different younger brother with respect.  It is left to Peter to either conform or to \\"toughen up\\".    It all seems a bleak picture.  Fundamentally Picould appears to believe that Peter, and kids like him, are in fact the losers their peers see them as. In other words, it is not the responsibility of the \\"Jocks\\", the \\"popular set\\", the golden ones, OR of the parents, teachers or adults in general to practice tolerance.  It appears that Picould shares the opinion of her characters that individuals like Peter or Derek need to become more like everyone else or be prepared to take the consequences.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Nice to watch a TV series where I don't feel defiled by lots of bad language, gratuitous violence and sexual immorality.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|I don't understand a thing: Why does U2 insist on creating DVDs in America? European fans are much better.  Just compare the Elevation from Slane<->Elevation from Boston  or Vertigo from Chicago<->Vertigo from Milan    Otherwise this Blu-Ray is very good!!
B001GCUO16|1.0|For this movie to have been any more predictable, they'd have to have included the script with the DVD. Seriously, this movie was a major letdown. It got to the point where I, having never seen the movie, could point out when a character was about to die. I personally wasn't a fan of the fact that pretty much every character in this movie who isn't in one of the other 3 X-Men movies dies before the end. The story was linear, the characters static and unrealistic, and the movie was filled with gratuitous action scenes that seemed to only be in the movie to make Wolverine look cool. If you want to see a bunch of mindless violence without meaning or purpose, and that won't even make you cheer, then this is the movie for you(although if this is what you're looking for, I recommend something like a Resident Evil video game....at least those have interesting stories attached to the mindless violence). However, if you want a movie that has any sort of a satisfying plot, or interesting characters, then this is not the movie for you.
0316098337|5.0|I could not put this book down, I could barely stop reading to go to sleep. I started Monday afternoon at 4pm and finished the next afternoon at 1pm. If the TV shows Criminal Minds and Mental crossed paths a script looking somewhat like this book (but nowhere near as good) might emerge. I haven't been this in love with a book since [[ASIN:0743278828 The Mercy of Thin Air: A Novel]]. The book is skillfully written from the point of view of a 5 year old boy who is being held captive along with his mother in the place he calls \\"Room\\". This room is his whole universe, it is all that exists for him and he cannot fathom that anything else exists because what he sees is all he has ever known. And as the reader we are introduced to his world through his eyes but at the same time we are outside and know better. The plot and characters are spellbinding, the language skills and story telling singular- it is one of the most unique books I have read and I would (and have) recommend it profusely to anyone.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Outstanding!  Crisp, clear, great sound.  Storyline is pure Besson, Portman, Oldman and Reno are a pleasure to watch.  Couple that with first-rate portrayals by the secondary characters, and this film rates in my top ten!
B003L16FAE|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Predator and have had this in just about every medium it's been created in. I didn't buy the previous Blu-ray release, mainly for the lack of extras. So I was very happy to see what they included on this disc. Great extras and great movie make for an all-around great disc for the sci-fi, action, popcorn, Arnold movie lover.     Not sure why Amazon insists on showing all the reviews for the original Blu-ray release as opposed to the reviews specific to the Ultimate Hunter Edition. If you are at all a fan of the genre, buy this disc.     The DNR is there, yes.  I'll admit that, but as a fan and as an HD lover, I can ignore it.  Anyone who tells you that it's an abysmal transfer, or some derogatory comment like that, they take their movie watching too seriously. If you watch a movie for the sole purpose of nitpicking it on it's flaws, you won't be disappointed, and you'll be deprived of the experience of the movie itself.     Don't believe the nay-sayers. This is a decent transfer with lots of good extras. Again, if you're a fan of any kind, buy it!
B001R4KQDE|5.0|Pure Eye and Ear candy.  Was already a huge fan of the Theatrical release, but the Extended, Recut edition really ties things together.  Excellent cast of characters (Micky as Marv is PURE genius), and the storylines punch through hard and fast!

0307592839|5.0|In Jennifer's Egan's lively and inventive novel - A Visit From The Goon Squad - each character feels his or her mortality.  Each is in a tenuous danse-a-deux with time and aging, otherwise known as \\"the goon.\\"<br /><br />Every chapter is told from a different character's point of view and it is no accident that the novel starts with Sasha - the assistant of music producer Bennie Salazar, one of the key focal points.  Sasha has sticky fingers and is constantly pirating away meaningless objects to compose \\"the warped core of her life.\\"  These objects serve as talismans, placing her at arm's length from the love she wants.<br /><br />And Bennie?  A one-time band member and arrogant indie genius, he is now one step removed from the action, adding flakes of gold to his coffee to enhance his libido and bemoaning the state of digital technology.  Like Sasha, he's at arm's length from a direct connection with love and life in general.<br /><br />Bennie and Sasha will never know much about each other - even though they've worked together for decades - but the reader comes to know them through various stories.  We get to know Lou, Bennie's charismatic, misbehaving, skirt-chasing mentor during a harrowing African safari; Dolly, the PR mogul who places her own daughter in harm's way; Jules, the ex-con journalist whose lunch with a Hollywood grade B actress goes terribly wrong;  Ted Hollander, Sasha's art-loving uncle, who travels to Naples to find her.  Each will add a little something to our understanding.<br /><br />Yet none of their stories is told in chronological order, or even through flashbacks.  Rather, time is revealed like the grooves of a record album, jumping from track to track in what appears to be no particular order.  As each character takes his or her own moment in the spotlight, he or she is desperate for a second chance and to hold off the approaching goon.  At one point, Dolly reflects, \\"Her deeper error had preceded all that:  she's overlooked a seismic shift...Now and then (she) finds herself wondering what sort of event or convergence would define the new world in which she found herself, as Capote's party had, or Woodstock, or Malcolm Forbes's seventieth birthday, or the party for Talk Magazine.  She had no idea.\\"<br /><br />The rich, lush, adventurous life that these characters once lived is being replaced by PowerPoints (one young character reveals her story through a 40-page PowerPoint presentation), paid \\"parrots\\" who create social media buzz, truncated emails, and digital technology.  As Egan's characters \\"strut and fret\\" their last hours on the broader stage, the world of technology is making them increasingly irrelevant.  When Alex - Sasha's would be beau whom we meet in the first chapter - tells Bennie, \\"I don't know what happened to me,\\"  Bennie's answer is, \\"You grew up, Alex...just like the rest of us.\\"ds herself wondering what sort of event or convergence would define the new world in which she found herself, as Capote's party had, or Woodstock, or Malcolm Forbes's seventieth birthday, or the party for Talk Magazine.

0205632645|1.0|First of all, I want to make it clear that I love this book. I borrowed it from a friend a few years ago, which is why I thought it was high time I got my own copy. Unfortunately, once I did, I found that the actual quality of the printing of this edition is horrible. The paper feels cheap and the text looks as if it were poorly photocopied. You would definitely not expect this from an edition billed as \\"more durable and elegantly bound edition\\".  The only good thing I could say about this edition is that the cover is indeed beautiful, which is a good thing if all you want is something that looks nice on a bookshelf.<br /><br />I recommend the 4th edition instead.
0981951244|5.0|I am student of personal development and very particular when it comes to what I read.  The Compound Effect is unlike most of the books on success that are on the shelf today. It really made me think about how I can work better on my basics. The ideas and concepts are not revolutionary (Darren will tell you so) but  but every page is filled with another powerful point that is immediately actionable. From my daily choices, to mentoring, to goal setting...the book just made sense and I found Darren's real world stories, examples, and action steps relevant to my life. I highly recommended this book if you're looking for solid ideas on taking your life (not just your business) to new heights.
B003IPC5UC|4.0|In the world of pop superstars, Kylie Minogue plays the role of the eternal adolescent. While other pop stars position themselves as provocateurs, rebels, or innocents, Kylie's music has always been at its best when simulating the emotional and physical rush of young romantic love. So the role of Aphrodite, goddess of love, beauty, and sex, is a perfect one for Kylie to play.<br /><br />Sonically, Kylie has always had to walk a fine line in her career ... she has to experiment with her sound, in order to keep the music fresh and fans interested, and yet not stray too far from her slinky dance diva formula. Musically, despite a bevy of producers, \\"Aphrodite\\" belongs to Stuart Price, who oversees the whole project and wrote or produced most of the tracks. Price, who's done great work with Madonna, Seal, and The Killers recently, adds moments of glittery euphoria to the tracks, keeping them from sounding too formulaic.<br /><br />Standout tracks include: \\"All the Lovers,\\" which starts off the album as a soft, breathy, come-on and then builds into an almost psychedelic crescendo. \\"Put Your Hands Up\\" increases the BPM and piques with a sonic explosion that is pure Stuart Price. \\"Aphrodite\\" is a catchy and cheeky ode of self-empowerment. And \\"Cupid Boy,\\" which glides along on an intoxicating guitar riff, offers a swooning rush of libido.<br /><br />This is pop music, pure, unapologetic and simple, with no pretensions of being anything else or anything more. You either enjoy the sugar rush or you don't. I do.

B003GDYN24|4.0|A big switch in musical direction for an artist is usually the result of one of two things ... either big changes in the artist's personal life, or a marketing strategy to appeal to a different or bigger demographic.<br /><br />In the case of Kelis with \\"Flesh Tone\\", I think it's a little of both. Kelis was pregnant and going through a nasty and public divorce while recording the album, which could explain the album's themes of liberation, birth, and rebirth. At the same time, the album's club/dance/electronica vibe could also have to do with the recent success of dance acts like the Black Eyed Peas and Lady Gaga.<br /><br />In the end, I think it comes down to whether it works or not. \\"Flesh Tone\\" works. On her last two albums, Kelis had been playing the role of tough/sexy R&B diva, downplaying the spaciness of her earlier work. But the vibe of \\"Flesh Tone\\" allows Kelis to completely blast off into space, and it suits her. And although the tracks are full of throbbing beats and electronic sound affects, Kelis' raspy, soulful voice keeps the tracks from ever sounding too mechanical, and her lyrics, probably her most vulnerable and heartfelt ever, add an emotional core that was lacking in some of her R&B hits like \\"Milkshake\\" or \\"Bossy\\".<br /><br />Ironically, by making a switch to dance music, Kelis has come up with the most soulful album of her career.
B003GDYN24|5.0|I've been a long time Kelis fan and while I loved her ghetto bumps like \\"Milkshake\\" and \\"Bossy\\" I've been more attracted to her as a dance music artist, her work with Timo Maas in \\"Help Me\\" being my favorite.  Now we have Flesh Tone which is the Kelis album I've always dreamed of.  100% dance/electro futuristic sounding club bangers.  There may only be 9 tracks on the album, but trust me you'll be hearing all of them nonstop this Summer and hopefully for the rest of the year.  This is an ALBUM, it's not just a few singles and fillers.  Every track sounds fantastic on its own, but to really experience it you need to push play and let your stereo work its magic all the way until it finishes.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the already sizzling hits \\"Acapella\\" and \\"4th of July\\" but \\"Brave\\" and \\"22nd Century\\" are also key cuts in my opinion, though like I said, it's an album and really they are all standouts compared to the rubbish top 40 radio is making us digest.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's hard for anybody not to love this album, though it did take some growing for me at first.  I've been a long time dance music fanatic, so I thought I'd instantly be attracted to Acapella and 4th of July when they were singles, but they are different enough, futuristic enough, that I wasn't sure how I felt about them at first.  They're certainly club bangers, but this isn't 4OntheFloor music, if I had to compare it to anything I guess Madonna's [[ASIN:B000B8QEZG Confessions on a Dance Floor]] would be it, but it's very different from that, too.  It really does sound like the mainstream music of the future.  I just hope I don't have to wait 90 years for this to be popular, let's make the future now!

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|Overlong and somewhat contrived, \\"Sex and the City 2\\" feels like a half-dozen episodes strung together. And I could care less. Writer-director Michael Patrick King elicits laughter and poignancy from the continuing saga of Carrie & Company. Judging by box-office returns, the outrageous \\"girls-only\\" trip to Abu Dhabi has broadened the film's international appeal at the expense of its American audience. Despite the obvious lack of sex (not to mention city), fans of the HBO series will not be disappointed. Though a step down from its predecessor, the 146-minute sequel is hardly the fiasco many critics would have you believe - thus making the \\"Ishtar\\" comparisons totally unfounded.
B002UXRGLG|2.0|I LOVE discovery and BBC documentaries.  I've grown up on these things and have watched them evolve from hours upon hours of sharks and crocodiles to the cinematics and photographic technology of Life and Planet Earth.  I was truly looking forward to Life; as I thought Planet Earth was one of the greatest, informative and intriguing series I had seen.  Life, however, completely fell short.  They champion following over 200 species through life and death and survival; from my personal perspective, I thought it completely GLAZED over informative opportunities and that the disconnect in transitions didn't deepen my engagement but allowed me to wander off in thought and activity.  I really was disappointed as I truly am an advocate and champion of the BBC and Discovery.  I recommend you rent before you buy.  Also, if you watch the highlights on the Life website...you've pretty much killed all the 'big' moments.

B000001ESF|5.0|This is a review of the final album in the first phase of Rush, 2112. This is one of my all time favorites in the catalog, and a favorite among many of the fans.<br /><br />2112<br />I - OVERTURE - this is the instrumental that plays the melodies that will be featured in the songs to come, like a true Overture does. this is an excellent beginning to this album.<br />II - THE TEMPLES OF SYRINX - this is the song that features Geddy's wail as the priests, the antagonists of this epic. This is a great straight ahead rocker within this piece.<br />III - DISCOVERY - this shows Alex beginning to \\"learn\\" the guitar, which is the idea behind the story of this wonderful new invention and thing of \\"discovery\\" that the protagonist will show to the world later on. it stars off with tuning, and chord play before the pace begins to pick up.<br />IV - PRESENTATION - This is the main conflict of the epic. Geddy sings in the two styles presented before to represent the priests and the guitar player. the good guy is trying to show how music can be beautiful and magical, and the priests refuse to listen to him, and destroy the guitar at the end of this section.<br />V - ORACLE: THE DREAM - this begins with echo and chorused guitar with a haunting effect. Geddy sings about how the protagonist goes home to sleep off the horrible day. In his dream, he sees a perfect world that existed before the Priests took control.<br />VI - SOLILOQUY - the powerful ballad portion as the protagonist commits suicide. a very powerful Alex solo within this section.<br />VII - GRAND FINALE - it is just that, a culmination of everything on this album up to this point so far building to the huge apex and explosion at the end with the words, \\"Attention all planets of the solar federation. We have assumed control.\\"<br /><br />PASSAGE TO BANGKOK - This is a personal favorite of mine, and has such a great groove along with a slightly Eastern sound to it. being that this has nothing to do with the Epic 2112, this is why this album is NOT considered a concept album, as many people state.<br /><br />THE TWILIGHT ZONE - This has a ghostly intro before it slips into a smooth groove of the verse. It then slows its pace back into the haunting Chorus with an acoustic guitar doubling a clean electric guitar before the heavy riff repeats and the verse groove repeats. This is a great song in my opinion and songs like this are not written anymore.<br /><br />LESSONS - Lyrics by Alex Lifeson - This has a very happy feel to it with the acoustic guitar fading in with the drums and a clean electric doubling the chords. With a syncopated chorus, this song has every bit of the 70's feel and sound, as much as it is the Rush sound.<br /><br />TEARS - Lyrics by Geddy Lee - This is a very sad sounding ballad composed by Geddy with guest musician in the role of Mellotron, before Geddy began his role as a keyboardist in Rush. This again has a very big sound while remaining original to its form and I never get tired of listening to this song.<br /><br />SOMETHING FOR NOTHING - This is the final track on 2112 and the last song of the first Phase of Rush. After this, Phase 2 begins and the sound of Rush changes. This song has a mellow Verse as apposed to the rocking Chorus. Very typical of modern Rock, the 70's and Rush. Straight forward and in your face to end this album on a high note.cept album, as many people state.    THE TWILIGHT ZONE - This has a ghostly intro before it slips into a smooth groove of the verse.

6301971272|5.0|I watched this again for the DVD commentary. Turns out that Clint and the director were at odds in several areas. Clint actually got some residuals from this movie. He didn't like that the explosives were real and was surprised no one got hurt. I didn't realize Eli Wallach was The Ugly (he was the old guy in THE HOLIDAY) and his army doctor background helped with the torture scene. MY GRADE: A minus to A.

I don't want to give the big moment away so I will just leave it at that.  The \\"Aha!\\" moment was done somewhat well but not well enough to get it four stars.

I WOULD RATE THIS ALBUM A NOTCH BELOW THE WHITE ALBUM, WHICH HAD A FEW GOOD SONGS, BUT MOSTLY JUST WEIRD, NO CATCHY TUNES, AND HAS A DEPRESSED OR DOWN TRODDEN FEELING.     I WOULD SAY TO STICK WITH EARLIER MATERIAL, OR GO TO A SITE LIKE YOUTUBE WHERE YOU CAN  SAMPLE THE SONGS FIRST.  THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE SONGS WORTH HAVING ON THIS ALBUM, IN WHICH CASE I'D SAY TO BUY A GREATEST HITS OR BUY SONGS INDIVIDUALLY.  FOR SOME REASON AMAZON DOESN'T LET YOU BUY MP3'S BY THE BEATLES.     NO OFFENSE TO BEATLES DIE HARD FANS THAT CONSUME EVERYTHING THEY DID, BUT QUITE HONESTLY FROM AN OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW, THEY WERE NO LONGER WALKING ON WATER AT THIS POINT IN THIER CAREER.

0545123267|5.0|Grace has always been a lonely and shy girl. Pretty much raising herself because even though her parents technically lives with her, they don't really take care of her. She's the parent figure of the household and I think it kind of describes her well. She is caring, responsible and independent. Ever since she's been attacked by wolves at a younger age, Grace has been fascinated by the wolves roaming the woods behind her house, and one of them is returning the favor. An epic love story, where impossible has a whole new meaning, awaits you within the pages of Shiver, and trust me, you don't wanna miss out.<br /><br />I'd like to start by saying, Shame on me for not picking this book earlier. It. Was. Amazing. Maggie created a very unique werewolf lore, and I'm actually uncomfortable using the word werewolf because it's not really what they are. In this world, humans infected are either humans or wolves and they have no to very little control over their changes. I think the key element to this special lore is that when the \\"werewolf\\" is in wolf form, they are an animal with the instinct that goes with it and none of the human consciousness. And I don't want to ruin the punch, so I won't tell you what triggers the changes =)<br /><br />Maggie knitted awesome characters and I will talk to you about Sam first because surprisingly, I connected more with him than with Grace. Sam is a boy with strong moral and is a pure gentleman, determined to do the right thing at all cost, it will sometime lead to some lovely awkward moments between him and Grace. He also got a very hard past and memories and nightmares are hunting him. His biggest torture is to loose himself when he is a wolf, and he fights it as hard as he can. While Sam is very artistic, Grace is very pragmatic and lives in an organized world. She always tries to find logic behind everything, and of course her logic fails her in a world where boys can turn into wolves. Secondary characters will also take an important role in the plot and while I enjoyed their personality, I kind of wanted to know a bit more about their past, they were all very rooted in the present.<br /><br />Narration switches back and forth between Grace and Sam along the way (and it's always clearly stated at the beginning of every chapter who the narrator is), which reveal a lot more depth to the plot. As you can guess my favorites part were the ones from Sam's point of view, because he is such a sweet-heart, but Grace's parts were equally good if you are not prejudiced. I also appreciated the little flashbacks encountered here and there along the way.<br /><br />Under every chapter's titles the temperature is noted, I thought it was very thoughtfully of Maggie to add this bit of detail as it is so meaningful to the story.<br /><br />Maggie did an awesome job keeping us in unbearable suspense the entire book, not knowing if we'll be granted a happy ending or not (and no I won't tell you!), and I loved her writing. There was this scene in a candy shop when she described it by scent and I could totally picture myself there. Kudos for creating a world so tangible.<br /><br />Shiver is a remarkably well-written epic love story, wrapped in a mysterious and magical lore. Sam & Grace will submerge you by their intensity and I'm sure you will never think of werewolves the same way again.<br /><br />Lucky for me, Linger, the second book in the series, is about to hit the shelves, so I won't have to wait for too long before I can dive in this world again!and while I enjoyed their personality, I kind of wanted to know a bit more about their past, they were all very rooted in the present.

B002OEBMN4|4.0|This is a very solid effort from a band who'd weathered a couple decades, added, subtracted, and re-added members, and made a living in the dark areas with unabashed music that stretched the edges of what would make it on the \\"core\\" hour at the local college station.  \\"Seasons\\" - the song - got some play, but many songs probably weren't knocking anything off the pop charts, even when \\"[x] metal\\" was \\"cool\\" in the 90s.  Too bad, cause their 80s riffage was ridiculous, and if you couldn't handle the truth (and some semi-intended funniness) in the lyrics, too bad for you.  With all absolute respect to those bands, but Metallica was (is!) the Beatles/Stones/Zep of my generation (and a couple others, apparently) and it's great to see them still going.  And Slayer was always Metallica's darker, sketchy older brother, who had scary friends and snuck out all night while you had to stay home.  But subtle differences aside, they laid the groundwork for most anything heard today and to be operating, no less making pretty decent albums, thirty years on, is probably a testament to thrash metal fans, and their persistence in getting other folks, too, to listen and say, damn, that's pretty cool stuff.  Wake you up like a cup of coffee.  And fun, too.    The first four songs are well-constructed Slayer songs that harken back to previous albums, but with a fresh style too.  Dave seems to fit really well on this album and they smoothly trade riffage and drum flourishes in their trademark manner.  \\"WPB\\" and \\"Snuff\\" contain classic riffs, and \\"Beauty Through Order\\" has a great drifty half and full time section that recalls many archetypal moments.  If I had one complaint, it was that the signature palm-mute riff with the great drop in \\"WPB\\" and the sublime verse/chorus first portion of \\"Snuff\\" were not explored further in either a repeat or an outro, even though the songs were decent length.  \\"Snuff\\" seems like it could have used another run through the great galloping verse to drum bombardment chorus (not to mention Dave's fills).  That song is ridiculous, it just ends with you wanting more, more.  The remainder of the album is good, too, not every song might catch every taste, but in terms of a Slayer effort it is all solid music.  Some is a little slower and wandering, but not overall I found, not more than you'd expect.  And not compared to some more recent albums.  Also the lyrics are the requisite treatises on religion and such, but are more tempered and relative to the song than on some recent albums as well, which helped keep the focus more on the quality of the music.  \\"Americon\\" is an interesting kind of dirge that works well, and the album overall is listenable, the last couple tracks slow maybe for a moment, but it's back to a good solid product through eleven songs (on the cd) for a king of the genre - albeit the black sheep, maybe - and after all these years that's saying something.  Hope they can keep it going for a while more - just stretch out some of those riffs!  If they can still sound that good after all this time, don't be afraid to make looong songs.  I'll stand in line to buy it.
B0039TD7PY|1.0|When I played this the DVD has a pause (freezed up) as I watched it. Eventually it continued to play. I enjoyed the music I was just disappointed that the DVD didn't play through like it should have.
B001HN694K|4.0|When I first started watching this movie I thought oh no, not another Tim Burton dull colorless dreary movie.  After about 15 minutes I was shocked that a world of color opened up and I was enthralled.  The characters were odd but a perfect fit in this outrageous world of \\"Underland\\".  Johnny Depp was a character that you thought was crazy and sweet at the same time.  Alice was just stand offish enough to fit in the world but then grew her character to become the heroine.  All in all, a very enjoyable movie with colors and delights that I wouldn't imagine could exist in a Tim Burton film.
B002ZG997C|2.0|The movie opens with Denzel killing a cat for dinner in this post apocalyptic odyssey that left me feeling like I wasted 2 hours of my life that I will never get back, by watching this waste of time.<br /><br />I was really not knowing what to think as I started watching this movie, then Denzel comes across a women by a cart and knows something is wrong. He can smell the band of thugs waiting for him. Denzel starts kicking ass as a band of idiots try to take his pack. He quickly, too quickly in fact, takes his knife and chops off the man's hand. It was life he moved faster than humanly possible.<br /><br />He kills all of them except for the woman who was there to set him up. He keeps walking and ends up in this town that is run by Gary Oldman's character. He's in charge of the town and has a blind women and her grown daughter who he keeps as his property.<br /><br />Denzel goes into the bar to get some water and pisses off one of the guys in the bar by shooing away this nasty white cat. Denzel again ends up killing just about everyone who tries to stop him from leaving the bar, which is a whole handful of people.<br /><br />Gary Oldman's character is sending his thugs out to look for a specific book that we later find out Denzel's Character, Eli has. We don't find out that the book is actually the bible until about half way through the movie.<br /><br />Eli makes it to where he says a voice told him to go. Are we to believe that the voice of god told him to keep going west for 30 years? He's been walking for 30 years before he finally makes it to the island of Alcatraz and finds people that are starting over by using a press to make books and keeping treasures like paintings and such things.<br /><br />The bible Eli has is given to Gary Oldman's character after Eli is shot by him. But when he gets back and gets the lock undone, he finds the bible is in brail and his girl that is blind won't read it for him.<br /><br />Eli has memorized the entire bible and tells a man what it said as he writes it down and then Eli does.<br /><br />The other thing about this movie that made no sense what so ever was everyone made everyone else they came in contact with shows their hands didn't shake. because if your hands shook, it meant you were eating human flesh, but that storyline was never really given much thought and it was never explained.<br /><br />This movie was a two hour snore fest that left me feeling dirty because of the self righteous religious aspects being forced down my throat.<br /><br />All in all, this movie was a waste of time and I would give it less than one star if I could. Don't waste your time, pick something else to watch.man what it said as he writes it down and then Eli does.<br /><br />The other thing about this movie that made no sense what so ever was everyone made everyone else they came in contact with shows their hands didn't shake. because if your hands shook, it meant you were eating human flesh, but that storyline was never really given much thought and it was never explained.<br /><br />This movie was a two hour snore fest that left me feeling dirty because of the self righteous religious aspects being forced down my throat.<br /><br />All in all, this movie was a waste of time and I would give it less than one star if I could.

B000002ULO|3.0|I'd been trying to by this cd for years. I knew many of the songs but I couldn't figure out what cd they belonged to. Well, I found it at amazon and I finally bought it.<br />It was quick and easy and the package arrived right on time. My favorite song is Calico skies but the cd is not bad.<br />I'm happy with my purchase.
030726999X|2.0|I got hooked by the first two books in the Steig Larsson trilogy, and looked forward to the third. Did the author write this himself? It was quite flat, full of descriptive government details that did nothing to further the story. The dynamite narrative drive of the other two books was barely alive. Sad...I wanted more character interest, more plot, more on Salander. I felt a sense of let-down. The book seemed less than average. I know Larsson's readers are a loyal group, but this last one left me very lukewarm.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|The DVD arrived earlier than I thounght and in perfect conditions.<br />I love this movie. And I'm glad I have it in my library now.<br />Wonderful job.
0743437497|3.0|*Spoilers Ahead*    \\"The Shining\\" is not my favorite among Stephen King's early novels; I thought \\"Carrie\\" was much more interesting as a character study, and \\"'Salem's Lot\\" was more frightening. Of course, that doesn't mean \\"The Shining\\" is a bad book. It isn't. Overall it succeeds as entertainment and holds up pretty well to a second reading.   So what's the problem? After establishing the characters, King gets off to an excellent start by giving the reader a glimpse of the Overlook Hotel's troubled history--but then, frustratingly, abandons this promising path in favor of increasingly clunky descriptions of the hotel's possessed topiary (the hedge lions just didn't work for me, no matter how laboriously King wrote about them) and Jack Torrance's psychosis. I would have welcomed a bit more detail about the shady dealings of Horace Derwent and his Mafia associates. Nonetheless, the book does conjure some genuine scares--especially in the passages about the dead woman who inhabits Room 217.  As I've said, I prefer \\"Carrie\\" and \\"'Salem's Lot\\", but if you're a fan of Stephen King in general (and of his early work in particular) you'll naturally want to own \\"The Shining\\", too. Personally, I found it underwhelming and feel that King went on to write a much more engaging and nearly perfect horror novel with \\"Pet Sematary\\".
B003HE2B6C|5.0|For many people nowadays Hanson seems to be treated like a taboo in the music world, which I personally don't understand. Tell anyone you listen to Hanson and they get a funny look on their face that you know is linked to a picture of long-haired boys singing Mmmbop on rollerblades back in 1997, but the truth is that Hanson is so much more than Mmmbop, and this album is the perfect example of this.     Shout It Out is a shout out to the good kind of oldies music that all music of the last four-five decades has stemmed from, the soulful, R & B of yesteryear with talented and fun musicians such as Sam & Dave and Otis Redding. There are fun tunes throughout the album such as Waiting for This, the even fun scavenger hunt of musical references that is Thinking 'Bout Somethin' (which has a music video taken almost directly from the 1980 Saturday Night Live classic film The Blues Brothers starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi), saxophone-enhanced Give a Little, Musical Ride and Voice in the Chorus. There is of course a nice balance between upbeat songs and the slow ballads added into the mix, filling the album with a nice alternation of ups and downs but all soulful, thoughtful lyrics and attention to detail from each drumbeat to the icing on the cake: the horn section.    Music fans of all ages will enjoy this well executed album from a band that has been honing their musical talents together for more than a decade and a half and producing albums for the public for thirteen years. This is a great album for road trips, for background music, and for just listening to. I did not listen to Hanson much before this album, but I cannot hear enough of Shout It Out.    Warning: Songs will get stuck in your head.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Kylie Minogue brings us her latest CD titled Aphrodite, and it is a great dance album. The first single is the beautiful \\"All The Lovers\\" which is a soft dance club hit with a strong electronic backdrop. I have to say I have not enjoyed a Kylie album as much as this since Fever and X. Although Aphrodite is not as strong as Fever or X, it does shine despite a few of its weak tracks. The best songs on the album are All The Lovers, Illusion, Better Than Today, Too Much, Cupid Boy, and Looking For An Angel. The album is reminds me of Madonnas Confessions On A Dancefloor probably due to the same producer who worked on both albums. I hope Kylie gets some love from the U.S. because this is a change from the same old boaring music on radio today. This is a fun album with some great dance music.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|Although the product was great (how could it not be) the packaging was in bad shape. I don't expect to pay good money for something that's going to come out of the shipping container in three pieces. Not Amazon's fault, but one of their suppliers.
0739384171|5.0|I have a 40 minute commute and books on CD are a savior for me.  I read \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" the old fashioned way and became hooked on the series.  It was a pleasure to \\"read\\" the second book while I was driving to work.  These Stieg Larsson books are addicting.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I purchased this and the JL Childress Bottles and Bags organizer. I kept this and returned the other immediately. This holds water bottles, large reusable bottles and fast food style cups easily. The sraps are adjustable making it easy to tighten to hold heavier items. The open space in the middle can hold more drinks or keys, cellphone, etc. and the zippered pocket in the rear is also a great feature. We have a the Peg Perego Aria twin and use this just on one side, and it doesn't get in the way when opening and folding the stroller (trust me we just came back from Disney). Plus, you can't beat the price! Great purchase.
1400052173|5.0|What an absolutely fabulous book, written in the fashion of a fiction story.  All the scientific information is written for the general public and is easy to understand.  The short life of Henrietta Lacks is terribly sad, yet her unknowing contributions to the scientific community and advances in medicine somehow have made her family glad.  Nevertheless, the monetary gains by many labs that grow Henrietta's cells today have never helped her poor family who couldn't even afford insurance.  The argument still rages regarding discarded body parts and biopsied pieces and whether the patient has a right to allow them to be used for research or whether they still belong strictly to the patient who has a right to say NO.  Unfortunately, our biopsies are still taken and are probably in labs without our knowledge since these pieces are considered \\"garbage throw aways.\\"      Sadly, privacy is the only thing now covered, but I doubt that will even remain as it is with cell-gathering, especially with the upcoming Obamacare allowing the government in all your medical business.  We are truly doomed.    Wonderful book, get it and read it or listen to it on CD...
030726999X|5.0|I loved all of Steig Larsson's books but I thought 'Hornet's Next' was the best.

B000JLQSWE|5.0|For you Alan Parsons Projcet fans out there, here is a great CD to check out!  \\"Vulture Culture\\", their eighth album originally released in 1985.  It's a concept album that's all about people taking advantege of other people at their expences.  In other words like, the rich taking advantage of the poor.  Think of today's news, and you'll know what I'm getting at.  \\"Vulture Culture\\" is all about the world that has become more predatory.  For example of the news today, big corporations, big oil, embezzlement, ponzy schemes, foreclosures, lack of trust, etc. etc.  Even what The A.P. Project was saying back in 1985, the songs have messages that still say of what the world has become today.  In addition to the eight original tracks, there are five bonus tracks that include demos, alternate mixes, first takes and more giving you an inside depth of the making of \\"Vulture Culture\\".  The earlier years saw a lot of American radio play from The Alan Parsons Project, but what has become the way musical tastes were changing in the mid 1980's, \\"Vulture Culture\\" and later LP's would not match the success of their earlier albums and Top 40 radio stations were not playing Alan Parsons' music anymore in favor of other artists who have grabbed more attention in the spotlight.  Take a listen to \\"Vulture Culture\\" and judge for yourself if you think this should have gotten some radio airplay.
030745455X|5.0|The book I purchased came almost immediately! Totally thrilled with the seller - thank you....<br /><br />I had read the first book of this series so was well informed as to the type of reading this would be - fabulous story - will be purchasing the third in the series.
0307266303|5.0|I picked up this book after several people that I train with had recommended it.  I read it and I found it to be absolutely inspirational.  I have always grown up with a distaste for running.  I played basketball, volleyball and jiu jitsu because they all involved as little running as possible.  After reading this book, all I want to do is get out and run a marathon.  The story just for the sake of the story is entertaining and captivating.  I cracked open the book one Saturday morning with the intention of getting my feet wet with the first chapter.  6 or 7 chapters later I was almost late for my kickboxing class because I didn't want to put it down.      The book itself mixes anecdotes, side-stories and facts in with the main storyline; all of which I found spellbinding.  I can understand how a couple of the chapters (which get longer as the book goes on) towards the end could be boring to some people.  Particularly the chapter on the evolution of human beings as a running species.  All in all though a fantastic book.      Contrary to a belief that seems to be going around, this book is not plugging an agenda for Vibram's FiveFingers shoes, though they are mentioned on a few occasions since one of the characters is sponsored by them.  The Tarahumara themselves run in sandals and (I believe) all the other characters in the book run in sandals or shoes.  I may be wrong, but only because the footwear of the characters is hardly a blip on the map.      A great read for anyone, and I'd imagine even better if you're a runner.  Do yourself a favor and read this book, then go for a nice run.  It's what you were born to do.
B003GDYN24|3.0|First,let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of kelis and have been for a while,I have all of her albums. What i've always admired about her is her sense of style,her individualism,and most importantly her music.    Now on to the album im going to have to say I am disappointed in the finished product.When acapella first came out I completely fell in love with it but in all honestly the complete album just seems a little unfinished and thrown together.Kelis has always given me original lyrics,unique topics with her beautiful(to me) voice on top.But this album just doesnt cut the cake for me.I kind of feel cheated as a fan.Some of the topics on this album are a little juvenille,I would expect this from someone who doesnt have as much of an artistic perspective as kelis. The lyrics are a little juvenille as well because what she considers chorus on some of the songs is just her repeating the same lyrics over and over again. And last but not least her albums usually have a little bit more length to them...nine songs?I really wish she'd added just a couple more tracks...    So why did I give this album three stars? Mainly because of the fact it still had a nice sense of creativity and the way that each songs flows into the next is insanely accomplished. I also think that the album concept and vibe is really cool as well and some of the songs have something about them that you cant help but enjoy.I also gave this album three stars because I just can't help but still give this girl her credit even if im disappointed because I love her so much. After all i'd heard the album long before it came out and still went out an purchased a copy to support her. And after a few spins I've actually grown to like it a lot more than I did during the first couple of spins.  So my advice is if you are a kelis fan buy this album because you will be able to appreciate it but if you are not a kelis fan i wouldn't chance it.    FAVS:  Acapella(of course)  Home   Intro  Brave

B003HARV3Y|5.0|I never knew much about the Percy Jackson series before watching this film.  Based on what I saw in the commercials, however, I went into this film with the prejudice that it would be a corny, wannabe Harry Potter movie.  Boy, was I wrong!  What I liked most about this movie is that it is FUNNY.  Among all the antics and adventures that the kids get themselves into, there are a lot of jokes among the action that keep you entertained.  The actor who plays Grover, Percy's best friend, definitely delivered many laughs.  I was quite surprised to see how talented the young actors were- each actor only made me more engrossed in the movie and there was no awkwardness in how the actors delivered their lines.  All the actors (adult and child alike) had great chemistry.  I also found the plot to be fresh and entertaining and I retract my statement that this would be a wannabe Harry Potter movie. I now think that the Percy Jackson series stands on it's own as a fun fantasy film for families.  I SINCERELY HOPE THERE ARE SEQUELS TO THIS GREAT FILM! As a novice in Greek mythology, I enjoyed learning new and interesting facts about Greek mythology throughout this film.  The plot is simple and light (by which I mean not too much blood and gory and dark issues being discussed) and something that a family (or just anyone) can sit down and enjoy.  I will say that the issue of drinking and (slightly) abuse are discussed, but things wrap up beautifully, so no problem there. :) There was also some slight sexual content in this film (cleavage bearing females) but it is NOT the focus of the film. This content does not last long so just skip ahead a few seconds in the film.  All in all, between all the action and laughs and sweet friends/family moments, you will be thoroughly entertained.  Isn't that what a movie is all about, anyway?
B002ZCDR88|1.0|What a disappointment for one of the greatest voices or our time to have wasted her talents on LEAVE YOUR SLEEP!  If you're the type of person who's into Broadway Musicals you might enjoy this album.  If you loved Ophelia and TigerLilly as I did then you will probably hate most of the songs on this album.  Natalie, You're much better than this!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|With my 9350e, the heatsink alone with the stock fans in my Antec 300 case keep it plenty cool.  Which is a good thing, because when I bought this cooler in late 2009, the included fan mounting mechanism was a complete and utter failure.  I've been building my PCs for 20 years.  This was the most frustrating fan installation I've ever... EVER, gone through.    If you look in the stock pictures, you'll see little silver clips that hook onto the heatsink.  These are devil's fingers, and about as much fun as an Alabama fan in October.  No amount of mounting, remounting, cussing, praying, or lizard sacrifice would make these damn things attach.  I suspect something happened in manufacturing that caused them to be sized incorrectly.  Not that this would have made the original solution a good idea, but would have provided an excuse.    I currently have zip ties keeping the fan on, and it's not pretty.  The fan on my model is slow and quiet, just how you want them.  Hurts worse than usual if you get a finger caught in there, though.    That said, in the customer shots, you can see what I presume are the replacement clips, which are black.  While I can't vouch for them, it seems like they've gone well for other customers.  I like that the cooler is proc agnostic, is fairly priced, and does its job.
B002C1BHIO|2.0|I am willing to concede that my problem might be the cheep dvd player I am using this on, but the result I found was that the good quality rca cables that I had on gave a more clear and vibrant color picture.  I really thought the HDMI was going to be the bomb, but after switching back and forth several times, I ended up putting the HDMI cable back in the box and leaving it the way it was.  If anyone has a suggestion for me, I'm willing to hear it.
1416972242|5.0|I give this book 5/5 stars. This book continues in the same vein of City of Bones, but adding layers of suspense and mystery. This book is enthralling as you learn more about the characters and their relationships deepen. There are many changes in this book-some temporary, and some eternal. This is the perfect book to intensify the storylines until they come to a thrilling climax in City of Glass (Mortal Instruments)(Book 3). I would highly recommend this book.
0385341008|4.0|I picked up this book in an airport book store on the way back from a very long flight on April 1, 2010, and I just now finished it on July 6, 2010. I am interested in WWII stories, so I thought it would be a great read (and a great read it was!). This book is perfect if you are looking for a heartwarming read during your winter or summer break.<br /><br />If you are going to read this book, read large chunks of it at a time, or read the book in one or two sittings. It can easily be done in one or two days. I spent a good part of the first half picking this book up and putting it down to read for later. As the novel has several different voices, and several days or even weeks (two to three) would pass before I picked it up again, the relationships between the letter writers and the identities of the letter writers themselves confused me a bit, which is why I give the book four stars out of five. I would imagine that would have been different had I not waited so long in between readings.<br /><br />The pace of the first half was somewhat slow as I was trying to figure out who the writers are exactly and their relationships to one another. Once I had these lines drawn, though, the story carried me through pretty quickly. About two-thirds of the way into the first half, I was hooked by the characters and stories of the inhabitants of the island. Today I read the entire second half of the book in a couple of hours. Overall, some letters were very moving and left me in tears, and some made me laugh out loud. The characters are quite charming, and I myself fell in love with Guernsey and its fictional inhabitants.<br /><br />In addition to the presentation of life during and post WWII, the novel also explores the power of the arts and its ability to reach out and touch us and create community.  The book club helped the inhabitants of the island thrive in the midst of a dark time--not only because of the books, but also because of the community between the readers.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|Being from the US, I wasn't introduced to Kylie as early as many of her fans in the rest of the world. Once I heard the 'Fever' album I was hooked. After 'X' I really didn't think I would like another album as much as I did that. She's gone ahead and proved me wrong with 'Aphrodite' though! There is not one track that I do not love. I can honestly say this is one of only a few albums I own, of any artists, that I can listen to on repeat without skipping a single song. This is definitely Kylie at her finest...great dance and pop, highly recommended!
B0039TD7RC|4.0|This is a 5 star album, enough said, and said quite eloquently in other reviews.    So this just leaves a series of unanswered questions about this remaster/rerelease:    Why no historical notes/critical appreciation like on the Beatles remasters?  Why no lyrics sheet?  Why choose not to give us a full reproduction of the original packaging?  Why not, on disc two, since there's plenty of space, also provide us with un-retouched versions of the 5 tracks Jagger 'finished'? I'm not saying Mick did a bad job, but really, why not give us both???    I guess what I'm asking is, why not give us the full 5 star product this album (and the work that went into the remastering) so richly deserves? Well?
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I was amazed at how well the blu-ray version has enhanced the colour quality. For a movie this old i was impressed with the picture and sound quality.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|As Steven Spielberg observes in the bonus matter, the fourth Indy film almost never got made at all, and we probably have Harrison Ford to thank for the fact that it did.  Ford, 66 when the movie came out, is a little heavier now, a little softer around the jawline, a little grizzled, but he clearly shows that he still has what it takes to recreate one of his most beloved characters.  The year is 1957, and Indy, after a distinguished career in World War II (he served in the OSS and attained the rank of Colonel) and several \\"years spyin' on the Commies,\\" is kidnapped by a task-force of Russians headed up by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett in an inky-black Prince Valiant haircut) to help them find a set of \\"mummified remains\\" which he helped study 10 years earlier (most viewers will guess at its connection to the famous \\"Area 51\\" case, and indeed the warehouse the gang crashes is so emblazoned; one wonders if the Ark of the Covenant is in there too).  Though he's unable to prevent them from getting away with their swag, Indy soon finds himself drawn back into the case when a motorcycle-riding youngster who calls himself Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) approaches him and explains that his foster father (John Hurt), an old schoolmate of Indy's, has disappeared into the jungles of South America in a bid to return a mysterious artifact to its proper resting place.  Mutt's mother is also among the missing, and he fears she and Prof. Oxley are in danger.  Which they are, because Spalko and her followers aren't just looking for remains.    Reuniting Ford, Spielberg, George Lucas, Karen Allen, John Williams, and various other key figures in the Indy saga, this may be the best of the entire series.  There are so many fantastic scenes I can't even begin to decide which was my favorite, yet none of them have the grue of Satipo's death or the melting Nasties, I mean Nazis, from [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]].  The pace barely lets upfor a moment--there are just enough quieter moments to give you a chance to catch your breath between crises--and the SFX are, of course, incomparable.  You may also want to read the novelization[[ASIN:0545007011 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]] and buy the soundtrack CD [[ASIN:B00171MNM4 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]].
B00005UKKF|4.0|This is probably one of my favorite Britney Concert specials she did.  I really enjoyed this DVD.  I would recommend it to anybody!  I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it lacked Bonus material, actually it had none at all.  I think it would have been a little better with behind the scenes or something like that featured on the menu.  Over all I enjoyed the concert.  I was glad to add this to my collection.  This is definitely for any Britney Collector/Fan!
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Have seen the movie several times. I like the movie but I bought it for my son. Movie came within the timeframe that was stated had no problems with the movie. I would buy from this seller again.
B00005RDRO|5.0|For all the fans of crime and noir movies, here comes one of the best satire's on the whole genre. Murder by Death is by far the funniest spoof on noir/mystery genre I have seen. Paying no respect to the stalwarts of the genre and taking the piss out of all and sundry, this movie should really rank up there in the noir-parody movies of all time. Made in 1976 by Robert Moore, in what could really be made into a sweet theatrical play, this is a forgotten classic.    Lionel Twain (played by Truman Capote no less), a bored/lonely/twisted oldman invites five of the world's top most private-eyes to dinner at his country mansion. One of the detectives will be murdered right after dinner but nobody who is being picked. The murder will occur before 12.00AM, and who ever solves the murder will be payed $1 million. But Twain does not show up at the dinner, preferring to talk through a taxidermy animal head trophy stuck on the wall. He keeps dropping hints and raising allegations, while giving his announcements, as the guests have their dinner. Naturally, all the guests are agitated but since they are the best detectives in the world, they rise up to the challenge of solving the mystery of who is going to be killer. As the night progresses, we are treated to high doses of hilarious dark humor. The only maids in the mansion are the blind butler (blind, why? since he was cheap to hire) and the deaf/dumb cook. Comedy of errors and comedy of terrors ensue as we get closer to midnight. Low, the butler is murdered, and Twain disappears. The ending will have you in splits, since its easily the most ludicrous parody of events.    Some of the finest acting is provided by Peter Sellers in his role as the \\"China-man\\" Sidney Wang, who strives hard to construct a sentence with an article, much to the chagrin of the well-bred Twain. Sidney Wang cracked me up when ever he opened his mouth. Also special mention to Pete Falk's Sam Diamond, a no-nonsense street smart, tough guy, who loves keeping naked pictures of musclemen in his closet, don't ask me why. This is truly a mad mad movie that will have you laugh all your worries away...2 thumbs up!
B003IPC5UC|5.0|This CD is FUN!! If you are in a bad mood this cd will put a smile on your face and make you wanna dance. Not a bad track on the CD. I do hope that Kylie will get some love from the US market with this CD as it is one of the best out there at the moment.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|Like many viewers, I'd read the book Eclipse before seeing the movie. I also read 'the short second life of bree tanner' (see my review on).    What Was Different From the Book; Some events were rushed or out of order. Bella's graduation was pretty short. The scene where Jacob 'kidnaps' her from school wasn't as dramatic as in the book (darn!). There were some short scenes from 'Bree Tanner' but certainly not the whole novella (no Diego or Freaky Fred).There were also a few additional scenes that showed Riley becoming a vampire and how Victoria manipulates him. What bothered me most was that we don't see how much the scent of Bella's blood tortures Bree - an important scene in the book.    What Was the Same; The akward 'sex talk' Charlie tries to have with Bella when he thinks she and Edward are 'doing it.' Brilliantly done, the entire theater was laughing hysterically and clapping. Aside from many scenes being out of order, the book was followed very well. Nothing was changed drastically, only a few scenes were added to illustrate what was going on. Victoria is now played by Bryce Dallas Howard; the wide-eyes and childish voice she uses may seem out of character for a vampire,but if you've read the book you'll be haunted by how perfectly the role is played.   More Info; I really liked this movie. It had a lot of laughs without being phony, exciting, and the acting has gotten much better.    For Parents; There are sexual references and an almost sex scene. The violence isn't bad, the dead vampires look like broken procelin, no guts. The goriest thing we see is a fire with blackened shapes in it (the dead vampires burning)   Without futhur ado...GO SEE THE MOVIE!!! I will write about the DVD format when I purchase it.BTW, since this is a happy (but expensive) time of year etc, I may wait a few months before buying/renting the DVD. Sorry if this causes inconvienience. If I hear anything along the lines of great special features or malfunctioning DVDs I'll let you know!! Sorry I haven't done this yet, I haven't had time to watch it but when I do I WILL update this.
B001FB5634|1.0|I am a big fan of apocalyptic stories and movies and I must sadly report that this one is not worth the time. There is no clue as to what disaster has befallen the protagonists. There is no semblance of survival beyond walking to the coast in hopes that the ocean is \\"still blue\\" (like on the map) and avoiding cannibals. The only color you will see in this bleak tale is the bloody chopping blocks of what is presumably a cannibal's kitchen. I found myself wishing it would end after about the first five minutes.
B003K05DQS|5.0|This movie was amazing!!! I saw it with my 11 year old kid and it taught him a lot about the iraqi war.  Although the few scenes with inapropriate language I thought this movie was a great way to teach children about the war.  5 Stars!!!!
0307474712|3.0|I enjoyed the book overall, but did find myself having quite a few times where I just needed to put it down for awhile and do something else because I was getting a bit bored.  I liked the concept and Nicholls does a fine job with painting a picture of what has happened throughout the year in each chapter so you don't get completely lost.  I found myself annoyed with Dexter (the male lead) so many times.  I have a feeling Nicholls does this on purpose, but it got grating.  I really enjoyed the female lead character, Emma, throughout the book.  This is probably because she is less \\"flawed\\".  I'll be interested to see it when it becomes a movie (as is rumored to happen), mostly to see how they handle jumping from each year while also managing to give explanation to whats been happening outside of that particular day.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Even though I already had some of the earlier Beatles CDs, I have been saving money to buy the complete set with updated audio.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  Amazon had a great price, and I felt confident that I would receive a new and authorized version.

030745455X|4.0|After reading the first book I was slightly hesitant about picking up the second in the series. I found the plot for the first one interesting yet slightly predictable. However, I did not get that with this the second book of the series. The first book is a complete story all on its own making it a good base story in the trilogy to introduce the characters and give a base history which they can look back upon. The second book on the other hand, this book, begins the story that will take up the next two books in the trilogy. I have only read the first two and will reading the third shortly.<br /><br />The book takes up a year after the end of the first book and tells of how Slander has been traveling about, while Mikael has a sudden infusion into his career from the events of the first book. From there the story just takes off with many things happening that lead to the most unlikely of circumstances with Slander wanted for murder and Mikael on his way to prove her innocence.<br /><br />The book in my opinion is better than the first, yet the first did a good job establishing the characters. Unlike the first book, this one I found wild and unpredictable and truly enjoyed the ride as it went. The book had a good amount of twist and turns but was not to obvious with the desire to \\"keep me hanging.\\" The characters showed very good development and I feel that Larson did a good job with the tension of the love affair mixed with the the business respect that the two main characters showed for each other.<br /><br />The cons of this book or small but there are two which I will point out. The first is that much like the first novel, I had a hard time getting into it. Although, I place this as a con, I also feel that our culture is much to wrapped up in immediate gratification and find that many of the great stories of the past could have this very same con, so I will not go spend any more time. The second thing that I felt was a con was the amount of sex and sex talk among really, all of the characters. I know that many times authors do this to keep people moving with the book. I don't think that this book needed as much of it as Larson placed in it, it did require some, the type of characters demanded it as a subject to come up, but the amount Larson used was well more than enough and found it to be a distraction. Along these same lines, and this might be just an ignorant American thing, but I saw the contrasting feminist and homophobic character development of some of the investigators was almost over done and could have been done a lot more subtly and to a better effect, but then again what do I know, maybe in Sweden that is the way it is.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book, and hopefully, when I am done with the third and the completion, I will recommend that one as well.racters.

0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor is a book that holds your attention to the point you don't want to put it down. It reveals a picture of the Navy Seals that is amazing and intriguing. I had no idea of their training or their commitment to our country and to one another.
B002ZG983M|5.0|All those who have their panties in a bunch because this movie did what so many other super-heroes failed to do should stick with reading Golden Age comics. This is one of my favorite comic book movies and definitely the best movie of 2010. I read the graphic novel prior to watching the movie and I loved both equally. Everyone in it was cast perfectly even the sort of bland Nick Cage as Big Daddy. The changes in the plot for the movie worked well and I cannot wait to read the next installment and hopefully the next movie.
B000F8O35U|1.0|We ordered this DVD so we could entertain our kids on a trip to Florida.  My wife noticed that the packaging looked a little weird and faded but didn't think much about it until she opened the cover.  She immediately noticed that the disk had small scratches everywhere and upon further inspection, the DVD's had very poor image quality on the labels and the word \\"Disk\\" was actually spelled \\"DESK\\"!!  Not on one dvd but both of them!! WE loaded the DVD into our van DVD player and it wouldn't even play.  Needless to say we where very upset the DVD was fake.  I emailed the seller when we returned and she immediately made things right.  She fully refunded us for the price of the DVD and shipping costs.  I would do business with them again because I don't think they had any idea the DVD was fake.  It was in clear packaging and they never opened it.
B002VPE1X4|4.0|This is a very nice case.  It arrives flat and expands from there.  Empty, it is 5 1/2\\" long X 4\\" wide.  It is big enough to handle most compact point and shoot cameras.  I have a Canon Elph that has plenty of swim around in there, but the case is so lightweight and thin that its size is alright.  The outside pocket is  plenty big to hold whatever battery or camera cards you might have.  Again it is flat unless full, so it is not obtrusive and you wouldn't even know it was there when empty.      The velcro holding the belt strap is very secure.  The velcro flap on the front also does a nice job of securing it. Compared to my LowePro camera bag, that fits the camera really well (bag is 3\\" wide x 5\\" long), this AmazonBasics bag is much less bulky, heavy or cumersome, but offers about equal protection.  For an inexpensive bag, it does all it needs to.  Only thing is that it might be a bit large for some of the really small cameras.
B0026IQFS0|5.0|Like I said in the title, this series is dense. Not only is it long (21 volumes in the set), but it's chock full of historically-accurate references to people, places, and things. So much so that the first volume (reviewed here) is a little rough to get into. But push through it and you'll be rewarded with a series you just cannot put down. The two main characters are ones that will be your friends forever.    If you're completely new to historical fiction or this set, keep in mind that it's written around the era of the French revolution, and all the perspective is from the sea. If you want to read about the same era with an equally delightful series--but from the perspective of the battles on land--pick up the works by Bernard Cornwell that feature Sharpe and Harper. That series starts with \\"Sharpe's Rifles.\\" It's more accessible, so to speak, in that it's easier to get into.    A third series is the Hornblower by C. S. Forester. It's the lightest of the three, but also good.    Finally, if you really get into this, buy \\"A Sea of Words\\" by Dean King. It's \\"A Lexicon and Companion for Patrick O'Brian's Seafaring Tales.\\"
B002ZG997C|5.0|i thought it was great i loved the images of the movie denzel was great of course his acting is always good i loved this movie probably not for everone but still a great watch.

B003NX76BM|3.0|The Search is a fairly typical Nora Roberts book.  You have the heroine (Fiona), the not-looking-for-love male (Simon), and the depraved criminal.  The characters are fairly well-developed (although not her best), and the relationship between Fiona and Simon has the some of the tension that we've come to expect from the author, but this book is nothing novel.  If you liked Nora Roberts' recent books, then The Search won't surprise you, but it's definitely not among her best works.
B003L16FAE|5.0|Predator is an awesome action flick of the 80's period. When I started collecting Blu-Rays Predator was one of the first titles I wanted. The first Blu-Ray had absolutely nothing on it so it was probably a rental at best. I never bought the first Blu-Ray anyway. Thankfully for the upcoming Predators movie, Fox put out this Ultimate Hunter Edition that truly lives to its name. It comes with just about every feature from the 2-disc DVD set of Predator. Not to mention a picture quality that's worth the disc's weight in gold. The jungle's environments have never looked better and the special effects are beautiful on Blu-Ray. The audio, it'll knock your speakers out and that's about it. Overall, Predator is amazing on Blu-Ray so trash the first Blu-Ray and get this UH Edition.     Also to add on, I hope Fox puts out great Blu-Ray editions of the Alien series The Abyss, and True Lies as these are great films that never saw Blu-Ray yet for now.
0786856297|5.0|My children, ages 11-14 all loved the movie and agreed that the book was even better!
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Sounding as many other reviews have said like a band from the 70's in the same vein as Zeppelin or Sabbath yet having their own distinct sound at the same time. Its truly amazing to have a band put out an album like this in todays day and age with all the crap the radio works on feeding us. I was completely blown away by this album. Quiet refreshing. I love the psychedelic feel .The only negative I can think of which is there is no lead. If they got a great lead guitarist wow they would be even more amazing. I dont get normally this excited about a new band. Maybe they will wear off after a while but I doubt it. I havent grown tired yet with repeated listens for weeks now.  Highly Recommended!
B002ZG977Y|1.0|If they would have stuck with the original story line it would not have been so bad(maybe. But I was very dissapointed, there version made no since. The original may have been campy but it way better than this mess!!!

B00004X01U|5.0|I'm not normally a huge electronica fan, but I did like this CD.  It has just enough of that kind of sound to make the music interesting and unlike that normally played on pop radio, but the songs aren't too weird either.  I really liked all of them.
0981951244|5.0|The Compound Effect is not another \\"success in a bottle\\" book, but a handbook for creating your own strategy for acheivement.

0312330537|2.0|This book came highly recommended and the back cover and first few sentences of the story hooked me, but for me, it did not hold up.  I could find no discernible plot.  It jumped from one \\"remembrance\\" to another.  It also seemed like a philosophy book thrown in.  It became a little laughable how almost every referral to Carla started with one of her wise sayings.  Toward the beginning of the book, I enjoyed reading about an entirely different culture, but those insights drifted off and never really returned.  After about 500 pages, I looked longingly at the unread books on my bookshelf.  I had to keep going with Shantaram, however. because I picked it for our Book Club.  I hope I'm not tossed out after our next get together!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|At full price, this item is worth every penny.  That I got it for less than half price from a seller makes it an even better purchase.<br /><br />First of all, the seller, Source Media Group, was great. The item was fulfilled by Amazon, so my Prime benefits applied and the product was like new, just as it was listed.  I'm very happy with the transaction and the seller.<br /><br />The DVD content is just outstanding, which is to be expected from such a much-lauded television show.  Some of the footage is simply unbelievable and I find myself being awed and amazed every time I watch.  Some of this is information you know and some of it is brand new; part of the appeal of this set is the learning opportunity it creates for adults and kids alike.<br /><br />I have watched this set with people ranging in age from 9 to 50 and everyone enjoys it.  It's also a go-to; when there's nothing new out on disc and nothing good on television, I know I'll find this entertaining and engaging.<br /><br />Yes, it's long, but it's a big world, right?  I can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of Planet Earth and I really think every home and classroom (at least, every science classroom) should have this set.  Of particular interest: the caribou migration on disc one and all of the undersea stuff.<br /><br />This entire DVD set is a don't miss, must have piece of work for pretty much everyone.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The best TV show ever to be cancelled! I was waiting for this to come out in the UK but I couldn't wait any longer so I imported it through amazon.com.  Luckily I didn't get charged import tax either!
B003JZT2AW|4.0|Having already owned every OASIS album, I was hesitant to plunk down the cash for this set as there was quite a bit of confusion about what was actually in the box, compared to the \\"standard\\" CD edition (or for that matter, the \\"deluxe\\" iTunes version). After a bit of detective work, I think I got it figured out .....    AMAZON lists 27 tracks as the CD portion of the box set. That list of 27 mirrors the standard 2-CD set, with \\"Champagne Supernova\\" kicking off disc two. But that track is NOT on CD's in the box. That leaves 26 \\"titles\\" as shown on the cardboard sleeves housing the discs in the box. However, \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" is included at the end of disc two, but not listed (a \\"hidden track\\". MY, how original!), so, the bottom line is that you get the 27 UK singles. If you want to have \\"Champagne Supernova\\" on your copy of \\"Time Flies\\", you need to get the standard 2-CD US release, or the iTunes bundle. Speaking of iTunes, that bundle lists 27 titles, including \\"Champagne Supernova\\"; however, a quick look at the running time (approaching 12 minutes) on the set's last cut \\"Falling Down\\", makes it obvious that the \\"hidden\\" track is there as well, so you'd get 28 \\"songs\\".    Moving on to the DVD in the box set, AMAZON lists 35 titles. There are in fact 38 on the disc. Amazon doesn't list the US editions of \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Supersonic\\", and (just a typo) includes \\"Wonderwall\\" at the trail end of \\"track 3\\" instead of listing it / numbering separately. So there's your 38. The aforementioned iTunes bundle offers 40 videos, with the base 38 plus two live cuts from the live show at the Roundhouse (the audio of which is on the \\"live disc\\" we'll now move on to ...)    The AMAZON track list for the 16 tracks on the live Roundhouse disc appears correct. The iTunes bundle offers and additional 4 tracks from that show -\\"F***ing In The Bushes\\", \\"Waiting For The Rapture\\", \\"My Big Mouth\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus\\".    I don't have the VINYL set, but the AMAZON track list appears to be the same as the CD, but omits \\"D'You Know What I Mean\\", thus clocking in at 26 cuts. Again, I don't have the actual disc, but just making that observation based on the track list.    WITH ALL THAT SORTED OUT ..... well, I pulled the trigger afterall. Fortunately the extra iTunes material (four live cuts, and let's face it, if you're reading this, you probably DON'T need to download \\"Champagne Supernova\\") is available for separate purchase. The music speaks for itself, there's the last recorded live show the band ever did, and box is nicely done, but a few minor quibbles leave it just short of a 5-star rating:    1 - OK, by now you've read it's NOT a \\"greatest hits\\" or \\"best of\\" set. It's a SINGLES collection. That said, presenting the tracks chronologically would have made a lot more sense.    2 - it's a collection / anthology / retrospective. List all the tracks for crying out loud (the hidden track thing, when applied to a a previously released song, comes off as worse than gimmicky).    3 - a neat \\"bonus disc\\" with the \\"Wibbling Rivalry\\" single would have been a nice touch (just kidding ... but it did in fact chart in the UK)    4 - speaking of the UK catalog, Oasis were a DECIDEDLY British commodity. They only had minor success in the US, from a chart singles perspective. That said, the content should have stuck strictly to the UK market. Or was the \\"Champagne Supernova\\" saga (for the US market) just their latest nod to another British band from the 60's whose catalog got sliced and diced at will here in the US ?    5 - the booklet is really a waste. No lyrics, history, credits, or even a single photo of the band. Instead, we get some random thoughts on the tracks from Noel, but more so from Oasis' fans. Nothing terribly revelatory.    All in, it does wrap up the whole sordid Gallagher Brothers Band saga. One final observation: the \\"1\\" disc by the Beatles (whom Oasis have emulated more than just a little) clocked in at  (you guessed it) 27 tracks. A very fitting farewell.
0399103422|5.0|I had to coose a novel for my AP Language class, to do a report on. I chose this novel. \\"The Godfather\\" by Mario Puzo. So I checked out prices and read reviews. I decided to order my novel from Amazon.com. It is an excellent book! I never really knew much about the Mafia until I read this book. They were like regular outlaws, a lot of bloodshed. I know this is a fictional story, but there are still Mafia families around today. They do not obey the law. The author had to do a lot of research about the Mafia. I give my satisfaction with this book an A+, I hope that is what I get on my report. I am going to order another novel from Amazon.com, \\"The Innocent Man\\".
0783231032|1.0|I bought this one, and I just got the British DVD from amazon.co.uk.   This one is letterbox non-anamorphic, meaning the picture uses about 1/2 of your screen.  The British one is anamorphic, meaning it fills the screen.   If you don't have a PAL dvd player ($50-$100 last I looked), I'm sorry, but you're not a serious movie lover anyway.   Just go ahead and get the player -- life is short.   (If you don't see this as a comic masterpiece that's another strike against you.   We're talking serious business here -- great comedy.)

B003JLA4KS|5.0|I've been a Rush fan since I first heard 'All The World's A Stage' Rush's first live album in 1976. Even though it took some getting used to Geddy's vocals, I always knew these guys could play their A $$'s off! There are probably only two groups left on the planet that I buy their new albums without hesitation one being The Rolling Stones and the other of course Rush. While the Stones haven't put out a great album in a long time, I still find their new offerings interesting.<br /><br />Rush on the other hand has delivered great album after great album, but even these musical giants have had their moments were they didn't top their last effort. For me I feel that the band continued to grow up to 'Hold Your Fire'. That doesn't mean that it's my favorite album, but there was a gradual climb to that point. When 'Presto' was released it marked the first time the band sounded like they went backwards...I know now that this was intentional. After 'Roll The Bones' the band started to dig in and really grow again with some of the newest albums technically amazing, but lacking in melody. I still love and own all of their albums and have nothing but the greatest respect for these stellar musicians and songwriters.<br /><br />I'm giving a little back history here because now with 'Rush Beyond The Lighted Stage' I get to hear what I've known for years from the guys who have influenced me and countless other musicians to play a little harder and I get to hear a lot of stuff that I didn't know about. While I and every other Rush fan would have liked this documentary to go on for hours, I think it is really well put together even though it should have been at least another 45 minutes longer.<br /><br />I can understand why this film is 106 minutes, but considering the fan base, I can't believe that the members of Rush didn't realize that Rush fans would want a much longer in depth look at the band's History. The early years are well done, but it seems to \\"rush\\" by the later years and even though the film is really quite good, I think with a little more effort, it could have been the definitive documentary all Rush fans were looking for.<br /><br />The Blu Ray has all of the extras that are on the two discs DVD, but to be honest, with all the early footage used in this piece, there is really little reason to buy the Blu Ray over the standard DVD as visual quality is really not all that much better. The small segments in HD will look fine on standard and the old stuff might even look a little better. If you don't own a Blu Ray player this is certainly not the reason to go and buy one.<br /><br />I rate the documentary itself 4 1/2 stars and the extras 5 stars for some very cool old concert footage with John Rutsey and other obscurities. Most of the other extras are mostly made up of segments that appear in the film as clips, are presented here more elaborately.

0393078299|5.0|Manjit Kumar's book is a fascinating history of one of the most<br />fundamental areas of science.Just as the title says, it is a history<br />of the great debate about the nature of reality with Einstein and<br />Neils Bohr leading the opposing views. Quantum Mechanics has always<br />been a fascinating subject for me, mainly because I could never hope<br />to understand it enough, however much time I spent on it. This<br />brilliant work takes you through the history of the ideas behind<br />quantum mechanics from the late 19th century all the way till the<br />latter half of 20th century.<br />Manjit Kumar sets the stage slowly as he describes the contributions<br />of great scientists ranging from Rutherford, Max Planck, Einstein,<br />Bohr, de Broglie, Pauli, Heisenberg, Dirac and Schroedinger. Their<br />works are captured along with a short historical background to provide<br />the context. Then the stage is all set for the great question about<br />the nature of reality. Bohr and Heisenberg and many others insist that<br />there is no objective reality. Bohr says: 'There is no quantum world.<br />There is only an abstract quantum mechanical description.It is wrong<br />to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is.<br />Physics concerns what we can say about nature.\\"<br />On the other hand, Einstein insists on his belief in the existence of<br />a causal, observer-independent reality. He says: \\"What we call science<br />has the sole purpose of determining what is\\". Einstein and his<br />Princeton team produce an ingenious thought-experiment called EPR that<br />casts a major shadow on the Bohr-Heisenberg view called the<br />'Copenhagen Interpretation'. However, for all practical purposes, most<br />scientists by the mid-20th century accept the Copenhagen view and get<br />on with their science. Albert Einstein toiled till his death to find a<br />Unified Field theory from which he hoped to derive the laws of Quantum<br />Mechanics. But he wasn't successful.<br />The book brings out the essence of those exhilarating times in science<br />when great minds battle year after year on the nature of Reality<br />amidst two major world wars and the looming threats of fascism and<br />communism. In spite of their battles for decades, both Bohr and<br />Einstein were such great human beings, having a great regard and<br />affection for one another. The other giants like de Broglie, Pauli,<br />Heisenberg and Schroedinger also show great respect and regard for<br />their opponents' views and keep egos and personalities out of the<br />equation.<br />Manjit Kumar's narrative brings out all these essential human<br />qualities quite vividly. He has a great ability to write. The book is<br />lucid and delightfully accessible in spite of the difficult subject<br />matter. I enjoyed reading it immensely. In many ways, it is like a<br />thriller, as you keep looking for the next thought experiment that<br />Einstein would come up with to counter Bohr only to find out how the<br />Copenhagen team overcomes each of these hurdles. I would recommend it<br />strongly to anyone interested in popular science in general and<br />Quantum Mechanics in particular.cience   when great minds battle year after year on the nature of Reality   amidst two major world wars and the looming threats of fascism and   communism.

This version of the historical story of the 300 Spartans from Sparta is the most modern up to date film loaded with CGI (computer generated imagery) special effects. It contains buffed out men who fight for their country willing to die even when immensely outnumbered. The film that inspired a crew to make this film was in 1962 titled \\"The 300 Spartans.\\" \\"300\\" is a typical film made for the MTV generation, fans of graphic novels, and the vast amount of video game fanatics that enjoy cinematic violence.     \\"300\\" was made by Warner Brothers Pictures in association with Legendary Pictures and Virtual Studios. The MPAA kindly gave this movie an R rating for graphic battle sequences, some sexuality, and nudity. It is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. He also wrote the famous \\"Sin City,\\" and put his own spin on the historical story of \\"300\\" that is loaded with a lot more violence and appeal for the generation from nowadays. Frank Miller got the drive to pursue this story from many viewings of the 1962 film \\"The 300 Spartans.\\" The music for \\"300\\" was beautifully orchestrated and perceived by Tyler Bates, who is fairly new but is on his way to bigger and better films. He has the drive and potential to be up with other big names on a high award level. The film's screenplay, which didn't take much work having a detailed graphic novel to base off of, was written by Zack Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael B. Gordon. The film had an incredibly huge cast some may not know by name but each actor gave his all with the parts they were so generously given. The cast includes; Gerard Butler (from the new \\"Phantom of The Opera\\" ), Lena Headey (from \\"Gossip\\"), David Wenham (as Faramir in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films), and Dominic West (from the new \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\"). And, last but not least, the film was directed by newly found sensation Zack Snyder who directed a well received remake of \\"The Dawn Of the Dead\\".     \\"300\\" takes place in 480 BC, when the Persian king Xerxes sends his enormous army to defeat Greece. The Greek city of Sparta raises supreme warriors, and 300 of them are chosen to fight for Sparta to overthrow the Persians at Thermopylae. They go to war knowingly they will be outnumbered, but are willing to die to keep Sparta amongst the Greek. The battle is basically a suicide mission, meant to give time to the rest of the Greek forces to prepare for the insurmountable invasion. This doesn't phase the Spartans from giving the war their all, heavily determined to take as many Persians down with them as possible.      \\"300\\" isn't a film that is likely to be noticed for awards other than maybe an MTV Movie Award or any caliber award for its use of special effects used to perfection. It was nominated in roughly 5 categories in the MTV Movie Awards and won for Best Fight for Gerard Butler's King Leonidas battle with an Immortal creature. I felt, at times, mesmerized and in the moment with Tyler Bates' use of music but believe this is not his best work. I sense his masterpiece in music is yet to come. This film is nothing more than a good time away from life and nothing more. The only other element this picture had, other than its great use of blue screen and green screen, was its gorgeous locations and cinematography. I believe that even the cinematographer and/or director went a bit overboard with themselves in creating a huge wall that is made up of dead bodies. It is award worthy for its amazing special effects but I can't get myself to say anything worthy of this movie more than that.     \\"300\\" was loaded with extensive trivia and interesting facts in making this movie. First, this film, made visibly on a great scale, was shot in just 60 days. Next, Frank Miller wanted the male's of the film to have the same look as in his graphic novel, so he demanded them to spend the majority of their screen time bare-chested. In order to efficiently present themselves as a well-trained fighting force of the time, the entire principal cast endured a rigorous training schedule for 6 weeks before shooting were to begin. Also, in the well shot and planned scene of the Oracle and its elegant flowing effect was oddly accomplished by filming the actress underwater. Lastly, with Zack Snyder being mostly in charge of this film he took it upon himself to cast his own flesh and blood son to play Young Leonidas as a child. In closing, I'd suggest this film to those that consider themselves a part of the MTV generation or are just fans of special effects used to create a very video game like blood splatter effect. It is all of the above, gratuitous violence, decapitations, lost limbs, and just all out brutality in its finest; if you're a fan of that.             Written by: Noel Petok

030726999X|3.0|The first book of the series (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) was new and different in the thriller/mystery genre.  The girl in the title was a new feminine anti-hero.  Unfortunately, the second and third books, in my opinion, do not think live up to the premise of the original.  The second and third books explore other characters in more depth. This makes the second and third books less interesting because these characters are known types and predictable. If you want to know how the series ends, read them but be prepared to be disappointed.  I was.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I like the movie. It's definitely different from the one I remember from my childhood but it's still good and weird... well, it is Wonderland and Wonderland is weird. Johnny Depp always does a great job and I always liked Helena Bonham Carter as well. They both take on some of the quirkiest roles and then do them very well. I wouldn't recommend this for little children though. It is a bit on the dark side... well gloomy anyway.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|A great series with some amazing footage! Fans of Planet Earth this is a must buy!
B003E48AYC|2.0|I have always enjoyed Johnny Depp movies, and think they are fun. Alice in Wonderland is a poorly written film, and although Johnny was his usual wonderful self, this film was a waste of my time and bucks.
0810971089|5.0|My 9 year old son loves to read but he isn't to hip on reading fiction focusing instead on factual reading, however he loves this series!  He has read each book multiple times and I think that is because he really relates to the main character.  He loves to draw comparisions about what he read to his real life situations and share them with me.  I am grateful to have found a fiction series he can enjoy!
0307588335|5.0|The book is very interesting for non-insiders. Contains more details and information on topics that one wouldn't even expect. It will be one of the best in the \\"Liar's Poker\\" series if one would exist. And it's a good contribution for the must read list of finance school students.
B003KVNV4S|5.0|I rarely review anything but I had to let people know that this is one of the best albums from start to finish period.
B000001GPX|5.0|This disc contains the most fantastic argument that Beethoven is the greatest musical composer in the history of the world. The opening notes of the 5th alone are justification for buying the best audio equipment you can afford and turning it up LOUD. I'm a layman when it comes to classical music - heavy rock is my background  - but this music has every bit as much energy and passion as any dozen heavy metal bands. And if you listen to a different recording you will hear a difference in quality, its not a hard thing with so much music on the internet. The orchestra are so good if you are a musician of any type you will be awed by the scale and brilliance of the music and the performance. If you only buy one classical cd get this - you will not be disappointed.
0743298039|3.0|I remember enjoying \\"gothic romances\\" when I was younger so I thought I would try this. It certainly has the elements of a gothic novel. Dark creepy house, mysterious characters,forbidden secrets, but there is no romance if that is what you are looking for. I listened to the book on cd, the readers' were excellent, adding so much to the atmosphere of the story. I almost never finish a book if I don't like the characters and the only sympathetic characters in this book were the minor ones. The heroine Margaret was whiny and detached. Therefore I felt detached from the characters. As some others have said, the last few chapters felt very rushed. It is worth reading or listening to but it won't go on my favorites list.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|After all the Hype this movie got in the media I really wanted to see it and judge for myself.  I really do love it!  Not just the story, though it is a good plot, nor the acting which is pretty good as well, but the special effects and the science that went into making the movie!  The creator of the story has a wonderful creative mind and the folks who broght that to the screen did a fantastic job!  Sooo glad I was able to add this to my collection!
B000002JSW|5.0|Powerage is without a doubt AC/DC's best album ever released.It's a shame that it is overshadowed by the \\"Black In Black\\" album and \\"Let There Be Rock\\". Bon's lyrics are outstanding in this album, from the Las Vegas centered \\"Sin City\\" to the great bluesy feel of \\"Gone Shootin'\\". This album just keeps throwing hard hitting, straight forward AC/DC music at you.Vanda and Young understand how AC/DC want to sound and they showed that on this great album.    If you haven't picked this album up yet, I highly recommend you do.Even if you're not a crazy, AC/DC fan like myself, this album should be recognized.I would pick this album over Black In Black any day and I'm not disrespecting Brian Johnson in anyway. Black In Black is still a great album as well but it's no where near \\"Powerage\\".
B002LW9ITY|5.0|I wanted to buy this since long. This package has both Blu-ray & the DVD print. Also the cars included are of good quality. My kid liked both of them. Overall a good buy.
B0000019PA|5.0|how do you describe music with this level of sheer inventiveness, insanity, and fierce honesty.  It is just out there for everyone to listen to, and not everyone will like it.  It isn't music I would expect my kids to like, but I think is part of any musical education.  This group may never have released anything else like it, i don't even know or care.  This is a one of a kind gem, an Anthem by any definition, that still brings tears to me eyes on songs like Two-Headed Boy.  Awesome stuff.
0307594777|5.0|Each book in this trilogy is very good. They take place in Sweden, so the Swedish names and towns can get a little tedious. All are intriguing, well written and hard to put down. You will become a huge fan of Lisbeth Salander, the heroine. I highly recommend all 3 of these books!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is great- it's definitely an AWESOME workout with plenty of room to work your way up from level 1 to level 3.  I am only 2 weeks in and I'm already seeing a difference in my muscle tone and stamina.  I don't do the workouts every single day, but about 5 days/week.  This DVD can really work for anyone- if you're a beginner, there are modified steps at each level.  And if you're more advanced, you will still be challenged at any level because you can adjust your intensity.  Jillian Michaels has gotten me addicted to working out- I can't wait to get home from work so I can pop in the DVD and work up a sweat!    The only little negative thing I can say is that you can't fast forward through the intro at the beginning of the DVD, which is a couple of minutes long.  This is really not a big deal though; I use this time to start warming up.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|A superb film by Alfred Hitchcock! This has to be one of the most suspenseful films of the 20th Century. Even though it was made back in 1959, it still has high tension all over it even today. It's an interesting premise: a man is wrongfully accused and is being pursued all around the country. It might be simple enough, but it's much more complicated than it seems. Here, we get a romantic subplot, a government conspiracy, several chase sequences, clever dialogue, perfectly-timed humor, brilliant performances by Cary Grant & Eva Maria Saint, etc. Basically, you get a whole lot from this film, but it's not overstuffed. Hitchcock, one of the finest directors in the 20th Century, has given us a marvel. It's a definite classic among top thrillers. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's perfect, but it's an excellent film nonetheless.<br /><br />Grade: A
0393061310|4.0|I would recommend this Pulitzer Prize-winning book especially for readers who are interested in anthropology and archaeology.    It is an investigation into why some human societies have been so much more successful than others, why Papua New Guinea natives have so much less in terms of material goods, less technology, poorer health and shorter life spans, etc. than do Americans, even though they are clearly as least as intelligent (Dr. Diamond believes that they are actually more intelligent.)    He spent 30 years collecting information in search of an answer, and this book is the result. Certain societies were able to conquer others because they had guns, germs, and steel; which the conquered peoples did not. (For example, the Spanish conquistador Pizarro defeated the Incan leader Atahaulpa and his army of 80,000 with just 168 men!)    That seems like basic common sense, but Diamond wanted to take it farther. Why did some societies have guns, germs, and steel while others did not?    After years of research, his theoretical conclusion is: geography. The more fortunate peoples lived in areas where they had access to crops that could be cultivated and animals that could be domesticated. This allowed their populations to expand and gave them sufficient resources such that they could support some individuals who did not work to produce food. Such individuals were free to spend their time and efforts in developing technology.    Again, Diamond's argument makes sense. The book is a compendium of information in support of his theory. Some may consider it overkill, but in a field of science in which researchers cannot perform controlled experiments and have them replicated by others, they must collect as many facts as possible to support (or refute) their theories. I consider Diamond's surfeit of information to be necessary and valid scientific investigation. Plus, it is interesting to read about.    The subject matter in Guns, Germs, and Steel doesn't have the high dramaof some of the things in The World Without Us, nor the humor of Bonk, (other science books I've recently read.) The subjects are more mundane and everyday, such as the development of agriculture and the use of domestic animals in food production. But these are things that are fundamental and important in understanding how civilization arose and progressed, and I find them interesting as well.    Naturally, as a microbiologist, I was particularly fascinated by Diamond's theory that most or all infectious diseases arose from close contact with domesticated animals. Although I knew that some microorganisms do cross between humans and other species (mycobacteria, flu viruses, mad cow disease), and that some diseases in humans are related to similar diseases in animals (AIDS, smallpox), I had never heard it proposed that ALL diseases arose in this way. If generally true, there obviously are exceptions, such as certain types of fluke parasites that come from water snails, which have never been a domesticated animal as far as I know. And HIV appears to have originated in chimps and/or gorillas, also undomesticated. Also, the origins of most virulent organisms are too far in the past to ever be traced or proven. Still, his theory does make sense and it is an intriguing concept.    A bit of trivia that I found fascinating is that the following plants are poisonous and/or inedibly bitter in their wild versions: almonds, lima beans, watermelons, eggplants, cabbage, and potatoes!    This book has been criticized for repetition, and I would agree with that. However, I do see a reason for it. Guns, Germs, and Steel was written for the purpose of proposing a scientific theory, not just for entertainment, and as such it is different in structure. Since the entire book addresses different aspects of the same underlying question, naturally there is considerable overlap in some of the facts - they fit into more than one theme (and therefore more than one chapter.) Since his goal is to \\"prove\\" his theory insofar as it is possible, Diamond must muster every supporting fact he can come up with, never mind if it also supports and has been included in another facet of his investigation (and thus another chapter.) So I don't find that problematic.    As for self-aggrandizement - yes, there is that, too (and it is far more apparent on the DVD.) But I can forgive that as well. Celebrity doesn't come easily to scientists in our culture - you don't write a bestseller science book, appear on TV and in a documentary film, or win the Pulitzer Prize without putting considerable effort into promoting yourself. It's just part of doing business.    For an opposing viewpoint, it might be interesting to read Edward O. Wilson's book, The Diversity of Life, which takes the opposite position on why we eat the particular foods that we do, than does Diamond's theory. (Wilson believes that we eat only a very few of the wide range of available edibles simply out of habit, because they were what our neolithic ancestors cultivated. Diamond suggests that certain plants and animals are far more suitable to agriculture and domestication than others, and their availability at any given place determined how successful the culture was that lived there.)    I first began listening to Guns, Germs, and Steel on audiobook, but soon realized that there is just too much detailed information in it to effectively hold in my mind, so I requested a copy of the book from the library, and I was glad that I did. Reading it for yourself also allows you to see the maps, charts, tables, drawings, and photos, of which there are a great many. This book is just too complex to translate well to audio.    (518 pages, including 32 pages of plates)

B000WTBMBK|4.0|I'm really not sure why this comes up when I search for dubstep - this is unlike any dubstep I've ever heard.  But I'm glad it did.    Off gates, I didn't like the first 3 tracks.  Maybe it was the source material, or the beats, but I just couldn't get into them.  However, from Ghost Hardware and on, this album manages to set an incredible mood that is hard to describe.  Very cyberpunk-ish with its dark futures and technology-filled dystopias, yet chill and sensual like a late-night jazz lounge.  Either way, it gives off that 'Big City, Rainy Night' vibe very well.  Especially Dog Shelter - love that track.    He reminds me a great deal of Mt Eden, actually, sans the heavy bass and distortion.  And, oddly enough, Ghost In The Shell as well.  I can almost fool myself into believing that I'm listening to a modern rendition of the original movie's OST.

0714843377|5.0|GREAT piece of work. I ran across it today in the book store. As an expert at unconscious persuasion and influence I can tell what moves people to action. This is a collection of thoughts that IF applied would prove to move prospects and clients to action. It's brilliantly written in metaphor (in some places) but it's NOT just for advertising. As a professional speaker, some of the things he talks about apply to moving people from \\"the front of the room.\\" The wisdom is subtle and none of it's a secret - but, he puts it together in a way that's refreshingly easy to understand/apply. Arrogant and non-persuasive as my remark might be, I'd dare to say that the negative reviews below are all people who think inside the box and march to someone else's drum....or, think they \\"know\\" the information contained in the book but do not apply it. Application will create results, and that being said, does someone just want a good read of do they want benefit? (Forgive my slant, though I do get tired of people who have never written a thing in their life criticizing those who have.)
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This is one of those classic fun-filled movies.  It \\"aged\\" well and kept a room full of 10 and 11 year olds happy.
B002OOG6RQ|3.0|Filled with typical Rammstein razor-edged riffs, this is a decent album, but not a great one. Certainly not in the same ballpark as Mutter, the best of the Rammstein albums in my humble opinion.    I am thankful that the lyrics to most Rammstein songs are usually in their native German tongue. The English lyrics of the song Pussy, while obviously tongue-in-cheek, are completely lame. Wiener Blut, allegedly about the disturbing Fritzl case in Austria, is one of the best songs on the album from a musical perspective, and since I know not a word of German I remain blissfully ignorant regarding the sure to be unsettling lyrics. Speaking of unsettling, the CD cover art depicting women being cannibalized is highly offensive. Rammstein do like to push boundaries, but sadly these days they seem to prefer to go for shock value rather than pushing the envelope with their music. Still, there is enough on offer here to satisfy any fan of their previous efforts.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Okay, so, there isn't a Rush fan in the world who could seriously be considered a fan that's not going to automatically get this. With that in mind, this isn't a review written to try to sell the DVD, because it's going to do that all on its own to any true Rush fan (thank goodness for something new that's not yet another \\"best of\\" compilation).<br /><br />As a younger generation Rush fan (I'm 28 -- or in Rush terms, I was born the year Signals was released), this DVD really helped me to relate to some of the older material that just never clicked with me (mainly the first 2 albums, though I always dug the singles). Having so much of the band's material placed within a historical context (not just a chronological one) is just one of the MANY treasures this DVD has provided me. This isn't just a documentary that educates you and gathers its information from people who know the subject(s) of the documentary; the band is directly involved in interviews, voice-overs, candid moments, and more. There's SO much more John Rutsy information than I would have ever guessed. I had no idea how much they really played with him and never have I been so aware of Neil being \\"the new guy.\\" And speaking of Neil, this is absolutely the best way for a fan to get to know him. Even if you've read all of his books, watched his instructional material, watched all the official live DVD's, interviews, etc., it's great to get the most honest and sincere impression of Neil around -- and what better than getting it straight from him?<br /><br />This is first-class, first-hand information contained on this DVD. You would be hard-pressed to make a better documentary than this. The only disappointment is how fast that 1:40 goes by! Ah, but when it does, there's a bonus DVD awaiting you and it contains the absolute funniest and most candid stuff. It's no secret that Alex is said to be the goofy guy in the band and that is made abundantly clear on the bonus DVD. All I'm going to say is that I was in tears laughing hysterically at \\"old chokin' Al Lifeson!\\" If/when you see the part, you'll know exactly what I mean (provided you have a good sense of humor).<br /><br />All-in-all, this DVD has allowed me to relate to the band even further and it has provided something a dedicated 28 year-old Rush fan could only hope for! I went into this experience thinking it would be low-budget, but I didn't care. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the visual/auditory quality of the content is top-notch -- never mind the actual content itself! There will be things you already know and things you don't, but the combination of the things you don't know with all of the unique candid encounters with the band, input from various top-notch musicians (Trent Reznor, Les Claypool, Vinnie Paul, Sebastian Bach, Billy Corgan, Jack Black, et al), and band historicity are enough to make this DVD worth watching multiple times.<br /><br />So, what are you waiting for!?

B002N5N4M6|5.0|My wife and I didn't discover this series until the third season, and its almost always falling off the couch laughing funny for me. It usually is for my wife, too.    I have an MSEE and work in Silicon Valley as a Software Engineer. I have my own moments, but never like Sheldon. In fact, I think one of the big reasons I like BBT is that their shennanigans make mine look pretty tame. (And, I'm often thinking so far out of the box that I can't even see it!)    As most reviewers say that the 3rd season is a shadow of the first two, we may have to spring for Seasons 1 and 2 DVDs.
0440241901|5.0|This is my first book by Sophie Kinsella, and was highly recommended by the kind staff at my local bookstore.    Frankly I have doubts when I bought the book, because I am more into historical romances, but since the staff was so kind and enthusiastic I thought I'll just give it a try.    Boy!  How glad I am to try it out.  This is the most hilarious book I've read in recent years!  Emma is just so endearing and real, with all her secrets and whims and insecurities.  And isn't Jack the most endearing kind tender smart boyfriend one could ever have?  This is definitely not a pure romance book, and there's no angst, mysteries or mind boggling plot etc.  The characters are all our everyday people, the usual behaviors and relationship,  people like Emma's roommates, colleagues and even the juice bar guy.      If you want big heart wrenching intelligent book, this is not for you.  But if you are into lighthearted reading, something to cheer you up, this is it.  But don't get me wrong, even though it is meant for light reading, it is NOT those where you read and throw and forget, I find myself re-reading the little scenes again and again, just to get a good laugh again.
0307269752|1.0|I have to add another 1-star review. Although I was curious to find out \\"whodunnit\\", I found the increasingly frequent depictions of horrible violence against women (and animals) to be very off-putting, and I will not watch the movie.  I realize this kind of violence happens in the world, but it is my personal preference to not be constantly reminded of it while reading for pleasure. But that's subjective. Objectively, I found the book to be very unrealistic or at best lacking in the way it presents the survivors of such traumas. For the most part, they all turn into fabulously successful businesswomen and carry on relatively unscathed. I realize such an event may not ruin your life - and I'm assuming that's what the author was trying to say - but boy, they sure seem to bounce back quick. On a less serious note, there were a lot of events that really stretched credulity. And, maybe I'm a bit dull, but why did the big secret about what happened have to STAY a secret forever? Fear? Doesn't seem likely. And the Nazi thing. You're not going to get me to take the real threat of racism in Sweden or elsewhere serioulsy if you make the Nazis literally insane - I'll just write the racism off as a fluke of their insanity, not something that attracted and seduced otherwise right-thinking people. It would have sent a more powerful message if they HAD been run-of-the-mill killers and Nazis, as the two leads discussed.<br />Finally, many of the characters and their relationships are not fleshed out enough. Is Mikael happy being a lover to three women but husband to none? I'm not sure. Maybe he isn't sure either, but I don't know that. Why does Erika stay married? How about some more clarity on Lisbeth's past? Does anything more happen with the advokat? Any of those topics would have made me happier than the boring tacked-on Wennerstrom stuff, which could surely have been written into the plot as the catalyst it is in the beginning without requiring the boring end part. I realize the author wrote two more books (and planned 10), so perhaps my questions are answered there, but I won't be reading them.author wrote two more books (and planned 10), so perhaps my questions are answered there, but I won't be reading them.
1400049628|1.0|I tried very hard to like this book...it begins with a fantastic premise...how would you survive a zombie attack...and then goes on and on as if it's a serious topic worthy of the level of detail a real survival guide might contain...but given it's content...it stops being funny about forty pages in and becomes more of a slog than anything...<br /><br />It might have been a good magazine piece...an intro to a zombie novel...or even a funny sitcom...but as a book, it takes a non-existent situation and treats it as if it's real...making for a boring read.
0307454541|5.0|My mom first picked up this book quite a few months ago, and I was never very inclined to read it. Mystery and murder are not genres I generally enjoy. However, when I finally gave this book a chance the only thing I regretted was that I hadn't done so earlier. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has complex characters, an intriguing, easy-to-follow plot that surprises the reader with twists and turns, and disturbing social insight. I had some difficulty understanding some references to Swedish places/people, but it wasn't enough to disturb the writing. There were other topics that were \\"foreign\\" to me, such as detailed computer- and business-talk, but I enjoyed this because I was able to learn about them! Read this and enjoy a thrilling read.<br /><br />My only fear is I have heard that the third installment is not that good, since Stieg passed away before the manuscript was sent to editing.<br /><br />I wish Stieg was able to see what a blazing success his novels were!
1401223176|2.0|After reading Long Halloween, Haunted Knight, and Dark Victory, I figured I'd give Jeph Loeb's latest Batman offering a good go.  Now, while the previously mentioned books were decent stories, helping give some solid background to Harvey Dent, Dick Grayson, and old Bats himself, they were no where near as ground breaking as Year One or Dark Knight Returns.<br /><br />That being said, I wasn't expecting any great insights to humanity, the darkness of the human soul, or politics of the current day.<br /><br />And with Jim Lee doing the pencils, it would at least be a pretty read.  And essentially, that's all it was.  This series has a very \\"commercial\\" feel to them as each issue introduces a character, a minor conflict, and a cliffhanger.  There's at least one two-page-panel in each issue, with Jim really showing off his attention to detail.  Most of his character models look very similar, but his work has such a great depth of field, it's hard to deny it's beauty.<br /><br />There's nothing new being told about Bruce Wayne or his enemies or his friends in this story.  He's still coming to grips with his parents' deaths.  He's still a complete control freak.  He's still a lonely, lonely man.  SPOILER ALERT! (He also hooks up with Catwoman and reveals who he is to her, which as of late, seems to be the only thing they can do to draw readers.

Repetitive viewing of credits of each A&E segment that's not to be found in the \\"Special\\" edition is slightly annoying but fast forward player controls handle it easily with little interruption so it is not really a worthy criticism.  It's the best film production I've seen; Jane Austen may have been pleased. The screenplay follows the book well thus requiring the extended viewing time of other offerings. The acting is superb. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle depict their characters well and the rest of the cast complements them.  I've seen this production since its A&E debut as well as its \\"Special\\" and \\"Restored\\" forms. I return to it so it must be worthy of my rating.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|During the '80's there were, in my opinion, two great female artists...Cyndi Lauper and Pat Benatar.  Both artists have magnificent vocal abilities, vocal control and vocal interpetation of a song.  While both artists did well and then \\"fizzled\\" due to the rise of Madonna; Lauper continued on her recording path.  Recording everything from pop, rock, disco, classics and now blues.  Her first album with Blue Angel (on Polydor) was a great hint of what was to come. Her first solo album is a true classic, not just '80s classic, but rock/pop classic. Now Lauper dives head first into blues, and does it with ease and bravado.  Her voice feels each song..her interpetations fit her uniqueness and yet do not misprepresent the original intent.  As other have stated, with all the uniformity in todays current female artist line-up (okay, I will exempt GaGa from that because she is by far better than the rest, especially vocally, and certainly better than Madonna ever was) it is great to hear a seasoned artist test her limits and achieve a magnificent body of work.  Lauper never received her just dessert, and I am not sure with \\"Memphis Blues\\" she still will.  However, it is nice to know that talent still prevails over style.

0425221806|5.0|This books starts out like many of Dean Koontz books, but it builds and sucks you in very quickly, and almost dares you to try to put it down: I couldn't! Koontz's ability to develop personalities of his characters - both human and canine - just sucks you in. By the time you finish it, you feel you've lost a close friend, simply because the book is over. If you read any Koontz book, make this one the top of your list!
B001EOQWEO|4.0|Wall-E,Disney's high grossing entry of 2008(released June/08),is a delightful look at our future(2805) whose protagonist just happens to be a little robotic trash compactor.On the surface it would seem to be something with only slight potential,but the magical folks at Pixar transform this seemingly mundane bot into something with feelings,something with dedication to his job and his charge(a cockroach!),endless determination and whose life we get caught up in and come to care about in short order.It is quite marvelous how it all unfolds.<br />The story takes place in 2805 and Earth is a deserted wasteland...waste,being the operative word.The entire population has long left earth(over a quarter of a million days ago!)and now lives on a huge spaceship;the Axiom.People,due largely to bone loss,no longer walk but fly around on hover chairs with their every whim and need catered to by a myriad of different bots.Every so many years the ship sends out probes to Earth to determine whether life has returned so THEY may return.<br />This is where our little rolling trash compactor by the name of Wall-E comes in.He lives in an old shipping-like container filled with many odds and ends he has collected over many years.He,along with his now non-functioning brethren,were left behind to clean up the Earth of all its' trash which forced the population to leave in the first place.He is still hard at it with a little cockroach for a companion when one of the Axioms life probes lands nearby.The ship comes and goes leaving behind a probe drone;think an egg with sleek wings!While the probe flits here and there seeking a sign of life Wall-E watches and falls in love.The probe isn't exactly discreet in its' search and is quick on the draw,disintegrating more than one object in its' way.This doesn't deter our love struck Wall-E however.When the probe(called Eve) finds life it shuts down,sends out an automatic beacon and is later picked up by the mother craft.Wall-E follows his lady love into space and back to the Axiom.<br />At the Axiom Eve delivers her precious cargo to the Captain but there is a conspiracy afoot.It seems an old message from the president relaying a message about Earth at one point being uninhabitable has been interpreted by the bots,who literally control just about every aspect of life aboard the ship now,as a directive to NEVER return.So they try and destroy the evidence.Between a love struck Wall-E trying to help his lady love and a now newly invigorated ships Captain who realizes they must go back,they eventually quash the robotic uprising and put the Axiom on a heading for Earth.<br />The story runs on many levels with its' obvious love story,its good against evil plot and a clear environmental message of how we must protect the Earth.The animation is visibly striking,rich in detail and life like;especially in scenes showing the vast wasteland that has become our planet.<br />Technically the film has been transferred beautifully and is in its original widescreen a/r.Extras abound in this three disc set and they include:A Digital copy,The Pixar Story,Deleted scenes,some \\"hilarious moments\\" from the movie,a look at the Buy N Large Corp,\\"Lots of Bots\\"which includes games,several making of featurettes,a close look at Wall-E's friends,two animated shorts:\\"Burn-E\\" and the theatrical short which accompanied the movie when first run,\\"Presto\\",audio commentary by the director,a tour of the universe by Wall-E and the sounds of Wall-E.It's an extra packed edition to be sure.<br />I do have one complaint about this three disc set however.The discs come in cardboard pull out sections;the left pull out has one disc in it(#1) and the right pull out has the other two discs,feathered over one another.When I saw this and started pulling them out to examine them I thought\\"Oh boy,here we go.I can see them all being scratched or scuffed\\".But I was pleasantly surprised to find they were fine.However taking them in and out(especially the 2nd and 3rdones)I think will eventually cause scuffs.So for my own peace of mind I elected to put them into a separate double holding DVD snap case.This is positively awful thinking on Disney's part to be so cavalier in how they package these things.Of course it's more money for them if you have to get new ones.So beware my friends.<br />In conclusion this 3 DVD set of the Disney/Pixar 2008 smash Wall-E is a crowd pleaser from start to finish.The characters we see are fascinating to the nth degree and the plot moves at a good and steady pace.The animation by Pixar is top notch all the way through and is startlingly real especially in its' portrayal of Earth in the future.In this 3-disc set beware of the bad packaging that these discs are put into.If you can overcome this hurdle,sit back and relax and enjoy another wonderful adventure from the imaginative folks at Pixar studios.ually cause scuffs.So for my own peace of mind I elected to put them into a separate double holding DVD snap case.This is positively awful thinking on Disney's part to be so cavalier

B00006D295|4.0|I use this DVD in a class I teach on deviance. Of course there is a fair amount of deviant activity in the movie including but not limited to: infidelity, drug use, cannibalism, incest and bioengineering a human being for sexual pleasure. What proves interesting is that over the past 25 years our society has embraced many of the things considered outlandish when the movie first hit theaters such as: homosexuality, bikers, cross dressing and tattoos.<br /><br />I explain to the class that when the movie originally came out it bombed. For the very reasons it failed at first, I encouraged my students NOT to watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show for the first time at home alone. It is an experiential movie, and an experience best enjoyed at midnight with a crowd of zany folks dressed in costumes from the show, singing, dancing, hurling toast and whatnot, all while exchanging dialog with the movie.<br /><br />Rocky Horror fans probably are interested in the DVD extras. Honestly, they're kind of a bust. Otherwise the culmination of a B-movie plot, outrageously compelling characters and trademark music make this flick worth adding to your collection.
0792838068|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars. Becuase, I felt it had a lot of romance to it. Also, it was more realistic than your typical romance love story. Nicolas Cage plays an alcoholic living in Las Vegas. Whom meets a pretty prostitute they fall in love for a short period of time. They realize they have faults, but they don't judge one another. They help one another when one is down on their luck. The ending is sad. However, no other movie is like this very different.
0307408833|2.0|We were very excited to get this cookbook, but were disappointed to find that many of the recipes contain spelt.  From the remaining recipes, we have not had a whole lot of success.  Sometimes a recipe works and sometimes it doesn't.  They are pretty good when they do, but just aren't very robust.  The ingredients are too expensive to fail most of the time, so we have stopped experimenting with it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is an awesome work out!  The only thing I do not approve of is her philosophy of giving women the triangle look to make their waist appear slimmer. JUST MAKE MY WAIST SLIMMER! There is too much upper body strength exercise because I would prefer to have smaller arms rather than a bulky look.  That said, I do half the strength exercises sans weights and it's still an amazing total body workout! I also use small weights so that it burns calories rather than building muscle, and extra ab exercises after I recover.  I WOULD deff recommend this tape :)
0446563048|5.0|Wow! It's very rare that you read a business book that is at once educational, inspirational and so personal. I want to buy shoes and more just to experience the passion that seems to run through the organization to make it so unique.     Although it reads like a history of the company. Something to inspire those past, present and future employees, It can still serve as guidance for many companies.    Don't think of this as just another business must-read. It's quick and you'll enjoy it.
B002SG8A56|5.0|This show delivers each and every episode.  With their unique blend of dry humor and surprisingly pleasant \\"novelty band\\" songs, it's hard not to keep a grin above your chin. I first saw their stand-up, and then had the privilege of stumbling across these DVDs after the show was all ready off the air(by the choice of Brett and Jermaine). I really enjoy all aspects of this show, and I wish they had signed on for additional seasons. Who knows, maybe they come back for more seasons like I think Larry David has done with Curb Your Enthusiasm. Splurge on yourself, you can't go wrong with this package.(Note:Limited Tracks on included Soundtrack)
B002ZG983M|5.0|You can still go to Heaven if you see, laugh and like this movie okay...    All the negative posts are people who are just genuinely uncomfortable in their own skins. For ages women have been complaining about be portrayed as weak, needing saving and being victimized. Well I say, those days are long gone. Nope, it wasn't a Fonda clone doing a killer spy gig, it was a 11 year old girl fighting the hard fight (and lets face it, her crusade wasn't meant to make another Martha Stewart) for her Dad and dead Mother (if it were you who'd been done so bad you'd be proud of your kid for getting it done, real naked American can-do spirit here. raw and unapologetic). Hit Girl, Hit Girl, (lord bless her) Hit Girl is a heroine for the 21st century where a terrorist might have to think 5 times. Yeah we give em' cell phones, music, home electronics and sugar up the a$$ and I say it's these things that combined make the toxic stew that are the ingredients that cause the typical superhero origin story that spawned Hit Girl... Life is hard and it helps to carry a loaded 11 year old. This movie is like what makes you wake up those mornings and wonder if there is any possible way to return to that crazy dream you just had. Pure voyeurism and anti convention, you want to talk about disturbing cinema with kids in it as main characters, rent \\"The Tin Drum\\" (a German import) and you'll see this movie in another light I promise you... Why are Americans sooooo worried about our widdle kiddies getting bad ideas from movies? Hello, Columbine and all the other would-be Hit Kids who've blown away real people waaaaaaaaaaaaaay before this comic/movie was ever conceived might just have you thinking, \\"Art DOES imitate life\\" and in this case, real life was there first and way more brutal and evil... I'm just sayin'... Buy this freakin' movie and if you have to keep it under your bed like porn, so be it, you'll live with the complication trust me! Can't get laid or ya have no weed, this will get you by nicely...

1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is a refreshing, insightful, and effectively touching story about an autistic teenager's efforts to solve the mystery of who killed a neighbor's dog.  The unintended consequence of his detective work is that he exposes some secrets about his own life that are painful and confusing to him, and ultimately challenge him to face his fears.<br /><br />The strength of the novel is in how Haddon portrays Christopher, telling his story in a first-person narrative from the perspective of an autistic boy.  It would be incorrect to suggest that all autistic people view the world the same way as Christopher does but I think Haddon does a remarkable job of presenting the world as seen through the eyes of this particular autistic boy, and he does so in an utterly convincing manner.<br /><br />Christopher does not like to be touched, struggles to understand emotions in other people, and interprets language in a very literal way.  This results in some amusing moments as he conducts his investigation into the dog's rather grizzly death.  Much of what makes the novel succeed is in how Haddon allows Christopher's narrative to reflect his own lack of understanding of many of the subtle nuances of human behavior, while at the same time allowing the reader to comprehend what Christopher can not.<br />I really enjoyed this novel and really liked Christopher, who manages to be endearing even though his condition results in his being emotionally detached from the people in his life.  My only minor complaint about the novel is something that most people would disagree with and probably consider a positive aspect of the novel (I'm strange that way).  For me, the ending is a little too sentimental and uplifting - everything works out too nicely for everyone. (I'm cynical by nature and usually prefer unhappy, messy endings - but that's just me).<br /><br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is quick and engaging read that I think most people will find rewarding.<br /><br />***Note:  I do have one other quibble with the novel that I am going to discuss in the comment section.  It is more of a `curious side-note' than an actual complaint and it was not a factor at all in my rating or review.  I am curious to know though if other readers felt the same way about it....arding.      ***Note:  I do have one other quibble with the novel that I am going to discuss in the comment section.

030726999X|5.0|This third book is an impressive culmination to one of the best-written suspense series of the decade.  Challenging, satisfying, amazing.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's genius for developing events, creating characters and constructing dialogue provides the ingredients with which he forms an intricate account as geometrically complex and structurally strong as a six-sided-comb-composed hornet's nest -- a nest occupied by swarms of clever and dangerous wasps.<br /><br />Kudos to Reg Keeland for so skillfully translating Stieg Larsson's masterpieces into English.  Oh, that there were more from Larsson for him to work on!<br /><br />Should the first two books of the trilogy be read first?  Definitely!  I can't imagine how a reader could fully enjoy the complex colony of characters without appreciating the hive of activity that preceded.  If you can't remember exactly how the second book ends, go back and read the last few chapters to pick up where the cliff-hanger left off.

Bad Romance, Telephone, Alejandro, Just Dance, Lovegame, Paparazzi, Poker Face, Eh, Eh (Nothing else I can say), Starstruck, Boys Boys Boys, Brown Eyes, and my two faves, Paper Gangsta & I Like it Rough, are a virtual cornucopia of pleasure.     Her style may not suit everyone, but this 50 year old is grateful for this masterpiece. Here's lookin' at you kid!
B0000640SB|5.0|This was a very funny and entertaining movie (except for the slimy parts!) and I enjoyed it.  It includes three of my favorite actors, Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent D'Onofrio and Will Smith.  The special edition includes making of the movie-special effects, etc. and is a nice bonus.  Definitely worth the money!
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Seeing this classic in blue-ray is a treat. The clarity is fantastic and makes an already entertaining flick more enjoyable. Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer (in my humble opinion, the best role Kilmer ever had), Bill Paxton and Sam Elliot make this movie come alive and joined with the likes of Powers Booth and a cast of outstanding character actors who finish the job with convincing and exciting gun play, fast horses, and bravado, the viewer will find themselves immeshed in the wild and wooly times of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday. Excellent.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|Like Leonardo Dicaprio, Robert Downey, Jr. can pretty much do anything onscreen.  He's funny and he's fun to watch.  The rest of the cast of Sherlock Holmes is good as well.  The costumes and sets look great.  Ostensibly, there's no glaring flaw in the movie unless, like me, you don't believe Sherlock Holmes is a Hollywood action hero.    I already knew Holmes is a drug addict, a boozer, a smoker, and somehow he has amazing mental faculties, but he is also brilliant in hand-to-hand combat?  I can't stretch my suspension of disbelief that far, even if it is in keeping with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories and novels.  There's just no way a man that age who never works out, and who sits for weeks on end in a drunken stupor, could look and move that way without throwing up or having a heart attack.  You can only get away with so much lack of logic.    I might have been okay with Holmes being a druggie genius martial artist.  But then I remembered how goofy I always thought Holmes' \\"logic\\" was.  The movie does a good job of relaying, in flashback sequences, the scenes in the stories and novels when Holmes voices the steps that lead to his solution to the case in question.  Often, what is elementary to Sherlock is a bit of a stretch to the reader, but his leaps of logic in this movie border on the absurd.  It's possible that director Guy Ritchie also felt this way, so he took a jab at Doyle's over-the-top characterization of Holmes by making Holmes' associative thinking appear at least a little ridiculous.    This is definitely a theater movie.  It is a loud, shaky-camera contraption that doesn't seem as fun at home.  It also has a one-way buddy-movie quality that didn't appeal to me: Since Holmes is so messed up and childish, the only way Watson can communicate with him is to stoop to his level of juvenile pranks.  A druggie genius martial artist is also as mature as a frat boy?  C'mon.  Give me some character trait I can believe and care about.    I can't really tell the difference between Downey, Jr.'s Tony Stark (Iron Man, which I liked a lot) and his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.  They both seem to be a mixture of Gregory House (House, M.D.) and Captain Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean).  It's a Hollywood action mix of personas that Downey, Jr. is quite comfortable with.  Most people will have a good time watching this movie, but after seeing a similar performance in Iron Man, and similar directing in Snatch, I didn't find the movie very engaging.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|This movie is a non-stop action pic...a must see.  Plenty of humor, heart-stopping action, spiritual adages, moral dilemas and a few sad scenes.  Overall, an uplifting movie showing the audacity and stubborness of mankind to go on...
0393072231|4.0|I read this book in one day. It's that easy to get through. Although it is not \\"the full picture\\", it's an easy-to-read explanation of a good part of the financial crash. It's written in a novelesque style, and quite enjoyable. I highly recommend it. For an in-depth understanding of the current financial debacle I would recommend Joseph Stiglitz Freefall.
B000BSLU2S|4.0|Great thermal compound, I'm using it on my Corsair H50. I may have applied too much, but it took around 2-3 weeks for the temperatures to drop. At first it was running the same as my stock cooler (45 degrees idle), then, after some time, it dropped to 30 degrees idle. I'm happy with it, I just wish it didn't take so long to cure. Although, it may have been my own fault.
030726999X|5.0|This is a great read.  I did not want it to end.  Has a good ending too.<br />Stieg Larsson did an awesome job with this trilogy. It would have been awesome<br />for him to have been around to see how acclaimed his books have become.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|Aphrodite, Greek goddess of love, beauty and sexuality; proud and self-assured, delicate but fierce, equally tantalizing as she is threatening. Kylie personifies all that in a compact package that infuses fresh energy to her long career and guides the listener through a journey of pleasant surprises.    It is difficult to dissect a record when each one of the tracks is a potential single. All the lovers reminisces of I believe in you, starting with a sigh that soon become a virulent explosion, much like the reaction caused by the album teaser posted online a few months ago. It summarizes the euphoric mood of the album, according to Minogue herself, and it is a perfect platform to introduce the rest of the songs.    Super star producer Stuart Price's signature is omnipresent. The results are obvious from beginning to end, a burdening concern that is balanced with other the inclusion of other big collaborators like Jake Shears from the Scissor Sisters, Calvin Harris and Tim Rice-Oxley from Keane. Kylie declared to Pop Justice that \\"this album is more about being in a pretty happy in my moment in my life. It is joyful..it's reflective in some parts - and I think there's enough to it so that it doesn't just bang you around the head\\"    Thus, it is not coincidence that no ballads were pitched and all twelve tracks are dance floor ready. The rapid succession of electro dance pop to might be dizzying, yet it works to give Aphrodite a cohesiveness rarely found in similar works. Put your hands up (if you feel love) is an exaltation of the senses, designed for tireless body movers, while Everything is beautiful provides a temporary break before the storm stirs everything around with Closer and Too much.     Kylie conveys a lot with subtlety. Hers is not a world of excess but of turning ordinary into magical; she reminds us that being aware and exploiting one's weaknesses sometimes turns out to be the best move. Sure, her voice may not be strong like other pop divas, but she capitalizes on that girl next door appeal and innate sensuality to deliver a truly likable record: joyous, stylistically cohesive, with limitations and originality gaps, but overall outstanding as a testament of the paths she has traveled.  \\"Here's what I do, when I know what I can do, I let you in into my world\\" she chirps in the title track, a corollary for the newly initiated and banging verse to sing along to.    Aphrodite is just what it set to be: her reinstatement card to the music world. While X spawned a couple of hits despite its ahead-of-its-time inconsistence and Body language was a turn to daring, sultry electro-pop, Aphrodite is gracefully bombastic record, successful in its delivery of dance pop anthems sure to reign this summer, or even for the rest of the year.

And, of course, we will always have people making political statements however incidiously they are presented, so...my copy of this exquisitely naive, and incredibly biased garbage was taken out of the Blu-ray player (and to those who are trying to turn our young people into govenment hating...no matter what persuasion...cretins...you're doing a great job) and put it up for sale from whence it came.

0307454541|5.0|I love to read, though like most have little time for much of it. I found this book engaged my interest early and, save for a segment elucidating on the Vanger family tree, kept an entertaining pace through the transitions. I am currently reading the next in the trilogy, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and continue to enjoy the flow and intrigue. I almost didn't buy the second book due to its prologue previewed at the end of \\"tattoo\\". I found it a bit gory. I was however fortunate enough to read several pages of the book owned by someone else, and had to read on.
B003U04TYK|5.0|I love that Kelis has always been able to change with the times and bring us a new face with each album.  Not only that, but she's good at it. Some people might not be into her new dance sound, but I love it. Kelis has embraced the dance/electro sound that's been coming up from the underground for the past two years and did it in a good way.  I want to point out that I am a new fan to Kelis--I got into her from Kelis Was Here.  That album was more hip hop than anything.  But I totally dig this too.  I think if you've got an open mind and love to dance you'll be into this. I'll also point out this is where music has been heading if  you notice the charts, and it's great that Kelis is on the cusp!
0670021652|1.0|I truly loved Eat Pray Love. Re-read it multiple times, found it beautifully written and inspiring. So as a HUGE fan of Miss Gilbert previously, it is quite a revelation for me to read this one.<br /><br />But now, after \\"Committed\\", I start to wonder: are those people who gave EPL bad reviews right? Is it all self-centered, egotistical, narcissistic whining pretending to be something deep?<br /><br />I am now inclined to start to think so. Despite me being impressed with the flawless language, excellent sense of humour of EPL, I can now see people have a point - it is an experiment in obsessive navel-gazing. Paid, mind you.<br /><br />\\"Committed\\" is a long ramble about things trivial everyone knows about. It has no beginning and no logical end. It claims to be a woman's search for \\"Do I really need this thing, marriage?\\" and ends up with just that - marriage, and it leaves utterly unconvinced as to on what grounds that decision had been made. What I found particularly repellent is the main thread of the whole book is \\"What's in it FOR ME?\\". This pretty much summarises the whole book for you, ladies and gentlemen. Why do I need to do this? Will I gain anything? Will HE gain more than I will? And why should this be the case?<br /><br />The idea that to love is not only to receive, but also and primarily, to give, somehow escapes Miss Gilbert.<br /><br />Selfishness and ego centrical main motive in this book are unattractive beyond any words. I cannot imagine who in their right mind would ever want to live next to the author - all she is concerned about is herself, her interests, her pleasure, her gain. Moreover, she is obsessed with this.  I am not saying every woman should suddenly turn to Mother Teresa and forget about her own interests, and I have great respect for some feminist ideas. Huge. But reading this book I couldn't shake off the feeling how egregious it is, to be concerned only about oneself.<br /><br />She doesn't do anything for anyone around her. Oh, no, forgot - she does help her nieces.  And in my mind, this is all an attempt to explain and justify her revulsion with the idea of having children - see, what a good person I am? See? I can do things for children. As long as I am not disturbed and inconvenienced. This is NOT love. This is as far from love as Bali from New Jersey. This is wanting to have a title of \\"Good Person\\" without having to do anything that would be uncomfortable, strenuous, or, God forbid, self-sacrificing.<br /><br />She secretly (or is it openly?) despises her mother for giving her and her sister a stable, loving environment in their childhood. She throws tantrums with her husband-to-be. She has \\"expectations\\" that the person will be as she wants them to be - not the way they are.<br /><br />Elizabeth now strikes me as someone truly selfish, vacuous, a bottomless pit which she is trying to fill with other people. And when they fail to fill that pit, she cuts and runs. It now makes me wonder, why she so categorically refused to comment on the reasons of her marriage break-up. I think I can have a pretty good guess, considering the immediate affair.<br /><br />Utterly  and bitterly disappointing. I want my money back. Half a star.in my mind, this is all an attempt to explain and justify her revulsion with the idea of having children - see, what a good person I am? See? I can do things for children.

Although I'm still in mourning, and I won't touch another thriller until I recover from this brilliant trilogy, I am looking forward to the movies! Steig Larsson's gift to the world is classic how to write three books that transport you to another country, a kick-ass heroine, a player journalist, and a whole cast of diabolical characters, not to mention great fun with hacker technology. Don't plan on doing anything else while you're reading them.

Neither war, not hate, nor antisemitism, nor lack of resources, nor massive immigration, nor blacks, nor poor, nor lack of common language, nor .... Simply put no excuses and great success for the benefit of all humanity.  The book offers a clear picture of a miracle on our time: Israel and how they single hand change the world for the better.
1849162743|5.0|This is the third of three novels by the same author with the same exciting and unusual heroine & hero.  They are feminist in their approach to subject matter, but also such good stories & mystery writing that they should appeal to anyone who likes mystery & adventure.  The perspective of a Swede makes it all the more interesting & he divulges the after effects of Nazism in the Swedish culture.  This is something as a student of History that I had never read about before.  Love the character of the young woman!

B000GG4XJM|2.0|\\"The Seeger Sessions\\" is Bruce Springsteen's vanity project. A very nice one, and a noble purpose. But much like other established artists that have ventured into well intentioned forays (Joe Jackson's big band, Elvis Costello's country, Linda Ronstadt and Rod Stewart into standards), merely recreating something doesn't make it great.<br /><br />Which is what happened to \\"The Seeger Sessions.\\" It may be the closest thing to a recorded hootenanny released on a major label in the last 20 years, and the musicianship is superb. What's missing is a feeling that this is flowing naturally. Springsteen sings several of the songs like he's gargling - the affectation is obvious. Why it was considered necessary is something I don't get. While I can comprehend the idea of recording them live with a mostly acoustic band, the end result is mostly stagecraft without emotional investment other than a good time for the musicians.<br /><br />The real moment for me came just a few months ago. I got to see Tao Rodriguez Seeger (Pete's grandson) play live and Tao incorporates several of Pete's songs into his sets. The encore was \\"Bring 'Em Home,\\" a raging anti-war anthem. Tao tore into it with all the edge of The Clash. On this CD, Springsteen treats it like a museum exhibit. Bruce and the band perform it like they're giving a reading to a college study. When Seeger wrote the song, he was p-o'd and meant it. When Tao sang it, he (to paraphrase The Sex Pistols) meant it, maaaan. And here, Springsteen and the gang want you to know that they really, really like it, and isn't that great? Well...no. Well done and proficient, yes. But Pete Seeger isn't a museum piece, and shouldn't be presented as one.

031606792X|5.0|Just finished Breaking Dawn. I'm sad though. It feels as though I lost an old friend. A true confidant has left me. I suppose this is what Bella and the rest of the Cullen's felt like when they learned of Alice and Jasper's departure. I was all but finished with BD two weeks ago. I left a scarce few chapters unread for two whole weeks. I was delaying the inevitable. I did not want the Cullen's story to end. I wanted it to go on. I want to know what becomes of the Volturi, when and how do they revolt against the obvious power that is the Cullen's? Because you know Caius' panties are in a right fine twist! I want to know if what Bella had seen in Nahuel's starings were correct. Will Nahuel look to pursuit a relationship with Nessie? And if so, what will Jacob think of it? Oh the question that arise with an ending like BD. In my own masochistic ways, I hope that Bill Condon will make an alternate ending for the special features. A couple actually. I would love to see what the fight would have looked like had Kate and Tanya had gotten away from Garrett and the Cullens. And, of course what if Bella could not extend her \\"shield\\" way from herself? Oh what a tangled web we weave? Both alternate scene would be awesome. Lets just hope that good ole MR. Condon thinks of that. But I digress. I have Fanfiction to keep me happy! If only these stories could be made into films! Oh the debauchery that would entail! lol
B002ZG997C|5.0|This movie was brilliant in plot, progress, characters, and concept.    However, it's not the type of movie everyone would appreciate.  It's somewhere along the lines of I Am Legend. The transitions might make it harder for some people the follow, but I believed it was a great movie.
0307454541|4.0|This excellent mystery took me a quite some time to get into. The book is a translation from Swedish and many new and unfamiliar names and places fill its pages. Once I became accustomed to these things, I was hooked. The character development is amazing, and it is hard not to fall in love with the underdog, the girl with the dragon tattoo, and her unusual ways. The mystery is finely crafted and multiple plots give added interest. Hang in there, dear reader, during those first couple hundred tough pages. It is worth the effort.

1577314808|5.0|I read this book in one sitting while under the influence of LSD. Once I finished the book I felt enlightened and my mind was clearer and calmer than it had ever been before. This book goes into great detail about the ego, and LSD is a substance that directly taps into ones self and temporarily provides relief from egoic thought making it a great complement to the book. They go hand in hand. It's difficult to articulate my experience, but I can't recommend reading this book on LSD enough. Trust me, you'll thank me.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|This album, as well as all of Kylie's albums, just put a smile on my face.  I don't care if its a disco pumping beat, or a slow ballad, any song she does just makes me want to sing along and lifts up my mood.  I had the fortune to meet her in person.  She is so genuine and nice, its no wonder she's been doing this for almost 25 years.

0321525655|5.0|Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity. - Charles Mingus<br /><br />Garr Reynolds combines his communications expertise (narrative and design), his experience as a jazz musician, and the tenets of Zen simplicity to undertake a noble endeavor: improve the quality and effectiveness of slide ware presentations.<br /><br />His book, Presentation Zen, summarizes key points at the end of each chapter, and uses visual examples throughout to illustrate these key points.  But his goal is much more than simply providing a handbook with tips for making better presentations.  The real ambition of the book is revealed in the text where he attempts to change the way you think about presentations.<br /><br />I suspect this will be the most difficult part for most readers, especially those who may be looking for a quick fix or checklist.  Putting yourself \\"in the audience\\" to develop your presentation and using slides to illustrate and punctuate your \\"spoken\\" narrative (the real presentation) will be a challenge to most business and technology presenters.  But the greatest challenge may be the time it takes to achieve a \\"less is more\\" presentation.  It is so much easier and quicker to stuff everything into a slide deck than to take the time required to achieve the simplicity, clarity and restraint the author advocates.  As he states, \\"Simplicity is not easy, in fact, it is hard.\\"<br /><br />Editing all of the information into its simplest form, illustrating it well, and practicing the presentation until you can deliver it as naturally as a coffee shop conversation takes time and commitment.  However, if you are willing to think differently and invest the time required to develop, design and deliver more effective presentations, this book can most certainly help you achieve that end.<br /><br />PS - The author also has a very popular blog on presentation design and delivery at [...].

Not only did I not have to wait for it to ship and arrive, but I also found that the download went quite painless and the quality was excellent. It also saved me having to rip it to my computer to put it to her MP3 player that we got as well. Digital downloads are how I am going to buy my music from now on.
0385335989|4.0|I really love this series of books. This one was a bit harder for me to get into for some reason. Yet, once certain plot twists started happening I couldnt put it down. The only thing is there were certain plot lines that seemed to just drop. So much so I had to go back and re read certain chapters to make sure I wasnt missing anything. If you have not read the book yet, please stop here.. I dont want to ruin anything for you.. so this is kind of a spoiler...........What REALLY happened to Lord John Grey and Willie? You will notice that Gabaldon leaves us with Jaime leaving Willie in the cave waiting for him to come back from being with the Indians, and leaves Lord John Grey with Claire recovering from the Pox. She aggravates me, because she jumped from these stories right into Roger and Brianna and left us wondering what the heck happened to them??? Yes, they come back later in the book, but we know nothing of how they got back home or what prompted them to go back or anything like that. I seriously thought I missed something and had to go back and re read some of the chapters because it bugged me so much that I didnt know what happened to these characters. And what about ( I cant remember his name now) the guy that had gotten angry and scalped the Indians. He went to Claire's and talked with her, but that was it.... where did he go? What happened to him? Maybe I am just missing something? Was it not that big of a deal to everyone else? Just curious. So if I have missed something can someone who has read these books help me out?<br /><br />Thanks!

0618918248|5.0|Among the rash of recent books espousing the cause of atheism, I find the arguments in this book and the style of Dawkin's writing to be especially impressive. As a professed agnostic, I squirmed regularly at some of my rationalizations which have little basis in logic and I laughed and delighted at Dawkin's refutations of commonly cited reasons to believe in God, especially the literal God of the Bible. He is especially convincing about the tenuous relationship between religion and morality. Much of his negativity about religion is due to the inclination of the religious to be absolutely convinced of their beliefs and quite closed to any kind of argument and to their tendency to be absolute in their morality. I do have a lot of sympathy for those matters.<br />  I find, however, that Dawkins, as well as other authors who are opposed to religious beliefs, often denounce things that are either neutral or have potential value in spite of weak logical underpinnings. While I prefer the rationale that Dawkins presents about the nature and development of the universe, I also find that some products of religion- notions of spirituality, creations of beauty in music, art, dance, architecture, etc.- are given little credit. It may have been wasteful to build the great cathedrals of Europe or the magnificent temples of Asia but they do stand as monuments to human creativity and provide ongoing pleasure today outside of their function as religious centers. Inspiration for the El Grecos and the Bachs of the world should be seen as byproducts of the religious experience, logical or not. I do not contest Dawkin's argument that religious has been the source of many wars and other problems in human history.<br />  This is fine book for either non-believers who will delight in its pages and find new and convincing arguments or support for their beliefs or believers who have another opportunity to examine their own faiths and weigh them on the scale of logic. I found the book very well written and quite interesting. It is well worth reading.written and quite interesting. It is well worth reading.
044024367X|1.0|You can discout my review I suppose because I didn't finish the book, that is how poor I thought of it and I am very much a fan of the series up to this point. I really didn't find much compelling in this book to keep me on until the end. I am currently reading the next book in the series (and back to the expected enjoyment) so I ain't holding a grudge against Mr Child. This one just doesn't measure up to the rest.
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi is good, there is no debating that. I began this book and thought I would love it. During Part One, Pi Patel is a character describing his life. I enjoyed it. Thinking Part Two would be the same, I eagerly awaited what Martel had in store for us next. However, I thought the story began to drag. It was almost two hundred pages with next to no dialogue. You are placed in Pi's head, having him narrate the story as he experienced it. It was hard to push through those two hundred pages. It got old after a while.   Currently a high school junior, I got to the end of this book with one thought. Huh? I found it confusing. I am not sure if that is because I do not understand the deeper significance, but I found it hard to comprehend. I am unsure of all the praise this book has gotten, because I don't understand what people found so great about it. I thought it was good, but not praiseworthy. Although I enjoyed the ending, I thought it was very anti-climactic. It was a good book and the writing was very good, but it was just not the book for me.

B002SF9YUM|5.0|I have to be honest that I decided to watch Little Ashes just to see Robert Pattinson.  I am a fan of the Twilight series and wanted to see other movies by the various artists involved.  I was pleasantly suprised at how good Pattinson truly is. I have been enjoying him in the Twilight series but have not felt that he gets to show his true range as an actor.  I have to say that this movie is not appropriate for 50% of the Twilight fans.  But, for those old enough and those intersted really need to watch this.  Pattinson portrays Dali so well.  Now I have to add that my new favorite actor is Javier Beltran.  Wow, he was passionate and beautiful.  I am excited to view other films from him.  I felt his pain in his battle of the life he wanted to live and the life he knew he had to live.  The chemistry between these two artists was wonderful.  I am so excited to see what they offer us in the years to come.

Each disc is dual-sided, with the contents of each side being a bit-for-bit copy (a \\"disc image\\") of a previous DVD release.  Usually the very first DVD release of a film is used as the master for each side, which could be either single-layer or dual-layer.  If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The \\"4 Film Favorites\\" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.<br /><br />### ABOUT THE MATRIX COLLECTION ###<br /><br />THE MATRIX<br />* Year: 1999<br />* Runtime: 2:16:13<br />* Video Format: 16:9 Widescreen<br />* DVD Production Date: August 2, 1999<br />* Region: 1<br />* Layers: 2<br />* Audio Languages: English<br />* Subtitle Languages: English<br />* Extras: Commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss and visual effects supervisor John Gaeta and editor Zach Staenberg, Music-Only Track with Commentary by composer Don Davis, \\"Making The Matrix\\" Featurette, Cast & Crew Bios & Filmographies (Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Joel Silver, The Wachowski Brothers), \\"Follow the White Rabbit\\" Feature (giving access to 9 behind the scenes featurettes at various points in the movie), DVD-ROM Content.<br />* Easter Eggs: (1) The Red Pill on the bottom of the Special Features screen leads you to the \\"What Is Bullet Time?\\" featurette.

If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The \\"4 Film Favorites\\" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.<br /><br />### ABOUT THE BATMAN COLLECTION ###<br /><br />BATMAN<br />* Year: 1989<br />* Runtime: 2:06:10<br />* Video Format: 16:9 Widescreen<br />* DVD Production Date: February 8, 1997<br />* Region: 1<br />* Layers: 1<br />* Audio Languages: English, French<br />* Subtitle Languages: English, Spanish, French<br />* Extras: Cast & Crew Bios & Filmographies (Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Willians, Michael Gough, Jack Palance, Tim Burton), Production Notes (8 screens).<br /><br />BATMAN RETURNS<br />* Year: 1992<br />* Runtime: 2:06:23<br />* Video Format: 16:9 Widescreen<br />* DVD Production Date: April 9, 1997<br />* Region: 1<br />* Layers: 1<br />* Audio Languages: English, French<br />* Subtitle Languages: English, Spanish, French<br />* Extras: Cast & Crew Bios & Filmographies (Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Michael Murphy, Tim Burton), Production Notes (Special Effects, Hero & Villains [Batman, The Penguin, Catwoman], The Screenwriter, The Composer).<br /><br />BATMAN FOREVER<br />* Year: 1995<br />* Runtime: 2:01:31<br />* Video Format: 16:9 Widescreen<br />* DVD Production Date: April 24, 1997<br />* Region: 1<br />* Layers: 1<br />* Audio Languages: English, French<br />* Subtitle Languages: English, Spanish, French<br />* Extras: Cast & Crew Bios & Filmographies (Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Joel Schumacher), Production Notes (Additional Actors, Behind The Scenes, New Villains New Hero, Bob Kane).<br /><br />BATMAN & ROBIN<br />* Year: 1997<br />* Runtime: 2:04:45<br />* Video Format: 16:9 Widescreen<br />* DVD Production Date: September 23, 1997<br />* Region: 1<br />* Layers: 1<br />* Audio Languages: English, French<br />* Subtitle Languages: English, Spanish, French<br />* Extras: Cast & Crew Bios & Filmographies (Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Elle Macpherson, Stephen Goldblatt, Akiva Goldsman, Peter Macgregor-Scott, Joel Schumacher), Production Notes (Bob Kane And The Birth Of Batman, Creating The New Story, Friends And Foes, Recreating Gotham City, The Batmobile, The Redbird, The Freezemobile, Special Effects, The Costumes, Special Makeup).MAN RETURNS  * Year: 1992  * Runtime: 2:06:23  * Video Format: 16:9 Widescreen  * DVD Production Date: April 9, 1997  * Region: 1  * Layers: 1  * Audio Languages: English, French  * Subtitle Languages: English, Spanish, French  * Extras: Cast & Crew Bios & Filmographies (Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Michael Murphy, Tim Burton), Production Notes (Special Effects, Hero & Villains [Batman, The Penguin, Catwoman], The Screenwriter, The Composer).

0061743526|4.0|Loved the book as a teen and wanted a nice copy to keep for my teens.  Shame about the quality for a 50th Anniversary Edition.  Kids still enjoyed it.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|Best Roots album since Illadelph halflife.  If the majority of hiphop had even half of the quality of this album the culture wouldnt be on long standing life support. I love the fact that the Roots are always consistent with album releases even though Def Jam doesn't really promote thier work. Job Well Done by The Roots. Excellent album. I won't need to purchase much for the summer with this album release.
B003GDYN24|5.0|Kelis has always worked in much the same area as everyone from Miles Davis,Prince and even Todd Rundgren before her in the sense that she has a strong eclectic tack to her music while standing on a very solid ground of her own unique style no matter what she does. What that really means for those who listen to her music is that it can be frusterating to hear one song and one album she does to another crossing so many bridges,especially for those who don't see beneath that down to her powerful,intelligent delivery she's maintained on all of her music. This is a short album,refreshing during a two decade period where so many were intent on filling every last digitally encoded bit on a compact disk. The music is a total rejection of convention hip-hop/R&B hybrids and rather embraces a heavily dance oriented ethic that lies somewhere between the work of Giorgio Moroder,Depeche Mode and Daft Punk-with a little Timbaland thrown in too. On the other hand this is not a gimmicky,noisy production.Multi instrumentalist Damien Leroy and DJ Ammo provide a series of strong Frankie Knuckles style house textures that go as quick as a wink into intense techno beats and often bassy,riffy interludes as well as a decidedly 80's flavor in the production. The two things that are the most impressive about this album are the strengh of the song writing:that sense of constructivism where different melodies are arranged together to form a whole as well as the spacious and broad minded choice of words in Kelis's lyrics,with lyrics mingling personal freedom with the idea of love and romance on \\"4'th Of July (Firewords),\\"22'nd Century\\",\\"Emancipate\\" and the wonderful melodic developement of \\"Acapella\\". These are not songs with singular,easy to follow beats and repetative self centered lyrics full of sexually obvious statements. In every sense this is an album that embraces both the not too distant past,the present and the future musically and in terms of it's lyrical intent it offers thoughtful,poetic viewpoints on romance and the nature of love itself as it might be for the open and empathetic. It will not appeal to everyone accustomed to much of R&B and the like of the past decade or two because it's very much a futurist styled venture. But we all have to remember with artists like Kelis this is something to be expected and respected.ent it offers thoughtful,poetic viewpoints on romance and the nature of love itself as it might be for the open and empathetic.

B0039TD7RC|4.0|The new songs were really good I am a stones fan and had the original exile on main street. worth the money
0385523386|5.0|I love this book -- Kerman writes with dry wit and deep insight about her stint in a women's prison, and her love for her boyfriend waiting on the outside. She never condescends, she never feels sorry for herself -- she accepts the consequences of her action and comes to have as much regard for the friends she makes at Danbury as she does anger at the injustices of the American  penal system toward nonviolent offenders. A terrific read.
B003E48AYC|4.0|There seems to be a new constant surrounding Tim Burton: the cast will most likely include Johnny Depp and real-life companion Helena Bonham Carter, that it will be visually arresting and have incredibly unique art designs, and will most likely include the music compositions of Danny Elfman. But now there's a 4th: it might not be that good. Ever since Mars Attacks! in 1996, he's been weirdly inconsistent from the great (Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd) to the mediocre (Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). It's hard to tell whether it's studio manhandling or whether he's lost \\"the touch\\" or whatever it is but the one-after-another success of the late 80's/early 90's is kind of gone and whenever he makes a good movie now, it almost seems like a \\"finally!\\" reaction than anything. So when faced with the notion of adapting one of the king's of wild imagery which is very present in the Alice in Wonderland story, I'm thinking Tim Burton, one of the last few directors with an unmistakable style, will go completely hog-wild with it. So visually, yeah, it works. The rest?     Rather than re-tell the old familiar story of young Alice encountering Wonderland for the first time, Burton and Co. instead do what Steven Spielberg did with \\"Hook\\": a returning hero who can't remember ever having been there but everyone knows they have. So this time we have 19 year old Alice journeying back to Underland (as \\"Wonderland\\" was what she thought it was) and revisiting the old characters from the pipe-smoking caterpillar Absolem, the dimwitted twins Twiddledee and Twiddledum, the time-obsessed White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter. But if everyone's back then that also means the Red Queen is as well and Alice returning isn't making anything easier on her still-present love of beheadings.    Disney so far has had an excellent track record with stunning Blu-Ray image transfers and this allows the visuals of the film to shine and Burton still continues his knack for making some unique and at times, almost stunning visuals. But then you see the images created by computers (of which there is many) and it becomes a bit too obvious and certain scenes and characters almost look unfinished and just scream \\"we're green screen!\\" but the film on a visual standpoint does have a great look about it, unfinished or no. The score though by Danny Elfman is quite strong and while I wouldn't say it's one of his top works on a Burton movie, it's certainly one of the better ones in years.    Now we come down to the casting which to be honest, is really all over the place. The lead role played by Mia Wasikowska is part of it as she indeed has that confidence and almost bravado about the role yet at the same time that wonder and \\"what's going on?\\" attitude is clearly missing. I mean, even though she can't remember the first time she's been there, having disappearing cats with huge smiles or walking playing cards would certainly bring a bigger reaction than she does. Johnny Depp seems to be echoing his eccentric role as Willy Wonka but it isn't quite as lovable as Captain Jack was, another unhinged character. But then we have Helena Bonham Carter nearly completely stealing the movie as the Red Queen with a bulbous head (which strangely enough seems unnecessary when you see how well she looks sans digital ballooning) and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. The voice work of Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Michael Sheen and Stephen Fry are very much recommended as well.    Another slight problem I have with the movie is that it just feels slow, not necessarily boring like others have said but on one hand I felt like I didn't want to turn the movie off as I was being entertained by what I was seeing but I felt like I needed some snap in its step if you will, just a quicker pace. But then the 3rd act comes in and it's almost like a watered-down Chronicles of Narnia ending complete with a fight against a fire-breathing dragon, Alice in a metal knight armor and that damn DANCE! It's here the 3rd act just becomes too noticeable as a problem and whether you're into the tone and pace and visuals of the film or not, the last parts feel really out of place.    Is the film worth seeing? I would suggest a viewing but when you have people saying it was one of the worst films this year to other people saying they really loved it, well, kind makes a recommend hard but I will say that the film isn't a travesty nor is it a misunderstood masterpiece. It's good, sadly nothing more and luckily nothing less.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I am a person that ALWAYS have buyers remorse.  This is only the third item that I have purchased in recent years that I do not have an ounce of regret or remorse.  The first two were my Blackberry pearl and then later my iPhone.  I must now add this to the list.  I love it and got a GREAT price.
B001GM28HO|1.0|I had to sit through this cd on a car ride from LA to San Fran and let me tell you, I'd rather slide down a fifty foot razor blade than listen to this crap again. At one point I wept and begged my girlfriend to turn it off-she didn't and so I dumped her when we got to SF. I think when you die and if there is a hell, Satan is playing this twenty-four seven while he shoves a red hot poker up your a*#!

B003IPC5UC|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, I liked it. The second time, I loved it. NPR had been previewing the album on-line before its release, I heard it then. It sounded nice enough, kind of like some of her other music, but didn't grab my attention as much I would have liked. When the CD arrived, though, it was like a whole different thing: All the intangibles that turn good songs into great ones were there, and it became apparent very quickly that this is one special album. The quality of the sound from the CD allowed me to hear all the wonderful production touches that fill this entire album.<br /><br />The first single, All the Lovers, is an instant classic, right up there with other Kylie hits. As of this writing, I can only guess what the other singles will be. There are simply too many great, euphoric dance songs here, with catchy hooks, interesting production, and lyrics about (what else?) love, sex, and dancing. Kylie and her production team self-consciously reference her brilliant Light Years and Fever albums, creating electro-disco dance pop that no one has done better than Kylie over the past decade. (Madonna's a riskier artist than Kylie, but her output is uneven, and the new breed of Lady Gaga et al. can't even come close to this quality).<br /><br />Aphrodite is another high water mark in the pop superstar's career. The songs, production, and performances are as good as they've ever been. Even the packaging is a step up, with a nice hard-back cd book and a series of pictures. I can't wait to see what she does for the inevitable concerts (and concert dvd) to follow. For Kylie fans, and fans of wonderful, upbeat, uplifting music, I couldn't recommend this more highly.
B00136NUAC|5.0|I read a handful of reviews prior to this purchase.  Some said it took a few listens.   For me it only took one for me to know it's a priceless album.  The complexity and genius behind it baffles me.  Such a layered album.    It's amazing.
B003E8P9G0|1.0|I found this book hard to get in to. I love to read and usually finish a book in a few days. I finished this book in 2 weeks. I just did not want to finish it but I did because I thought it might get better but it never did. I don't care that much about Egyptology so I don't think I will buy the next one in the series.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I saw this with my friends earlier, and we constantly made jokes throughout the entire film. At least it had a little more action than New Moon did, where Bella just cried the whole time. This time, Bella just can't decide who she wants; Edward or Jacob. She is always asking Edward to make her into a vampire. It still has plenty of lovey dovey moments. Victoria still wants revenge and creates an army of newborn vampires who are reckless and don't play by the rules. She plans to kill Bella. The vampires and the werewolves reluctantly decide to work together and fight Victoria and her army. If you are crazy over Twilight, I'm sure you'll love ECLIPSE!!!
B002VECM4A|3.0|This movie has obviously garnered a lot of praise, but I have to be honest and say that, subjectively, it didn't do much for me.<br /><br />One could argue that the movie does a service by showing us how truly miserable the circumstances of some people are, so that we understand and maybe even try to help.  But I'm already well aware that there are countless people in similar or worse circumstances, both within and beyond the US.  And I already care and try to help where I can.  In other words, the movie didn't tell me anything new and didn't compel me to do anything different.  Moreover, I didn't find that the movie portrayed these bad circumstances with any distinctive subtlety or nuances.  The experience of watching this movie was like the experience of having a run-of-the-mill nightmare.<br /><br />A different argument would be that the character of Precious shows us that people can be resilient, can break out of the vicious cycles in which they appear to be trapped, and can thereby show us the power of hope.  But does the movie really show that?  It seems to me that, at the end of the movie, Precious was on her way to improving her circumstances, but the improvement was about going from absolutely horrible to merely lousy circumstances, not from bad to good.  I personally don't find that all that uplifting.<br /><br />As far as the acting, it was pretty good across the board.  As expected, the lead actors were strong, and the surprise for me was Mariah Carey's entirely believable portrayal of a social worker.  Who knew that she can act?<br /><br />Considering all of the above points, I can only give this movie three stars, and I can only recommend it to people who's lives have been too short or sheltered to realize how bad some people have it out there.
0767827902|5.0|Having seen this in the early 70s, I recently found out that my wife had never seen it. Seeing it again was an incredible experience. It is, without a doubt, one of the finest films ever done in America. Script, Cast, Location, film technique, editing, and also the great soundtrack, it's as perfect as it can be. It's stronger now (for me at least) than I remember it being for me in 71. It seems to have aged extremely well. To put it in perspective, it is to me now what Gone With The Wind would have been to me in 1971, in terms of an old film being seen again. But this has most definitely become better with time, which I can't say about Gone with the Wind. It's almost a documentary, but with a great storyline, of a time and place that doesn't exist anymore. Just do yourself a favor and either buy a copy of this director's cut for you library, or rent it. You won't regret it.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I admit that I'm not the target audience for the Twilight series.  I do, however, review all movies, good or bad, and that (along with the desires of my better half) warranted a trip to the theatre.<br /><br />So I ventured out amongst the sparkling pink hues, reverberating a perpetual gum-smacking staccato, and felt every bit as claustrophobic as Black Friday.  After purchasing tickets I peered out the theatre and couldn't help but notice the glazed-over stares of the tween throngs moving sloth-like towards the door in a pubescent phalanx and ponder the similarity to a Romero film.  Swann of the Dead?<br /><br />The Twilight series left off with Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) stuck in a strained love triangle between mortal enemies:  vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner).  If there are pangs of anguish or throes of passion, they're masked by what I can only assume is a bout of Botox left on the cutting room floor of New Moon, because Bella shows nearly no emotion whatsoever.  At certain points of the film the battle for Ella's heart really started to resemble scenes from Weekend at Bernie's.  Nonetheless, Team Edward and Team Jacob must put aside their differences to collectively protect Bella from a growing coven of sadistic newborn vampires - an army spawned by bloodthirsty vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) to avenge the loss of her lover - conspicuously ravaging the Seattle landscape.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bella's vicissitudes about love and immortality grow tiresome, revealing major acting flaws and bad script writing.  The dialogue between pale-faced lovers - not for racial or vampire reasons, but because she's lifeless - may as well have been a vampire transformation conversation of \\"Uh-huh,\\" followed by \\"Nu-uh.\\"  When Rosalie mentions that being \\"frozen means never moving forward,\\" it immediately clears up why Bella, who appears to have Bell's palsy (Bella's palsy?), is so readily accepted into the cold, undead clan.  As for the beleaguered choice between lovers, Edward, the pedophile stalker, and tritagonist Jacob, who leers at Bella like a rapist while making necrophilia-related comments about \\"loving Bella after she's dead,\\" is a situation that only gets muddier with each film.<br /><br />The film's primary positive is that the script finally surfaces above the 20+ minutes of staring contests in the previous two Twilight movies.  In fact, learning that the rebirth of Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) occurred while he served as a Cavalry officer in the Civil War, and discovering Rosalie's (Nikki Reed) unfortunate transformation went a long way towards the character development and understanding of their roles.  Even better, however, is the Quileute folklore told with great reverence by Billy Black (Gil Birmingham).  I enjoyed that part very much.  Somewhere along the line, however, there is a subplot-anchor about the Volturi, which is evidently an ancient vampire word meaning \\"rigid acting superfluous to the script,\\" that adds nearly nothing and could have been removed without any coherency issues.  Direction was also notably improved over its prequels.  It should come as no surprise that the tension is better relayed and the minimal action comes in vicious rushes since David Slade directed [[ASIN:B000GI3KGC Hard Candy]] and [[ASIN:B00111YM5Q 30 Days of Night]] before tackling the Twilight series.<br /><br />Twilight addicts will want to fornicate with this sequel as background noise.  Average movies fans, many of whom probably hated the original and thought the second was an improvement, will still find Kristen Stewart's atrocious acting almost intolerable.  I must say, however, that the series is improving.  With any luck there will be less sparkling and fewer staring contests as the series progresses, and more details about the various characters who act as the crutch for Stewart and the weak script.beleaguered choice between lovers, Edward, the pedophile stalker, and tritagonist Jacob, who leers at Bella like a rapist while making necrophilia-related comments about \\"loving Bella after she's dead,\\" is a situation that only gets muddier with each film.

B003FMTZOM|4.0|Ive never actually like Christina Aguilera. Actually, I have always disliked her based on interviews and articles written about her.  She has put out some great singles but the only other full on album I own of hers is Stripped.  I absolutely love the lead single, Not Myself Tonight.  Yeah its sound is a little dated but its just a good dance song.  This album, other than a few missteps is a great listen.  She is getting a lot of flack for going the electronic route and utilizing autotone.  Some artists, like Britney Spears, make a career out of it and its easy to say that someone with such a fantastic voice shouldnt be distorting her vocals.  Relax people, its just pop music.  Listen to Bionic, Elastic Love, Des Nudate, My girls and Vanity.  Just some great pop/dance songs that would fit on any party playlist.  On a side note, i got to see her perform for the Early Show last month and I have to say i was pleasantly surprised. She was very sweet and signed as many autographs as she could.  Give this album a try, you may be very surprised.

6305291446|4.0|Well, its been twenty years since the first Halloween, and ten years since Part 4.<br /><br />Now since the terrible Halloween 6, I was really not giving this one hope at all. But, I watched it all way through, and was amazed. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode (this time with her son played by Josh Harnett). Laurie is a school teacher know, and its around that time of year......you guessed it, Halloween! Well Laurie has put most of her past with Michael Myers aside, and lives a nice life now. But.....Michael Myers is back, wanting revenge (wow, hasn't this guy gotten weak in 20 years?!)<br /><br />Michael tracks her down and just starts killing all of the people that work with her, not mich can be said, alot of the film is probably Laurie with her son or boyfriend.<br /><br />But the main scene of the film, and what made me like this film, was the \\"fight scene\\", where Laurie comfronts Michael at the school, where the roles are switched, and Laurie is hunting Michael, after an evil game of hide and seek in the school, Laurie finds him, and pushes him off a high floor of the building, just like at the end of the first movie. To double check Michael is dead, she decapitates Michael, to the films end, which Would've been a great ending to the series, but sadly, they ruined it.......with a resurrection.<br /><br />___<br /><br />But theres one more thing I should talk about before I go, at a horror convention, I picked up:<br /><br />\\"Halloween 7: The Revenge of Laurie Strode\\" (aka the workprint of H20). In my opnion, the films are ALMOST the same, the workprint just shows some minor added scenes and a slight alternate ending, but in this case, I'm still rooting for the actual theatrical version, H20!

While this is an overall more upbeat album for Sia (which is good - very fresh for her) the few tracks that are slower than the rest are also very good. \\"I'm in Here\\" is a bit slower and very beautiful.    Also, I disagree with the reviewer who said this is a \\"pop\\" album. OK, sure, you can define it that way, but it's definitely no Britney Spears or Lady Gaga. Puh-lease! It's still 100% Sia, at her best.
B001WCN23W|1.0|We all would just LOVE to love the new Rolling Stones UMG remasters.  Now, I have the Virgin 1994 Sticky Fingers cd, the Japanese pressings and this new UMG offering.  This new UMG release is GAR-BARGE.  The LOUDNESS WAR is on.  For example, using a waveform audio editor to look at the UMG version of Can't You Hear Me Knocking, you can see the brickwall limiting right up to 0 db full scale.  What that means is clipping, causing god awful distorion and practically NO dynamic range.  It sounds TERRIBLE folks.  The Virgin and Japanese cds are so much better.  They have good dynamic range and no clipping distortion as a result of \\"THE LOUDNESS WAR.\\"  I simply don't understand the rationale behind ruining a perfectly good product with BAD mastering and processing.  Do yourself a favor. Look for the old Virgin releases.  Stay way away from this one.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|This series is wonderful if you get the one narrated by David Attenborough. The one narrated by Oprah is just ridiculous and written at the 5th grade reading level. David Attenborough does such a great job!
0060987464|5.0|this book is a great book for any fan of manson or even the nonfan it shows a different side to life itself and shows that even though a decision isn't right morally it might be the right one for you at the time
B00368PSN2|3.0|Calling this a science fiction movie would be like calling The Wizard of Oz a movie about Kansas. I am a dedicated science fiction fan and have been one for a long time; although there are some occasional references to science fiction I would classify this movie as much more like fantasy-horror. This in itself is not necessarily bad; it's just not real science fiction.<br /><br />The movie starts with the scene of a space craft crashing into Earth during the age of the Vikings; from that point on it pretty much becomes a fantasy-horror film with lots of slashing and guts replete with a terrible monster that starts wreaking havoc on the local Viking communities.<br /><br />It just so happens I'm not a fantasy-horror film fan so I was disappointed to see how the film was developing; if you are a fan of this type of movie you may enjoy it. I had watched the film expecting a little more science fiction than what was delivered.<br /><br />I'll admit this is just a personal preference but wanted to caution you the film is basically not a science fiction movie. I gave it three stars because it does a pretty good job of being a fantasy-horror film.
030726999X|5.0|Loved this 3rd book and final in the series.  Some closure finally.  In spite of the fact that I loved the book and the characters involved, I have to say this 3rd one required some patience in remembering all the Swedish names (often similar).  But worth it in the end!!!!!  There are plenty of places this series could have continued to go if the author hadn't died unexpectedly.
B002TZS5GU|5.0|Well, it's finally happened. Some hideous virus has wiped out most of the world's population. Now, a group of four young people, led by Chris Pine (STAR TREK) and his brother, are heading toward a childhood beach resort. They don't know what they'll find there, but at least it's a destination, a goal in the middle of total catastrophic chaos. CARRIERS is a very grim look at a dire situation. It's increasingly clear that this story cannot end on a positive note. We are taken along on this adventure as witnesses to the final curtain for our species. The growing horror of the subject matter is handled perfectly, as in RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR, we are not spared any of the tragedy or the irony of it all. There are no meandering, flesh-craving zombie hordes. No sci-fi scenarios or roving bands of post-apocalyptic road pirates. Nothing, save for disease, desperation, and death. CARRIERS is one of the bleakest, most downbeat PG-13 films I've ever seen. I loved every minute of it...
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is destined to be the greatest Batman film ever.  Perhaps even the best superhero film ever.  Perhaps even the greatest action film ever: in an era when anything is possible with CGI effects, director Nolan goes back to the old-fashioned method of actually creating the stunts in Dark Knight with wires, stuntmen, stunt drivers, and explosives.  He blows up an actual building for the Gotham General explosion.  He flips an actual 18-wheeler truck head-over-tail.  That's actually Christian Bale standing on top of a 100-story building.  This use of \\"real\\" effects/stunts is vital in a Batman movie, because the entire premise of the Batman is that he's a \\"normal\\" guy without superpowers.  This is the first key to why the Dark Knight is so great.    The second key is the use of the Joker as the villain.  He is the \\"main\\" villain in the Batman pantheon, but he's always been problemmatic.  Because he's insane and can do anything, there's often a lack of consistency between stories and even within stories.  Heath Ledger's Joker does not fall into this trap.  Oh, he's certainly insane!  But as the film progresses, you begin to see the method in his madness.  Ledger's performance is certainly very good - worthy of the Oscar he won for the role.  But I'd like to point out additionally the fact that the story and screenplay writers, along with Ledger, have created a self-consistent version of the Joker, finally making him a worthy main foil for Batman.    I think this film is most effective on first viewing - I really enjoyed the gradual unfolding of the Joker's master plan from seemingly random events.  I also enjoyed the relationship (often stormy) between the levels of Gotham's law enforcement - the D.A. Harvey Dent, the detective James Gordon, and the vigilante Batman.  The action is vicious and intense, but there's not too much of it.  The film slows down between its special effects extravaganzas to allow relationships to be viewed: relationships between Rachel and Dent, between Rachel and Bruce Wayne, between Gordon and the police commisioner, even between the Joker and his mobster allies.    However, it is also enjoyable on repeated viewings, and there are many sequences that are so busy that you'll likely want to watch them repeatedly.  Hence, this is a good Blu-ray to get!  In addition, there are some nifty extras, the most interesting are the breakdowns on the action sequences, where you get to see the stuntmen in action.  There are also a number of \\"Gotham Tonight\\" interviews - a local public affairs program for the people of Gotham.  It features the characters of the movie (Dent, Bruce Wayne, etc.) basically giving their back stories.  The acting is a little forced in these, but they are entertaining nonetheless.
014241543X|5.0|One of the great things about the Twilight phenomenon, is that it's inspired  people to start reading again. Whether you loved Twilight, or hated it, you READ. I was always a reader when I was younger. Over the years I read less and less, and then I read Twilight, and it sparked something in me again. Since then, my appetite for books has become insatiable. I've been devouring them. Reveling in every last delicious word.<br /><br />I am so monumentally ecstatic that my new life with the written word has led me to this breathtaking, and truly \\"achingly beautiful\\" novel. I'm still reeling from my experience. I read this book in one night. Literally the 8 hours I should have been sleeping, were sacrificed to this story. It was totally worth it! I could not put it down, even through the tears. I'm so in love with Mia and her family; In love with her entire life! I've read some of the other reviews, both positive and negative. For those of you who didn't \\"get it\\" or \\"get sucked in\\" I can only sincerely hope that one day you do, because you must be missing out on a LOT in life.<br /><br />I feel so inspired, so alive! So thankful. Good lord Gayle, thank you SO MUCH for this! You wrote in your book that you leave it to the readers to decide about your writing, and I say STAY!!!!! STAY!! WRITE!! PLEASE CONTINUE WRITING! I am your loyal fan, for life.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Just updated to the 5.20 filmware software on Sony BDP S2000ES, not a cheap player!  Updated 5.20 filmware.  Movie player worked before with Avatar.  After the update it's doesn't play anymore.  I don't care if you have $200.00 player or $5000.00 dollar player; it's not worth the time and trouble to play it in Blue Ray.  Don't waste your money on blue ray.  Sony does not have ducks in a row for this technology!
081297381X|5.0|Skimming through the most recent 3 pages of reviews on this book, it is pretty obvious that there is a love-hate relationship that readers have with this book.    Trying not to be too elitist, I think you need a certain level of intelligence and education to even understand the depths of what the writer is getting at.    Is the book 30 or 40% too long?  Absolutely.  Could it have benefited from a good editor?  Without question.  Can an intelligent reader who is willing to look beyond all of that gain some life-altering knowledge from slogging through it?    Undoubtedly.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|Evangelion 1.11 is an updated, movie version of the series first six episodes. While the animation is much better, and the new CG fits in perfectly, you're not going to find much here that's new as far as the plot goes. The little bit it does add, though, is a great set up for the next three movies, which are completely different from the rest of the series.     I've found that this serves as a good introduction to the series, and in fact you could almost watch this, ignore the very very last part (as it's basically MASSIVE spoilers for the original series), and then continue the series from episode 7. However, by doing this you would miss out on a lot of the more subtle parts of the first six episodes that couldn't be fit into a movie, as well as a lot of character development. To each his own, though.    I would definitely recommend watching the original series first before watching the movie; this merely serves as the set-up to something greater with the next three movies.
0399156577|1.0|First, the audio narrator was UNBEARABLE...She had a small s-lisp that kept jerking me out of the story--which was bad enough without the constant interruption. She gave the main character a sickly sing-song voice and put a STRONG inflection on the last word of each of her sentences. It was maddening! On top of that she talked obnoxious baby-talk to the dogs--Ugh! The hero's charactor was so flat and unemotional while every other character came through like a small child trying to do voices...cringe-worthy.     Secondly, THE STORY STUNK! It was a boring manual on dog training with a few moments of babbling dialogue about NOTHING. The heroine/hero were bland and rude respectively and together they were totally forgettable. The serial killer was stuck in here and there like an afterthought. The ending was just as unimpressive. I'd rather listen to nails scraped down a chalkboard than have to endure this book again.
B003MX5P20|5.0|gotta say how much I am enjoying enriqu'e new album. It contains a variety of different styles in english and spanish, from the upbeat almost clubby feel of \\"I like it \\" with Pitbull , to the gentle , lilting sway of \\"cuando me enamoro \\" with juan-luis guerra . And each song works beautifully to create a wonderful summer cd.  I bought the \\"deluxe\\" edition at Target which includes 3 bonus tracks (in english)which appear on the UK version but not the US edition.   I have all of Enrique's albums and really feel like this is his best so far!If you liked any of his other cd's ,I am sure you will love it too !
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series reminds you how freedom was bought with the blood and sweat of our veterans.

0307387178|5.0|A fascinating psychological portrait of solo wanderer Chris McCandless who died alone in Alaska in 1992. The author draws parallels between Chris's exploits and his own odyssey: climbing the Devil's Claw in Alaska--solo, after 3 nearly life-ending attempts. The account notes the conflict that sometimes occurs between fathers and sons, the derring-do of specific young men such as John Muir who shared characteristics with Chris; and in particular, connects McCandless to these threads. Time and perspective change continually in the tale which covers a period of about 4 years. Krakauer skillfully weaves in McCandless's journal notes, the underlinings in his books, and the letters he wrote friends he made on the road.<br />Krakauer wrote several articles for various outdoor magazines soon after McCandless's body was found in the Alaskan wilderness. Most interpreted the death as the result of poor planning and McCandless's having made key miscalculations.  Later, Krakauer adopted a more sympathetic interpretation. McCandless had already demonstrated his ability to live off the land for extended periods of time.<br />I was struck by the tragic character of this story. Chris had adopted the name Alexander Supertramp when he began his travels shortly after graduating from Emory University. He left his parents without a word of his plans; he disappeared without leaving a trace. He wrote a check to Oxfam for the remainder of his education trust fund (a cool 24K) and adopted the life of a wanderer deeply critical of the system. Although they hired a private investigator, Walt and Billy McCandless were never able to locate their son. Krakauer believes Chris had learned some ugly family secrets a year or so before his graduation and was never able to forgive his father. The irony of the book is that a secret so ugly his parents never told it, is now available to the public in a book that was apparently written with the cooperation of the McCandlesses.
0743454537|3.0|Is this book well-written? Yes. Did it keep me turning the pages? Yes. Would I recommend it? No. But since I don't want to spoil it for potential readers, I will speak abstractly. On the surface this novel is all about issues and personalities or character(s). But it soon becomes apparent that the driving force is plot and drama. This becomes absurdly so at the end of the book, where, first, there is a surprise that completely undercuts both the main issue and the interestingness of the main character, Anna, and second there is a plot development that \\"resolves\\" things shockingly and movingly but ultimately gratuitously. The main disappointment was the former, though. I felt it was a betrayal of the reader, who had gone along grappling with what turns out to be a non-issue. For all its up-to-the-minute moral \\"relevance\\" and complexity, this book opts for a perfectly moral universe of totally \\"good\\" people instead of real characters facing real dilemmas.

1423113381|4.0|and he has a great story formula going for him.  This was a page turning read and in the same way Percy Jackson inspired kids to learn about the Greeks, it will make kids want to learn ancient Egyptian history.  I give him props for that.
B002VECMAO|4.0|An excellent film with fine acting and a very good story.  Worth more than one viewing.  Both video and audio are high quality.  Video has excellent depth to the image and good color fidelity.  PCM audio is top quality.  Rear channels add dimension but not much else.  This is a surprisingly good movie, something of a sleeper that deserves a higher rating than generally given by the critics.  You will most likely talk about this film after you see it.  If you enjoyed \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou,\\" you will enjoy \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats.\\"  Recommended.  (Viewed on 1080p, 120hz screen; audio KEF Reference and Sequerra T1 speakers, with appropriate cables and electronics.)
B003NTSBUG|5.0|This is the best mystery movie that I have seen in a while. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what is going to happen next. I don't think that it's boring or dull like the other comments. I think that Leonardo did a really good job in this movie. And WOW was that a surprise ending. I was guessing that one thing was going to happen, but it ended up being something totally different. This is a MUST-RENT or MUST-BUY movie!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|If you liked Encore, Relapse and Refill (which I did, I loved those albums, as well as all his other works) do not buy this expecting more of the same.  I would still strongly recommend this CD for fans of his previous releases, however, it will probably take a few times listening through it to really like it and get where he is coming from now.  The very first time I put it in I felt let down, but now it is the soundtrack to my life.    In this CD I would say that he is really at the top of his game in the sense that this was something he seems to have wanted to do because -forgive the cliche- he has found peace, rather than feeling compelled to do it by anger and addiction.  There are so many lines and elements within the songs and beats that will knock you on your ass every time you hear it because of how clever or how good it is.

031606792X|1.0|Now, just to be clear, I actually thought the first book in this series was pretty cute.  I didn't think Anne Rice had anything to worry about, but I still acknowledged it was a sweet, endearing little fantasy.  I understood neither hatred or adoration.  I just thought the book was...nice.  The next two were starting to overstay their welcome, in my view, introducing themes I wasn't terribly comfortable with as well, but I still slogged on, determined to see it through and have an opinion one way or another on the newest cultural phenomenon.    But this...this just crashed and burned.  Breaking Dawn, as far as I am concerned, is a failure on every level.  It fails casual readers, it fails literature as a whole, but perhaps its worst crime is that it also fails its fans, the people who devoted so much energy to making this series what it has become.    At the start of this absolute catastrophe of a novel, Bella Swann is finally (FINALLY) marrying Edward Cullen.  All things proceed as might be expected, and the newlyweds jet off to a honeymoon in somewhere only super-rich vampires like Mr. Cullen can possibly afford, in addition to his cars and awesome house (way to be a philanthropist, Ed).  Bella and Edward there engage in the typical matrimonial bliss, now that they're safely married and Meyer's tedious abstinence preaching can be finally set aside.  Everything is actually going okay up to this point, for all that it feels a bit like a coda to Eclipse that didn't quite make it into the final cut.    Then everything really falls apart.    It's difficult for me to adequately discuss the true impossible awfulness of this novel without a few spoilers, so be warned, some follow.    Bella gets knocked up.  With a creepy vampire love-child.  Linda Blair + Every Idealized and Uninteresting Little Angel Ever = Renesmee Cullen (and yes, that name is thoroughly as stupid even after seeing it a thousand times).      My explanation?  Meyer really couldn't think of anywhere to go.  The series, like most vampire stories, is basically an expression of feminine fantasizing, sexual and otherwise (albeit in this case with some moralizing thrown in).  But Bella's basically GOT Edward now.  He's her husband, the deed's done, and Meyer's suspense just made a gurgling noise as it went down the toilet.  Team Jacob vs. Team Edward?  Gone.  Edward possibly vanishing?  Gone.  They're together forever, the perfect princess story.  Cinderella has married Prince Charming, and they ride off together in his chariot, into the glorious sunset.  Meyer's problem is that she has to figure out what to do next, now that Bella and Edward are actually wedded and bedded.  She has two options: complicate their relationship (and thus their characters), or introduce some new element.  This being Meyer, it's basically a no-brainer.    So, we proceed to Phase II of little-girl fantasy: having the CUTEST BABY EVERRRRRR!!!!  Unfortunately, this destroys everything.  Meyer's fantasy has always been a simple enough story.  The action centers around the star-crossed lovers: everything else is a force either bringing them together or driving them apart.  Now, however, Meyer dumps it, dumps what legions of readers fell in love with, and starts talking about Blair Baby.  A LOT.      Edward, naturally, gets marginalized.  If he transitions into Super-Dad, then that would take time away from spending all his time in (mostly mute) adoration of Bella, which would be too much complexity for him to manage, most likely.  So Meyer goes with the alternative, just...leaving him out for the most part.  Oh, don't get me wrong, he's always THERE, always hovering aimlessly around in the wings, but where's the mysterious, intriguing vampire lad from the first three?  Where's his undying devotion and dramatic commitment?  Who, pray, is this new fellow who just sort of stands around either whining or grinning like an idiot?  Edward plays, once the baby enters the picture, like Bella's faithful Beagle: he lounges around, barks prettily on command, and is always available when Bella needs fluffy comfort.  But Edward has no drive anymore, no apparent reason to exist.  He's pointless, a part of the scenery.    Of course, that's nothing to how poor JACOB gets screwed over.    I admit, I was never a big Jacob fan.  I never really had a \\"team\\", per se (I understand that, having a Y chromosome, that's pretty much beyond me anyway), but if I had to affiliate one way or t'other, I'd probably end up on Team Ed.  I always knew he was going to win anyway, so I didn't see the point in supporting Captain Buff.  But even I was appalled at how Meyer destroys everything that made Jacob likable.  And so FAST.      It happens in two quick strokes.  First, Jacob's given his own point of view chapters.  BAAAD idea (mostly b/c Meyer isn't practiced at multi-character narrative and Jacob basically reads like Bella with painfully cheesy \\"guy jokes\\" thrown in).  THEN...yeah.  Superbaby comes along.  And in that instant, all of Jacob's doomed love for Bella, all of his faithfulness...it all gets blown apart, because actually, the WHOLE TIME, he was in love with the DAMN BABY.      Having now successfully annihilated anything interesting at all about her two male leads, Meyer blunders ahead with giving Bella the same treatment.  Part of Bella's limited interest has always been the possibility of her becoming a vamp, and undergoing all of the dramatic changes associated with such.  THAT'LL bring about some character shifts, by golly!  Or...so we thought.      Instead, Bella somehow gets to be improbably immune to newbie-vamp nuttiness, all so that Meyer can hastily move past anything interesting associated with Bella's BEING a vampire, and get back to business as usual.    (As a minor note here...Bella getting powerful.  Does it strike anyone else as deeply wrong that the ONLY POWER the female lead EVER gets in this series of being endlessly rescued by Alpha males...is given to her BYHER HUSBAND after she's successfully provided him with an heir?  Not to say Meyer intended it, but still...in conjunction with Bella always being a disturbingly powerless, anti-feminist little damsel in distress ANYWAY, this comes off as a little disturbing, to me at least.  Oh well, moving on...)    There's one last ish, of course, because Meyer has to go out with a bang.  The Volturi get the idea that Evil Baby is...oh, do we really care at this point?  Anyway, for a few breathless moments, it looks like Meyer is actually going to DO something with her series.  Bella and Edward's love MEANT something, because it brings about a battle between good vamps and bad vamps.  The Volturi shall be overthrown, and the victorious Cullens shall usher in a new era of human-vampire cooperation.  There shall be new Edwards and Bellas, new loves.  They shall become the Adam and Eve of a generation of change and cooperation between the two races.  There was actually a POINT to it all.  Hallelujah!    It looks like she's going to do it, too.  Meyer gets us RIGHT THERE, so close we can almost TASTE the triumphant ending.  Armies lined up, generals stalking out to spit terms at each other.  Two conflicting views of vampirisim coming into dramatic and terrible conflict, with the fate of the world and two races of intelligent life at stake.    Then Bella whips out the damn, damn, damn BABY.  And it's one more \\"Ain't my baby just the cuuuutest in da whole wide WORLD?!?\\"  And, as we sit there staring in stunned, horrified disbelief, the Volturi agree that the Blair Baby is indeed the cutest in da whole wide world, say \\"oops, our bad, sorreh\\", and pack right back off to Italy to supervise murder of humankind for the next zillion years.    But who cares, right, as long as Bella gets to be rich and pretty and have her trophy husband?  And let's not forget DA CUTEST BABY EVER!    God, could you get any more shallow with an ending?  Meyer not only denied the greater possibilities in her own narrative, she didn't even realize they were there.  I should have seen this coming, but somehow I didn't.  I hoped she would have something, ANYTHING, redeeming at the end of this long, interminable slog of a book.  Something that would make all my suffering worthwhile.    But ya know what?  I guess I have to accept that sometimes, disasters just do happen, and there is no silver lining.  Breaking Dawn is such a disaster, a purest expression of everything that is shallow, pointless, and insipid in an untalented writer tragically out of her depth.    If you can possibly avoid this ending, do it.  It is not worth the paper it is printed on.

B0015DROBO|4.0|I felt bored for about the first 3 chapters of this book, but they were important and tied the rest of the book together.  Definitely turned into a page turner.
015204907X|5.0|My two year old loves this book. At this point she is looking at the pages and telling me the story. Our house loves Mem Fox and this book is a great addition to our library. Easy to read and understand for the little ones. Keeps their interest with short phrases, yet has lots going on with the illustrations so that as they get familiar with the book, they can explore what else is going on in the story. My daughter has really evolved with this book from confirming learning colors, to pronunciation \\"where IS the green sheep\\" and focusing on a single item on the page. I highly recommend to all.

B001FA0W5W|3.0|I enjoyed this book and kudos to Taleb for making such a dry subject very interesting.    I prefer this book over the Black Swan since this book attacks all uncertainties in  life than Black Swan which is focused on just one type of uncertainty.    My biggest beef is when Taleb proudly proclaims  - \\"Instead of immediate philosophizing and working at McDonald's, he went to work as a trader to become financially secure\\"    Now Taleb is it not the whole idea of your book that many people are stuck in dead end jobs, suffer misfortunes or experience bad health just because of pure randomness in life in-spite of their best efforts and advises people to practice stoicism?    It looks like you did not follow your own advice by deterministically trying pursue illusory financial freedom at the same time making fun of Carlos and John who were trying to do the same.    My personal experience has been you need to have personal conviction about your positions in order to make money in the markets. Yes you could go wrong and lose your ass as happened to Carlos and John. But even the most successful investors/traders like Warren Buffet and George Soros had personal conviction. Do you really think Soros bet billions against the British Pound without personal conviction that he is going to make a profit?    Taleb is right on one aspect which is we need to have an open mind and review ones position constantly but not having personal conviction on your position is a sure way for mediocrity.    Peter Lynch clearly put it - \\"Show me a trader who always has a 10% stop loss and I will show you a portfolio with 10% loss\\"
B001B7CNXI|5.0|The video is 4/5  The sound is 5/5    You've all seen the movie, so no need to review it other than to say the two gun fights are the best I've seen in any movie. This is not a movie to think about, just do along for the ride and enjoy it. This movie does share something in common with the original, the movie has a good soundtrack. Nonpoint does a good job remaking Phil Collins In The Air Tonight. Colin Farrell does a good job, Jamie Fox continues to impress his ability to do drama, and Gong Li is attractive in her role.
1594200823|5.0|This book will rock your food consuming world.  In the name of capitalism the US food industry has worked hard to engineer food that does not satisfy your body's needs but rather makes you crave more food!  The genetically altered and hormone enhanced corn, meat, etc is killing Americans at increasingly higher rates!  This book lifts the veil on how food is produced and the scary truth behind what we are being sold.  We need to revolt!  Michael Pollan does an outstanding job in this book and if you read it all the way through you cannot ignore the need for a national food revolution!  Get on board!
B00007D03I|4.0|It took me more than a few years to read this book because I had to remove the image of Tom Hanks in the lead role from my mind (done after the first 50 pages). Let it be stated that I love fiction set in New York and the 1980's is a fascinating decade worthy of examination (and post-rationalization). The interlocking story is so well known now that I will not reprise it in this review. Suffice it to say that this is a tale of greed, morality, ego, \\"classes\\", and lost values. Wolfe walks and drives us all over New York and it is a dizzying and fun trip.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The movie is heartwarming and well acted by all.  A good adaptation of a simple, sweet and honest story.
B000001FKY|5.0|Listen - I can go on and dilate about each and every track and compare it against the Beatles, Stones, Floyd, Zep, and the Who.

This one's a no-brainer people!!!!
B002ZG99CM|5.0|This 2010 remake of the classic Karate Kid was excellent. I have heard a few people make negative comments about the movie and I was floored. My whole family loved this movie, and we cannot wait to own it so my boys can watch it over and over.  My husband and I were very touched by the underling them of conquering your giants and overcoming obstacles in your life. Currently our 6 year old son is battling stage IV Neuroblastoma and is in the fight for his life. This movie really motivated my son to keep fighting and battling his giants, we watch this movie just before my son's bone marrow transplant and the movie really did help my son stay string during it. I really cannot say enough good about it!! I felt Jaden Smith did a tremendous job in it, as well as all of the other \\"un-know\\" child actors. Karate Kid is a must see and a must have.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|It's no wonder this is the 2008 academy award winning best foreign film. What a treat of a movie. There are things to learn and great performances by all involved. This is a must see film for people who enjoy a very good story.
0385504225|5.0|The book was in better shape than expected and shipped fast. Great price at much lower than retail. Thanks.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I have loved all these movies since they were first released. In my opinion, the first and fourth movies were the best, but I enjoy all of them. Releasing all four of them in this format makes it very easy to collect the entire series.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|A fantastic movie gets even better on this 2 disc special edition blu ray,complete with theatrical and director's cuts,both versions are great,with a few noticeable differences on the director's cut with Marv and Hartigan's stories and the ability to watch the stories seperately in any order you want with the director's cut.The picture quality and sound is among the best blu ray has to offer with fantastic high definition visuals and ear splittingly awesome sound.And finally the extras are great too with two commentaries with rodriguez and frank miller and rodriguez and tarantino with bruce willis as a guest in the tarantino commentary,there's also a picture in picture commentary with behind the scenes footage and graphic novel pics showing while you watch the movie and comes along with the miller and rodriguez commentary,while the rest of the extras on disc two are the awesome extras carried over from the special edition dvds except for one new one,the kill em' good interactive game of marv's story which is a good little distraction for a while.All in all,a must buy for fans of the movie and even for others who wanna know what all the fuss is about this great blu ray,I urge you to give it a try as long as you have the stomach for it because this really is a great movie with great performances,great action,and great visuals.
B003ELOQCK|3.0|Ok, first the positives:    The sound on this DVD is amazing. Playing this on my home theater system made me feel like I was back at the concert, which in the case of U2 is always a good thing. The video is also extremely sharp and clear.    Now, the negatives:    Ugh. I really hate to criticize this DVD because U2 is my favorite band in the world that still tours and makes music. However, I was at this show and it just doesn't capture what it was like to be there. I know that is an extremely difficult thing to do for a concert video, but U2 has done that before for their concert recordings. If you want proof, look at the ZooTV recording from Australia. Now, I wasn't there for that show, but I did see the outdoor performances in Los Angeles and in Oakland. Watching the ZooTV concert, even though the setlist had changed a little by the time the show reached Australia, felt like I was reliving the shows I'd seen. I was able to turn that video on and show friends what I had been raving about for months. There was a 'this is what it was like' feel to the camera work for that concert and you were able to get an idea of the magnitude of what the ZooTV experience was like. This is SORELY lacking in the 360 DVD. Again, I realize that because the claw was so huge, the DVD only watching crowd would never fully be able to experience what it was like to be in the presence of the claw. But if the editing had just lingered on the claw from distance for more than 2-3 seconds, if there had been a few audience level shots from different points of view from the stadium that maybe lasted 10 seconds or so, then maybe, just maybe, people would have gotten a feel for what it was like to be there. Bombastically over-the-top though the claw was, and rightly or wrongly, many have said the claw detracted from the intimacy of a U2 show, it was a technological marvel to witness and should have been given its 'time in the sun' for this recording. To be completely honest, the worldwide youtube broadcast of the Rose Bowl show was a much better indicator of what it was like to be there. I guess they figured they couldn't just clean up the audio and release that on DVD, but I would much rather own that than this DVD.     Secondly, no Breathe to open the concert? Seriously? Look, always one of the the greatest moments in a U2 show is the dramatic buildup to the opening song. The salvo fired across the bow of the U2 fan that begins a U2 show is crucial. Any U2 fan worth his salt can tell you the opening song of the various U2 tours, it sets the tone for the whole show. Not including Breathe on the setlist except as, essentially, a 'deleted scene' section on disk 2 of the product is completely ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that the reason this was done was stupendously stupid to begin with, the tension created, the way the band was introduced during Breathe, plus the fact that Breathe is simply a kickass song...I don't know, it just boggles the mind.    Thirdly, I brought this up before a little, but the editing, YIKES! Watching this DVD makes me want to kill Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, you know those guys. The idiots who brought you Armageddon, Con-Air, the Transformers movies, etc. These cinematic delinquents have nearly ruined movie going with the quick-cut editing style that seems to be the formula for big-budget action movies. This editing style makes you worried that you'll start having an epileptic seizure in the movie because the scene changes so quickly. Well, U2 360 is not as bad as some of those movies, but almost. Sometimes the cuts are so quick between Bono, the Edge, Adam and Larry that you start to think maybe they are only one person and not four. Throw the Ang San Suu Kyi masks into the mix and you seriously might think you are losing your mind.    In the end, would I recommend this 360 DVD to others? It's a hard case to make. If you are a U2 fan that wants to be complete and own the visual record of each tour available, then yes. If you didn't get to see 360 and want to get an idea of what 360 was like, i'd say rent it. As for me, I've had this since 2 days after it came out and have only watched it once and I doubt I'll watch it many more times. I'd watch ZooTV, Slane Castle, Red Rocks, heck even U2 in Chicago over watching this, and as a diehard U2 fan, that's tough to say.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|absolutely love this show!!!!  thanks to amazon.com, I can now own it and watch whenever I need my \\"smallville fix\\". :)   thanks!!
6304696515|5.0|A brilliant piece of film indeed. Even though it started in a slow pace, after a couple of minutes, I couldn't take my eyes off the characters and was easily drifted away along with the film. John Malkovich is excellent, his chemistry with Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer both are amazingly wonderful. Glenn Close plays the evil lady in the a very precise manner while Pfeiffer gives a stunning performance as the married woman torn between shame and lust. A remarkable piece of cinema and sharp performances, acting and direction makes it worth a watch.
030745455X|4.0|I would have loved to give this book 5 stars.  The intrigue and the very interesting characters are some fo the best I have ever read in the genre.  However the first quarter of the book seems to be written mainly for titillation, and is basically pornographic, detracting from and otherwise excellent book.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I watched this movie and tried to stay open minded to the end of it. I tried to give this movie a chance to the end.. . Had I not been so distracted by trying to keep up with the constant rapid fire delivery of conversation between these characters, I would have looked at my watch several times. I think we can all just agree the notion of the story is a good idea, but this is a terrible way to get the notion.   1 the acting was unnatural and sometimes uncomfortably forced  2 the two leads had no chemistry at all.   3 the female lead was unfocused and unconvincing  4 its written down to the inth degree. I'm concerned for the writers wrists  5 There should be no need for me to mention the camera and sound issues, but I will to spare others.    Here's the scene for your evening.. while you are trying to follow all of this over chattered dialogue between characters under a second hand watch.. Director?  weird things start happening out of no where. I'm asking myself at times throughout the movie `did the cameraman just trip?\\", \\"did this person just discover the zoom feature on the camera?\\" \\"oh yes thank you for turning on that actors mic after he had started speaking in the scene.\\" \\"please don't show those two kissing again...\\"  6 the only thing that needed to be said for all of us to get the notion of this story is -paraphrasing here- I've built my whole life towards you. I've always loved you. ..... This declaration of his love for her despite her rejection years earlier.  It's a beautiful story but this movie isn't saved by that. It was poorly done. I think the brain power and resources involved in chopping this thing together might have been better used elsewhere?
B003FSTN52|5.0|Sometimes the stars align and a cast and crew is lucky enough to produce a season of television that is pretty much flawless. The third season of \\"Friday Night Lights.\\" The fifth season of \\"The X-Files.\\" The second season of \\"Gilmore Girls.\\" But normally these seasons of perfection come only after a show has slowly built itself into something great after making a few missteps.<br /><br />From the opening moments of its pilot to the closing seconds of the twenty-third episode of its first season, \\"The Good Wife\\" was flawless.<br /><br />Part of its elegance comes from the fact that it refuses to define itself, easily veering between lawyer procedural, family drama, conspiracy thriller and romantic drama throughout the year, often over the course of one episode. The shocking thing is that each of the above is just as well-handled as the others, and it is a delight to watch the ensemble juggle the storylines. More than that, each storyline is meticulously layered unlike any other drama of (dare I say) the past decade. Here the viewer feels mixed feelings with every new twist and turn. Like life, nothing on this show (except the main titles) is black and white and every happiness comes with a few notable reservations.<br /><br />The large cast is diverse and obscenely talented. Part of the joy of watching \\"The Good Wife\\" is watching the worlds of the shows briefly intertwine with one another and seeing characters you know well but would never expect to share the screen together feel one another out. From Archie Panjabi's smart-but-labyrinthine investigator to Alan Cumming's oily, brilliant publicist (the show is also notable as being first time I haven't wanted to reach through the screen and strangle Cumming), there isn't a weak link in the bunch.<br /><br />And then, of course, we have Julianna Margulies in the performance of her career. No other actress can say so much while speaking so little and her fantastic, multi-layered performance already has me ranking Alicia next to Lorelai Gilmore and Buffy Summers in terms of my favorite heroines of all time.<br /><br />The show is a major hit for CBS, but not many of my friends are watching. Perhaps it is because, on the surface, it seems to be nothing more than another glossy procedural. What a damn shame.<br /><br />The fact that \\"The Good Wife\\" can be this consistently good in its first season is unheard of. It is the best show of the 2009-2010 season and has done in one season what most shows cannot in their entire runs. And the best part?

006145205X|4.0|Matt Ridley argues that the division of labor and exchange are responsible for man's great historic progress and the near inevitability of future progress because of increasing returns to knowledge.  The author is most effective accumulating supporting evidence on his main themes in a historic context and in explaining their economic rationale.  When he proposes innovative or extreme ideas, he sometimes reaches beyond his evidence.    The author provides convincing evidence to show man's great progress in economic, farming, population, natural/environmental, cultural/moral, energy usage and invention/knowledge dimensions.  He demolishes the counterclaims and explains why there have always been a half-dozen irrelevant doomsday scenarios at any point in time.    His attempts to base all progress on the division of labor and trade are less convincing.  The biological development of man and evolution of language and cities based upon economic specialization is an interesting theory, at best.  The development of trust and morals in response to the needs of trade is a stretch.      The prologue on \\"when ideas have sex\\" is an unnecessary reformulation of increasing returns to knowledge.  The use of carbon-based energy as a means for the \\"release of slaves\\" overstates the valid underlying point about trade-offs in the use of energy.  The valid criticisms of simplistic economic models of climate change (ala the old Club of Rome extrapolations) are undercut by an unwillingness to consider the valid negative cases and the potential irreversible damage of climate change.    The author has written a series of highly informative and insightful summaries of modern biology.  This book fills the same role regarding the broad debates about human progress and the positive role played by the economic tools/theories of division of labor, trade and increased knowledge.  The reader will be convinced by the main arguments, but may question some of the extended theory and policy recommendations.

B000LXHK22|5.0|This is one of those \\"sleeper\\" movies that did not get much exposure in theaters but is a REAL treasure!  Not only is it filmed in France (so that in itself makes it worth watching), but it has so many wonderfully defined characters and several themes.  Romance also comes on many levels---love of Provence, France, love of the vineyards, love of friends, and romantic love.  I have watched it many times and it is one of my personal favorites. Great bonus material too!  It is a great gift idea.  Give the DVD and a bottle of French wine and your friends will LOVE you forever!  I also read the book and it is just as good, but the visuals in the movie and seeing the characters come to life did it for me!  Cheers!

B002VPE1XY|4.0|The Amazon basics camera case is made of nice quality leather and to a reasonably high finish level.  It reminds me a good deal of the case I bought for my zune (reviewed elsewhere) with which I was very pleased.  Since it is not noted in the description, this case fits a sub-compact camera, but, personally I would like to see a list of the models it is best suited for.  My guess would be that it  is about right for a Canon power-shot, but since I don't have one, I can not say that with any authority.<br />The case is basic, but well made and well though out.  It has a belt clip, an opening for a wrist strap, a memory card pocket, a soft suede interior and attached microfiber cloth for protecting or cleaning lenses.<br />I'd say that it descrves a 5 for the quality to price, but I am something of a pocket fiend.  I like to have space for  a spare battery, and maybe more than one card (depending on where I am taking my camera).  For people who are looking for a sleek, trim case and want to keep bulk to a minimum, this might be just perfect, but that said a list of the models it fits would be in order.  We have something like a down cameras around the house as well as a variety of MP3 players, PDAs and other hand-helds.  It does not fit any of them quite right.  I don't know which Apple products it is thought to be suitable for because my daughter has most of them, and say they'd fit, but rattle around (clearly not what this was intended for)  Now that I think of it, I expect it would fit my zune, but doeesn't have the window etc approriate to an MP3 player case, which is OK as that is not what it was intended to be.<br />Most of our cameras are either older and slightly bulkier, or SLR or near SLR, consequently requiring larger cases.  My daughter who is an award winning photographer has several, but is eyeing the Exelim as something to just have on hand at all times.  The case would fit that camera... maybe 2 or 3 of them.<br />It is a good little case at a great price.  Just check the dimensions to make sure it will work with your camera.  If it's a good fit, you've got yourself a nice little leather case at an excellent price.<br />Edited to note that it is an awkward fit for the Panasonic (Lumix) P1, P3 cameras.  It was clearly meant for something a little (maybe 1/4\\") smaller vertically, and chunkier.the dimensions to make sure it will work with your camera.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is one of my favorite movies from the old days. I was kind of a nerd in HS. Fantasy movies like this were my life. I've always thought this was one of Val Kilmer's best performances after Real Genius. This DVD is pretty good. It's letterboxed of course but my PS3 upsampled it a bit and the video looked pretty good. It would be awesome if they would re-master it in HD. As for audio, my reciever is feeling bad so I had to use the TV speakers. For that it sounded great.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|Maybe it is not by the letter but this adaptation is simply charming. All characters, All the locations, Emma's house really takes you to another time in the past.

0142004235|5.0|Upon finishing this book, I was in awe. At his sharpest, Steinbeck weaves an intricate web of characters, all of whom encompass both good and evil, yet enable us to fall in love with each one of them, even the worse ones. Through the despair, cruelty, and pain, there lies hope and pure honesty of human emotions that force you do to your own introspection, leaving you begging for more and speechless once you've finished.
0307454541|4.0|The prologue sucks you right in, drawing out the mystery, and then the first chapter is something completely different. So you're left a bit confused in the beginning, but it all clears up eventually. The prologue remains in the back of your mind throughout the entire novel. Which helps, because the first few chapters were a bit slow; introducing the characters and their situations. But once the novel got going, it was like a snowball rolling down a hill.<br /><br />It is puzzling that the title references Lisbeth Salandar, when most of the book follows Mikael Bloomqvist, the journalist from Millenium. Lisbeth doesn't really come into the picture until about halfway through and even then remains more of a secondary character. A fascinating secondary character, that is. Larrson does an excellent job painting a picture of her for us-- her lack of social skills, her dubious moral standards, her backbone in standing up for herself. Mikael is interesting, too, but he's more of a typical reporter/ladies' man and seems to have a new woman in his bed in every chapter. He's like the Swedish James Bond, except a journalist instead of a spy...<br /><br />The story itself was amazing. It intertwined so many different subjects-- violence toward women, embezzlement, dysfunctional families, Nazism and WWII, and the list goes on. But it's written in a way that it all makes sense and each piece fits together like a puzzle. There is a definite end to the novel, a wrap-up of the events, but still leaves you hanging for more, which is why you'll want to pick up \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" right away.
1844256383|3.0|I bought this book because the cheap chinese tenor sax I own can't really get any service w/o shipping it back to the importer in CA. I needed a fix - a solder joint came loose (actually, I'm not sure there was any solder there) - after e-mail correspondence and the cost of shipping, I ended up fixing this myself after reading something online ($20 for supplies).  I thought I needed to have a manual around just in case another problem occurs - there are definitely good tips in this book, especially about common problems like leaks and sticky pads.  But there also is a lot of \\"see your professional technician\\" type comments and the book is rather short (though full of pretty photos). If your above a beginner and have a small amount of mechanical skill, this book is too basic for you.
1601251505|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? 4th is good, fun, creative, and represents a lot of work by thoughtful game developers, but Pathfinder is better. 3rd was streamlined, but open to build upon by the player, truly the Linux of the D&D progression.<br /><br />D&D 4th edition plays like a fun video game with long loading times. Even if you get good with the rules rounds still take forever, and are rigidly structured. The combat is very dependent on movement that miniatures (or usually dice) must be used to track everyone's location in combat. It is neat to have so many powers, but that ends up meaning that there are a million powers in effect all the time that have to be kept track of.<br /><br />Pathfinder plays like Dungeons & Dragons. It gives you enough rope to hang yourself with, but it really cleans up some of the flaws in 3.5, most action is fast paced, and I still love that 3rd ed feel of really building my character myself, with the ability to be creative right there in the base book. XP penalties for multiclassing is eliminated. Go nuts!

0553582461|3.0|I was looking forward to this series eagerly when I found it was a continuation of the Assassin trilogy.  I could hardly put those books down and I just knew this series would be as good.  Should have known better, since follow-up series are never as good as the first. I liked Hobb's writing and her story telling, but she really \\"fleshed out\\" her characters way too much. I found myself losing interest when Fitz went through the columns in the Assassin stories; although I know it was an integral part of the story line, there was too much time devoted to it.  The Skill road was pretty much a dud as far as I'm concerned. I felt like Fitz let Chade take over his life too much when he should have been more decisive. Fitz was the most important character but was manipulated by all those around him.  I didn't like that very much.  I got about 300 pages into this book, after reading the first 2, I just decided \\"to h*** with it\\" and quit.  I couldn't follow the story line anymore, there were too many characters getting involved and I was really mad at fitz for the way he treated the Fool. Some friend!!!!  I was so disgusted with the Thick character that I really hated it when he came up.  I'm glad so many people enjoyed it and sorry I didn't.  Maybe I'll give it a try again someday.

I would reccomend them for every parent or grandparent to keep handy for thier little ones, they are wonderful.
1401207529|5.0|I've never been a big fan of DC comic books, I've always preferred Marvel Comics to DC. And I'm not even that big of a Marvel fan, I just like Spider-Man, and trust me I've got a helluva lot of Spider-Man so don't worry I'm no newbie to the world of comics. But if there is ONE DC character I really really like it's Batman. The Nolan Batman films have always been better than the Raimi Spider-Man films (well not really better there good in different ways, Nolan's films are really good serious movies and the Raimi are really good fun movies). So I was surfing the web one day and found a top ten list of Batman novels, this was number one. This was three years ago, I may be just a little bit late with this review. Now three years later I have amassed a large collection of Batman backissues (and current issues as I am currently enjoying Tony Daniels, as of this writing, current run on the Batman series) and graphic novels, and I can honestly say that Batman Year One my first Batman comic is still my very favorite.     This story captures the realism and grit of Gordon, and Batman, and Gotham. It's probably one of the most realistic Batman stories and cements Batman's place in the real world. The storytelling is skilled and it is probably Frank Miller's greatest work (it's definetly better than his modern stuff... DEFINETLY) and the narration switching between Gordon and Bruce feels like things these character's would say if they were real, and I just get an immense ammount of joy that Bruce's narration is written in script. But my favorite part of this stor is that it doesn't treat the reader's like there morons it doesn't explain everything becsause it knows that the mature readers reading the book will understand, my favorite example of this is when after being interviewed by Gordon Harvey Dent turns to behind his desk and tells Batman that it's safe to come out. The narration doesn't say \\"DENT IS WORKING WITH BATMAN, DURPA DURPA!\\" but you know that they are.    In short all I can say is... buy this book!

0307463745|5.0|If Nike were to ever expand on their Just Do It slogan, this book would be it.  Rework urges the reader to get on with your work and to ignore a lot of the supposedly sage wisdom about how to run a business.  For example, meetings - keep them to a minimum because they are usually time wasters.  Go forward with something that's good enough; don't wait for it to be perfect because you'll never proceed.  Have managers work the front lines to truly understand the business, particularly customers' problems.  Don't add features to satisfy a customer who may be growing out of your service.  Identify those things that your customers really need and drop the bells and whistles.  Hire only when you really need someone, not just to add superstars to your team.  Marketing is not a department; it is everyone and everything you do.  The book is replete with advice like this.    I particularly liked the authors' debunking of the notion of the entrepreneur.  This label is used to denote a special class of people who are in some way gifted to start and build companies.  The authors say this is nonsense and discourages individuals who may feel they do not have the entreprenuerial mystique.    On the down side, there is one section where the authors encourage people to act like drug dealers; i.e. offer a sample or test of something to get them hooked.  Of all the possible analogies, why choose this one?  Readers who live with the problems of the drug trade will not appreciate this.    Finally, although the book is about 270 pages long, the actual text is probably less than half that, so it's a very quick read.

B002ZG99CC|5.0|The summer of 2010 version of \\"The Karate Kid\\" is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.  The best sequel of all time might be on that does not immediately come to mind, namely John Huston's version of \\"[[ASIN:B000GIXLW0 The Maltese Falcon]],\\" which was the second or third version of the classic crime novel.  I do not think anybody would dare to remake that one, and fans of the original version of \\"[[ASIN:B0008JIJ2E The Karate Kid]],\\" probably feel the same way about the 1984 film.  But I doubt anybody who loves the original is going to be bitterly disappointed with this new one, because there are three significant changes that help make this remake stand on its own carefully poised leg.  The first two are related, in that this time our young hero does not just move across the continent but across the Pacific Ocean when his mom drags him off to China.  That gives us not only a shift in the wise master from Japanese to Chinese heritage, which represents some shifts in culture as Pat Morita's Mr. Miyagi becomes Jackie Chan's Mr. Han, but also means almost all of the film was shot in China, which means some gorgeous vistas filmed by cinematographer Roger Pratt (\\"[[ASIN:B000E6EK2Y Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]\\").  The third factor is that Jayden Smith as young Dre Parker is a pre-teen, which takes the level of the story down to junior high, and he is relatively undersized, so that when this gang of bullies comes after him and keeps coming after him, he looks terrified.  Learning karate, or kung fu, or whatever the most accurate name for this particular brand of martial arts might be, looks to be literally necessary for Dre to keep alive, let alone improve his sense of self-worth or help him with the cute violinist (Han Wen Wen) who is willing to befriend the new kid in town.<br /><br />This is Christopher Murphey's first screenplay credit (he came up with the story for 2001's \\"[[ASIN:B00008NFR3 The Unsaid]]\\"), and it is really impressive in that it is respectful of the original Robert Mark Kamen story without treating it with undue reverence.  The story beats are all from the original movie, but Murphey's script comes up with new variations, so that nothing is repeated.  The least successful of these is the bit with the shirt that takes the place of the great \\"wax on, wax off\\" sequence that probably earned Pat Morita his Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.  But others changes are more successful, ranging from the subtle gag involving catching a fly with chopsticks to the new and more dramatic significance of the car the master has been restoring.  I wonder how much credit Murphey gets for getting this remake to work, but I also suspect Jaden Smith's parents, both of whom have producer credits for the film, played significant roles in making sure this was a high class product.  There are lots of snap shouts of the proud parents in the end credits, which are in both English and what I assume is Mandarin.  Credit also goes to Jackie Chan, who once again shows that he is the Fred Astaire of martial arts films in his ability to make use of what is there, such as a windbreaker, in the early fight sequence.  It takes a while in this film before you really recognize Jackie Chan as Jackie Chan, mainly because it takes a long time for a smile to crack his lips, or, more importantly, for that tell-tale glint to show up in his eye.  There are people who love Chan and those who find his persona annoying, but I think both of those groups will be impressed with his performance here.<br /><br />I round up on this one because of the way the end game plays out this time around.  Working off of Smith's small frame, Dre comes up with an additional reason for why he has to show up for the final match, thereby tying things together nicely.  More importantly, all of the lip service to winning and losing not being important actually plays out in the big match, where Dre is so totally in the moment that those words become flesh.  That is probably the most significant addition to this version, and hopefully youngsters will pick up on the message and not just be enthralled with the thought of learning kung fun and/or visiting China.  I also anticipated and approved that the movie goes a bit farther than the original, coming up with its own way of adding a coda that we did not get with the original until the beginning of \\"[[ASIN:B00005JXY3 The Karate Kid II]].\\"  So, even if you know \\"what\\" is going to happen, you still get to enjoy the \\"how.\\"  I went to this movie with someone who has yet to see the original, and I am not sure which one of us enjoyed the film more.

B000P0J09W|5.0|It's incredibly hard to believe, but I seriously think a couple days ago was actually the very first time I ever watched the Goonies. Some of the scenes looked familiar like I'd seen bits and pieces of the film in the past, but I don't think I ever sat down and actually watched it the entire way through.  This is hard to believe considering I spent my entire childhood in the 80's.      Well, for the most part it's a family/adventure type film involving a group of troublemaker kids around 10-years old and going on an enormous adventure.  It's funny whenever the kids think they're doing something they'll be grounded for, it's actually mild compared to things kids do in reality.    As you can tell, adventure movies came a long way since the Goonies- just look at Harry Potter for example. Two completely different films perhaps, but both putting heavy emphasis on the adventurous aspect of the storytelling.      Anyway, this movie aged somewhat well. You can definitely tell it was released in the mid 80's, and my goodness, Anne Ramsey is one of the scariest women of all time! I mean that as a compliment- she'd immediately scare *any* troublemaker child straight just by looking at them with that mean expression on her face!  I remember her fondly throughout the 80's- rest in peace.  A terrific actress she was.    This is a pretty good film. I'm surprised it's popular enough to have received 500 reviews here on amazon, but I guess it's easy to see why- it's a fun flick.  Perhaps the Goonies is more important than I'm giving it credit for and it's considered either a perfect timepiece of the 80's, or I'm just underrating its overall popularity, or maybe it's a major influence on something.  Whatever the case, I'm glad I watched it.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|In ancient Greek mythology, Aphrodite was the goddess of love (and by extension, sex and allure). All three have their place in Kylie Minogue's latest pop album \\"Aphrodite,\\" which reverberates with the best of Minogue's past few albums -- lots of deliciously infectious club beats, satiny cool melodies and luscious instrumentation, with her wispy voice in the middle of it all.<br /><br />\\"Dance/It's all I wanna do/So won't you/Dance/I'm standing here with you/Why won't you move?\\" Minogue says softly over a building electronica beat. Then it explodes into a sinuous, writhing melody that assures her boyfriend, \\"All the lovers/That have gone before/They don't compare to you...\\" Up next: the beat-heavy, neon-tinged \\"Get Outta My Way,\\" which sounds like a track cut from \\"Fever.\\"<br /><br />And there's plenty more to come -- the wild cascade of \\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\" and \\"Can't Beat the Feeling,\\" the silky merry-go-round of \\"Closer,\\" the sparkling forceful title track, the champagne shimmer of \\"Illusion\\" and \\"Too Much,\\" the thick beats and mellow flavor of \\"Better than Today,\\" the charming \\"Cupid Boy,\\" and the delicately frothy piano-and-strings-led \\"Looking For An Angel.\\"<br /><br />What did I not like? \\"Everything is Beautiful\\" is a nice song, but it feels... lackluster compared to the colorful, sparkling songs that surround it. And some of the beats in \\"Can't Beat the Feeling\\" sound like Mario Bros. music (don't hurt me!).<br /><br />But despite those small flaws, \\"Aphrodite\\" is an intoxicating album -- imagine driving with your friends in an open-topped car on a hot summer night, surrounded by glittering signs, dance clubs and shimmering stars. That is what this album is like. It's an unadulterated guilty pleasure that also happens to be really entertaining; I dare you to put on some of these songs and not feel your feet twitch, just like with \\"Fever.\\"<br /><br />And for an album crammed with clubby dance music, Minogue manages to include a lot of musical variation here -- her danceable beats can be heavy and thick, ethereal and silky, flexible, or a rapid rain of silvery electronica. There's also some gauzy swirls of softer, cooler synth, blips and some heavy squiggling -- as well as some soft interludes of piano and strings that add an organic edge to the album.<br /><br />As for Minogue, she sounds like she's having fun -- lots of songs focusing on how she wants to dance (\\"My heart plays a rhythm in my head, I can't help, but move\\"), or lose herself in her love for a \\"cupid boy\\" (\\"If only you knew I shimmer for you/Oh the very thrill of it!\\" she coos in that song).<br /><br />\\"Aphrodite\\" is a welcome return to the sort of clubby, shimmery pop that Kylie Minogue does best, with lots of flourishes, sexy coos and intoxicatingly dancy melodies.

B00288KNL8|5.0|Coraline (no, that's NOT a spelling mistake!) may be one of the spookiest animated films I've seen in quite some time.      What makes it different from all the rest is the constantly quiet and creepy atmosphere, and the highly unusual flow to all the animated scenes.       When this film first began for example, I was completely confused watching an animation showing a doll fly through a window, then get ripped apart and put back together again, then out the window it went.  Just a REALLY strange piece of animation.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.    The soundtrack is fascinating.  In fact it might be one of the best soundtracks to an animated film ever.  It's seriously THAT good.  Okay, Dumbo probably wins the award for best ever soundtrack, but Coraline is definitely a runner-up.    The music seriously reminds me of the mid 70's Canterbury scene involving progressive rock bands such as Hatfield and the North, Caravan and the Soft Machine.  Plus it's entirely melodic and just perfect.  I absolutely LOVE it.    The storyline is pretty good too, though incredibly simple and adventurous.  Just how a storyline *should* be.  A young girl bored out of her mind because her parents are too busy to spend time with her goes on an adventure of a lifetime right in her own home (by going back and forth through a secret doorway in the wall).      On the other side of the wall lies mirror images of her parents, but with buttons for eyes!  I kid you not, haha.  It's kind of scary in a way, but not intentionally so.    Overall, the atmosphere is definitely eerie, and the quiet tone of the entire movie might take a few minutes to adjust to, but in the end Coraline is a quality film for children and adults alike.
B003U80I5G|4.0|It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.  And while there have been lots of movie and TV adaptations, one of the absolute best is the 1970 TV movie starring Susannah York and George C Scott. \\"Jane Eyre\\" spends too long on Jane's school days (and not quite enough on the Thornfield days), but the two lead actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles.<br /><br />Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected at a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone push her down -- and many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele. Then she encounters her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield.<br /><br />They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat. But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- injuries, fires, and a mysterious \\"danger.\\" Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the 1970 adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\" is that it spends too long at Jane's rotten school, and not quite enough time at Thornfield -- it could have benefited from another half an hour to flesh things out slightly, and include a few more important scenes that the TV movie didn't have (like the gypsy fortuneteller). So it's a credit to everything ELSE in this movie that it's still very good.<br /><br />Director Delbert Mann does an excellent job here, smoothly gliding through the three phases of Jane's life, slowly building up the gothic feel of the movie until Rochester's secret is revealed. And he weaves in some truly brilliant, intense scenes, such as when Rochester wakes to find Jane missing, and races around Thornfield searching for her, or when Jane joyously rejects the fanatical advances of the self-righteous St. John (\\"You cannot love just God alone!\\").<br /><br />But the best part is York and Scott, who have electric chemistry. York gives the role the passionate, rebellious undercurrent that you'd expect from Jane Eyre, and she's more striking than conventionally pretty. Scott seems a bit too gritty at first (breaking stuff?), but he soon turns on the passionate, embittered aspect of Rochester -- especially when the truth about Bertha comes out, and he sits sadly in her tower cell murmuring softly to the madwoman.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre\\" is definitely one of the better adaptations of Bronte's classic gothic romance -- it's a bit too short, but the performances are absolutely awe-inspiring.

1416550550|4.0|I loved this novel.  From the cover to the title, to the respective stories, I could not imagine a novel pulling me along with such concentration. First, I love stories about children who are rescued and children like in The Secret Garden.  Second, I love ties to the past and family history.  The author is quoted from her interview.... \\"My interest isn't so much in the supernatural aspects of the gothic (apparitions and the like) as much as metaphorical ghosts--the haunting of the present by the past; guilt; memory; identity issues; twins and doubles; the complicated ties of family....\\"  When she said that, she had me, definitely it was a yes moment for me.... tell me more.  I always want to connect the historical dots, the soul-connections of people.<br /><br />I am on a reading binge this year after spending several years writing and business-building.  I am glad The Forgotten Garden was a book I chose.<br /><br />My favorite storyline of the novel was of the young girl without memory or voice, her circumstance had my heart throughout.  But I felt most connected to the granddaughter finding her way home.<br /><br />Highly recommended and staying on my reading room shelf, not a giveaway.<br /><br />Essa Adams<br />[[ASIN:B003DXAC3G A Breath Floats By (Spirituality Fiction)]]<br />kindle and paperback
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Many who judge this movie harshly miss the entire point of the movie, and cannot glean the meanings in here. It was a great movie. Violent certainly, one I would use good judgment around the kiddos. Wonderful music. Great acting. And a story line that seems to be a complete original outside the post apocalyptic idea. Seems several of the reviewers like to point out that God wouldn't sanction killing. Uhmmm yeah he would. You don't have to look far to see direct commands to do such things in the bible. But as usual it has become popular to christian bash in this day and age. Getting away with bigotry without all the hassle of being called a racist. Those that understand even some scripture will pick up a few key things along the way. 1. The living word will endure. This is the main focal point of the story line. 2. God will use many vessels to see his will done. Those of peace and even those of death are his. This supports the overarching storyline. Even if you are not a scholar of scripture you will still walk away with something more than you started with.

B000TNF7OC|5.0|As far as melodic metal goes ufo was always at the top of the heap from this point until the early 80's at least. Their first 2 discs were interesting but they were psychidelic hard rock and  not on this level.  However their third 'landed japan' is close to this in greatness ,it's a awesome live disc. But from the moment michael schenker joined this band they were at the head of the pack in talent and skill as far as hard rock and metal were concerned. And they only got better each disc too. This one has alot of great songs like the classics 'rock bottom' and 'doctor doctor' which are as good as anything that came out before our after them metal wise. great driving melodic metal songs  that give homage to the blues slightly. The rest of the disc is not as powerful as those songs and with the next release 'force it' they would really become the true masters of melodic metal that came from michaels' guitar ,ways' bass, parkers' drumming, and moggs'sometimes poetic words.  This is a great disc that any hard rock fan should have in their collection  of course it's where they start as a powerhouse band too.
0399156577|2.0|I am probably going to get bashed by NR fans, but I have to ask what went wrong with The Search?  I love NR's books.  However, The Search is really just an ok read.  I wasn't excited about the suspense because to be honest there was very little.  The characters were ok, but not one of them stood out in my mind to the point I was clamoring to know what was going to happen to them.  I expect more from NR's books.  She is one of the few authors I buy before I check out the reviews.  This book seemed like a homege to dogs. It borders to close to Iris Johansen's series.  Will I pay my hard earned money for another NR book?  Probably as long as she gets back on track.

B003Q7B78S|5.0|No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West, \\"Orlando.\\"<br /><br />And few movie adaptations are as coyly, exquisitely lovely as the 1992 movie adapted from that book, a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders. Tilda Swinton has the right combination of androgyny and intelligence to perfectly embody Orlando, and director Sally Potter gilds and perfumes every set and costume.<br /><br />Orlando (Swinton) was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite. She also bid him, \\"Do not fade, do not wither, do not grow old.\\"<br /><br />And Orlando did as she said. With the death of the queen and his father, Orlando's passionate, curious personality attracted many women -- and during the Great Freeze he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial Russian princess (Charlotte Valandrey) who enthralled him, but left him as he ice began to thaw. Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.<br /><br />But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life of poetry (befriending Pope!), sex and legality, stretching all the way to the twentieth century -- when she finally finds peace.<br /><br />\\"Orlando\\" is a treat for the senses, filled with  showers of gold dust, luxuriant flowers, pale sunlight, golden sands, cities veiled in ice, dark rivers, snowy forests and mist-filled hedge mazes. It feels like Sally Potter took Woolf's beautiful book and sprinkled it with roses, gold and crystals -- and it just adds a suitably magical atmosphere to a already unreal story.<br /><br />The center of all this is Swinton, who plays Orlando in both incarnations, and she's utterly brilliant. Her androgynous features and slim body mean she can pass for both a man and a woman, and she manages to carry both genders off beautifully -- she captures gangly boyish grace, sleek femininity, and a sort of chummy male attitude with equal skill.<br /><br />And she captures Orlando's elusive personality. Her Orlando is all puckish charm, sweetness and unleashed passion -- even to the audience. While watching a street performance of \\"Othello,\\" he glances at the camera and whispers, \\"Terrific play!\\", as if we're trailing after him over the centuries.<br /><br />And as I mentioned, Potter does a brilliant job with a very difficult book, sticking faithfully to most of Woolf's novel and adding a shimmering, silken atmosphere to it. There are lots of beautiful scenes that could have stepped out of a Pre-Raphaelite painting, and she deftly handles the passing centuries by having Orlando sprint through walls of mist. The ending is slightly different from Woolf's novel, but it has the same pleasantly timeless, thoughtful quality -- the only downside is that weird freaky angel thing.

0140157352|5.0|Although negotiation takes place every day, it is not easy to do well, and standard strategies for negotiation often leave people dissatisfied, worn-out and/or alienated, according to Roger Fisher and William Ury in this book. The book describes a method of negotiation called principled negotiation, or negotiation on the merits. The method is designed to produce wise outcomes efficiently and amicably.<br /><br />There are four basic points to principled negotiation: separate the people from the problem; focus on interests not positions; generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do; and insist that the result be based on some objective standard. Before entering negotiations, the negotiator should be aware of his or her \\"best alternative to a negotiated position\\" as a fallback in case the negotiations are unsuccessful. The authors also suggest various strategies for dealing with people who refuse to negotiate or who use dirty tricks.<br /><br />The book is reasonably short and easy to read. It provides a systematic approach to a highly desired skill, showing how a difficult conflict can be approached in a rational rather than emotive manner, and that helps to explain why it has been a bestseller for almost 30 years. Negotiation is an essential skill for lawyers, but it is also a necessary skill for running a successful business or maintaining a successful marriage. This is the best book on negotiating that I have read, and I highly recommend it.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This story was so amazing, I have no idea how anyone could create it!  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  Trust me when I tell you that I'm easily distracted, but not from this book.  From the very beginning, it's full of secrets from the past, some that become known as you read.  You'll find layer upon layer of mysteries, and it still keeps you guessing, about a couple of things, up to the very end.  I also liked the fact that the story takes the reader through WWI, and the years after it.  This story easily emphasizes the lasting effects that the war had on people.  It also illustrates the definitive boundaries set by social classes.  Very interesting.  I loved every page of it.  I'm actually kind of sad that I've finished it.  I'm deterimined to read the rest of Kate Morton's books, I'm sure they'll be as good as this one.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|Boy, this movie is bad. Plot - what plot. 45 minutes into it, I still couldn't tell you what the point was. Action - maybe there were some (supposedly) wow special effects, but the movie just DRAGGED. Production - Superficially, it would seem that at least the movie had richly detailed scenery and backgrounds going for it; but, even that, after about 20 minutes lost its allure, just like HDR photography, after the first couple dozen times you see it, begins to look like just one more digital affectation. Audio - These actors don't speak their lines; they mumble them, especially Downey, Jr. It might be easier to follow a silent version; at least, you wouldn't waste your time rewinding a half dozen times to figure out what was said (only to find that it just can't be done). Acting - Just not believable characters the way they were played. OK. This is Sherlock Holmes, after all. We don't really think that he is that smart, do we? But there has to be enough credibility to pull you into the story. Not here. All in all, this moview blows.
1401323820|4.0|Although this is fiction, based on a fictional TV show, it's written with the same wry wit and surprise twists that the TV series has. A lot of fun and an easy read.
0312360258|1.0|I have never written a review before but this book was so awful I was compelled to do so. \\"Marked\\" reads like a horrible piece of fan fiction written by an immature 13 year old. The premise is stale, the plot is thin, and the characterization is non-existent (unless you count \\"annoying\\" as a characterization).    However, in a book filled with terrible writing one thing stands out to me as the worst: Zoey's (the narrator) descriptions of sex and women. Any female who is, has been, or is interested in becoming sexually active is labeled a \\"slut,\\" \\"ho,\\" or \\"skank.\\" Aphrodite, Zoey's nemesis, is called all of these things at various times just for the length of her skirt or cut of her dress. The narrative makes it clear that Aphrodite was sexually active with Erik, Zoey's crush, and yet not once is Erik or any of the males who participated in sexual activity condoned for it. After a brief make-out session with Erik, Zoey even chastises herself for being so \\"slutty.\\" It's disheartening to see such an ancient double-standard being applied in contemporary fiction. What a disappointing message to send to young girls--that they should be ashamed of their sexuality.
0679731725|5.0|My first experience with Kazuo Ishiguro was with his novel `Never Let Me Go', which drew me in and blew me away.  I have been a longstanding fan of the 1993 film adaptation of this particular novel, and so I have wanted to read it for some time.  Truth be told, the idea of reading a novel about a butler's revelations didn't seem all that appealing.  Some stories are better told on the big screen, for reading their plights can become rather monotonous and redundant.  After reading `Never Let Me Go' though, I was so enamored with Ishiguro's magnificent writing technique that I became confident that this novel would please me.<br /><br />It did, and then some.<br /><br />I find it rather baffling to read some (very few thankfully) reviews that lambaste this novel for being boring or uninspired.  Yes, to the untrained eye this may seem like a longwinded exercise (which I can't say I rally behind in the slightest since I was unable to put this engrossing piece of literature down and finished it rather rapidly) but quite frankly there is so much to be absorbed here.<br /><br />The story tells that of an English butler named Mr. Stevens who takes a much deserved holiday to visit an old acquaintance and former co-worker, Miss Kenton.  Over the course of this trip, Stevens recalls his life in segments that add layers of development over his own person and the people with whom he shared his company, namely Miss Kenton and his former employer, Lord Darlington.  While it may be instantaneously ascertained that Stevens is quite oblivious to his former employers real life ambitions, the reader soon become privy to the fact that Stevens is searching for a meaning to his own existence that causes him to place unnecessary adoration on his late-employer.  Stevens, a man so dedicated to his craft that he has made other people's mistakes, is stumbled by his own lack of `dignity', as he sees it.  Feeling lost and inadequate, Stevens focuses his reflection on times when he felt most amenable, completely worthwhile and needed.  This reflection, when recollected in like manner, paints a vivid picture of a man who is just beginning to grow outside of himself.<br /><br />Some have balked that this story is far from the `romance' is it trying to be, but for me that anti-climactic finale only further bolsters the story's romantic subplot.<br /><br />There is a passage near the beginning of the book where Stevens comments on the meaning of greatness, and when discerning the reason many consider the landscape in Britain to be `great' he states: \\"I would say that it is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart.\\"  That is precisely how I feel about this beautiful novel.  The `obvious' theatrics are stripped away to reveal a story that is pure and believable and relatable, no matter what your nobility.<br /><br />I must also make a quick note in regards to Ishiguro's writing style.  This man is a genius.  I've only read two of his novels and yet I'm ready to pronounce him one of the greatest novelists I've ever had the privilege of reading.  His ability to transport the reader into another world is unsurpassed.  Comparing the style of this novel and `Never Let Me Go', it is outstanding to see how he was able to capture such completely contrasted personalities so effortlessly.<br /><br />This novel breathes.ile and needed.

0618680004|5.0|Being an atheist, is very difficult in this \\"Modern Times\\", especially if you are living in a very Catolic Country like Honduras. Thanks to this book, I have the pleasure of having access to information and ideas, that otherwise are difficult to find in my medium. Praise, for all the books of Dr. Richard Dawkins!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the best headphones I have ever owned. They are very light with excellent sound quality. And they are also very inexpensive. They fit nicely in the ear and are the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. I use them with my portabble CD player and my MP4 player. Unless you are an extreme audiophile, you will love these headphones. Unfortunately, Sony no longer produces them but they are still available on the internet.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a fascinating true story. It's about a woman named Henrietta Lacks who died of cervical cancer in the 50s, but before she did, some of her cancer cells were taken without her permission and cultured. Her cells were the first scientists were successfully able to keep alive outside of the human body for an extended period of time, and they're still alive and growing today (called HeLa). They've helped scientists discover numerous cures and treatments, including the vaccine for polio.<br /><br />This book not only illustrates how incredibly valuable her cells were and are for science, but it also takes the reader into the lives of the Lacks family and how Henrietta's death and the eventual revelation about her cells damaged their lives. Despite Henrietta Lacks' incalculable contribution to science, her family is destitute and can't afford health care.<br />Throughout this book, my jaw dropped realising the legacy of the HeLa cells, and my heart broke for the family left in the dark. An absolute must read.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|This is a *must have* for any serious Doors fan.  The audio quality is good as it will get.<br /><br />The only ding is all six audio CDs have mixed HD and non-HD content. The original recording tracks are in HDCD format while the bonus/extra tracks are in non-HDCD format. This was done &#34;most likely&#34; through carelessness of the sound engineers.<br /><br />I would recommend buying this Box Set.<br /><br />2006 Release(ASIN:B000ILYYJE UPC:081227995980 Catalog:R2 334844) is the version I'm reviewing here.
B002VPE1YS|3.0|I used this case to replace an extremely clunky heavy case that came with my camera originally.  It has a nice little carbine hook so that i can hook it into the inside of my bags or clip to my belt loop.  The case is moderately padded, nothing overly fancy there, the cinch cord on the top of the bag is easy to use and convenient.  The packaging of this product was ridiculous however, it came in a two foot long box for a little quilted bag. But overall I am happy with the case.
B0036V4DGC|3.0|Finally a concert dvd. I just wish it had been in 5.1 surround sound and a longer concert. I would like to have given this dvd 5 stars since Alan is one of my favorite artists, but I was disappointed in the length of the dvd and as I said, it should have been in surround sound. Otherwise the music is great as usual.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|If you don't like watching films twice, then I suggest you not view SHUTTER ISLAND even once. But if you do, you need to click over to the extra features on the DVD and watch \\"The Making of Shutter Island.\\" It is here where you will begin to realize how important it is to restart the disc from the beginning.<br /><br />Shutter Island is a film-within-a-film, about a character-within-a-character. The multiple layers and textures are unbelievably inviting in a very twisted sense. The entire film screams thriller, but after you view it a second time, it'll scream ...something entirely different.<br /><br />Dividing audiences and critics, Shutter Island reveals itself to probably be too dense for many, but a revelatory success for others; I'm obviously in the latter category.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio ([[ASIN:B000M5AJQI The Departed]]) has rapidly become director Martin Scorsese's muse (and rightfully so). The two have been nearly inseparable since [[ASIN:B002XUBDVK Gangs of New York]]. \\"Marty\\" saw something inside Leonardo and knew that he had the acting chops needed for some fairly tough roles. And here, on Shutter Island, Marty gives him his toughest role to date.<br /><br />As soon as we see Federal Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo, [[ASIN:B001HN699K Where the Wild Things Are]]) arrive on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a mentally deranged prisoner, we get the immediate sense that things are off-balance. The guards look at Teddy and Chuck with great apprehension; their weapons pointed in Teddy and Chuck's general direction.<br /><br />And as Teddy's investigation winds up, so do clues that don't match up. The possibility of a 67th patient being on the island, even though the warden and his charges claim there are only 66, tips Teddy (and the viewer) off that something is amiss.<br /><br />The dark edges surrounding the island also leads Teddy into flashbacks of his time in WW II, and into other muted corners of his past that he'd rather not see.<br /><br />It is these dark corners that intrigue Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley, [[ASIN:B000UAE7KO You Kill Me]]) and his partner Dr, Naehring (Max von Sydow, [[ASIN:B001WLMOG4 The Seventh Seal]]), themselves being psychiatrists. But we quickly garner that these two men are at opposite ends of the same field. And are they fighting each other over Teddy? If so, why?<br /><br />It is here that I'll stop any further possibility of spoilers for those who choose to read this review. And it is also here that I need to reaffirm the requirement that you watch this movie twice. If you do, you'll come away feeling as though you've seen two movies instead of just one.It is these dark corners that intrigue Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley, [[ASIN:B000UAE7KO You Kill Me]]) and his partner Dr, Naehring (Max von Sydow, [[ASIN:B001WLMOG4 The Seventh Seal]]), themselves being psychiatrists.

159562015X|3.0|I started by buying this book used from an Amazon seller. Bad move. The code in the back that lets you actually take the test was already used, and the website has NO WAY of buying a fresh code (I even emailed and asked), so I was stuck shipping the thing back and buying a new copy. I didn't realize this was going to be an issue until I was a third of the way through the book and it told me I was finally done reading about how great the test is and was ready to take the test itself.<br /><br />So a week later, I get my new book, I take the test, get my results, and really enjoyed looking through the results. I then read the entirety of the book to see what other attributes could have been ascribed to me. I had to agree with the test that they pegged my attributes correctly. It was really interesting reading about all the possible strengths and \\"seeing\\" some of my friends and relatives in those strengths.<br /><br />I had a really fun time taking the test and reading about the attributes, but two weeks later - has the knowledge changed my life in any real way? Not really. I am already in a well-thought-out career path, have carefully thought about how I interact with others and use my time, and the insights they provided me with were excellent, but the action steps to put them into practice weren't very helpful to me personally - they were too obvious and were almost all things I had already done or am aware of.<br /><br />I think if you're not yet very aware of who you are and what your natural tendencies are, then this book could really revolutionize your life, career path, and how you do everything. For me - I'm fairly self-aware, so while it was fun, I didn't get any life-changing benefits from it.<br /><br />I'm also honestly a bit insulted that they made us buy the book when most of the info is available online or could easily have been. Why not make this a simple online test that we can pay online to take? Save the trees, save the gasoline... The idea that in order for my partner to take the test he needs to buy his own book is just dumb. He could easily share mine and not need to waste more resources.<br /><br />I think the test would be more useful in my life if I could get a few relatives and friends to enjoy taking it with me - but the idea of getting them each to buy their very own copy of a book to take an online test is just puzzling and odd to me, so I'm moving on.<br /><br />Some good stuff here, but they need to come into the internet age.e test he needs to buy his own book is just dumb.

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|I did a side by side comparison of the last DVD release of The Terminator with this new Blu-ray and found some slight improvement.  Nothing here will slap you upside the head with heretofore unseen clarity, but details do pop more than the on the DVD release.  I chalk this up more to limitations with the source material than with a sub-par transfer.  The Terminator was a low budget film after all.  This may not be enough to justify an upgrade for some viewers, but at the low price Amazon is currently offering I find it perfectly justifiable upgrade.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this Blu-ray release omits a number of the bonus features of the DVD if that makes any difference to you.  Personally, I want better image and sound first and foremost which this release offers, especially in the sound department.<br /><br />The movie itself = 5 stars<br />Blu-ray transfer = 4 stars
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This Sci-fi classic looks better than ever on Blu-ray.  I did a side by side comparison with the 2 disc Ultimate Edition DVD and noticed a striking difference in clarity, color and sharpness. Watching the Blu-ray, it was like a gray screen had been removed from between me and the TV. Audio is also substantially better than the DVD release.<br /><br />If just a better looking and sounding movie isn't enough for you, then just about every bonus feature ever created for T2 has been ported over to this Blu-ray release. Combined with the low price of the Blu-ray, there is really no reason not to upgrade or buy for the first time.<br /><br />This is what Blu-ray is all about, making classic films look better than ever.
B002UXRGM0|4.0|There is no doubt the footage is excellent and the content is highly educational but...    There is no title index on the cover. If you have disk changer and all the disks are inside there is no way to know what exactly each disk contains.    The way how the disks are placed in the cover is annoying. You have to remove the top disk in order to get the bottom.    Some of the disks contain advertisements of the Planet Earth movie and some other which you cannot skip. Those are about 2 minutes of watching crap.
1423113381|2.0|I was so excited about reading this book after the fun and adventure Riordan created in Percy Jackson, however, the Kanes do not match Percy the slightest bit.  This book starts out in similar fashion as Percy Jackson as it provides a warning as to how real the story is, which is meant to grab the reader immediately and pull them in.  Somehow this book does not carry it off as well, though.  The father, Dr. Kane, is extremely secretive to his son, Carter, and is constantly doing mysterious things with no explanation.  Then the sister, Sadie, comes into the story and Dr. Kane gets buried alive by an egyptian god.  What I had hoped for as fun turns out to be quite creepy.  The story is filled with eyptian references, but instead of the same charm that Percy Jackson carried out with monsters, this book comes across much more dangerously.  There are spells, superstitions, demons, and gods in this book.  Like I said, just not enjoyable.  Another let down was that Sadie and Carter have to get to know one another so the dynamic between them is untrustworthy and cutting to one another.  Percy had to depend on his mates with his life and the relationships are quite comical.  These are refreshing differences, but the red pyramid falls short of the same magic and charm that Percy Jackson carried out.  Riordan is a gifted writer, but this book is disappointing.  For those who aren't sure, rent it from the library.
B002RAREAK|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this CD. Although it's not as good as \\"confessions,\\" it's definitely better than \\"Here I stand,\\" which I love as well. Usher steps out of the box for this one with cuts like \\"OMG\\" and \\"Little Freak\\" while still keeping it vintage Usher with cuts like \\"here comes my baby\\" and \\"daddy's home.\\" I think this is a great album, definitely worth having.
B002VECLVO|4.0|The year is 1962, and George (Colin Firth), a quiet college professor, is about to kill himself.  His lover has died and George has calmly decided that he cannot bear to live another day alone.  He teaches a class, puts his papers in order, sees his best friend, and is ready to go.  Then, one of his students interrupts his plan.<br /><br />This very intimate, somber, arty film has a good script and good actors.  Firth gives a wonderful performance as a man who welcomes death; his expressive eyes speak volumes about George's pain.  Julianne Moore looks like Ann-Margret with a questionable British accent and is really annoying in a small role.  Nicholas Hoult is excellent as the student who makes George think there may be a reason to live after all.<br /><br />The director uses constant flashbacks and stylized photography and changing colors to make his emotional points and I think it all comes across as a bit heavy-handed, as does the Bernard Herrmann-esque soundtrack.  It's a wonderful, delicate story that could very well have stood on its own without the special effects or music that reminds one of \\"Vertigo.\\"  Recommended if you're looking for a thoughtful, quiet film with the message of \\"appreciate every moment.\\"
B003JR1JV0|4.0|I think Miley's new CD of songs is good, and sounds less like teen music than your typical Hannah Montana stuff. So, it is good that she sounds more grown-up. But I'm torn between loving her Hannah sound versus her mature sound. Because part of me wishes Miley never grow up. I didn't like the concert DVD that much, because she isn't really that great of a stage performer or vocalist. She seems to sound tired from running back and forth, and her singing is marred by her breathing. She also seems to scream very annoyingly once in while in her songs. I have no problem with her trying to be sexy and stuff, but getting close and simulating sexy stuff with guitar players and dancers, I could do without. I rate her CD of new songs higher than the DVD. Her concert doesn't include any of her new songs. I seem to think she's a better actress than a singer, especially as a concert performer. But I think her work and sound in the studio is likeable.

9889979942|5.0|I can't afford to travel to China. However, with Tom Carter's book, not only do I feel like I'm there but I'm also seeing the country in a way that no tourism would ever show me. His photos are both breathtaking and thought-provoking. Carter's ability to use his camera to provoke emotion is astounding. We see the beauty of China and its people, the rich and the poor, their struggles, their accomplishments, and their culture. This book is truly a masterpiece.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I have the soundtracks from both Twilight and New Moon.  Like the movies, the soundtracks get better and better every time.  I LOVED the New Moon soundtrack and didn't really expect Eclipse to outdo it.  The Eclipse soundtrack is great.  There is a wonderful mixture of upbeat music and some really emotional songs.  Jacob's Theme is instrumental, but for those of you who have read the books it really puts his feelings into music.  Amazing.  A couple other songs that really stick out for me are My Love by SIA.  It's beautifully haunting.  Chop and Change by The Black Keys is pretty sexy to me, I can picture this song in many movies other than Eclipse.  A couple more gems on this album are Lets Get Lost by Beck & Bat For Lashes and Heavy in Your Arms by Florence & The Machine.   If you like less than mainstream music give this soundtrack a listen.  It is really fabulous, not only for Twihards, but music lovers in general!
B002QGUFWE|1.0|MTV is such a great station! I couldn't sleep last night becuz i was up til 3am watching the latest videoz of the best artists ever.......Besides Jonas Brothers and Limp Bizkit, Lady Gaga has to be one of the greatist musicians to ever put musics out on the radio! Stupid poser bandz like Daft Punk, Air, the Cars, and Children of Bodom don't know how to use keyboards like Lady Gaga does! Lady Gaga can also play every instrument......take that Varg Vikernes! Plus, if she wasn't good then why would MTV, VH1, and the radio play her all the time?     Learn from music geniuses like Lady Gaga, Kesha, Limp Bizkit, Jonas Brothers, and the ultra talented Puff Daddy/Diddy/Doddy/Duddy (LOL!)
B000063V8T|4.0|All in all a sturdy season five set of episodes with the usual TNG entertaining collection of 'techno-babble', 'Cause and Effect' and 'The Next Phase', to the brilliant and whimsical 'The Inner Light'.  Horrors of the season were 'Imaginary Friend' and 'Cost of Living'.      One little gem appears in the episode 'Conundrum'.  Data and Troi in the opening teaser are playing three D chess.  Data in his usual methodical manner advises Troi that he will have her 'King' in check very soon.  Troi surprises him with an unforseen move that will win her the game.  Anyone ever notice what the 'King', piece is?  Someone else's review may have mentioned it, but I thought it still worth a giggle.  It's the 'Lost in Space' TV series robot.    A nice little 'in' joke from the production crew.  I've seldom ever seen it referred to.      Season five suffers a little too much from familiarity breeding run of the mill, however each episode does offer something for everyone, both topical, technical and a little bit fairytale.

I DONT KNOW! but she is sure one talented musician.....the world needs more of her type of music......    Avoid terrible women singers like Doro, Blondie, Janis Joplin, Joan Jett, Mamas and Papas, the Carpenters, and especially Fleetwood Mac!!!!!!
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is the first book in a new series (book2: Catching Fire, book 3: Mockingjay). In a post-apocalyptic world, the United States is divided into districts, who are oppressed from the Capitol. People are not allowed to move freely and while the Capitol enjoys many entertainments the districts are suffering. Each year the Capitol requires two teens to be chosen from each district to participate in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are required viewing for all citizens making them a reality show; however, the games are not fun, it is a fight to the death. The story follows Katniss who volunteers to go to the games in the place of her younger sister. Peeta is also picked from her district. The story unfolds as the two travel to the Capitol and prepare for the games. The reality of the games is clear as they meet their opponents. Katniss questions the purpose of the games and really doesn't want to kill anyone but she also doesn't want to die.<br />A very interesting story that only gets better as you get into it. Almost a warning to society today of what the future could hold...A Brave New World. As a high school English teacher, I've recommended the book to a number of students who have all enjoyed reading the book. Most of them say the beginning is boring, but once they get farther into the book they can't stop reading (even reluctant readers). Everyone who has read the first book, requests the second book.  I highly recommend reading the book.

1594481784|3.0|Rob, a floundering record-store owner in his mid-thirties, is having something of a crisis.  Hie long-time girlfriend Laura has just left him, and Rob is feeling like he might never find someone else.  It seems that most of the relationships in his life have spectacularly imploded, breaking his heart over and over.    Rob decides to examine his past relationships in detail, going so far as to track down the girls he knew in adolescence to find out where he went wrong.  He studiously pretends to be unaffected by Laura's leaving him, while secretly feeling devastated and insecure.    Parts of this book were very entertaining.  I liked the idea of Rob tracking down all of his former girlfriends and having them tell him what happened in their relationships that made him unappealing.  I liked Rob's internal journey to come to terms with who he was and what he really wanted in his life.    Rob was a pretty depressing character, though.  He had few prospects and his business wasn't doing well.  He refused to get himself permanently entangled in a relationship, and was also unwilling to make more solid career plans.  Everyone he encountered seemed to annoy him or make him nervous, even those he considered his friends.  It was a bit hard to be invested in his story when he made it obvious that he wasn't trying to change the things in his life that made him unhappy.

B001HBEDKY|3.0|Yes, \\"Kind of Blue\\" is a Jazz(and music) classic, and musically speaking, this is a definitive edition. The main album sounds fine(to me, that is, because I've only owned one of the many previous CD editions). There's little material that can be added:one alternate take, plus numerous bits of session talk & false starts. The second CD adds other selections by the same line-up(Davis, Adderly,Coltrane,Cobbs,Evans) and a live version of \\"So What\\". The DVD features the excellent \\"The Sound of Miles Davis\\" T.V. broadcast from 1959, which you'll want to watch again and again, and a documentary about the making of \\"A Kind of Blue\\", which is interesting, but it's something you'll want to watch only once. The box also features a blue vinyl L.P. pressing of the \\"Kind of Blue\\" album. I was lucky, and my copy was flat and played fine. There's an attractive hardcover book with essays and plenty of photos of Miles & his group, a black & white poster featuring 3 photos of Miles at Columbia Studios plus an envelope of memorabilia, including a reproduction of pianist Bill Evans handwritten rough draft of the album's liner notes,a reproduction of a Columbia Records promotional brochure, and six 8' x 10\\" photos of Miles & his musicians(one photo was missing from my set, and I got a duplicate of one of the other 5)                           The problem with this set which cause me to give it only three stars is Sony's disc-damaging packaging. The 2 CD's & The DVD fit into excessively snug pockets inside the L.P. record's gatefold sleeve. As the many(now removed) reviews established, there is no way that you'll get the 2 CD's & the DVD in anything remotely resembling decent condition, and if you put the discs back into this packaging, the marks will get worse and worse.                           If you want to own this set, make plans to send the two CD's & the DVD to a CD resurfacing/repair company. That's what I did, and now my three discs are in the perfect condition that they shouldhave been from the outset. Needless to say, I'm storing the 3 discs in regular CD jewel boxes now.                           After Sony Music's superb effort to put things right for people who bought the 71-disc \\"Miles Davis-The Complete Columbia Studio Albums\\"box set (they provided replacement box sets for everyone who bought the first production run of the 71-disc set, after the original sets suffered from glue stains on the discs, and a torn,dented, extremely fragile outer box), I am surprised that they didn't remedy the problems with this set, because everyone got badly scratched CD's & DVD's. While Amazon themselves are no longer selling this set, Sony Music is still selling it through the official Miles Davis website.                           I'm expecting that the forthcoming \\"Miles Davis-Bitches Brew\\" CD + DVD + L.P. set will have similar problems, but I'm a Miles Davis fan, and I'll buy it. This will undoubtedly result in my having to send discs out to the CD resurfacing company. This is \\"Kind of Sad\\".                                                 As an update to the above, Sony may have learned their lesson:The disc pockets in the \\"Bitches Brew\\" box set were designed differently, and they don't damage the discs.

1563899426|5.0|Well written story of Fairy tales called fables residing in New York city. I was unaware of the Fables graphic novel line until I happen upon the book Peter and Max, one of the best works I have read in many years, and decided to see what the Vertigo comic was all about.  There has been a lot of praise already posted on this site for the work, but for those a little tepid about a fairy tale, well - this is not your \\"scare the kids straight\\" king of fairy tale. Very adult material, but not overly so, that you should have no fear of investing your time into. Warning: If you read one, you'll want them all.
0812973992|5.0|One of the better novels to address the emotions, trauma and life after the terrorist attack on NYC and on the collective American consciousness. This book shows us what makes America so attractive, despite of all the vices, the social underpinning, the non-sense death. This book achieves an almost Gatsby-like response, sprung from the landscape that millions called home yet outsiders might view it a corrupted, unrelenting social distortion, laid wasted after the towers crumble to Earth.<br /><br />Reading this book is an amazing journey, the levels, the characters, and interconnectedness of our lives that we sometimes try so hard to disassociate from.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|First of all I will only echo the other reviewers and say that this is a Hollywood Classic. It is one of the best adventure escapist films ever made. The Blu-Ray edition looks wonderful, has a ton of extras, some more interesting than others. My only complaint is that the film is in monorual sound or 1.0 . Other than that I love this disc.<br /><br />At its low price it is a steal, and a must have for lovers of classic hollywood films.

B000IZJ1J8|5.0|This English trio of darkness have called themselves the \\"heaviest band in the Universe...\\"  I can't disagree with that fact, no Sir, not one bit.  Listening to this album is like trying to swim laps in Mississippi mud, a veritable quagmire of colossal magnitude thrust upon your shoulders rendering you helpless.  Funeralopolis with it's melodic detuned chugging is akin to the stickiest of the icky!  After one listen you can practically feel your consciousness descend like lead into the pit of your stomach as this unholy triumvirate's melodies drag you down into the sludge factory of DOOM METAL!  This album is amazing if you're down with music that sounds like it was written by Lu Cifer himself!!!  After all if metal is the product of Satan...  THEN AT LEAST HE JAMS!!!!!
B000001ESJ|5.0|This is the beginning of the second phase of Rush, in which they begin to shift towards their more Dystopian lyrics and bigger arrangements musically. At this point in their lives, Alex, Geddy, and Neil have expanded their musical arsenal and added percussion and keyboards to their sound, making good use of the multi-track recording systems of the day and making for bigger sounding albums.<br /><br />A FAREWELL TO KINGS - Unlike previous albums, this album begins with acoustic guitars, bells, and keyboards instead of straight ahead rock. At about 1:10, the band kicks in to the harder part of the song, and builds to the first verse. I love this song, however i wish that they would have hit you in the face with a big sound from the first chord instead of building into it.<br /><br />XANADU - This song begins with low keys and Neil on percussion and volume swells from Alex. It takes a few minutes to build the track up to the song, and at about 2:57 the groove kicks in, and the themes of this song will eventually become the themes within the Hemispheres album. This song appears to be instrumental, however at the 5 minute mark, the lyrics actually begin. Chiming in at just over 11 minutes, this is still a fun song to listen to.<br /><br />CLOSER TO THE HEART - A fan favorite for years, and just recently dropped from the band's set list because they actually got burned out on playing it. This is still a great song, with a catchy melody and singable chorus.<br /><br />CINDERELLA MAN - Lyrics by Geddy - this has the signature sound of Progressive rock with changing time signatures, syncopation, and multiple parts strung together to make the verse sections. The chorus also has a staple from the Rush catalog of making the chorus softer than the rest of the song for reverse emphasis. The guitar solo is a fun blend on a whirl effect moving it from left to right speaker, with the Classic Alex tone and wah solo.<br /><br />MADRIGAL - Starting with the typical Acoustic on the left, clean electric on the right, and keyboard introduction. This is one of Rush's shorter songs, and very Ballad-like in structure and tone.<br /><br />CYGNUS X-1 - This songs stars off with the Synthesized vocals and reverse bells, giving it a very space sound backdrop for the story of the travel through space to find the signal from Cygnus, which may or not be another black hole. The bass groove on this can be heard blending in at about 1:40, and it is in full swing at about 2:14. This is one of my first \\"Cool Groove\\" moments listening to Rush some 20 odd years ago. I still love the syncopation and rhythmic diversity of this track. The lyrical story begins at about 5:05.

1441866868|5.0|Generipping. Plagues. Cheshire cats. Kink springs. Megadonts. Calorie companies. And New People. Why? Because of something that isn't in this future: oil. At some undefined time in the past of this story, the world ran out of oil. Travel came to a halt. International trade stopped. And everything collapsed.<br /><br />\\"The Windup Girl\\" takes place in Thailand, some undefined period of time after the collapse. The country has survived by closing itself off from the rest of the world, fighting off the plagues, holding at bay the Western world dominated by the calorie companies that control the world food supply. The country is powered by human and animal muscle. Kinetic energy is stored in kink springs that run industry.<br /><br />The political balance in the county shifts between the ministries of Trade and Environment. But the West is knocking at the doors of the Thai kingdom. Clipper ships and dirigibles have brought international trade back, with all its benefits and dangers.<br /><br />This is a complex story that demands a bit of thought and attention. The cast is large, but not so much that you lose track of people. The politics are central to the story, but not so convoluted that it gets confusing or boring. The setting is different enough to put it squarely into the realm of science fiction, but close enough to be more than a little scary. And the plot... well, I never knew what direction it was going to run off in next.<br /><br />I was fascinated by this book. I hope that Paolo Bacigalupi returns to this world in future novels. He has clearly developed a pretty detailed back story, and drops a lot of hints that make the reader want to know more.
1401227821|5.0|Adam Hughes is a better artist than you.  Adam Hughes is a better artist than me.  Adam Hughes is depressingly, embarrassingly good, and he's making everyone else look bad.     Adam Hughes must be stopped.    So don't any of you buy this book!  If you buy this book, Adam Hughes might know how good he is.  He might keep drawing, and he might even, (through some dastardly witchcraft,) become EVEN BETTER.  And then I might have to kill myself.  So don't any of you buy this book!    Since none of you will be buying this book, because I told you not to... I'll let you know what you're missing.    The first 25 pages showcase some of Hughes' earlier work, from the late `80s to early `90s.  The largest section of the book, at about 75 pages, is dedicated to his Wonder Woman covers.  Then there're about 50 pages of Catwoman covers, followed by 50-ish pages of miscellany (some Superman/fam, Rose & Thorn, Gen13, JLA, Teen Titans, Power Girl, and Batwoman). This is interspersed with a few double-page spotlights on his merchandise-design work (busts, statues, and posters/t-shirts).  All sections include sketches, preliminary thumbnails, and commentary, so you get an idea of how the artist works.    This is not a complete sampling of Hughes' work: as the title indicates, only the stuff he's done for DC is represented here.  So unfortunately, that means no Tomb Raider, no Red Sonja, no Star Wars, no Marvel characters.  The book can't really be faulted for this: it delivers exactly what's promised on the cover.  But here's hoping Hughes' will get the chance to publish more collections.    I mean..!  Curse you, Adam Hughes!      DON'T ANYONE BUY THIS AWESOME, AWESOME BOOK!
B003INBNXO|5.0|This is the best kung-fu movie I have ever seen in the recent years!  It illustrates the life and the character of Bruce Lee's great master 'Ip Man'.  I have been waiting for 2 years to have it formally released in the U.S.  I am looking forward to this movie!
0786889284|4.0|Veteran homicide detective Lou Boldt is called onto the scene of a house fire, where the flames had been so fearsome that none of the firefighters had ever experienced anything like it. In tandem with profiler Daphne Matthews, Boldt is determined to smoke out the vicious arsonist, who strikes again a few days later. Within this scenario, author Pearson spins out a riveting subplot.  Ben Santoro, the twelve year old victim of a sadistic stepfather, has found a safe haven in the home of psychic Emily Richland, and in the course of their friendship, both become involved with arsonist. Finally, the intense attraction that Boldt and Matthews feel for each other is compounded when Boldt suspects that his wife, whom he also loves, is having an affair.<br /><br />Starting with practically no hard evidence, Boldt obstinately pursues clues to the identity of the killer, who uses rocket fuel to create his infernos. Little by little the tension builds, and the final third of the book is so suspenseful that it is difficult to put down. The denouement in Ben's story is a satisfying one, but the reader is left hanging in the final scenes between Boldt and his wife, his behavior toward her having been appallingly distant. He's a great cop, but he could use some help with his own character.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|This is not what I expected.  This movie could have gone in so many directions, and I liked trying to predict it.  I was wrong every time.  PTSD, Delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations...  Good job!  The complicated ending was also done well and a WOW for me.  The main characters choice at the end, made me wonder what I would chose.
0375413405|5.0|This is the second copy of this book that I bought since my original is in storage somewhere in Michigan.  Julia is a master at telling you what to do as well as why to do it and how to recover from inevitable mistakes.  Cooking her way does take us back to a time when people actually made time to cook.  I enjoy taking the time to make the delicious dishes described in here.  Many recipes are actually quite quick and they always lead me to try something new, which is the sure path to a more fulfilling experience in the kitchen.  A master work.

B000022TSH|2.0|I got the dvd reasonably quick, but the case came in pieces.  The seller just sent the dvd in an envelope with no protective bubble wrap or anything.  I'm glad it was just the case and not the dvd.  Its very disheartening when you pick up a package you have been looking forward to and hear pieces rattling around.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because I am comparing it to Dream Theater's entire body of work.  I am a die hard DT fan and while I love this album, it's not quite up there with Scenes From a Memory or Images and Words.  But if you're a fan of DT or any progressive metal or rock you will enjoy this album.  There's some softer stuff, like Wither and Best of Times, and some hard stuff like A Nightmare to Remember.  Then The Count of Tuscany, one of their best epic songs, is a combination of both and was composed beautifully.    In summary, any DT fan will be happy with this album and with all the crappy music out there today this more than worth the $15 to buy.
0812550706|5.0|I hadn't picked up a sci-fi/fantasy book in over 15 years before I went looking to have something to read while on vacation. When I was younger I mostly read Dragonlance and Star Wars books. While browsing on Amazon I came across this book due to the number of positive reviews and the story being based around futuristic space combat. I have to say this has been one of the best and easiest to read books I have ever opened. Once you pick the book up it's difficult to put down. I finished reading it in less than two days and wished it'd been another 300 pages longer once I'd flipped over the last page.    I won't go through the summary of the book since this has been done in countless reviews so I'll just add my thoughts on points of the book that stick out to me.    One of the biggest positives for me was the ease of reading of the book. I don't remember having to re-read any sentences in the book to grab the meaning and I didn't even notice myself turning the pages as I read.    There wasn't a bunch of characters to keep up with and the side characters were written in a way that they were easily identifiable when they showed up each time in the book. One reason for this is the book stays mostly focused on Ender's point of view and doesn't try to write a point of view for each friend/enemy he comes across.    The ending has two twists that I thought fit very well with the story and unfortunately I ruined one of them for myself by reading too many Amazon reviews and reviews of other books in the series. Without spoiling it for someone else I will say I really liked how the author used the dream sequence throughout the book and tied a meaning to it near the end.    Something I found different about this book compared to the books I'd read as a kid was the books I was used to reading had an adult/adults protagonist and antagonist. The protagonist of the book starts out at 6 years old but acts like and is written more as an adult. It took a few chapters of reading to suspend disbelief of this concept and treat the character as a special case (The author on countless occasions makes sure you remember the age of the characters). The book makes references to Ender and his siblings being \\"special\\" but doesn't go into detail whether it's through genetic manipulation or something else; only that his parents were authorized to have a third child when the first two didn't pan out (couples by law weren't allowed more than two children). His two siblings are also written more like adults than kids and end up manipulating world politics in their pre-teen years.    The main character is also portrayed as having ruthless fighting tactics which was hard to picture for a 6 year old hero (or maybe I should say anti-hero) character. His fights weren't knocking someone out, rendering them unconscious or blooding someone's nose but to permanently put kids (close to his own age) out of commission. The writer tries to justify this by dropping the hero in \\"odds stacked against him\\" situations but it's still hard picturing a 6 year old launching killing maneuvers against other kids less than ten years of age; regardless what they did to him.    The ending to the book wraps up a little abruptly and due to one of the twists near the end there isn't much suspense built up when the climax of the book comes.    I haven't yet decided if I'll read the other books in the series. From reading reviews of those books they don't appear to live up to the first in the series and the writing style seems to be more about political and social issues as opposed to interstellar war.    Overall I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction/fantasy and especially futuristic fiction.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Went to see it in 3D and enjoyed it.  Bought the Blu Ray and enjoyed it twice as much.  I don't see  that wearing glasses to get a movie in 3D will be a winner long term.   I think it will turn out to be a fad.   The 2D Blu Ray is clear & the sound is wonderful.  I know there will be another addition with more extras, but if you are mostly interested in the movie then buy this one and enjoy.
B002OOG6YY|5.0|This is what it should have been in the first place- one show, one set. Powerful performance from the best Marilyn Manson lineup ever. Get this even if you already have the 2002 DVD version. Trust me. It's a good upgrade.
B00275EGX8|3.0|I bought the Blu Ray from Amazon figuring it would be an outstanding picture having just won best picture.  I enjoyed the movie but consider it an average movie, nothing special.  It is not a movie that I would watch a second time.  In contrast Avatar I saw it in the theater in 3D and have since watched it twice on Blu Ray.  It is a movie I will watch many more times.  Hurt locker was a disappointment. My advise........Rent it don't buy it.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This movie was shocking, deals with real life issues of the real world.  If you looking for a fairy tale, this is not the movie for you. The acting was awesome.
1416594787|4.0|As always, Dawkins is a fantastic science writer. This book is no exception: the language is fantastic and the anecdotes about evolution are very interesting and enlightening.    But while this book contains a lot of evidence for evolution, it comes secondary to Dawkins desire to communicate how wonderful nature is. While this is a very good goal in itself, a person doubting evolution might still have doubts after reading this book. Not because the evidence isn't there, but because it is presented in a way that requires some thought.    Basically, this book is a condensed version of the fantastic \\"Ancestor's Tale\\" by the same author.
B0036EH3WK|1.0|Which is why millions of people communed on message boards and around water coolers across the nation, to discuss at great length and depth the characters of the show.  There were so many theories and much, much speculation as to the state of Sun and Jin's marriage, and whether Jack would ever find reconciliation with his deceased father.  Everyone wondered if Michael would ever find forgiveness in the eyes of his estranged son, Walt.  Will Hurley ever find love again? Will Kate and Sawyer be able to escape their turbulent pasts?  Will Sayid ever be able to forgive himself? Yes, these were the discussions taking place on message boards and around water coolers for the past 6 years.  No, wait... I'm remembering that wrong.    I've loved Lost since it premiered in 2004.  I've followed the show faithfully, which is why, even to this day, when I talk about Lost, I get pissed.  Really pissed.  Without \\"spoiling\\" anything, I will say this:  What \\"answers\\" (and I use that term loosely... VERY loosely) the writers did give us were the kind of answers that parents give children who ask questions they either don't know the answer to, or are just too lazy to answer intelligently.  But then again, what am I saying?  This show was all about the characters.

0399156577|2.0|I really like Nora Roberts, but I was really disappointed in The Search.  I was five hours into the book before it got somewhat interesting.  The book meanders from long multiple dog training sessions, boring dog rescue searches, and a scene on tree planting.  If you make it to the tree planting you're doing well.  The two main characters, Fiona and Simon, are fun at times when they are together.  There are splashes of humor between the two that will catch you off guard.  (So don't have a mouth full of food or drink.)<br /><br />After escaping a now imprisoned serial killer, Fiona deals with a copy cat serial killer wanting to finish the job.  I just didn't care after all the dog training. I think there was a silly theory that Fiona should figure out the minds of these two killers like she figures out the behaviors of dogs?  What?<br /><br />I was expecting a perilous ending when Fiona would confront the man who wanted her dead.  It was such a letdown.  It ended in about two seconds. No fiery ending whatsoever.<br /><br />The best of Nora Roberts Romantic Suspense - [[ASIN:0515130389 Carolina Moon]], [[ASIN:0515137111 Birthright]], [[ASIN:0515148040 Black Hills]], and [[ASIN:0515141399 Blue Smoke]]
0307454541|4.0|This book is one you have to understand going in that the first 100 pages you're going to want to put the book down and start something else.  It takes awhile setting up the past of the two characters and the plot before the momentum kicks in, but once it does you'll be glad you stuck with it.  Other than one plot element which involves one of the supporting characters having some special knowledge which allows the mystery to avoid a dead-end, the book is flawless in bringing dimension to these two flawed characters.  I like the weird direction it went when it came to being more than a reporter's search for a missing girl.  Let's say though that I immediately dove in to \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", so I certainly took out of it what the author and publishers wanted.

B003NFM3JU|4.0|I am a \\"Christmas Carol nut\\" and have 7 versions of the movie, the book, a trivia book, figures etc. etc.  This was a good attempt.  No version I have, or have seen, is completely true to the book and this is no exception.  But Disney's Carol is relatively close.  It is also a movie where the 3D effects seemed planned and enhance the scene.  For example, when looking inside Nephew Fred's, there is a layer of snowflakes, the layer of the exterior and then the characters in the interior.  Well done!  Carrey does a good job of being Scrooge... he is a bit over-the-top for my tastes, but not bad.  The movie got 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't find him believable as the 3 ghosts.  This is not my favorite version of the Carol, but I like it and have pre-ordered the DVDs.
0739368257|5.0|I came to this audiobook a fan of the books, so I'm merely here to tell others that if they like audiobooks, this one is a must-listen. Tim Curry's reading is amazing, nuanced and enthralling. He caresses words as he speaks, and his characterization via dialogue was so good I thought they'd hired a troop of actors. It is among the best readings I've ever heard.
1556438850|5.0|This book is just great!

I can only recommend it to every young teacher.
1439153663|5.0|Loved this book from the moment I read the synopsis.  I had no idea that there were any slaves that were NOT african-american, and I found it interesting that Lavinia being a white slave, rather than a black slave, got somewhat better treatment.    Some other reviewers did not like the writing style of describing the same event/scent from the perspective of different characters, but that was one of the things I loved most about the book.      I am looking forward to other books from Kathleen Grissom.

030745455X|4.0|Mikael Bloomkvist, Millenium publisher, has been approached by a journalist with a well-researched investigation into sex trafficking.  Bloomkvist cannot resist becoming involved: he has built a reputation through exposing corrupt Swedish establishment figures.<br /><br />Bloomkvist's attempts to contact Lisbeth Salander (`The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) have largely been unsuccessful: she is avoiding him in person while closely monitoring his activities via his computer.  Salander's own past draws her inexorably into the sex trafficking investigation.<br /><br />And then there are three murders.  Evidence indicates that Salander was involved, but she disappears. Bloomkvist believes that she is innocent and tries to find her, and to work out who the killer really is.  It's a race against time as Salander is not only being sought by Bloomkvist and the police.<br /><br />Two stories unfold simultaneously in this novel.  First, there is the investigation into the murders which encompasses the sex trafficking investigation.  Secondly, there is Lisbeth Salander's traumatic past.  The action moves between different sets of characters: the police investigation; an investigation by the private security investigator who once employed Salander; by Bloomkvist and also Salander's own activities.<br /><br />In the world inhabited by Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Bloomkvist, coincidence certainly seems to play a large part, yet this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story.  Sure, some of the action seemed over the top and some of the characters - especially the bad guys - are stereotypes.  But the central characters of Mikael Bloomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are flawed and enigmatic, and that is enough for me.  This is the second book in the Millennium Trilogy, and I would strongly recommend reading them in order.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

B000F8O35U|1.0|Received this video and it was sealed as it stated in product description but it was obvious this wasn't a real Disney video.  The usual label was missing sealing the outside of the case and the usual Disney info from the inside of the case wss missing, including the Disney code for Disney bonus materials.  Also the disc artwork looked different from our previous Little Mermaid DVD that got stuck in a DVD player.  The video also gets stuck in the very beginning every time we play the movie and then jumps during the Kiss the Girl scene and then the audio doesn't match the video.  I'm very disappointed that this was represented as new, sealed DVD and it was a copy.  I didn't return it however because it is my daughter's favorite movie right now and I can't find it anywhere else.  This is the second Disney DVD I have ordered through Amazon that has obviously been a fake.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|I really loved the show since the Pilot. The way they introduced the characters from Castle to Beckett to even his ex-wife.<br />The second season continues with the strength the first season started, it even contains better episodes like Boom!<br /><br />The way Nathan interacts with his daughter is outstanding and I think this is how father-daughter relations should be. The suspense in his relation with Det.Beckett is great, it keeps us laughing and expecting at the same time.<br />I think everyone who loves Nathan Fillion, police shows, comedy, action and perfection should love this show.
0307454541|1.0|One of the reviews on the back of this book says something like \\"the movies of Ingmar Bergman crossed with the novels of Thomas Harris.\\" Methinks there's far too much Bergman and not nearly enough Harris in this turgid, lethargic mystery novel. I really wanted to like it and looked forward to reading it. After all, the book is an international sensation loved by millions. I charged in. After more than 150 I was still waiting for something, anything, to happen. Nothing. From what I've read about the book, stuff DOES eventually happen, and some pretty grisly, Thomas Harris stuff indeed. Maybe by page 250. But getting there just isn't worth it.  I gather the movie version, out of necessity, tosses all the excess baggage and gets on with the story. I plan to give that a try. I don't know. Maybe I'll come back in a year or so and give this book another go, but right now this just seems like one big boring disappointment.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Rush has been an inspiration to me and my friends since the early 80s, I heard all their music, read all their lyrics, heard all interviews, read all the books and bios, and even listened to their side projects.

This movie comes out to prove me wrong, that my band has more glory than I ever realized. Watch the movie and thank god that you are a RUSH fan.

B003JLA4KS|5.0|Back in 1977 a friend of mine said that I've just got to hear this new live album by the band called Rush. At the time I was probably the biggest Rainbow fan on Earth and I was totally into their new live album called [[ASIN:B00000IMTG On Stage]]. In my opinion there couldn't possibly be anything better than the combined talents of Ronnie James Dio, Ritchie Blackmore and Cozy Powell blastin' out A Light in the Black or Kill the King. I had heard of Rush, but I never really gave them a listen because I was told that it was bad Progressive Rock with a singer that sounded like he'd just inhaled helium.<br /><br />So over to my friend's house I went after school on that day in 1977, thinking more about indulging in some of his fine Columbian versus listening to [[ASIN:B000001ESH this new Rush album]]. And it was that day that turned my Rock & Roll world upside down...and not because of the Columbian. I was absolutely captivated by what I was hearing from \\"Hello would you please welcome home..Rush!\\" to \\"Thank you. Good night!\\" And furthermore, as a drummer, I'd never heard playing like what I heard Neil Peart doing on the album. The next day I went out and bought Rush's first four studio albums, All the World's a Stage and was excited to learn that a fifth called [[ASIN:B000001ESJ Farewell to Kings]] would be released in weeks.<br /><br />Why the background story? Because I would say that most of Beyond the Lighted Stage is devoted to describing Rush's exploits during the same time period that I became a fan. I'd say 75% of the documentary covers Rush's experiences from the mid 70s through the early 80s. And to me, those are the golden years of Rush. I know that there's a world of fans that continued to be big fans of Rush's \\"new material\\" from the mid 80s right up until the current day, but I will always view the disks up through [[ASIN:B000001ESP Moving Pictures]] as what shaped me musically and as a musician.<br /><br />Ironically, Beyond the Lighted Stage doesn't even make a mention of All the World's a Stage, but this DVD does an outstanding job of telling the story of Rush's formation, through their early days of getting signed with original drummer John Rutsey, through hiring \\"The New Guy\\", through making some of the absolute greatest recordings in Rock & Roll history. There's some unbelievable video in this documentary, and not just of the band playing together in their early years; I mean of candid moments behind the scenes with the band. In today's world it's not unusual to capture everything on video, but back in the 70s? What would be the chances of having video of the day that you announced to your parents that you're dropping out of high school to pursue your musical career?<br /><br />The main documentary is about an hour and 30 minutes long, and then there's like another hour and 30 minutes of bonus features that includes stuff that just didn't make it into the final cut of the documentary for whatever reason, some rare performance footage and some other fun stuff like pre-gig warm-up routines. By the end of watching all 3 hours of the DVD, I felt like I really knew these guys. Since that day that I heard All the World's a Stage in 1977, Rush has always been close to the heart, but now they're even Closer to the Heart.<br /><br />There is no question here...if you are a Rush fan add this to your cart. And if you don't own one of Rush's current live DVD's, pick one of those up too, because after watching Beyond the Lighted Stage you'll still be craving more. The perfect cap to Beyond the Lighted Stage for me was popping in [[ASIN:B000IOM0QA Rush in Rio]].n make a mention of All the World's a Stage, but this DVD does an outstanding job of telling the story of Rush's formation, through their early days of getting signed with original drummer John Rutsey, through hiring \\"The New Guy\\", through making some of the absolute greatest recordings in Rock & Roll history.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|Very few movies made in the last 10 years possess a certain \\"charm\\" to them that make me want to watch them again and again. Collateral is one of them! Cruise plays a slick, fearless hitman who oozes of confidence and charm, while Foxx is just a decent, regular guy. Both actors give fantastic performances and make this flick really fun to watch. Cruise's character, while ruthless and amoral, is intelligent, charming and quick-thinking. And he's a jazz music buff to boot! One of his marks is a noted local jazz trumpet player, and Vincent (Cruise) makes it a point to have Max drive him to the jazz club early enough to enjoy the trumpet player's performance, and even buy the musician a drink and talk about Miles Davis, before doing him in. Talk about a great script...just when you think Vincent is softening up a bit and deciding to bag his work for the evening, BAM! It's obvious he's not opposed to knocking off anyone, no matter how much he likes them! Somehow, though, it's hard NOT to like Vincent, he's just so cool in his own way. What's troubling about liking him (aside from the obvious fact that he's a vicious killer, of course) is that since Max knows that he's doing all of this killing, Vincent is going to have to knock him off, too, before the night is over. As others have noted, great character development!    Foxx's character (Max) is understandably freaked out when the trouble first begins, but rises to the occasion more and more as the story evolves. Even though the two characters are completely different, the chemistry between the two is nevertheless quite entertaining. The way Max borrows tough-guy one-liners from Vincent when his own \\"tough\\" gets going is also quite amusing!    As others have indicated, not the most realistic movie, but for sheer entertainment value, it's top-notch! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

0393061310|5.0|I had read some good and some not so encouraging reviews of this book before i finally decided to read it. I am glad i did not pay much attention to the negative ones. This is one book that probably should be placed in every important collection of avid readers. Loads of gifts in the form of deductive reasoning from the unwritten past, and each so compelling that you would have to accept it as the truth. This is phenomenal research which, as he mentions, must have taken the author more than two decades. This very enlightening work provides answers to some very big questions that any sufficenlty curious sapien would venture a guess at. Even if one does not agree with all of Diamond's reasoning, one still shall end up learning a lot from the book, and would be left both stunned and satisfied at the comprehensiveness of the volume. Please do yourself a favour and read this which i reckon more important than the 'Lord of the rings' for those who speak english. You shall rise from the experience a knowledgable and happy entity.    My sincere thanks to Mr. Jared Diamond for conducting the research and providing us with this masterpiece.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was skeptical. Get toned using a 30-min workout? Riiiight. I am thrilled to say Jillian proved me wrong! I'm on level 3 after 16 workouts (spaced out over a month so I can train for a marathon) and I can truly see a difference in my abs and arms. I am a Mommy of two who works out about 6 days a week. This is the first program that has made a significant difference in my appearance.    Here's how it breaks down: The program is broken into 3 levels of approx. 30 minutes each. Each level features 3 circuits that include strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute abs, plus a very short cool down at the end. In addition to the levels, the workouts feature women who model two different approaches to the moves. Natalie demonstrates the tougher moves, and Anita shows us the modified moves. (Jillian GUSHES about Natalie's appearance, and while she does look absolutely fantastic, Anita does, too!). The workout incorporates moves that require light hand weights and a padded surface (I use my yoga mat).    Another reviewer stated that Jillian's approach is \\"old-school gym class,\\" and I agree. She is tough but encouraging. When moves get hard, she reminds you to think of why you bought this workout in the first place - like  bikini shopping!    I LOVE that this is a fast and effective workout - perfect for Mommies trying to get a workout in during naps.    My ONLY criticism is that some of the tough moves ARE hard on knees. For instance, I don't do the jumping lunges in level 3, I stick with regular old lunges. I am a runner and I'm trying to be nice to my knees!    THANK YOU, JILLIAN! Keep 'em coming!
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I had read all the terrible reviews of the previous packaging of the complete series, and was very happy when the new box set was produced.  You have to search the Amazon site hard to find this.  Why it isn't the first version to appear on a search is beyond me.  The packaging is great, fits nicely on my shelf, the disks are well protected, and I am very happy.  I ordered it from Amazon, arrived very quickly, and looks great.  There's no toy cylon or anything silly like that.  Just every episode of the series (including Razor, and even The Plan, tucked away and uncredited in one of the Season 4 boxes), and is priced very nicely.  Remember to look for the gray box version.
9889979942|5.0|Mr. Carter captures with great vision and artistry the depth and breadth of China's diverse ethnic groups is a remarkable, comprehensive photographic diary of China's people.  When Mr. Carter set out on his journey, he was an amateur photographer, but it is clear that natural talent and passion for the people quickly developed his craft for capturing the soul and essence of people, with photos that could easily pass muster in publications traditionally dedicated to well-established photographers.  In the 900 images, Mr. Carter captures the diversity of the pupulation--both in physical characteristics and lifestyle--and brings to the viewer the knowledge and experience that most gain only through their own extensive personal travels, a luxury not available to many.  His images equally capture the essense of Chinese culture and lifestyle through candids of people at work and play as well as more traditional close-up portraiture.  Beautiful color, otherwise fleeting captured moments, and interesting perspectives add to the appeal of the book.    For those interested in Chinese culture, artistic yet journalistic portrait photography or looking for some depth of understanding before traveling to China, this book provides a comprehensive exposure through its pages.
B003MX5P20|1.0|Why not a complete English album this time, Why ?!     I have bought all Enrique's English albums so far (Enrique, Escape, Seven & Insomniac) and liked them all very much, but I am sorry to report that, this time, I have no intention of buying this one. I love all his English songs but on the other hand, I have never liked his other style when he sings in Spanish, which I'm sorry to say, but, it's just not the same. In Spanish his songs are mellower and much less dance and interesting, it's just not the kind of music I enjoy listening to.    To this moment, he managed to separate his two careers and produced separate albums for both languages and it was fine with me. I'm sorry to realize that this time he changed his mind and I surely won't be buying his albums anymore if he keeps on mixing the unmixable !     It's too bad because, all his previous English albums were truly fantastic and I will be listening and enjoying them for a longtime to come. I didn't like much when he sang with other singers whether it was Whitney Houston, Sarah O'Connor or Lil' Wayne etc because I love his voice, his talent, his presence, his songwriting but as long as it was all in English, it was tolerable, but I won't be wasting my hard earned money in this times of worldwide money crisis on albums like this one.    Please Enrique, come back with a real and complete English album next time, it's all I'm asking and waiting for. I have nothing against Spanish singers and I'm not nor English or American, I'm French, but English is the only language for dance music, to me anyway, that's just the way it is.    Besides I like it is not that good a song. It sounds too much like Can you hear it, there's too much yelling in it but I've still bought the single and will continue to buy all the singles from this album, as long as the songs released are the English ones. Yeah, I know, I may be stupid but I'm stubborn and at least, I'm consistent.
B002ZG9828|5.0|'Jonah Hex'. What are people saying about this character in this movie? What are they saying about the movie itself? 'People', whomever they are, many who probably have never seen the film, or ever watched a western in their life, have shown nothing but disdain for this film. 'Jonah Hex' is simply one of the best westerns to come along since 'Outlaw Josey Wales' (one of Clint Eastwood's best westerns). Forget about the bad marketing by Warner Bros. Forget about Megan Fox's 'image' (she is tough and very sexy in her limited scenes here). Josh Brolin, who, in interviews, says the film should be taken as camp, is correct. This is a supernatural western. This is a no-holds barred, shoot'em up, explosion filled, ghostly (originally from DC's Weird Tales) and fantastic western that blows the socks off of the viewer - if only the viewer were to take a second glance at it. Brolin is fantastic as the horribly scarred bounty hunter. The actor IS Jonah Hex (never a doubt). John Malkovich shows he's still as villainous as ever. And Fox is fine (forget that 'Transformers' crap, she is good in this). Even Aidan Quinn shows up as President Grant. This is a high class production, and the best western (and, alas, there are so few) to come out of Hollywood in some time. If it doesn't jive with the comic book exactly - and it doesn't - so what. Jonah Hex isn't Batman or Superman, he isn't Ironman or Spider-Man. Who cares? He is a unique character who deserves another chance at building an audience. Maybe DC will make it happen. But I really implore you. 'Jonah Hex' is a great western. Maybe you're expecting 'Hamlet' here, or even 'Twilight' or 'Toy Story'. This is Jonah Hex. He stands on his own. And if you do see it again (or for the first time for those fakers), you will see just how mind-blowing this film can be. I can't wait for the DVD to show up. I pray the director's cut last longer than 75 minutes. PEOPLE: Give it one more chance. I implore you. For most of you, you WILL be pleasantly surprised at how good 'Jonah Hex' really is. It'll blow you away!!!
B003IPC5SO|1.0|A lot of people say that this album is full of hits. I'm sorry to say nothing could be further from the truth. Because apart from All the lovers, the only potential single here is Looking for an angel. But all the other tracks are bland, uninteresting and all sound the same : just like Wow all over again.     Even Body Language that a lot of fans hate (I don't know why but some really do) had it all, just like Fever, X and Light years : they all include very different kind of songs : some beautiful slows (Loving You, Cosmic), experimental songs (Chocolate, Secret, Light years, Speakerphone) and off course a handful of hits (Red blooded woman, The one, In your eyes, On a night like this)    But on Aphrodite, even if Closer and Illusion are very good surprises (fresh and different), I'm sorry to report that there are no other potential hits like the ones I'm mentioned before in here.     Granted Cupid boy, Put your hands up and Aphrodite have a little something but if you compare them to Like a drug or Stars from X who really could have been singles instead of the ridiculous Two hearts and the awful Wow there is no standout track whatsoever in Aphrodite and that's a shame.    I've never been this disappointed with a Kylie Minogue album since the album Kylie Minogue (Confide in me, Put yourself in my place etc) and that was 16 years ago !     I was afraid of buying X 3 years ago (mainly because of his awful 1st single) and it was for me a very good surprise. This time I was sure this album was going to be a blast because the 1st single (and even its b-side) was truly amazing, so I've bought both editions of Aphrodite before even listening to it, one thing is for sure, I won't be making the same mistake again.    All Kylie's fans should hurry to buy All the lovers (both the remixes-cd because the wawa mmb remix is great and the 2-track single because the b-side Go hard or go home is fresh, dance & more fun than all the content of this sad sad album.
B003N7GATM|4.0|When Trent Reznor played his final Nine Inch Nails show in September of 2009, fans knew it wouldn't be the last they saw of Reznor. Named after a single by the 80s electronic group Coil, Reznor formed How to Destroy Angels with his wife, Mariqueen Maandig and former Nine Inch Nails producer, Atticus Ross. The lead single, \\"A Drowning\\" was released in May and now a six song EP is available to download free of charge from the band's website with a high quality download available for a modest two dollars. Trent Reznor is no stranger to giving his music away for free. In fact, Nine Inch Nails' last record was available from the band's website at no cost as well.<br /><br />How to Destroy Angels opens with \\"The Space in Between,\\" a song vaguely reminiscent of Smashing Pumpkins' darkened single \\"The Beginning is the End is the Beginning.\\" Slowly building throughout the track until coming to a very abrupt end, Maandig's vocals are casually introduced and fit perfectly into the mix. With the exception of a few backup harmony vocals and whispers, Reznor's trademark voice is traded in for that of his wife with extremely positive results. Maandig's calm and quiet singing echoes the dark mood conveyed by the music which rattles the brain with heavy bass, thumping drums, and distorted guitar like the best of Nine Inch Nails.<br /><br />The album's third track, \\"Fur Lined,\\" is, in a way, the perfect description of Trent Reznor's new sound. The song opens with the most nostalgic drum and bass line to Nine Inch Nails. When Maandig's vocals enter, they are distant and distorted, sounding very much out of place. Reznor fans may find themselves wondering just how great the song could be with his harsh vocals and tortured screams. When the chorus enters, however, an additional high hat rhythm enters, changing the mood just enough to create an opening for Maandig to really shine. The remaining instrumentation presses on, but that slight change is all that is needed to really make the pieces come together, like finding the last edge piece of a puzzle before continuing with the center.<br /><br />Reznor and company do an excellent job of mixing the past with the future to string longtime fans of Nine Inch Nails along for the ride without clinging to the security blanket of past success. How to Destroy Angels, though available for free, is worth the CD or high resolution download price if you really want to hear the music. The reign of Nine Inch Nails may be over, but this record proves Reznor still has a great deal to show our ears.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"A Drowning\\"er, like finding the last edge piece of a puzzle before continuing with the center.

0307592839|3.0|Although I've read her short stories in the New Yorker, A Visit from the Goon Squad is the first novel I've read by Jennifer Egan. A cloud of literary cognoscenti endorses it as brilliant, and I can see why. Egan is stylistically ambitious in a way very few American women writers have been, and she ably pulls off the challenge of viewing a group of characters from shifting points of view over several decades. The scene moves from San Francisco to New York with jaunts to Europe, Asia and Africa, but we recognize the characters as they emerge from multiple plot lines. To pull this off, a writer must be in top form.    Yet, ultimately, I found the novel unsatisfying. This may be because I don't know the music that holds many of the characters in its thrall, but to travel from the seventies to the not-too-distant future without reference to politics, religion, AIDS, the stock market, and dozens of other cultural markers left me wanting more. I have to believe this was intentional, but I didn't find the characters adrift sufficiently compelling.     One of the keynotes of the narrative is atrocious behavior by parents towards children. Some characters, like rock promoter Bennie, struggle through their self-absorption to relate to their kids, but many of the others don't put up a fight. In one scene a single-mother PR agent allows her young daughter to accompany her and a fading starlet to Africa to put a more benign face on a psychotic dictator. Later, we meet the daughter as an adult, but we have no idea of how this ill-fated excursion influenced her. Sasha, the most complex of the novel's characters, metamorphoses from a lost-child kleptomaniac to perhaps the most competent parent in the book, but we don't see how she gets there. One of the virtues of the form Egan uses would seem to be the ability to trace character development, but she doesn't' take advantage of it as she might.       Of course, I'm reading my own predilections into Egan's novel. I have a lot of respect for her ambition, but maybe I'll stick to the short stories.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|My favorite Eminem album up till now has been The Eminem Show. But after listening to Recovery I have to say that this is his best work to date. I am not the typical rap fan, being a 58 year old white female Christian engineer with a Masters degree. This CD deserves a listen by even folks that are not a fan of rap.     For Eminem fans, he is still playing on some old themes, but the lyrics, the tunes, and the arrangements are fresh.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I've been using these headphones for about a week, mostly with Assassin's Creed 2 on Xbox 360. The audio is impressive. Running around Venice really feels like you're there, especially when close to the water. When standing on a bridge, you can clearly hear the water splashing in the direction where it's located. People speaking are very clear and I now can actually understand what they are saying. When walking into Piazza San Marco you can hear the acoustics of the large plaza, as opposed to the acoustics of a narrow street. There's been times when I take off the headphones because I hear a strange noise in my house only to realize that it's happening in the game. It's that realistic, it's impressive.    These headphones allow me to play at full volume at night when my wife and 2-year old are asleep. No more complaints about our 2-year old believing she's growing up in a war-zone when I play Modern Warfare or Left 4 Dead 2 (NEVER when she's in the room with me!), and no more not being able to hear anything myself because the volume is so low on the TV.    The XBL chat works perfectly, too. The folks on the other end can't hear me better since it's limited by the service, but it works perfectly and the chat volume does increase as the game volume increases. The voice feedback also works fine and is very useful.    I have heard some very minor crackling, but nothing to complain about. Probably some interference from Wi-Fi or wireless phone, but it's very minimal. An extremely low hiss is also discernable when there's absolutely no sound in the game.    The wear is comfortable when playing for hours on end. My ears or head don't sweat and I can hardly feel that I'm wearing them. I have a huge head and big ears, too, and they fit comfortably. (I'm 6'1)    The only complaint I have is the quality of materials and construction, which is why I'm giving it four stars. While the padded headband and earcups are fine, the plastic feels pretty cheap, and the letters and lightsthe front panel of the decoder unit are not centered but shifted to the right...    Overall and excellent purchase and it will really improve your gaming experience, especially if all you use now is your TV speakers. Highly recommended.

In \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" he takes his inspiration from Exodus; in East of Eden it comes from the primeval stories of Genesis.<br />  The long 602 book was published in 1962. The novel begins in Connecticut where Adam Trask and his older brother Charles live on a farm owned by their father Cyrus. Cyrus is a bigwig in the GAR and has a wooden leg from his Civil War service. We later learn he stole money from the GAR. The Vice-President of the USA and Secretary of War attend the old man's funeral. Adam enters the army for ten years while his irascible brother Charles stays on the farm making a fortune. There are shades of Cain and Abel in the tumultous relationship between these brothers.<br />  Adam marries Cathy Trask who has burned her parents to death in a fire at her New England home. She has the face of an angel and the mind of a devil. After Adam and Cathy move to Salinas California she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to Cal and Aron but deserts the boys.

Cathy is a greedy, horrible, cruel and devious witch!<br />  Adam and the ever faithful Chinese servant Lee raise the two boys. On the night Cal takes Aron to the house of prostitution owned by Cathy the two boys engage in a fight. They also resemble Cain and Abel from the Bible. Aron elists in the World War One American Army and is killed in combat. Cal falls in love with Abel's longtime girl friend the beautiful and kind Abra Bacon. Adam who has suffered a stroke following the shocking death of Aron forgives Cal for his sins. As the last page ends we know Adam is at peace with his oldest son.<br />  The novel is a big three masted ship which also looks at the family of Samuel Hamilton, his faithful wife Liza and their brood of nine children.

0743298039|3.0|I was really excited when I started this book.  I loved the characters and the plot was very intriguing.  The story unfolded well and I anxiously turned each page...until Ambrose appeared.  Sorry but the twins plus one was a stretch for me and the ending was out of reach.  Well written by an intelligent author, but I was disappointed in the end.
B002ONC9NC|1.0|-- AUDIENCE for this review --<br />This review is from my perspective. Many people appreciate movies from entirely different perspectives and criteria--as witnessed by the many such reviews here--and such people are likely to find this review irrelevant to them.<br /><br />In watching movies, I have a strong character-oriented focus: Is what is happening reasonable for that character, versus being a message the writer or director wanted to make, but which is out-of-character for that character.  Here, none of the major characters were authentic to me.  I also focus on what the movie is actually showing, not just what it is saying.  If there is a conflict, or even disconnect, I become distrustful. If a movie fails badly in these aspects, it is difficult for it to have enough offsetting positives for _me_.<br /><br />-- REVIEW --<br />This movie is from a chapter of a recently published [[ASIN:1934633852 memoir of Lynn Barber]] (a famous British journalist) with the script adding many details.  Given the decades separating the events (in 1960) from the writing, a certain amount of re-interpretation, self-justification, blame-shifting and score-setting is to be expected, but what appears in the movie is far beyond what I was willing to accept/accommodate.<br /><br />First and foremost, the movie's Jenny (Carey Mulligan) never appears to be a 16/17 year-old from a newly middle-class family: She shows none of the physical awkwardness and lack of knowledge and experience. Neither does she show the expected reactions to being introduced to new experiences. Instead, the way the character moved in the scenes and responded to situations said to me that she was well into her 20s and at least upper middle class: She displays an ease navigating those environments that indicate years of experience plus a support system--family and close friends--also in that environment (her birthday party suggests she has no friends, only acquaintances). Recognize that precocious _interest_ alone does not produce _experience_, nor does book learning and quick tutorials provide much of a jump start.  This is not a complaint about the age of the actress (Mulligan), but of how the scenes are written, composed and played.<br /><br />In her interactions with her parents, her teacher Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams), the headmistress (Emma Thompson) and even David (the older man/Peter Sarsgaard), Jenny is presented as a dominant presence, including being smarter and better spoken than the adults.  A scene with Miss Stubbs has Jenny talking down to her, in both the dialog and the camera angles. At least one scene of Jenny with her parents plays as Jenny being the grown-up and them being her children.<br /><br />In these scenes, Jenny's behavior make it hard to think of her as not being at least in her late 20s--by no stretch of the imagination or dramatic license is it a girl just turned 17.  I attribute this to the distortion of the \\"memoir\\".  While it is not uncommon for girls of Jenny's age and intelligence to adopt such airs of superiority, I can't believe that they would have been indulged by the adults of that time (I am seven years younger than the author/Jenny).<br /><br />Second, Jenny's transitions just happen, with little or no motivation.  After seeing the movie, I read a couple of reviews of the memoir (in British newspapers) where the word \\"unexamined\\" kept popping up.  For example, she is presented as an intellectual--interested in big ideas and believing in delayed gratification--who instantly abandons this for the baubles and instant gratification.  For example, her decision to lose her virginity on her 17th birthday appears out of thin air, despite that potentially resulting in her being expelled from school and losing her dream.  Example: Her rejection of the value of an education for women comes in a petulant attack on her teacher Miss Stubbs, in contrast with what we have been shown up to that point.

0307454541|4.0|My book club read this, otherwise I probably would not have chosen this book on my own. While the story is suspenseful and interesting and the characters engaging--especially the enigmatic Salander, I could have done without all the emphasis on sexual abuse and cruelty. That said, I'm curious enough about the background of the cool, crafty and strangely likeable Lisbeth Salander that I'll most likely read the sequel as well.
9889979942|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me.  I must tell you that I thought I had seen all photography books and have seen pictures from places all over the world.  But, my friend insisted it was great - so I got it.  WOW is all I can say.  I have traveled to China from the US and thought I had seen most of the country.  Now I see I have probably only been to the tourist parts of China.  The author, Tom Carter, takes one on a journey far beyond what an average tourist may see in the country.  It is the the \\"real\\" and \\"everyday\\" China.  But is much more than that.  You see not just some of the sights, but something that tells much more of the story.  The sights and the people...their everyday life, their landscape, their way of surviving in a changing country.    From the picture of the coal miner with his amazing face and expression - to a child's laugh.  Photographer Tom Carter was able to not only view but capture a China that the rest of us could only imagine.  If you had told me such a country existed beyond what the state-media portrayed - I probably would not have believed it.  But, in his genius to sneak some shots, befriend locals, and take pictures at perhaps the most ridiculous times, Tom Carter has captured a country and a people that is very foreign to most Westerners.  The book is much larger than expected and the photographs themselves are much more personal than one may expect from a first-time photo-journalist.  But, this book will put Tom Carter on the map and so much that he may have trouble in the future traveling to such places as an unknown photographer.    I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  If you have an interest in China, photography books, or just capturing the world - Tom Carter has done it and it is amazing.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Laura Dern is the best actor in the U.S.  In Inland Empire, which she stars, she gives one of the greatest screen performances I've ever seen.  From her opening appearance in this David Lynch masterpiece, the nuances of her expressions as she's listening to a bizarre woman are superbly done,  conveying outwardly within a few seconds what it would take most actors--even good ones--much longer and much less effectively than Ms. Dern requires.<br />  Inland Empire is David Lynch's 2006 foray into a nightmarish world where reality and fantasy are blurred, both for the audience and Ms. Dern's characters.  It is both Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive, in B & W and color.  Admittedly, there are sections of the film that drag and this flick is too long (almost 3 hours) for what it has to say; however, what it does say coupled with Laura Dern's staggering acting as she goes through a gauntlet of changes that surpasses even Naomi Watts' in Mullholland Drive, is well worth a little boredom and frustration.<br />  Ms. Dern is not a big star, which is probably just as well because I have a feeling--although I don't know--that she goes after roles that allow her to really act and have the creative freedom that so many mainstream films wouldn't.  She proves this in the magnificent satire Citizen Ruth, the film that made me aware of Dern's awesome abilities.<br />  If you like David Lynch and/or Laura Dern, see this film.  If you don't like them, see it anyway.  It might just change your mind.
1401224253|5.0|What a great Elseworlds tale.  Superman is an American ideal but what if he crash landed in Russia in the late '30s?  Well, read this and find out.  This book is so well thought out and gorgeously drawn by both artists.  I love all the easter eggs but they were needed for this to be unforgettable.  I love how even though he was a communist he was still the hero we know.  Fantastic work by Mark Millar!
0307463745|4.0|I'm a small business owner who is always searching for ways to make my company more efficient, effective and prosperous. In my quest for knowledge I read REWORK  by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.<br /><br />To sum-up the book, I  would use the old acronym K.I.S.S. - keep it simple stupid.<br /><br />The best advice I took from the book:<br /><br />Planning is guessing. Make decisions right before you take action.<br />Workaholics are stupid. They waste your time and cause more harm than good. Send people home at 5.<br />Don't ask for money from other people. It's their money and therefore, they control your business.<br />Do a few simple things and do it well.<br />Don't worry about the competition, worry about yourself.<br />Learn to love \\"no.\\"  Saying \\"yes\\" can put you into a position you really don't want to be in.<br />Make a product/service that is good at-home, not just in-store. Take the time while your business is small and new to go through a crash-test phase.<br />Stop fretting over an Ivy league education. More CEOs earned their undergraduate degrees from the University of Wisconsin than from Harvard.<br />Own your own mistakes. Customers would prefer it comes from you than the rumor mill.<br />I would recommend the book to those who are worried about pursing their dream of owning his own business.<br /><br />REWORK is a quick, easy read.  Most of the content of REWORK is common sense, but common sense is something we as a society are sadly lacking.
0345410025|4.0|The techniques presented here are somewhat like revealing the mechanics behind magic tricks. There's a reason that magicians won't reveal their secrets. It's not because they are trying to protect something valuable, but because fans are generally disappointed when they realize how simple the trick actually is. That said, proper application of the magic is far more difficult and takes more practice than the explanation suggests. Using a trick deck to perform a miraculous card trick is a disapointment to the viewers once they learn the truth, but it still takes skill to use that trick deck properly.    It's simple on the surface, and somewhat disappointing to many people who imagined the ability to simply meet a room full of people and somehow remember all their names after a quick introduction. Just like magic though, the techniques take practice before you become proficient at using them. I'll concede one point to the detractors of this book. This does not somehow improve your natural memory or brainpower. It just helps you learn how to use what you have to achieve better results.    Memorizing the names of people is an incredible social skill that few have. George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were both known for their ability to work a room (at a fundraiser usually), then remember the names of everybody they had met, finishing off the evening by wishing them all well by name, one on one. People were blown away by this, but they probably simply used similar techniques as are presented here. If you work in a sales capacity and are able to remember hundreds of names of people at a trade show, that can go pretty far for you in the real world. Memorizing facts for history tests helps in school. All the stuff in this book has real world practical applications that you just need to practice and apply.

B001GCUO5M|3.0|Shutter Island directed by Martin Scorsese is a very ambitious film but kind of boring as well. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, and Ben Kingsley round out the talented cast but even their acting chops can't save this psychological film from barely staying above float. The film doesn't really get interesting until the last 45 minutes - very disturbing and hard to watch but that's the only section of this film that grabbed my attention. So-so thriller, a mixed bag for me.
030726999X|4.0|I know many people who were disappointed with this book based on the previous two.  I agree, its not up to par with the first two, but that doesn't mean the book wasn't really good.  I enjoyed every single line of dialogue or inner monologue by Lisbeth Salander.  That alone is worth the price of the book.  I do think that the book spends a lot time in the court room by the outcome of that is very worth the wait.  The ending was predictable but it was about the only thing I ever saw coming in the entire three books.  Its sad that these will be the last books by Larsson as his voice was unique.

B00007AJGH|5.0|Films that feature both live-action and animation generally haven't done so well (Cool World, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, Looney Tunes: Back in Action, etc.), all except two. From the best of my knowledge, Space Jam and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? have held up all these years. But before there was Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny, there was Bob Hoskins and Roger Rabbit. This is a dark, silly, and extremely fun film with a whole lot of humor and a whole lot of (cartoonish) action. The special effects are especially top-notch, and none of it looks dated. The cartoon characters look authentic, as if they're actually there onscreen with the real actors. Christopher Lloyd is dead-on as Judge Doom, while Bob Hoskins delivers the goods as Eddie Valiant. Charles Fleischer has the right voice for Roger Rabbit, while Jessica Rabbit look nice as Roger's girlfriend (even though I think that she's not very attractive as a cartoon woman).<br /><br />If you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking film, then this is not the perfect choice. What it is, however, is a wildly fun movie with lots of brilliant effects and perfectly-timed humor. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's for really small kids, but hey, it's good for the rest of us.<br /><br />Grade: A-
0802714544|4.0|Being a child of the late 1980's, I entered the world way after the setting (and writing) of this book. For whatever reason, though, the 60's spy scene fascinates me and I really enjoyed reading this book as my first foray into the period and genre. Le Carre seemed to reach right into my mind and create an atmosphere, and on more than one occassion his outline of a setting allowed me to imagine a vivid and detailed scene. While I wish I had started the series at the chronological beginning, each of the characters were quickly brought to life and became distinct players in the story. I found myself confused once or twice as the story meandered through the twists and turns of a spy ring, but I know that's exactly what Le Carre wrote for. Excellent book, and one that can be read in a single sitting.
0385737424|5.0|Miranda and her friend Sal walk to and from school together, just as they always have.  But everything changes when the big kid in the green army jacket steps out in front of them and punches Sal.  After that, he doesn't seem to want to spend time with her anymore.  But that's when the notes start showing up - anonymous notes telling Miranda to write down a story of everything that happens, with as much detail as possible.  With any luck, the note writer says, lives will be saved.<br /><br />While I was initially put off by the world-wise perspective of Miranda, which seems so typical of kids in books that take place in New York City, the mystery of who is sending the notes and why drew me in completely.  I thought the darkly-tinged urban setting with a background of late-70s TV game shows and Madeline L'Engle's A Wrinkle In Time was very clever, and the characters are engaging if not always entirely likeable.  It's the kind of mystery story that kids and their parents will enjoy, although parents may want to know that there are a number of scattered mild profanities throughout.  I listened to the audio book read by Cynthia Holloway, who does a very good job, but I will be purchasing this book for my 11 year old daughter, whom I suspect won't be able to put it down.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|At one time in the early 90's it looked like Alice In Chains was going to be the biggest band of all of them to come out of the Seattle grunge scene.  Although Alice were lumped in with many of the grunge era groups, the band's sound had more in common with classic rock and heavy metal than Nirvana or Pearl Jam.  Actually they did not really sound like anyone else.  The music was dark, brooding and heavy with Layne Staley's emotional vocals leading the charge.  The band scored a monster hit with their \\"Dirt\\" album in 1994, but internal struggles and drug issues eventually drove the them apart.  Bassist Mike Star (who has since turned up on television's celebrity re-hab) was sacked for drug problems and singer Layne Staley eventually died from a drug overdose.  For the past 14 years the band has been on a long hiatus.  2009 found guitarist Jerry Cantrell putting the band back together with new vocalist William Duvall and the result is one of the best comeback albums of any artist I can think of.  \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is classic Alice In Chains, basically picking up right where the band left off back in the mid-90's.  That is not to say that this is a retro album as although the band's classic sound is here the disc is a very modern release that should please both old and new fans.  It is interesting to read other reviews of this album.  Alice In Chains fans tend to be very passionate about their band, and to some just the thought of Cantrell using the name is a sacrilege.  Personally I came a bit late to the A.I.C. camp and consequently don't have a lot of history with their earlier incarnation.  Taken as a stand alone album I think \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is probably one of the best straight ahead rock albums of 2009.  If people can get over the fact that Staley is no longer here and give Cantrell a bit of a break I think they will find a lot to enjoy on this excellent release.

0312370849|2.0|This story about the rounding up of Jews by the French police in Paris in 1942 was both horrifyingly sad and, to me, contrived in the author's juxtaposing it with a current-day story. In creating a page-turner she has not fully developed her characters.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I started listening to Eminem a few years ago when he came out with The Way I Am. I have never bought an Eminem CD in my life. After hearing all the tracks on youtube I decided it was worth it. This is the first CD I bought in years and I absolutely love it. He is truly a lyricist in this album. He has came a long way and it shows. He needs to be recognized as one of the best in the hip hop world today. A lot of work has been put in this album. Out of 17 tracks I like 16. Sample it before you buy it, you will love it. I absolutely love White Trash Party. Catchy tune and good lyrics.
B00275EHJG|5.0|May be small spoilers below!!!!<br /><br />This was such a great movie.  I went with my mom and stepsister to see this.  So there is an age difference.  We all enjoyed it.  We laughed and really got into the story.  The strange thing though is that after like 45 minutes in I started to cry.  I couldn't believe it.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a drama.  But maybe it has a little bit here and there.  The movie is about Andy getting ready to go to college.  The toys just want him to pick them up and play with them.  As he is getting ready for school, his mom tells him he has to put stuff for the attic in the attic box, stuff he is taking with him in the college box and trash in the trash box.  The toys are all worried about where they will end up.  Things happen and the wrong thing gets put in the wrong spot and then the adventure begins.<br /><br />The toys need to find there way back to Andy.  At least some of them do.  After something happens, some just want to stay where they are.  They soon realize that the great new place they are may not be all they thought it was.  There are some crazy kids and an angry bear they have to deal with and figure out how to get out of the new prison and get back to Andy.  That is all I can say.  I don't want to tell you the whole movie.  As I said at the beginning, I cried.  Just the fact that he had to leave his stuff and they were lonely made me sad.  I was going to come home and take my collectable stuff ut of the box because I felt bad for it!  That's strange I know. I have the DVDs of the firs two.  I don't remember if they made me feel a little pity or sadness.  It's great for the kids because it is funny and memorable.  It is the same for the adults, while at the same time it may make them think about being a  kid and bring some great memories from your past.  Either way, weather you saw the first two or not, this is a must see.  We saw the non 3D version and it looked amazing.

B0026J8LHM|4.0|Dream Theater return for their 2nd release on Roadrunner records with another chunk of lengthy epic progressive metal.  The album runs over 70 minutes and with the exception of the 5 minute ballad \\"Wither\\" the comparatively short 8 minute single \\"Right Of Passage\\" the album consists of epic tracks exceeding the 12 minute mark.  In other words, \\"Black Clouds\\" is a typical Dream Theater magnum opus.  I have all of Dream Theater's albums and have found them to be incredibly consistent over the years.  There is a reason why this band has been able to stay at the top of the prog metal heap for over two decades, and this album is a good example of why that is.  Personally I think it is a step above their last two releases and ranks up with some of the best albums the band has done.  I enjoy all of the tracks here especially the album closer \\"The Count Of Tuscany\\" which will instantly remind you of early Rush.  In fact, Rush seems to be a rather large looming influence over much of this album with \\"The Best Of Times\\" also sounding similar in spots.  The lone ballad on the album \\"Wither\\" is one of the band's better efforts of this style, and the finale of Mike Portnoy's 12 step program series of songs, \\"The Shattered Fortress\\" is a fitting bookend to the previous chapters in the story.  The only area where this album seems to be a bit weak is in the lyrics.  Dream Theater has never been up among the elite lyric writers in the field, but they usually do a pretty decent job of pulling it off.  This is not so true on this album, as there is a significant amount of cliché's to be found and overall the lyrics are just not that strong.  This is a rather minor quibble though as overall I think this is a very strong Dream Theater album and well worth checking out if you are on the fence about it.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|This is a fantastic read, gripping from start to finish, with a skillful technique of establishing the accuracy of quotes and events.     It's true that Lewis' analysis of the root causes of the crisis are just an amateur's perspective, and it's unfortunate that he's touring and answering the question 'why did this happen?' in just a few sentences.    However this book is much more a factual explanation of the mechanisms, and studies of a few characters who saw it coming, than it is an analysis. I also like how, for someone like myself who has read and understood these mechanisms for some time, Lewis still finds a fresh way to explain the speculation tools that were so necessary for the major losses.

0446567337|5.0|I just finished reading Dear John, and I'm still in tears because of the ending. I loved every bit of the book so much, and even though I wish things might have worked out differently for John and Savannah, the fact that it doesn't end like a fairy tale makes me love it that much more. Nicholas Sparks is amazing at creating great stories with lessons in them, but not making the book seem too fake. Because the fact is, life isn't always going to turn out the way you want it to. I have never had my heart warmed and then broken in the same book, but Dear John has done it. I look at this as a positive, and have never read another book like it.
0679746323|4.0|I got this book as a hardcover from Amazon while I was in Shanghai China.  It got past the censors who open every package that comes to China. My thinking is that the censors do not speak English so did not know this book is an excellent critical review of Mao.  I read this book in China, but left the book in China.    I now want to read it on my Kindle but it does not show up there.  So, please publisher, put this on the Kindle page at $9.99 and I will be the first ones to buy it again.     Steven  Oregon

Just stunning.<br /><br />this is just a great collection<br /><br />note: I've since seen some of Tom Carter's other photography and wow, the guy really has a talent. check out india! [...]
9889979942|5.0|This book was both educational and beautiful. Reading the book, I felt like I was seeing parts of China that I would never have a chance to see otherwise. It opened my eyes to the varieties of culture that China contains, and stunned me with it's beauty.     I love traveling but have never been to China- this book made me feel like I've actually been there! I think it is a good book for anyone thinking of taking a trip to China to read, because it provides a great breakdown of the different regions of China- with maps and snippets of  information.  It's also a piece of art- I loved looking through it and will keep it on my coffee table.
B003L16FAE|4.0|I watched it for myself. I can honestly say I thought it looked terrific. I own a Samsung 40\\" HDTV and a Samsung Blu-ray player.     It is obvious there was some serious DNR done to this but it wasn't enough to distract me.     In simplest terms it looks like it was shot with digital cameras instead of film.
0739380338|5.0|This review is for the entire series, although The Last Olympian is a solid ending to the fun--the choice of title and who that last Olympian is--is truly touching. The entire series is another for us who remain kids forever! Hopefully Riordan will take his place among all the great writers who have produced \\"quest\\" novels that not only embody the best of our civilization, but find a place in its heart. Riordan is spot on in his portrayal of the young protagonists and their braggadacio as they hurtle from one impossible challenge (at least one per chapter)to the next. (The dialogue is extremely well done.) Even better is his updating of the gods and their world--he is as consistent in his creation as Rowling, Adams, White, Alexander, Tolkien, Lackey, and Norton (and many others) are in theirs. In addition, the plot MOVES--so like the old cliffhangers my grandparents watched and enjoyed as kids--not a chapter goes by but that our young heroes(oines) get the better of some evil villain. And yes, Riordan uses a lot of \\"saved at the very last impossible minute\\" tricks, but they're very clever, and usually very funny. I began keeping a list of \\"ways out\\" as I read the books, just to track the author's inventiveness.   Also, while reading, I was \\"persuaded\\" to revisit Greek mythology, and I found that Riordan was spot on there as well. (Although why the Greeks decided that relationships of gods and nature spirits produced Cyclopes I will never understand!) I particularly liked his portrayal of Hestia and her importance in the great grand scheme of things. One caution--read the books or listen to the audio versions--the movie of the first book is. . .awful! Enjoy!
0143038419|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert chronicles a year-long journey through Italy, India, and Indonesia (Bali) that she embarks on after a bitter and traumatic divorce and failed romance. Gilbert's journey, told in three distinct sections of the book focuses on not only her travel/journey to these three distinct locations but her larger spiritual journey.    In each locale, Gilbert focuses on a specific aspect of life: Italy is about the spiritual pursuit of pleasure, which Gilbert largely seeks through experiencing the wines and cuisines of Italy while immersing herself in learning the language. She spends 4 months in Italy absorbing what she considers the most beautiful of languages, first studying at a school, which she eventually quits, and then with a tandem language practice exchange partner. Gilbert then spends the next 4 months in India in the Ashram of her Guru. Here, her spiritual journey continues, as she focuses on devotion. She devotes herself to the practice of Yoga and to deepening her relationship with God. After leaving India, Gilbert then spends the next 4 months in Bali, where she journeys because nearly a year earlier on a previous trip to Bali a Balinese Medicine man has predicted she will return to Bali and live there. Here, she seeks to find balance or equilibrium in her life.    Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Watching Gilbert's spiritual journey (and ultimately her journey to find herself as a 35 year-old woman after a difficult divorce) was quite fascinating. I really enjoyed her views on religion and how she sought to find practices from several religions to inform her own beliefs. Her explanations of Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu beliefs were both thoughtful and provocative. I was really drawn into her discussions of the similarities among the religions and how she felt that some of the practices of various religious could be used to deepen the experience of other religions.    I also thoroughly enjoyed her descriptions of all the places she traveledand the people she met. Gilbert just seemed to bring many of those she met to life and made the leap off the page for me. My favorite of those she encountered was Richard from Texas, who she met at the Ashram in India. I think Gilbert did an especially good job of capturing Richard's persona, especially his practical, no B.S. advice. I also really enjoyed her description of her experiences with the Balinese Medicine Man Ketut Liyer. (I especially loved the section where Ketut tells Liz to meditate she only needs to smile but to smile with her whole body, \\"even smile in your liver\\".    Favorite Quote: \\"Bhuta ia, dewa ia\\" (Man is a demon, man is a god.)
0439023491|5.0|If you loved The Hunger Games, you will love Catching Fire even more. Suzanne builds on this amazing story with perfect pacing and opens up a bigger picture of Panem. She builds out her characters beautifully and will have you thinking about them long after you turn the last page. Due to the number of 5 star reviews that already get it right, I'm not going to expand further. I'll just say I recommend this 100%. I can't wait for Mockingjay!
B0013N3DSE|4.0|I have always loved the Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood. This Blu-Ray edition was very well done. It was a pleasure to watch.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|I managed to swallow Chris Columbus's changes to the first two Harry Potter movies, but the travesty he created from Riordan's lively, likeable \\"quest\\" novel I just can't ignore or forgive. All the great conversations, the truly funny situations, the believable universe, and the contemporarizing (is that a word???) of Greek mythology that made Riordan's novel (and the complete series) such great fun were completely ignored. What this movie is instead is a retread of every stereotypical \\"fallback\\" character, plot line, and dialogue ever presented in a movie for preadolescents. Obviously, the choice of young stars was to introduce two more attractive youngsters who have some potential--whether as actors or teen idols remains to be seen. But what was the point of making Grover an over-sexed satyr? Of making Persephone a hot mama? Of making the Lotus Hotel an older teen's idea of free drinks, free sex, free gambling? Of making the gods SO stereotypical of every bad B movie from the 1930s through the 1990s? I mean, Riordan created a great new consistent universe, and Columbus turned into a tired old grade-B (even C or D!)  stereotype.  Don't bother with the movie--get the audio books instead! Jesse Bernstein does a good job with the tone and feeling that Riordan created. (And yes, I'm an adult who's been reading and enjoying \\"quest\\" novels for many years. Riordan respected his audience, and created well and true for them; Columbus, on the other hand, \\"disrespected\\" Riordan's intent, and it shows.)
B0024F08RO|5.0|I'll be completely honest, this season is absolutely awesome, I don't care what anyone else says. Every season of this show has been exciting and it has been almost impossible to stop watching.<br /><br />Season 4 is charged with heavy emotions. The events since season 1 are finally taking their toll, especially with Scofield who is a good person at heart but blames himself for so many of the things that have gone wrong. Burrows gets to be even more of a bad-@$$ and is obviously done playing games. Things never get dull or boring in this season.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about this season is that it's the last one. Fortunately, they released [[ASIN:B0024FAR4I Prison Break: The Final Break]] to bring things to a close. This is definitely one of my all time favorite shows.
0439023483|5.0|I've been recommending this book to anyone I know since the day I finished the last page. After finishing the Twilight Saga, it's SO refreshing to actually like the main character of a book! Collins has great pacing, three dimmensional characters, and an action packed storyline with some serious social commentary bubbling under the surface.     I also have to make a comment about Battle Royale. Similar? Yes. A rip-off? Uh, no. Seriously? When it comes to writing, there are no longer any original ideas. Not because authors are borrowing from each other, but because the odds are no matter what you think of something similar has been done before. It comes down to execution...and Collins nails it.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Bought when it was on special for $35.  Great deal!  I love Amazon free shipping too!  My 8 year old son loves the series and I split up the set to use as incentives as he completes his summer reading/math program activities.
B003KT3NRA|5.0|I don't care much for the single \\"Tattoos and Tequila\\", but I do really like the rest of this album.   The cover songs have an old school Motley Crue sound to them.   If you liked the Motley Crue covers of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Smokin In The Boys Room\\", you should like this album.     Vince's voice sounds great, as does the rest of the band.    I LOVED the cover of The Hollies \\"Long Cool Woman\\", I'm hoping they'll release that as a single.   Well worth the 7.99 I paid here.   Heck I've been listening to this more than Motley's last album \\"Saints of LA\\".
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|It seems to be commonplace for folks on the Internet to dismiss the Blu-ray transfer of this film, citing inconsistent definition, incorrect color timing, among other things.    I'm a bit of a hi-def enthusiast: I do not usually pay for Blu-rays that are subpar, that which don't live up to my expectations. For me (and I wish it weren't just \\"for me\\" but instead an industry standard), Blu-ray is a medium whose sole purpose is to bring a movie into a living room, representing that film as accurately to the original look and sound as possible. A proper Blu-ray Disc (BD) of a movie shot on celluloid will look like an actual film projection on one's HDTV (with the proper video settings, of course--a well-calibrated TV makes a great deal of difference). If a film is shot on gritty 16mm film, the BD product ought to replicate that look accurately, with little digital noise reduction (DNR)--only used for dirt and scratch clean-up, not to remove grain (which is NOT \\"noise,\\" but an inherent part of the image)--and a good encode with as much room as possible for the least amount of compression with zero artifacting.    Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is a visually rich and captivating film. Shot at the brink of CGI, the filmmakers made it a point not to use any computer effects, preferring traditional means: practical effects, optical effects, the lot. The end result is a visually striking film that is above and beyond anything being produced today.    The Blu-ray for this film, as far as I can tell, is an accurate representation of its original finished and edited photography. Colors are vibrant when intended to be, and likewise dull when intended. A good grain texture and structure is present throughout, and is appropriately grainier during scenes where a different film stock was used. Definition is strong, with a great deal of detail, with any occasional softness to the picture being due to the original photography and effects. It's important to understand that BDs are supposed to represent the film itself, not a reimagining of it. I all too often feel that consumers and \\"professional\\" HD DVD and BD reviewers have a wrong notion that films should be touched up and filtered to provide a \\"pristine and clear\\" picture, meant to satiate the immature, undeveloped tastes and preferences of \\"the HD video game crowd.\\" (I can't count how many times I've read a review where the words, \\"The image just POPS!\\" are used to convey the supposed high quality presentation of a BD film, as if this faux-3D \\"popping\\" factor is key to a good transfer.) Old films aren't meant to look like the pristine, \\"flawless,\\" and entirely clear digital photography of, say, \\"Zombieland\\". Different methods of filming, different technology, different eras, different intentions--artistic or otherwise.    I own the Superbit DVD of this film and can honestly say that the BD blows it sky-high in every manner. Far better clarity, more lush colors; I'm convinced that the old home video color timing of this film is way off, on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD (despite claims to having received Coppola's approval; people should know by now that such phrases are usually marketing fibs). The look of a film should never be determined by how it appeared on old home media, but rather by the source. The Superbit DVD is a mess of browns and washed out colors; the BD is much more natural and filmic, and also far more beautiful. According to Robert A. Harris, a noted film preservationist (who approves of this BD), the transfer for the \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" BD is based on the answer print of the film, and thus accurate to the original artistic intentions and endeavors.    It's disheartening that so many have put this BD down. Even more sad that many have come to their conclusions based on low resolution screencaptures of the BD (that are also often captured incorrectly, degrading the quality of the original image further) rather than anything even remotely representative of its quality. There's a particularly well-known screencap of the BD that has circled the Internet, one in which Dracula's face has a green glow on it, and people use this to dispute the color timing of this HD transfer, saying it's outrageous, out of place, and totally off. The fact of the matter is, this particular scene's color scheme fits contextually. It's a dark film, but is very colorful at key scenes where certain colors are chosen to set the mood--and yes, there is a source to that eerie green glow, which is completely absent from previous home video releases.    I'll never understand how anyone could choose the look of any previous home video releases over this utterly fantastic Blu-ray THAT WHICH IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ORIGINAL FILM. Thank God the \\"pro\\" reviewers aren't in charge of things! Though I fear their ignorance and the exposure of such can sway studio decisions in a negative direction.    Hopefully this review will persuade somebody to pick up the BD, and to not be dismayed by the wrong and, might I say, uneducated outlooks of disapproval.    In a collection of Blu-ray films where I somewhat pride myself on only having \\"the best\\" quality visual representations of films I enjoy, I can say that this is one of the most stunning Blu-ray Discs I own, in large part due to the original film's merits and visual feats, and equally the accurate representation of that film's transfer to high definition. (For a quick example, some of my other favorite United States-released BDs I own are for the films \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Braveheart\\", \\"The Searchers\\" [another BD that gets slagged for its color timing compared to older home video releases, even though this release is most accurate and most visually appealing], \\"Hellraiser\\", \\"Children of Men\\", \\"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\\", \\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Rio Bravo\\", \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\", \\"Drag Me to Hell\\", \\"Black Dynamite\\", \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", \\"Hot Fuzz\\", \\"How the West Was Won\\",\\"Zombieland\\", and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", among many other quality BD titles.)

B001NLKT60|2.0|\\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" is the second book in the Millennium Trilogy by author Stieg Larsson. The book is 724 pages in length.

Journalist friends of Blomkvist have been murdered and the suddenly missing Salander is the main suspect. A wild and expansive police hunt is begun in order to bring the 'fugitive' to justice.<br /><br />*END SPOILER*<br /><br />Comment:<br /><br />The book reads like a summertime bestseller meant to be consumed at the beach while the kids are off making sand-castles. Although a fast and easy read, it is not particularly well written and I don't feel that this is something entirely related to the book being translated from Swedish to English. There is a degree of shock, sex, violence and doing things to inexplicably put oneself in harms way that smacks of amateurish bestseller-ism.<br /><br />The police force seems at least as interested in its own sense of hierarchy as it is in solving the murder. Talk about a dysfunctional group with their own agendas! Clues are not followed up on correctly...some problems are solved (or not) by random luck or convenience.<br /><br />Many characters in the novel missed important communications by repetitiously leaving their cell phones turned off or lost contact because of low batteries. Just hard to believe in a murder investigation that has riveted the entire country.<br /><br />And finally...COFFEE (in my title)...don't think I've ever seen so many references to coffee either being made, brewed, poured, sipped, drunk or refused in one book.

B00164EAC8|5.0|Lighten up, people. It's just a monster movie, not MAN CONQUERS SPACE.  Let me start with a bit of trivia, EVERY Godzilla film has this line, &#34;Godzilla is Still Alive!!!&#34;.  Now go and re-watch all the Godzilla movies and listen for that line.  I enjoyed this movie very much.  Like the original &#34;Gojira&#34; Godzilla was a sympathetic character - a victem of Mankind's thoughtless actions.  I like all the Godzilla movies, but this one is my favorite. The Big G really looks like a monster. This and Gojira are the only ones that scare me sometimes.  A nolstalgic celebration of 50's atomic monster movies imploded unto 90's, with none of the Politically Correct cynicism of Armageddon.  A must have movie! Story is intelligent and well done. All performances first rate. Special effects superb.
0451529308|3.0|Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book.  However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it.  For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental.  The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious.  The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others.  As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth.  Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy.  Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness.  While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|Yes, this movie was critically panned.  Yes, this movie was a remake. Did I enjoy this movie?  Yes! I am a female, over age 30,a well read professional who does appreciate Masterpiece Theater.   My husband and 13 year old picked this movie, but I was just as happy with the choice.  I have fond memories of watching the original in a drive thru theater with a scratchy speaker in the car. I recently rewatched the original version with said teenage son, and the effects and storyline did not impress him.  The new movie had great special effects ( I saw it in 2D) and the story and action moved fast enough to keep everyone entertained.  Did Greeks have Aussie accents? Probably not, but as my coworker mentioned, if Sam Worthington was in a Kung Fu movie speaking Japanese in an aussie accent it wouldnt matter to us :)  Bring on Clash of the Titans 2, or even better, have Perseus fall into a time portal which allows him to team with his modern day counterpart/namesake Percy Jackson, another immortal demigod. Oh sorry, I guess you don't like to read kids books either ....
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I recommend this dvd collection, don't mind the fact that the orginal music is not there anymore. Who cares?? I wouldn't have even noticed if it wasn't because I read about it. I loved watching Daria back in the days, and now I am so happy that I got the dvd collection at last!
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book! It's well written, the pace is just right, and wow - all the emotions that it takes you through! I love it when I find a book that is effortless to read, when you find parts that impress on your mind so much it makes you stop for a minute to re-read what you just read, a book that reaches into you - one minute it's making me laugh out loud, next I find myself crying. It's uplifting without being preachy, it's heartwarming using well-crafted language, and its characters are so real. I'd recommend this book to everyone.  Reading this book reminded me of another one of my favorite book, \\"I Am the Messenger\\" by Markus Zusak. The stories are completely different, but the way both stories are melancholically uplifting, the clean and somewhat poetic prose, struck very close to my heart. It's definitely worth checking out!

B00095NX9G|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD, especially for the price.  It's very advanced, so it's not necessarily for absolute beginners who don't know a choo choo shimmy from a Lebanese style shimmy, but if you are knowledgeable of the basics, this is a great tool to improve your dancing.  The combination of yoga and bellydancing drills is great for improving strength, techinique and stamina and Rachel builds on each activity as she goes so you can work up to that level without a lot of guess work and/or confusion as to what she just did.    Rachel's friendly, warm and often humorous narrative gave me a greater appreciation for her as a person, but also as a dancer/performer/choreographer.  As a newbie to bellydancing I didn't realize the intricacies and layering in her dance, but thanks to DVD 2 (choreography), I have a much greater appreciation for her skills and a broader outlook on the Tribal Fusion style as a whole.  DVD 1 is a great fundamentals builder and a must have for Tribal Fusion dancers looking to advance in the form.    I would recommend this DVD for the serious dancer who has a solid basic knowledge of bellydance technique and terms.  While I would not recommend this DVD as an introduction to bellydance, I definitely recommend it to intermediate dancers looking to move on to advanced work or for advanced dancers looking to polish their skill.
B0012GMZ4U|2.0|Love Barbra's voice, can't stand the songs on this album-totally boring!  I own a copy of every album she's released I believe but this one?  I think I played it once, and once was enough!    Rejane
B0029O08WA|5.0|This album is a mix of edgy alternative, folk and soft rock with contributions by legends such Radiohead's Thom York (one of my favourites on the album) means that even those who aren't fans of the Twilight franchise can enjoy this unique album.    Every song on this album was created especially for the film by the respective artists, which makes each song all the more special in my opinion. New Moon may be the movie version of a wildly popular teen romance book series but the atmosphere struck up by these songs in the movie along with the cinematography of the movie is art. The music fits in beautifully with the stunning scenery and action in the movie.    The best songs on the album are:    3. Hearing Damage by Thom York: This song is amazing! It mixes electro and hard beats with Thom Yorke's distinct vocals. The harmony of the different sounds in this track manages to create a rhythm and beat that sounds almost exotic. Although this is a dark and calm track it could almost be danced to. The way it's used in this film perfects the track for me - an evil vampire is on the run from werewolves and a native tribe leader who suffers a heart attack in the Washington forest, the music rendering the scene both urgent and melancholic.     6. Satellite Heart by Anya Marina: A calm yet angsty acoustic indie track with raspy vocals, perfect for the troubled romance in the movie.    9. Done All Wrong by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club: This is a brilliant folksy woody track which is perfect for the scene on the native american reservation. This song makes that side of the conflict in the saga shine, the world of the tribe and Bella's small town roots.    But all the songs are great.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I have the 2003 Kino restoration and absolutely love it.  The 2010 Kino restoration is to include additional footage found in 2008.  It's a very symbolic silent film that is so applicable to today - the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots,\\" the working man, the corporate bosses, and so on.  I saw a version of Metropolis on cable (USA) and that version was supposed to have the original orchestral score with it.  It makes a world of difference in watching it.  I've looked long and hard to find this version because other versions had the wrong music - some about listening to \\"happy, cheerful\\" music and watching a serious scene just doesn't cut it - or was just a poor quality.  The Kino restoration has the original score.  The effects used were pretty good considering the time.  Sure it's not CGI, but I'm not sure CGI would have the same impact if it was used.  The latest restoration will not be available until later this year and, yes, I will be getting that version.  That version is being show around the country now.  Go to the Kino website for details.
0143038419|2.0|The book is well written and entertaining up until Italy (chapter 36) then it gets boring and preachy.  The thing that made the book almost unbearable in the end is how much I grew to dislike the author as the book went on.  She just seems self centered and self indulgent throughout the entire book that made me ask this question in the end - why does she deserve a happy ending? A simple advise for anyone thinking of reading this book - you can spend your time more wisely than read about someone who is so unhappy with herself and full of herself at the sametime (sounds contradictory but this my thought).

The movie shows terrific examples of being the underdog, coming from behind, pushing hard, going against the popular opinion, swimming upstream, being mentored and mentoring, being a fearless servant/leader.  Excellent film that will warm your heart.  Good movie for family talks about what you believe, apartheid and world history, how to go against the grain and even be unpopular when you're doing what's right.  Two thumbs up!
0812973992|5.0|They bore the sorrows of the earth and they had a line of communication with God, all except one, the hidden saint, who was forgotten. The forgotten one was left to struggle on his own, with no line of communication to that which he so hugely needed. Corrigan had lost his line with God: he bored the sorrows on his own, the story of stories.<br /><br />-Let the Great World Spin<br /><br />It's the 70s in New York City. Above, between the World Trade Center, is a man on a tightrope. Below, people watch and wait for something to happen. Helicopters are circling. Police are on both rooftops. Will the man fall? Who is he? How did he get up there.<br /><br />That's the scene as the novel begins, but the author quickly transports us into the lives of an ensemble cast of characters: A Catholic monk who lives in the most dangerous complex in the Bronx. Hookers walk in and out of his apartment. He takes care of them as if they were his own family. The love of his life - not a hooker but a nurse with two children - spends countless hours with him, torturing them both; he's celibate and committed, though he's not sure God has ever been listening. But he has faith.<br /><br />And then something happens. The great world spins. So do we. We meet a group of mother's who've lost their children in the Vietnam war. They struggle to keep their children alive, but sometimes a common tragedy isn't enough to form the support and devotion they need. Husbands are long gone, or present but unavailable as they wallow in their own sorrow.<br /><br />Children go motherless.<br /><br />A remote connection sparks and fades.<br /><br />The childless scoops up two sisters.<br /><br />A grand-daughter breaks the cycle and steps outside of herself.<br /><br />An estranged brother bonds with the unlikeliest woman.<br /><br />What McCann has done is woven together the most desperate yet hopeful citizens of New York City. Though implausible at times, their lives are not unlike all of our lives. And he veers from the trite and refuses to sketch for us a happy ending for all of the characters we come to love simply by knowing them. Though it's a sinking feeling to read through the pages, and sometimes impossibly draining by the end of nearly every chapter, it's honest and it's accurate and it's poignant and it's a mess.<br /><br />Though some have said that the characters are made of molds - the southern black, the rich white woman - it's simply untrue. Some of us fit neatly into a mold, a vision that's perpetuated by stereotypes, what happens is the friction, the grinding of life. This is where the characters fit in no mold and become believable.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book. It is a masterpiece full of wonderful language that sets artists apart from mere writers. If you are at all disinclined to read messy, painful fiction, I'd urge you not to read this. But if you derive some pleasure and meaning from watching characters struggle through life, in all their various, wonderful ways, pick it up and get reading. You won't be disappointed.haracters we come to love simply by knowing them.

B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is NOT for the faint of heart. The characters get under your skin and become family. Watching them grow and evolve is like watching your own family grow and evolve. This season was incredible, and I highly recommend it to anyone interesting in some incredible storyline and great acting. Especially the finale... you won't be able to stop talking about it!
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Prior to going to the theatre, I sat down to watch the first two installments of the Twilight saga; as a habit, I try to re-watch movies whenever a sequel comes out, just to get an idea of how the series progressed and developed. And in all honesty, both contributed to my overall impression and appreciation of Eclipse.    Twilight is a movie I've never really had an opinion on one way or another; it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't a complete train-wreck. Looking back at it now, I have to say that it is very painful to watch. I, personally, found this first installment to be very mediocre and primitive. Everything in it--the corny music, the blue filters, the choppiness, the transition, the plot selection--felt like a crappy teen flick. But the weakest point of this movie was the lead acting, so weak in fact, that it made the story more difficult to watch. The entire time, I could not focus on anything but the fact that Kristen Stewart kept letting her mouth hang open and scoffing/sighing with every line, while a somewhat aggressive Rob Pattinson kept awkwardly twitching and cringing as if he was in pain. There was no buildup to the romance whatsoever, and it left me wondering why Bella and Edward were even a couple. It wasn't until I got the books for Christmas that I read the story and figured out what was supposed to happen.    New Moon was a fair improvement, coming from a director whose work I generally like. The music selection was much better and more appropriate, the graphics a bit more exciting and the color-scheme more natural. Can't say that the transitions from every scene were done well; this movie still felt like it could be more uniform. And I absolutely loved the entire sequence in Voltera, Italy; that depiction alone is reason enough not to discount New Moon's cinematography. But though this movie was well-shot and produced, once again, the lead acting lacked. Rob made a change, which unfortunately went in the other direction,making him too robotic and emotionless. In my mind, I started to question whether he even had any talent or was just a poor actor. It wasn't until I saw Remember Me that I thought that he had any potential. And Kristen, who at least limited her scoffing to only two or three times, did not shed a single tear in any of the key scenes. Thankfully, her acting was balanced out by Taylor Lautner's, who actually gave a great portrayal of Jacob.     The minute I sat down to watch Eclipse, I had high hopes that David Slade would finally give the Twilight series what it needed - some quality - and walking out at the end of the film, I was anything but disappointed. The flow of the movie was very smooth, and I was actually surprised at how fast it was coming to an end. The special effects and fighting scenes were precisely shot, and the snow-capped mountainside was breathtaking. I am not a Twi-hard, teenager, housewife or part of whatever other stereotype is used to describe people who like this series, but I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. In fact, for the first time, I felt like I was watching a re-make of the series with new actors and overall better cinematography.     My biggest surprise was the acting. For the first time, Rob actually nailed Edward's personality and depicted him as he was meant to be--sensitive, caring, loving, witty, protective, etc. Every scene he did, whether angry or laid back, was spot-on and believable, all creepiness and awkwardness aside. FINALLY! And Kristen, though still not at her best, actually smiled and laughed and was fun as opposed to depressed and introverted. This improvement from both of them made all the intimate scenes feel more natural and the romance more believable. All the actors, in fact, especially Jackson Rathborne and Nikki Reed, really stepped up to the plate and played their characters well.    Although no movie will ever give a faithful adaptation of any book, Eclipse got pretty close. And though therewere certain liberties taken with the plot, which I remembered well, they did not detract from the key ideas. Overall, the movie hit on all the aspects of Bella's feelings/decisions about love, family, marriage and human life through different interactions with all the characters. Even if I hadn't read the book, I felt like as a viewer, I had enough information to understand her struggle and ultimate choice.      I know that there is always a negative for every positive, so there are plenty of haters of this film. But despite the complaints about the substance/content of the story (which should be attributed to the novelist, not the director), I feel it's unfair to deny that this is more mature, professionally made film that actually breathed some life into what could have otherwise been a cheesy, teen flick.

0316066524|4.0|Reading a cut of Andre Agassi's new book, \\"Open: An Autobiography\\",  in the preview window on Amazon makes me think he could have been a fictional creation of David Foster Wallace; someone else who steeped too long in tennis, stepping into or out of Infinite Jest. How so? Agassi starts his story this way. \\"I open my eyes and don't know where I am or who I am. Not all that unusual--I spent half my life not knowing.\\" See? Agassi goes on. \\"I look up. I'm lying on the floor beside the bed. I remember now. I moved from the bed to the floor in the middle of the night. I do that most nights. Better for the back.\\" Now is it apparent? If you still don't believe that Agassi belongs with Incandenza, there's more. \\"After three decades of sprinting, stopping on a dime, jumping high and landing hard, my body no longer feels like my body, especially in the morning. Consequently my mind doesn't feel like my mind. Upon opening my eyes I am a stranger to myself , and while, again, this isn't new, in the mornings it is more pronounced. I run quickly through the basic facts. My name is Andre Agassi. My wife's name is Stefanie Graf. We have two children, a son and daughter, five and three.

1416594787|4.0|You know how sometimes you get a feeling, and you can't necessarily back it up by reason or examples, but you just know it's true? This book is written by a British guy who's smarter than you and he lets you know that he's smarter and Britisher. That, however, is not a bad thing. The Greatest Show on Earth is a very good piece that demonstrates some of the more fascinating evidence for evolution. I went into this book as a choir member asking to be preached to, and for the most part, Dawkins delivers full scale.    As a lay person, I was baffled by the parts regarding scientific minutiae (and if I don't get it, chances are creationists won't either). Regardless, there is a lot of great material in the book geared to those of us who aren't as smart or British as Dawkins. I like that Dawkins didn't compromise when writing this book, but it's this lack of compromise for the average punk like myself that will prevent it from reaching the grand audience that it needs to reach.
B001HN6940|3.0|This is a story about a brat (Mairi Ella Challen) that grew up to a demure young lady (Mia Wasikowska), and lost her snot factor. Can she gain it back through adventure?  The story needed some adjustment due to the age factor of the victim. So this is why we get a more of a return the Underland in place of the original Wonderland. The wit is replaces with action, the cunning with swordplay and so forth.<br /><br />I do not want to give away any surprises but this presentation is a unique made for the actors and to be politically correct for this day and age. Alice is facing marriage to the son of her defunct father's old business partner.  She has been having problem with being distracted by a rabbit in a waistcoat.  She falls for the rabbit and we began to think back fondly of the story we were told as children.  If she can adjust her size the adventure takes a sad turn into a swashbuckler; unfortunately it is Alice not The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Will Alice be eaten, scratched, beheaded, or otherwise dispatched? Or will she return, get married, and realize there is no place like home.<br /><br />I only saw the 2D version so I cannot comment on 3D. The parts were extremely well acted by many of the best known actors of the time. No telling what the movie would be if the characters were a tad more traditional.
0061353248|3.0|I really liked reading this book. A lot. In fact, I read it pretty quickly considering my lackadaisical book reading ethic. That being said, this book is not without its flaws.    Dan Ariely is a nerd. It just sounds like it. He writes like a nerd. The language isn't particularly engaging or humorous. It felt a little contrived, as if Ariely didn't know who his audience was (and I'm not sure I know either). Thankfully Ariely has some great content and experiments under his belt to pad out this book.    This book came to my attention after reading Freakonomics. I consider this to book to be in the same vein. Ariely wants to blow our minds (and he does sound like a nerd saying \\"come on guys, you'll never believe this!\\" before explaining the results of his experiments). Some of the stuff is really interesting and mind blowing (e.g., the chapter about price anchoring). Other stuff is, well, pretty intuitive (i.e., people will cheat more if they don't have the option of getting caught!).    Additionally, the book comes off a little preachy. At the end of every chapter following the experiments' results, there's usually a piece about some sort of social policy we could employ. Granted, I did enjoy the take home message of how we can't really trust all of our decisions, but I do not believe the answer is paternalism. It does, however, appropriately address the need for updating economic models.    Ariely wrote a book with a great message (we might not always know why we make the decisions we do, and when we do, those reasons might not always be rational or right) but with a flawed execution. I can't recommend it wholeheartedly, but if you're coming down from a Freakonomics high, this is well worth it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is one of 2 books that literally blew me away this summer. My friend offhandedly mentioned this book to me on vacation. I downloaded a sample chapter to my Kindle, read that, downloaded the whole book, and spent a half a day curled up around it. I've never read a nonfiction book that I was completely unable put down, at least not until this one. I love inspiring stories, especially ones that aren't obviously TRYING to be inspiring. The author is a sports writer who loves running but kept having foot/knee issues. He starts researching why running is so hard on our bodies and through the course of the book, and his journey to find answers, runs into some amazing people - biomechanics experts, a hidden tribe of Native Americans in Mexico, ultra marathon runners - and he discovers that our bodies really are built to run. You read about all these people united by their love of feeling their bodies in motion, for the joy of being out there, running like kids, who run because it feels good. This book really touched me, especially because in my own life I've been working on the physical portion of getting true life balance. This book makes you want to go outside and just run, to not see it as work or a necessary evil for keeping in shape, but as something that your body wants and needs to do to feel truly free
014241543X|3.0|If I Stay<br />By Gayle Forman<br />Published by Speak<br /><br />This is the coming of age story of seventeen-year-old Mia, a classical cellist and Juilliard hopeful whose whole world is suddenly turned upside down. After a thin blanket of snow causes a school closure, Mia and her family set out on a fateful visit to a friend's house when they are in a horrific car accident. Waking to find that she is outside of her badly broken and comatose body, she is alone and confused.<br /><br />Mia's life is revealed in passages from her memory as her body is transported to the hospital and doctors and nurses work to save her life. The crux of the story is that Mia must make the ultimate choice of whether to live a forever-altered life, or to simply let go.<br /><br />Heartbreaking and poignant, If I Stay is an undemanding, honest narrative. I would not, however, feel comfortable recommending this book to the YA audience it is intended for. Regardless of how kids are raised today (or not raised as the case may be), I feel it's irresponsible to glorify a fifteen-year-old young girl having sex with her boyfriend, at home, with her condom providing parents downstairs. With several unsafe activities, overnight trips to other cities, and more swearing than I normally hear in a year, it was a little tough to swallow.
B001GCUO5M|1.0|Love Scorcese. Wanted to like this movie, but going into it... and this isn't entirely Scorcese's fault, it started to remind me of a movie called \\"The Ninth Configuration,\\" which was written by the same guy who did Exorcist. these are basically the same two formulas, but with different characters. I'm sorry, but Shutter Island had this feeling the whole time like it was trying too hard to be spooky. That's Scorce's fault. He makes a good movie, then does some clunkers, then makes a great movie. then more clunkers. this is a clunker. One man's opinion.
B000ION79Y|1.0|This was originally a SCI FI movie with Steven Seagal et al battling the hidden alien menace. Said aliens revealed only by their occasionally sideways blinking eyes and odd bits of wushu style wire work. All really low budget and I suspect a bit of a pile of steaming stinky as our man Steve is so laid back he's practically comatose and his action hero skit isn't helped by the spare tyre he's acquired over recent years. He clearly isn't bothereing, looks like he can't wait to hit the doughnut shop with his police buddies.  Then to cap it all after completion the producers decide to rework it as a modern terrorist movie about a spectacular drug plot, only there are a few MAJOR problems :-  1) New plot doesn't make any sense at all.  2) Alien special effects including sideways eyeblink left in, one hell of a narcotic.  3) New plot dialogue dubbed in by somebody who sounds almost entirely unlike Seagal, presumably cheaper and it really sucks big time.  4) Stupid continuity errors with fight wounds flipping from right side of victims chest to left then back again. It's also glaringly obvious to the casual viewer, this is not nerd stuff. Failure to pick it up is symptomatic of this slipshod, bone idle, crappy production.     If you want an example of how not to make a movie fine buy it. If you're looking for a Steven Seagal Movie forget it.
B002SG8A56|5.0|I love everything about Flight of the Conchords.  Everything. Except the fact they are not coming back for season 3. Of the two seasons, season 1 is better, but there are fantastic moments in season 2 as well (Jermaine becoming a prostitute, getting Garfunkled, the prime minister of New Zealand wanting to drive the tour bus). It's a very quirky show and not everyone will find it amusing, but I for one laugh out loud each time I watch it. And I have all of their songs available for purchase on ITunes on my IPod. I even saw them live in Atlanta last year and the live show is even better than the series. Love, love, love FOTC!
B003405MF6|5.0|I'm always interested in guitar players and their music.  I've been a fan of Jeff Beck ever since I was a teenager.  He was a teenager too, playing in the Yardbirds.  I have most everything Jeff Beck ever released on records and CDs, and saw the Jeff Beck Group at a concert where Rod Stewart was the singer and Ron Wood played rythm guitar.  This album is very different.  It's majestic, soulful and powerful.  On other albums, Jeff mixes blues, rock, reggae and other genres together.  Emotion and Commotion has a synergistic flow throughout.  Nothing seems out of place even though the material covers everything from \\"Somewhere over the rainbow\\" to Screamin' Jay Hawkins \\"I put a spell on you\\" with Joss Stone. I highly recommend this CD and think you will find yourself listening to it many times.
B003GDYN24|5.0|I'll always loved Kelis, I like this new direction of music I really hope she can find away to keep both of her styles next time,There are only 9 track and one is the intro is a really good song but is still the intro. But is so good that I have to give this a 5. But I really hope she finds balance cause I'm gonna miss the old Kelis or maybe this could be some type of alter-ego but in music.     Great album, get it. definitely the summer album. Great job
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Bought this for son's birthday. He was thrilled. Don't have Blu-ray as of yet, but bought DVD/Blu-Ray combo because price was only couple dollars more than DVD alone. Can't wait to watch it!
0981951244|5.0|I read \\"The Compound Effect\\" in a day or two and have re-read sections to my wife that were massively insightful.  Darren nails it with this book!  I've read all the classics (of personal development, that is) and rate this one near the top!  I am now listening to the audio version while I'm running.  Nothing will motivate you to take that next step, then that next step, go a mile, then another mile, more than hearing about the compound effect as explained by Darren!  Thanks for changing my life, Mr. Hardy!
0321701763|1.0|I think this book is a waste of money, for the price I believe I should be getting alot more instructions on how to use all the new features.  This book really just give you the basics, what tools are what, etc.  I have bought Classroom in a Book for Elements 4, and it was fantastic, thought I couldn't go wrong with this book.  Nothing in here is something one couldn't figure out on their own.  Save your money!!  I will wait for the Scott Kelby book, where I have never been disappointed.  Thankfully, Amazon has great customer service and I was able to return this book.
1423113381|5.0|I am truly amazed by Rick Riordon. I love his Perseus Jackson Camp Half Blood Series, that feature demi-gods, children of Greek Gods and mortals, and their adventures as we learn about Greek mythology.<br />As Camp Half Blood is evolving into a new series, Riordon now has given the 'young folk' The Red Pyramid (The Kane Chronicles, Book 1). It deals with Egyptian mythology, and boy does he give us an education in Egyptian mythology while he entertains us with an exciting story line! I thought I was familiar with most Egyptian gods, but he had me!<br />What I like is he features the children of a mixed race husband and wife -famous Egyptologists in their own right - the mother is killed at the Obelisk in London, and the children are divided up - Sadie, the daughter, who is like her mother, blond and blue eyed is based in London with her mother's parents. Carter, who is like his African American father, stays with his father and goes on his digs and adventures.<br />When the Dad goes to visit Sadie during Christmas Eve, he takes them to the - oh be still my heart - the British Museum - to see the Rosetta Stone - He tries to do a spell to release some Egyptian Gods, but the plan backfires and he is drawn in to the land of mythology leaving the children in the hands of their uncle Amos, and his baboon Khufu in a mansion in New York!<br />They have to stop Set from finishing the Red Pyramid in the desert because they will kill all humans and take over.<br />My favorite Egyptian God that was written absolutely perfectly was Anubis, who has a flirtation with Sadie, and I cannot wait for the next installment to see what happens next.<br />Riordon says, like the Harry Potter series, this is for the young folk, but I can tell you it is for everyone and the references to the gods will cause younger and older folks back to their mythology books to see who these gods and goddesses are.<br />Adventurous, groundbreaking, and fun. What more can one want in a book?<br />Excellent read.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show is a surprise hit!  Great cast and gerat Drama.  It has it all.  The acting is superb as well  I watch Dexter, Sons of Anarchy, and this show ranks up there.  If you haven't watched THE SHIELD, check that out as well.
B0018SWA56|5.0|I recently finished reading both novels, something borrowed, followed by something blue. I have to say that I loved both novels, but I think I loved something blue even more. The author has a great ability to describe the characters and the environment so well that most of the time I felt as if I was right there with the characters. Both books made me laugh, I had a fun time reading them.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|One of the most engaging books (or series) I've read so far!<br /><br />There are probably a million characters in the whole series but not one of them can be ignored!
B003E48AYC|5.0|ALICE IN WONDERLAND    I have to say that I am indeed a fan of Lewis Carroll the person who wrote the stories on which this film was based [yes I said stories as in multiple, it's true look it up], and am a huge fan of the animated film that we all know and love, CLASSIC. Add in that I am a Tim Burton fan, a Johnny Depp fan [my girl loves him], and a huge Helena Bonham Carter fan [I love her]. So naturally we all got together to see this film opening night and had a great time. Also naturally when released on this three disc combo pack I had to have it, the day and minute it was released it was mine. Did I love the film that much, is it a classic, is it five stars, are all questions I am sure you want to ask me after reading that. Well before any are answered here in the review let me say this, I believe in supporting people you claim to be a fan of. So regardless I would have bought this any way luckily I liked this film so it was all good.    This is not the classic animated version you all remember from back in the day, no, this is Tim Burton's take on this. In this version of the film Alice is older and on the verge of getting married, or so her hopeful husband to be thinks. Of course she is not in love and doesn't want to do it plus she thinks she is seeing a rabbit every where she goes. It is at a party in which the future husband [he hopes, or is it expects] will be asking for her hand that she follows the rabbit. Of course you all know she falls into the hole at the bottom of the tree only to end up in Underworld, oops I mean Wonderland [which is it, I guess you will have to watch]. Now that we are here there are a few familiar faces, or maybe not so much if you are Alice. It turns out she doesn't remember any of them or she may not be the real Alice at all.    All of your favorites are here of course from Tweedledee and Tweedledum, White Rabbit, Blue Caterpillar, and of course the Cheshire Cat along with so much more. But yes as I am sure you all know the Mad Hatter is here and plays a big role in the film. You see the Red Queen and her huge head are planning on killing Alice so she can't kill the Jabberwocky. But if she isn't Alice how can she defeat this monster and why should she even try, this is not her battle after all. So off we go on a crazy adventure that I can honestly say I enjoyed as did my little cuz, she loved it.    This is with out a doubt a Tim Burton film as it has his style all over it but I wonder what type of film this would have been if it would not have been geared towards kids. Still I found it to be a very entertaining film that was just straight fun. If I would have went in expecting more I may have been disappointed but if little 5 year old cuz and my girl enjoyed it then so would I, and I did. It must have been kinda hard for writer Linda Woolverton to not only write this but write a visual film for 3-D. the visuals are amazing and look flawless and bring magic to the screen, the colors and creatures of this world are wonderful. DP Dariusz Wolski did a great job with this film as it looks excellent.    Now if the story changes are too much for you in the script or you feel Burton's take was not what you expected there is one thing you can count on, the performances. We will start with our lead, Mia Wasikowska, the way she portrays Alice is wonderful. In fact it is possible she may be the best Alice yet from all of the live action films and TV shows. Johnny Depp of course is excellent as The Mad Hatter and brings a new version of the famous charter to life, switching between a sweet yet mad version and a more menacing version when talking about the Red queen and such. Depp has always been able to bring any character to life and does a great job here, especially after watching the special features I love this Hatter. Just an example is how Depp had them put one eye slightly off from the other, the reason for doing so, you will have to buy and see for your self.    Now before I get to any oneelse I have to say my absolute favorite in the film for sure is the Red Queen, Helena Bonham Carter. I have to admit that I love her as she is one of my favorite actresses ever, of all time, and well you get the idea. Her over sized head just gave me more to look at while she was giving the show stealing performance in my opinion. She hits the \\"Off with his head\\" line perfectly throughout the film and delivers me and my girl's favorite part off the film. That of course is when she yells \\"IDIOT\\" at Stayne; you know she is very much like my lady in this film. She yells that at me a lot 2, I'll let it slide today. Speaking of Stayne Crispin Glover as does an excellent job in this film and looks very, well, awkward I guess as he is very tall and thin. Still it was cool to see him in another theatrical release; I have always liked him [\\"Willard\\" is a classic].    As for the rest of the cast they are all as good as the ones previously mentioned such as Anne Hathaway who plays the White Queen. Matt Lucas plays both the Tweedle brothers, Michael Sheen is the rabbit, Alan Rickman plays the Blue Caterpillar, but the show stealer from voice over characters has to be Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat. He steals every scene that he shows up in plus he is a big lazy looking cat like one that I own [it is her cat I swear, she made me get it, I never wanted to own cats but she forced them upon me I swear]. Well regardless of that the Cat is still a bright spot in this film, in fact the one thing that people who didn't like the movie can agree upon is that the acting was great.    I must also say that the special features on this 3 Disc edition are wonderful and highly recommended, so get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo like we did. Also I think another reason I enjoyed this film so much [aside from Helena Bonham Carter, love her] is that my girl she loves Depp] and little cuz had a wonderful time with this film. Of course my cuz loved it because she is 6 and was completely sucked in by the wonderful images and characters that were before her. Whatever the case was for why I enjoyed this film so much I guess it really doesn't matter, this review is for my lady since she loved this film and would give it 5 out of 5. So here ya go baby the review I am sure you would have written yourself, Love You and happy Birthday.
B003IPC5SO|2.0|We've waited 3 years for this?  i'm a kylie fan from 1988, even though i had to buy most of her albums by import cause they weren't released in the u.s.a.  i know the 5-star lovers are going to crucify me for giving my own opinion, but so be it.    i didn't like the lead off single, \\"All the Lovers\\", but i was hoping the rest of the album would be great.  it's not.    tracks 1-6 are listenable, but tracks 7-12 are just boring fillers.    if she thinks this is going to explode in america, she's wrong.  she might have a hit on the club charts, but they won't play this on american radio.  if she's relying on Gaga's success to get her music back in america, she's going to have to bring something better than this.  this music is not nearly as exciting or catchy as Gaga's latest.    the \\"X\\" album is so much better.  i'm not the only one who feels this way.  people say X wasn't cohesive.  would you rather have an album like APHRODITE that sounds the same all the way through--bland?  \\"X\\" had many different sounds, which offered tracks that stood out.  it was still a dance record, and an exciting one.    stuart price made an exciting album with madonna a few years ago, and a great one with the new scissor sisters, but that's not the case here.    i love kylie, but this is her worst album since 1991's LET'S GET TO IT.    boring...
B00000DI2T|5.0|I think \\"Santa Fe Listener\\" is largely spot on about Bernstein's last interpretations of Mahler. The sound is FAR better than the sony 1960's recordings for the most part, and except for 4 and 8, the interpretations are at least equal, and in some cases  (1, 6, 9), superior. There are now tons of Mahler complete symphony sets, most of which are mannered to the point of blandness, see Zinman, Bertini, Boulez, and none that match the sheer excitement of Bernstein conducting Mahler with world class orchestras. I think BOTH Bernstein sets are indispensible.  If you have room and budget for more, Michael Gielen, and for sheer quality of sound and playing, Chailly are well worth a listen. For the tamer approach to Mahler, the Kubelik recordings from the 60-s-70's have probably not been surpassed.
0385504225|2.0|It seems as though Dan Brown found a formula with the Da Vinci and duplicated it with angels and demons and this book.  The plot seemed like an interesting topic but it was very predictable and the ending was very lackluster.  I would not recommend this book.
030745455X|5.0|This sequel to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is amazing. After struggling to get used to the style and names and places of the first book, I was primed for this wonderfully suspenseful mystery. From page one, this storyline had me hooked. Salanger, the tattooed and pierced computer genius with the photographic memory once again fills this story with intrigue as she hides and tries to uncover the truths behind the triple murders of which she is wrongly accused. One word of warning, get the third book in the trilogy now, because you'll want to devour that one too!
B003JLA4KS|4.0|I'll admit that i'm a Rush fan up to the Moving Pictures album only.  After that forget it, and i've really tried to like their newer stuff (Vapor Trails, Snakes) but sorry it just doesn't cut it for me.  Fortunately this movie has a lot of clips from the early years when they just smoked.  I have fond memories of seeing them live in 1976 and 77 and the clips bring back the intensity of those gigs.  You knew something was going wrong when they started wearing skinny ties on the Moving Pictures tour.  The later clips of them during their \\"synth-pop\\" phase are hysterical, Geddy's hairdo, the corny videos, etc.  It was unbelievable that this was the same band that did 2112!!  It never really was the same after that, try as they might to go back to a power trio format.  Guess they were just getting too old to rock(they should hang out with Lemmy more often...or Angus).  They seem like nice guys, though.    In any event it's a good watch, they really avoid making \\"fun\\" of them or interviewing fans of the older material asking them what they thought of the direction change.  And I must reiterate that the stretch of work from the debut to Moving Pictures is absolutely essential listening and perhaps some of the greatest progressive rock ever recorded.  But anyone watching this movie already has those anyway.
0061703257|5.0|I am a big fan of this author having read all of his previous books - the Kenzie/Gennaro series, Mystic River, The Given Day - and was \\"saving\\" this one until another Lehane book hit the shelves. I wasn't disappointed. This is truly a \\"suspense\\" novel so I'll keep my review general so as not to spoil any of the plot twists.<br /><br />In 1954, U.S. Marshalls Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule are assigned the task of finding a female patient who has escaped from Ashcliffe Hospital, a federal institution for the criminally insane located on the isolated Shutter Island, in Massachusetts' Outer Harbor. Upon their arrival, Daniels and Aule soon realize two things - Shutter Island and Ashcliffe Hospital  are not what they appear to be and that an impending hurricane is about to lengthen their \\"day trip\\" to the island significantly.<br /><br />This is the stuff nightmares are made of and Lehane handles it expertly. If One Flew Cuckoo's Nest got under your skin, Shutter Island will make it crawl but in a much more subtle manner. The lines between staff, patients, wardens and doctors all become blurred with our two US Marshalls stuck - literally because of the storm - right in the middle of this dilemma. The escaped patient \\"case\\" soon grows into a game of  \\"Who can you trust?\\" and with Teddy Daniels' past haunting his every step, the story soon becomes a test of reality.<br /><br />The conclusion may disappoint some - not this reader - there is a \\"Lady or the Tiger?\\" aspect to it - regardless, you can't fault it for creativity and originality.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0790729687|5.0|This is a clasic vampire   story of love,  desire,    loneliness,  greed,    anger,  sadness and   every other emotion in it.    It features famous   actors like Brad Pitt,    Tom Cruiz,  Antonio   Bandaras,  Christian   Slader and a very young   Kirstan Dunst.  Christian   Slader plays a reporter   who interviews the   vampire Lestat,  (played   by Cruiz).  Lestat tells his   life story and   adventures of his dark   world as a vampire,     while intriged yet   unconvinced Slader   records his story.  Lestat   is lonely and fastinated   with a young wealthy   man (Pitt)  who after the   death of his wife,  has   nothing to loose and no   longer enjoys life.    Perhaps Lestat can give   a better life for the   empty Pitt....  An older   clasic with class and   hidden humor.  Enjoy!!
1439165645|5.0|A very rich story. Beautifully written. Great contrast of cultures and characters. The Hundred-Foot Journey is great book.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|The movie seemed pretty darn good to me. BUT, I know how it is when you read alllllll the books, hear a movie is coming out, you get all excited, see the movie, and it's like someone deflated all the air from you, you're so disappointed. So, I can relate. However, I did not read the books, so I enjoyed the movie :)
B000VWE5OY|4.0|This season had more engaging episodes than the first season. The characters were engaging. However, Owen's ongoing condition got a bit tiresome.
0345363132|5.0|I'd read one of Penman's books before, and was impressed, but this one really blew me away.<br /><br />For starters, I like historical fiction but don't usually read the sort that stars real historical figures. The characters in such books often lack personality and the plots are frequently dull. Happily, The Sunne in Splendour bears no resemblance to such books.<br /><br />This is the story of the War of the Roses, spanning 33 years, from 1459 to 1492. It's also the story of Richard III, one of the most vilified kings in English history. When I picked up this book, I didn't understand the time period at all; I'd read some summaries of the wars but found them confusing. I \\"get it\\" now: in 931 pages, Penman shows us the battles, the politics, the intriguing, and the rise and fall of kings (plural), and without resorting to simplification, conveys it all so that it not only makes sense but is memorable. As for Richard III, I had no opinion about him before reading this book, but Penman has turned me into a partisan--which is, I'm sure, exactly what she intended.<br /><br />So what makes Penman's work great isn't just her attention to historical detail (although it is prodigious) but her attention to psychological complexity. The characters are real people, with conflicting loyalties and moral ambiguities and all the rest. There aren't any evil villains (although there are characters you'll dislike) and there aren't really any heroes (even though Penman really likes Richard), but there are a lot of interesting and complicated people, who experience a lot of interesting and often tragic events. It makes for great drama.<br /><br />In the end, I think maybe this book is so universally admired by readers--although it's Penman's first book, many consider it her best--because it's so passionate. She's passionate about her subject, and the characters are passionate about a variety of things, and it all adds up to a truly compelling read. There were a couple of minor annoyances, like the overuse of character names in dialogue, but I found them easy to overlook because the story and characters grabbed me by the throat and would not let go.<br /><br />On a more mundane note, I want to commend Penman and/or her publisher for a couple of inclusions that greatly enhanced my reading experience: one, a map of Great Britain and northern France with all relevant locations marked; and two, a family tree as of 1459. That's right: for those of us who don't know who marries whom, or when major characters die, there are no spoilers in the family tree. Thank you for that.<br /><br />What else can I say? Buy this book!es, like the overuse of character names in dialogue, but I found them easy to overlook because the story and characters grabbed me by the throat and would not let go.<br /><br />On a more mundane note, I want to commend Penman and/or her publisher for a couple of inclusions that greatly enhanced my reading experience: one, a map of Great Britain and northern France with all relevant locations marked; and two, a family tree as of 1459.

B000002G87|5.0|this is a great cd.  im glad i got it from a great seller!
0156013983|5.0|That statement is hinted at on the back of the book.<br /><br />And presumably, this is a children's book.  It clearly isn't.<br /><br />If you have the courage to read this book, if you haven't already, then good luck.  The ending just isn't very easy to take, but this author really seemed to know what he was doing, so I guess it was necessary.<br /><br />I AM a pilot (literally) that happens to live in the desert (Southern California).  So I relate to the author on a literal level, but only up to a point.<br /><br />The author is nothing less, in my opinion, up there with Socrates, Einstein, and other great minds.  Yes, the book really is that powerful.  It masquerades as a children's book, and therefore people that should have read it, haven't.  It contains some secrets, all of which (I don't think) most \\"adults\\" will acquire on the first reading. One reading of it just won't be enough.
B0001AUAU4|4.0|Carla Bruni's music reflects her unique personal style.  You will appreciate her music more by knowing her life stand and background.  However, her music is simple and light.  Do not expect to carry it for long.
0316154687|4.0|I took \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" with me to the hospital as I needed to have neurosurgery to remove what was ultimately a benign tumor.  Mr. Sedaris' essays on smoking cessation in Tokyo kept me completely engaged during the entire check-in process until I was wheeled into the operating room.  I couldn't wait to pick the book back up when I was in my hospital room post-operatively.  His little tale of morality and mortality paralleled the immediate events in my life with wry observations and wise conclusions.  I strongly recommend this book.
0385504225|5.0|After I'm done reading one of Robert Langdon's books, I always feel that the latest read is the best one yet.  I've enjoyed them all and love how he places the reader alongside him participating in the search for the truth as he merges actual history with fiction to create his story, touching those very subjects in such a way that he produces an emotional arousal of feelings in the reader; thoughts and beliefs that have been so instrumental in our our own continuous search for that which is greater than ourselves.    I took the \\"Lost Symbol\\" everywhere with me.  Just coundn't put it down.  \\"The best yet!\\"
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I was totally disappointed. Unlike the first 2 books, which were linked by the characters but the plots were different, Hornets' Nest is just a continuation of the second book in the series. I haven't finished it yet - I am bored with it. He could have tacked on a few extra pages to Plays With Fire and skipped this book.  Nothing very new unless you like Swedish politics. I am very disappointed!
0446563048|5.0|Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose is an excellent read. The book chronicles the life and business pursuits of the author, Tony Hsieh. It offers inspiration that can be applied to both business and personal pursuits. The book is divided into three primary areas as the title implies; they are profits, passion and purpose. Through stories of his business endeavors, Tony illustrates how his focus evolved from being on profit, to finding his passion, to finally living his purpose.     I appreciated that the stories were candid and well sequenced. In fact, transparency is a quality throughout the book. Hsieh actually included company email correspondence to support certain aspects of his story. He also welcomed inserts and accounts from people who worked alongside him when building both LinkExchange,  which was sold to Microsoft in 1998 for $265 million and Zappos, which was acquired by Amazon in 2009 in a deal valued at over $1.2 billion.     Zappos was started in 1999 during a recession. While other prominent ventures failed, Zappos made it through a recession, dot com bust, stock market crash and 9/11. In 2008, we began to see economic times reminiscent of those in the early Zappos days. The bottom fell out of the housing market, financial institutions failed and millions of Americans lost their jobs. The timing of this book and the Zappos story couldn't be more appropriate. This book provides inspiration to those on the fence about starting a business venture amidst an economic down turn.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|This is a cool set to add if you like The Boss, it is defiantly no Born to Run or Born in the USA but is still a good album to have your collection.  It has some good tracks on it, including one toward the end that was in the movie The Wrestler.  If you like the Boss it's a good piece to have your collection.

1591396190|4.0|Written in a very understandable format, Blue Ocean Strategy by W.Chan Kin and Renee Maugorgne expose a fantastic plan to step out of the pack of competitors. The authors lay out their strategy canvas that can be used to plan and take action when picking new directions for your company or products. The strategy canvas is part planning tool and part implementation tool. Through great examples and stories Blue Ocean Strategy really got my mind thinking in new ways. Well worth the read if it is your job to plan ahead. For a more detailed review visit [...]
B000QTCXIW|4.0|Easily one of the best Beyonce albums out there! Despite the fact that some stuff she has come out with since it really good I do not think that I have enjoyed any albums over all as much as I enjoy this one so many great hits irreplaceable, Beautiful Liar, World Wide Woman and so many more.
B002HREKCI|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite books I have ever read, maybe even my favorite. You cannot put this book down! I read this book in one day!!! I felt like Clay, I needed to know what this girl had been put through to make her make such a horrible and irreversible decision. This book takes you on a journey through many different emotions. Frustrated that someone so young could end their life, irritated how immature people are in high school. Mad at how inconsiderate and ruthless people can be. Angry at the fact that people can know something is happening but are too scared to try and help, too afraid at what people will think. Then at last you feel sad, almost depressed as you watch her try one last final try to reach out to someone for help. No one looked deep enough to find the true root of the problem. No one thought it was a big deal. NO one realized what she had went through. This book showed me how on elittle rumor can set up events that can ruin one person's life and make them feel they need to take such a drastic measure to try and fix it.     I don't know about any of you but I know after reading this book I will treat people different, I will try to be more caring and try to see past the outside and see deeper inside people to see the good. Maybe even deep enough like people should have looked inside Hannah to realize she needed help. I know that this is not a true story, but the fact is that situations like this happen everyday. I know that this book changed the way I view people. I feel that if every high schooler had to read this book it may help fix the way they treat eachother. I know that it will never stop, but if we could improve it even a little bit it might save peoples lives. Don't start rumors it may seem harmless but after reading this book you will see that it does not stop there. Like Hannah said you cannot disprove a rumor. I look forward to more books from Jay Asher. This one is amazing! I hope that this book can be turned into a movie someday, it really needs to. Well this book is amazing you should read it. I know that this won't be the last time I read this book. I will pick it up again in the near future so that I may learn from Hannah's life.     Thank you.
B000002N2Q|5.0|I have all Green day albums, im not someone new to music or new to 'punk rock' infact I was raised in music of this genre, be it the Pistols, Dead Kennedys, Ramones, The Clash, Sham 69 etc...     But this is easily the best Green Day album ever.     Every song can be taken seriously, the album is well constructed, everything fits and fits perfectly.     The best thing about this album is that not song is a single which makes it a proper 'album'.    I dont like bands like blink 182 etc, punk faded away way before this mess, my views are as a fan, not just of Green Day but of music as an art form.
0345404475|5.0|PKD is undoubtedly one of the masters of the genre.  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is a not-so-subtle examination of consciousness and the human experience.  In his deliberate blurring of the lines of what it is to be human, Dick crafts a tale that is as inspiring as it is fun.  Blade Runner this ain't, but that's what makes this novel a true masterpiece.  And hey, if you liked this book, have a look at [[ASIN:1419608258 Wonderboy and the Black Hole of Nixvy Veck]]
0143038419|2.0|So many people have said they read this book, but often I discover most of them could not get past Italy and never finished the book.  I really found it difficult to finish this book myself.  I did not find the writing style to be particularly clever or witty.  I could not connect to the self-absorbed author.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|This little case is big enough for my Zune HD MP3 player *actually, it is much roomier than required for that), and my guess is that an iPod Touch/iPhone would also fit.  The padding is quite thick and the whole case looks very stylish in my eyes.   The drawstring cord has a plastic closure mechanism on it. The overall quality is very good, the stitches are sturdy and I could not detect any apparent flaw in the fabric or the seams.  Overall, this is a very simple, yet sturdy and usable case for a lot of the current electronic gadgets. Just don't try to fit an iPad in it ... :)

0399156577|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a Nora Roberts fan. Ever since the first and probably always will be. The majority of her books are above and beyond anything else out there but of course there are a few that fall short. This, in my opinion, is one of them.    I'm not going to rehash the summary of the book. You can find that in other reviews but I'm going to hightlight some of the areas that bothered me.    One: Fiona (the herione) talked too much. Too jumbled. Too babbling. Just too much about the same stuff over and over. Toward the end of the book, I skimmed through most of her dialouge.    Two: I couldn't get a clear picture of the hero in my head. He was tall, had a lot of dark hair, tawny eyes, and a chiseled jaw. No dimples, no smirk, no half-smile, amused look in his eyes, nothing. He was just very wooden and I couldn't picture him. It bugged me.    The herione was described better and I could picture her, but...strawberry blonde? Tallish and lean? Perky nose? Slight over-bite? That's a younger Nora Roberts. No matter how I tried, she came out as a younger Roberts.    Three: Simon (the hero) was mean and rude. I get that some heroes can be rough around the edges with a soft heart. Or arrogant and brash but with a sense of honor and compassion. Simon was not any of those things. I also get the message that survivors don't need to be coddled and babied from the man they love, that they're not weak. I get it, but Simon was often just plain rude, intolerant, and non-empathatic.    The plot was decent, if repetitive. The dogs were great and fun. I learned a lot about dog training, that's for sure.
B00111YM5G|5.0|This is a terrific movie.  I was looking on Redbox to see what they had, read a couple reviews for this flick, was intrigued both by the reviews and the fact that it stars Andy Whitfield, now starring as Spartacus, on Starz and gave it a watch.  It's fantastic, and I hope they follow through with what I believe is a planned trilogy.
0307269752|1.0|thought maybe the ending might make up for the boring read, but - my god - it was just another way to torture someone and there was no satisfaction of justice for the crimes committed.  it was like the author was bored too and he should have been.<br /><br />the \\"who done it\\" was -yawn- something i am sure everyone who reads it thinks is a distinct possibility throughout the book and so the ending is no real surprise.  i didn't care about any of the characters except for lisbeth.  she was interesting and i liked reading about her sometimes, but that just wasn't enough either.<br /><br />why oh why, do so many people like this?  kinda makes me worry about the state of our readers.
9889979942|5.0|What Peter Hessler did in his memoir River Town, Tom Carter does with China: Portrait of a People.  A new wave of camera-toting expats will soon come to China hoping to follow in Carter's footsteps.<br /><br />I write this within a week of coming back to America after a year of teaching English at university in southern Hunan.  While it was a wonderful experience, I was eager to get back home and move on to bigger and better things.  But then Carter's book came in the mail from Amazon.  My immediate reaction:  every expat coming to China should have one for the inevitable day culture shock strikes; the book should come wrapped in white paper with a red cross and the instructions: \\"For prevention and treatment of culture shock.  Open if you have any of the following symptoms...\\"  Just paging through it compels me to return to see what I can see, do what I can do, and meet whoever I can meet.<br /><br />About the size of a Wendy's ¾ Pound Triple with Cheese and just as juicy, Carter's China: Portrait of a People is the perfect gift for old China hands and armchair explorers alike.  But before I tell you why, let me first say that I have beef with his book.  While the author has clearly gone above and beyond the duty of any artistic photojournalist, he has neglected to document two very important regions: China's renegade province Taiwan and the California Special Economic Zone.  Despite these glaring omissions, I give the book five red stars.<br /><br />The photography pulls the reader along a journey filled with joy, wonder, sadness, awe, and cognitive dissonance.  What fun!  Pictures of people from all social strata doing all manner of things capture the essence of this unique time in world history.  As I read between the lines (or looked between the photos?), it struck me just how social savvy the author must be and how much social support he must have had in order to complete such a journey.  The photography is intimate; like good literature, readers see into another's soul, feel another's feeling, and experience a moment in the life of another person.  Nine out of ten Confucianists agree China: Portrait of a People cures autism.<br /><br />While each picture is worth 10,000 words as one reviewer already noted, the well written prose complements the imagery.  Captions provide snippets of the subject's story and interesting tidbits of Chinese history, culture and trivia.  The prose is informative, witty, literate, and peppered with anecdotes about some of the hardships endured during the author's travels.  The factoids presented herein will make any reader an instant MVP on China Trivia Night and gain face with Chinese friends and acquaintances.<br /><br />Carter backpacked 56,000 miles and visited 200 cities and villages to gather material for this book.

B00008G7UF|5.0|I so wanted to see this movie since I became a fan of Kevin. It didn't happen until July 5th 2010. Now I have it in my own home. At the time I bought this movie, I would do personalized acting. I don't do that anymore. From a whole new perspective, I find it funny. From a video I watched, the female narrator from watchmojo.com mention both this and I.Q. as fluffy projects. Sometimes I look at this and it made me think of a photo I still have of Kevin and Meg. Either my mom or somebody else asked me &#34;Were they in a movie together?&#34; and I said &#34;Yes. French Kiss.&#34;  I watched a scene where they were on the train and Kate liked the cheese and the scenery and Luc didn't care much because he was born there and also a lot of other scenes. Back when I played with dolls and do personalized acting, I didn't find those scenes funny because I had to stick with my lines. Now I find them quite funny. I still think that Meg looks like the girl we once knew. She's not a young person anymore.  Thumbs up.
0143038419|1.0|Basically this book is a self induced food eating coma that the writer cannot get out of. Yes these are the three things that one must do in live to get by, but um, she comes off as a selfish brat that has to run away from her life, which by the way this book was funded by the pre contract money to write this book. It is so self asborbed and very annoying, it did not change my life only by the fact that i wish i did not spend money on it, ugh, it left a horrbile taste in my mouth also. Dont read this book.

0743289692|5.0|Nothing new to add to the 308 reviews that gave this book five stars except that i. it should be required reading in high schools across the Western world  (provides very fertile ground for discussion questions and critical thinking) and ii. it should be part of the syllabus of \\"Feminist studies\\" in all top U.S. universities and iii. once it is required reading in Muslim schools and is read and can be openly discussed by every menstruating Muslim without physical repercussions, the book will have come closer to fulfilling one of its goals -  aligning the beliefs of Islam with the eternal values of equal rights and opportunities for all in the 21st century
B003EV6DBM|1.0|I'm living in the Netherlands and have waited for the online version of Doctor who season 5 to be available since the release of the Christmas special. I Loved all the Mofatt eps in Davies era, so I was looking forward to the new series. I'm sorry but it's a total disappointment. I watched ep 1 online and thought that I had accidentally downloaded some cheap Scifi show from the states. The story line was unappealing for adults older than 8, the new Doctor is emotionless and cold, and Amy is as charming as a pouting goldfish. Why did they do such a horrible job at casting? I kept watching, hoping that it would eventually get better, but even the ep with the weeping angels was an utter disappointment, by the time I got to the Vampire ep, I just stopped watching.

B000002HPV|5.0|This album is powerful!<br />If you are ok with music deviating from what you hear on the radio, this might just be for you!<br />I used to think Bjork was weird at one point too (I saw the Where is the Line With You)!<br />I didn't listen to her for the longest time.<br /><br />Then I realized being weird was ok. So I gave her a second shot. This is the first album I owned of hers and I love it!<br />So different, but its what makes her unique!<br />(and I have no pprblem with her voice).<br />But, true, some people might not like this as it is very different from mainstream music.<br />Oh well..
B001HN6940|5.0|Reading some of the reviews, I found myself wondering if we even saw the same movie?!?  I saw this movie originally in the theater and then I bought the Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />Perhaps I went into it expecting something different than some reviewers here.  This Alice is older than your children's books and she's returning from a long forgotten trip when she was young.  The characters are fun, the visuals stunning and a plot with enough differences to be entertaining.<br /><br />I didn't think the 3D added much in the theater and it wasn't missed in the home viewing on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I found I enjoyed watching the movie the second time even better than the first.  I caught things I'd missed previously.  I look forward to watching it again and again - who knows what else I missed!
B000GCFY0I|3.0|This is your classic Brave New World rewrite. It is YA, but I couldn't get through it all the way, and neither could my teen daughter. The writing is fairly good, the idea is pretty cool, but somehow it just doesn't get anywhere. For a long time, the main character doesn't really have a goal they are trying to get to. And as they \\"go off the grid\\" and start meeting people in other circles, there's this strange feeling that comes over the reader that the author doesn't really know how his world works. It feels like he is making it up as he goes along, and could have used an outline.
B000007MVM|5.0|Roger \\"Syd\\" Barrett,a founding member of Pink Floyd,a psychedelic rock group, having hits with Arnold Layne,See Emily Play and Piper at the Gates of Dawn,having written most of the material,was an innovative guitarist in his own right,exploring sonic possibilities of dissonance,distortion,feedback and echo,able to create mysterious, otherworldly sounds using slide guitar.However the pressures placed on Barrett and his increasing LSD drug use, edged him towards psychiatric illness and mental breakdown.His antics became unpredictable on stage and he was replaced by David Gilmour.They just left him out in January 1968.He had a brief solo career1968-72.He released 2 albums,The Madcap Laughs and Barrett.     In The Madcap Laughs Barrett's more vulnerable moments have been left on tape giving the music a more authentic feel.Some sessions occurred between May-June 1968,but the bulk was recorded between April and July 1969,with David Gilmour and Roger Waters,serving as studio musicians and producers.A few tracks have been overdubbed by members of the band Soft Machine.Despite Barrett's descent into insanity,this record is a real exploration of psychedelic rock.Some of the tracks are simple acoustic guitar and Barrett's voice.Others have electric and base guitars, organs,vibes, pianos,cymbals,drums and are more multi-layered, largely overdubbed over his voice and guitar. Barrett didn't want any rehearsals or re-recordings done. Syd's playing and singing were highly erratic and unpredictable--he skipped or added beats and bars seemingly at random, or otherwise he would strum on a single chord for a long time before unexpectedly reverting back to the main portion of the song. This was all much to the frustration of the session musicians leading to certain tension.     Madcap,the rash,impulsive,high-spirited girl he sings to in these songs,flips from being inner demon or muse.The spontaneity and immediacy come from his raw talent,stripped bare.He is slipping away from us mentally,getting into his own groove,out on his own track,soon to be lost forever,far from the world of groups,session musicians and engineers,floundering in a limbo of headspace,a universe in reverse.On the album cover the image of Barrett crouching in the corner of his living room,face obscured by dark, wavy hair and bad lighting.Purple and orange floorboards.This is the antechamber to the end of the 60s,when darkness descends,stark instrumentation,haunting lyrics,a vulnerability so palpable and unedited,you know this man is not sane. He will soon putter out from conscious creation.However he was in fine form during the sessions.Some of the later tracks are rushed and spartan due to time allowed.     We board an unorthodox musical train of thought,not able,like the session musicians,to anticipate where it will go.The opening song,\\"Terrapin\\"changes key and skips beats without warning.The word order combination 'Floating,bumping,noses dodge a tooth/the fins a luminous/fangs all `round the clown/is dark below the boulders hiding all/the sunlight's good for us' is rich in imagery,soulful in voice.Are we ever on the same page?In \\"No good trying\\" there is the wilful egotism and directness of a child.In `Love You' we have the whooping joy of first love.We know what it means,yet it it has no sense.In \\"No Man's Land\\" there is a gibberish verse no one can even understand to write down,meant to be understood,yet Syd liked it that way.\\"Dark Globe\\",a first person narrative of schizophrenia,with the plaintive refrain \\"Wouldn't you miss me at all?\\" or \\"please lift a hand\\" like voices in his head.\\"Here I go\\" Barrett waxes lyrical about a romantic,happy ending,with a happy tune disguising something scary beneath the surface like a darkness he neither knows nor cares about,warding it off with a jaunty,familiar air.     My favorite track \\"Octopus\\",a cornucopia of joy from a liberated,child-like soul, full of imagery of promise:\\"with a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds/clover honey potsand mystic shining feed..\\" I love his rendition of Joyce's \\"Golden Hair\\" with Barrett strumming mournfully against some soft cymbal work by session musicians.Two great souls united through a harmony of song.Sad and beautiful.The sad nostalgia of \\"Long Gone\\" combined with a visionary intensity:\\"I borrowed the page/ from a leopard's cage/and I prowled in the evening sun's glaze\\". With \\"She took a long cold look\\"a simple love song mutates into something much chillier.He is at the lowest ebb of his mental health on \\"Feel\\",almost mad,and \\"If it's in you\\",both harrowing examples of the misunderstood Barrett, teetering on the edge.The valedictory \\"Late Night\\",a beautifully rendered love song,gentle like sunshine through rain.Barrett never did anything to match this superb record,indelibly marked with his genius.As Pope once said:\\"Great wits to madness sure are near allied\\".However this record stands as a landmark of true creative promise.After this ,the stutter into vagrant silence,then the long walk home to his mother's house.
B00004XMTJ|2.0|I love cats, T.S. Eliot, Broadway musicals and a lot of Andrew Lloyd Weber's work.  So, I had great expectations for this, especially when someone told me recently how much she and her whole family adored it!  So...I wondered what was wrong with me when I just didn't get into it.  I kept thinking it would get better but finally I stopped trying.    I didn't see the original on stage so maybe that's the problem.  Here I'm just offering my opinion, for whatever it's worth.  I thought the concept was very clever---who would have thought to make a musical from Eliot's work?  Well, perhaps it there had been English subtitles so I could have read the words which were unintelligible to me I would have liked it better.    My main complaint was how visually unpleasant it was!  I just didn't find the sight of people dressed up as cats with hideous makeup very watchable.  I'm trying not to say hideous or grotesque....but that's how I saw them.  The costumes were ugly, the colors were ugly.  There was nothing warm or inviting  or beautiful about the whole thing.  The music didn't grab me either.  Maybe it got better later but I didn't want to bother sitting through any more of it to find out.
B000BNX4MC|4.0|Classic movie, well written and a fun distraction for most anyone young at heart (and a need or wish to skip school just once).
B003NX76BM|5.0|Nora Roberts has always written fantastic dogs into her stories and this book does not disappoint. Once again, the banter between the two main characters, Fiona & Simon is witty and engaging. Fiona reminds me of Eve Dallas from the In Death series. She's strong, determined, and has been through some pretty awful things in life. She refuses to be a victim, and instead puts her past trauma to work helping others. Sadly, Simon isn't like Roarke (but who is?) but he's funny and honest to a fault. MAddeningly honest, which is the cause of some pretty good scenes.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Fantastic movie, so much so, one might hope they will not make another (break the mold in other words).
6305313687|5.0|I have started watching this movie twice when shown on TV but had to leave for appointments so I could not watch the whole movie. The movie immediately grabbed my atttention so I eventually ordered the movie so I could watch the entire thing. I do now consider this a movie that is one on my top list to watch and own.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|no long review... GET THIS MOVIE. Beautiful and wonderful story telling.  Any movie that is not train or truck centric - that my 6 year old boy asks to watch on a regular basis - gets my big thumbs up!!!

Book is full of great experiment's that Dan has done to help you explain why we make Decisions..ect    2.Dan personal BIO is very interesting and funny at times.    3. Most of the info in the book can be easily EXECUTED in you daily life.      ( Have fun and read it! )
0307454541|2.0|This book is \\"just ok\\".  It could have been a 300 page book, it's choppy, and has hollow characters.  It is readable though, and you may find it a decent beach read.  If you are used to tight, well written, well characterized stories, you'll be disappointed.  Hey, it is what it is.  You were warned.<br /><br />I loved the \\"one star review\\" comparison to \\"The DaVinci Code\\" fans.  Very true.  If you love Dan Brown books, you'll likely love this one.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Like many reviewers I had about the same reactions to this album:<br /><br />First Listen: Dissapointed.  I don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it.  I really only heard the beats.<br />Second Listen: Wow, maybe I misjudged this.  He is rapping about some REALLY real stuff.  The words really starting to grab me.<br />Third Listen: Holy $&/# this is ridiculous.  He is a master of rhymes and his songs actually MEAN something again!<br /><br />I was a HUGE Eminem fan for his first 3 albums but then he drifted away from me for a long time.  I am going to disagree with others who say he is back.  THIS is a completely different rapper.  Imagine taking the Eminem you used to love and then supercharging him.  The lyrics are tight on nearly every song and his flow is near impeccable.  I am VERY impressed with almost every aspect of this album.  He now wields his rapping with supreme confidence and it shows.  He seems clear headed and focused, maybe more focused than he has ever been.  This is even more impressive when you consider he already sold more than 80 million albums and has no monetary/fame reason to cultivate this new focus.  Amazing job Mr. Mathers, I am a fan again.<br /><br />My top three, from 4 or 5 listens:<br /><br />1. You're Never Over<br />2. Space Bound<br />3. Not Afraid<br /><br />My least favorite (not to say they are bad) are Won't Back Down (ft. Pink) and W.T.P. although I haven't really listened to the lyrics as much in those so who knows.<br /><br />In closing, this album is well worth the money, which is not something you can say about most albums these days.  I personally feel its the best album he has made.  I think he is going to win awards for this one, but after hearing him on this I feel that for the first time in his career he could care less about that stuff.  This is refreshing and an awesome return for one of the best rappers of our time.
0060512806|4.0|No way around it; this book is huge.  Huge settings, huge numbers of characters, huge timelines, huge array of subjects.  I took nearly six weeks to turn the last page, but I was sad to see it end.      If there is something bad to say about Cryptonomicon, it is that it probably should have been broken up into volumes.  It is a similar experience to reading The Lord of the Rings in one of those single bound books.    That said, you can tell that Stephenson takes pleasure in building a story.  In this case four or five different stories.  Though all of them are related and all of them are good, I could have done without the more modern of the storylines.  I found myself hoping that I could get back to the WWII timeline and skip the more modern sections.  These tend to be the more \\"geeky\\" scenes in which the complex machinations of hacking and modern business are discussed.  This is simply a matter of preference because the more modern storyline can stand on its own and gives the book a kind of geek cred that would otherwise be absent and make it more common.    Stephenson constantly jumps forward in the stories that he tells with no warning.  Though this was aggravating at first, I ended up liking this type of storytelling because I always felt that he was doing his best to treat the reader as if they were intelligent rather than spoon-feeding them timelines.  He can be wordy at times, but his love for storytelling always comes through.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|I am a HUGE fantasy movie fan - so that being said, obviously I expect a bit of cheese.  It's just the genre.  But having read the books in this franchise, I was horrified by the movie to be honest.  I felt like so much of it was cut out that much of what made it a STORY was removed.  It's so.... fantasy cliche.  It is not original in its own way anymore, and that is a sad translation indeed.  I have a VERY open mind to fantasy films, and this one disappointed me.  I will not be purchasing it until - POSSIBLY - it comes out as a very cheap used DVD. Even then, I'm not completely sure if I will bother at all.  I only gave it two stars rather than one because I just like the genre a little bit no matter how bad the movie is, lol.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|Well, Ozzy sure makes for some spirited debate, doesn't he?<br /><br />To put my review in perspective: 30-year fan, first saw Ozzy live on the Madman tour with Randy.  Seen him live countless times (not ALL good shows) and in 1998 I drove 2800 miles to catch the Sabbath reunion tour kickoff.<br /><br />I bought this album 'cause it was (appropriately) on sale and I felt that overwhelming sense of nostalgia.  But, after the last two albums, I was SURE that it was going to suck; that it was going to be more \\"product\\".<br /><br />Well, \\"Scream\\" may be product but it does not suck.  It is quite catchy, heavy and at times felt almost organic.  Ozzy's best since the comparatively catchy/heavy \\"Ozzmosis\\".  This new one is tucked in the car's CD player where it will remain for the next several days/weeks as I continue to enjoy it (or at least until I acquire the latest Nevermore release).<br /><br />Ozzy's growl is infectious and makes this reviewer feel like a kid again.<br />I don't miss Zakk one bit.  The man never seemed to grasp the \\"less is more\\" approach that made Iommi/Ozzy such a perfect combo.<br /><br />I would love to see Ozzy perform these songs live but historically Ozzy only performs one or two tracks from the latest release while playing almost the entire \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Paranoid\\" albums!  Great albums, yes, but I've seen those songs performed too many times.  Vary the set-list, Ozz!<br /><br />Everyone has their own expectations of Ozzy so I completely understand the wide range of opinions.  Me?  I'm just a sentimental ol' metal-head who was very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />And remember, Ozzy loves us all.
0452295548|5.0|This is a book about a neuroanatomist who suffers a cerebral haemorrhage. Apart from the first three chapters, which explain to us in detail the structure of the brain, with its two halves, detail necessary for us to understand what happened to the author, the first part of the book reads like a thriller and is unputdownable.<br /><br />She, Jill, wakes up early one morning to a sharp pain behind her left eye. This is the beginning of a blow-by-blow account of her haemorrhage. This takes place in the left, logical, side of her brain. The account is fascinating, in that we experience Jill's gradual awareness of the fact that something absolutely serious is happening, something she realizes she will have to do something about, get help with, while at the same time she is more and more being drawn into the euphoria and now-consciousness of the right side of the brain. The left side was gradually filling up with blood and her ability to move, talk, and think logically, was disappearing. Part of her knew that she had to act quickly, but she was constantly distracted by the wondrous feeling of being one with the universe (not to mention by the splitting headache). It was a struggle to focus enough to find out what to do to get help, and how to do it. Who to call, what number to call, and how to call a number.<br /><br />Eventually of course, as we can figure out, she does manage to alert the world to her predicament. After a brain operation and aided by her loving mother and much sleep, she gradually returns to health, though it takes her eight years fully to regain her faculties. Of course she needs to learn how to walk, talk, read and understand numbers, the latter proving to be the most difficult.<br /><br />Now, I believe that everything happens for a reason. And Jill herself later realized how fortunate she was to have the whole experience, that enabled her to release a number of negative characteristics and create a new Jill with a new understanding of the fact that we are all connected to each other and to the universe: all we have to do to contact \\"Nirvana\\" is to quieten the left half of the brain.<br /><br />Owing to this personal experience of the very differing characteristics of the two sides of the brain, Jill obtains a new understanding of the field of her work, neuroanatomy.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important part of the book are the final chapters, where the author explains her new-found insights, how she can control her thoughts (not continue to dwell on negative ones) and return to the now. She can thereby choose to be loving and peaceful (as exemplified by her right brain) no matter the circumstances.<br /><br />She quotes a Dr. Jerry Jesseph as saying \\"Peace should be where we begin and not where we strive to get to.\\" (I read this book in translation, so the wording of the quote may not be exactly correct.) This is practically the same thing as I have recently read in a book by Thich Nhat Hanh. He quotes A. J. Muste as saying \\"There is no path to peace, peace is the path.\\" (Same comment as previously as regards wording.)<br /><br />Jill realizes that the way we think, what we say to ourselves, is decisive for our mental health. (Abraham, as revealed in the books of Esther and Jerry Hicks, goes much further and teaches us that the way we think is also decisive for our physical health, and in general for everything that happens to us in life.)<br /><br />Jill's stroke (of insight) is thus veritably life-changing and this book, in which she communicates her insights to us, offers us all a chance to change our lives correspondingly without we too having to suffer a stroke first.<br /><br />Deep inner peace is just a thought/feeling away. And peace is experienced in the now (again exactly as formulated by Thich Nhat Hanh).<br /><br />The book contains two useful appendices designed to help others in the same situation as she was. The first appendix comprises questions by which to assess the state of your brain (tohelp to alert you to the possible necessity of seeking immediate help). The second appendix contains forty pieces of advice to caregivers attending to those who have suffered a stroke or the like, advice about how most respectfully to treat the patient.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you all read this book. Not only will it be extremely useful to all those with relations who suffer something similar, but will also in general help every-one to lead their lives more successfully.nd appendix contains forty pieces of advice to caregivers attending to those who have suffered a stroke or the like, advice about how most respectfully to treat the patient.

B002N8A14M|5.0|I love this case for my nano - particularly because of the built in clip.  I clip it on my belt to listen while running, but also have the option to clip it to an armband which also works well.      The case is great protection for the nano - I don't feel the need to have a separate case to keep it in.  If there is any minor complaint is that with the case on, it won't always plug into iPod compatible devices (like external speakers and such) - in those cases I can slip the bottom half of the case off while it is plugged in.  I can plug it into my computer just fine in the case.

B000AYELVA|5.0|Awesome action scenes and storyline.  Another classic movie to throw in with the Spiderman, Batman, Superman series.  They really do a great job on recreating those comic book characters and making a movie out of it.  Get it you won't be dissapointed.  Some scenes are a bit for the mature audience, but so are some in Batman and Spiderman.  Very similar to those movies.
1423113381|5.0|The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan<br /><br />Carter and Sadie Kane are siblings that were separated six years prior to the beginning of the story, when their mother Ruby, died mysteriously at an explosion on Christmas Eve.  Carter has been living with his brilliant father, the Egyptologist Dr. Julius Kane, has been home schooled, and has lived out of a suitcase, traveling the globe.<br /><br />Sadie has been living in London with their maternal grandparents, who hate Julius, and blame him for Ruby’s death.  Sadie has, what Carter envies, a normal life, friends at school, and a place to call home.<br /><br />After six long years of living apart, the siblings have almost nothing in common until, on Christmas Eve, six years later; Julius takes both children to The British Museum, with a promise “to make things right.”  But as Carter and Sadie watch as their father summons a mysterious figure—who quickly banishes and causes a fiery explosion, sending Julius to a sarcophagus and certain death.&#60; They are rescued by Julius brother, Amos, who reveals to them that the gods of ancient Egypt are wakening, and the worst of them—Set—has a frightening scheme to destroy the world.<br /><br />To save their father, they embark on a dangerous and magical journey quest that brings them close to the truth about their family and its links to the Egyptian House of Life—a secret order that has existed since the beginning of time. Accompanied by different Egyptian gods, they travel the world trying to stop Set in his ambition of building a Red Temple in Camelback Mountain, Phoenix—and reignite the war between magicians from the House of Life, and Gods from ancient Egypt—and try to save the world and their parents all at the same time.<br /><br />Compared to the Percy Jackson series, the book is more mature, more complex and presents a much wider number of characters.  It is certainly for an older audience.  The writing is good, but it’s not an easy read.  I had to write a chart to keep up with all the different Egyptian Gods, pharaohs, and their history.te a chart to keep up with all the different Egyptian Gods, pharaohs, and their history.

B000NQRR1Q|3.0|In this film Johnny Depp plays an antique book dealer who is hired by a millionaire named Balkan to investigate two copies of a book on Satan. There are only three copies of this book in existence and Balkan has the third, which he loans to Depp in order to find out if any of the copies are fake.<br /><br />The movie starts out very promisingly, with a look at how the antique book business works and travel to Europe to look at the other copies and the interesting characters we see along the way. However, several murders happen along the way and I'm still not sure exactly who was supposed to be responsible, or indeed who the female \\"protector\\" of Depp is. The book started out very well but towards the end through in some gratuitous sex and a last-minute plot twist and just left a bunch of things unsaid. If the loose threads had been wrapped up before the final credits this could have easily been a 5-star film, since the acting and the cinematography were great, but I couldn't do it.
B003IWZ1D8|1.0|For the impulsive types who slavishlly defend censored product film companies happily spoon feed us, I'll clarify, my 1 star rating is for the blu ray edition, not the film its self.<br /><br />Now before the usual suspects leap upon here and defend the same old censored print, they need to ask themselves, would they do the same if Frankenstien's dvd were still missing the once censored dialogue etc?...<br /><br />For all the great stuff they've loaded onto this SE, it is still a missed opportunity. 18.36 seconds censored from a cinematic classic (which played in complete form on German TV a few years ago) is not good enough.

0142410705|4.0|Like Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska, An Abundance of Katherines is more than run-of-the-mill YA fluff. John Green excels at addressing themes of loneliness, identity, friendship, love and loss with a light touch, and An Abundance of Katherines does not disappoint here.     However, the book's levity, while often welcome, occasionally detracts from the potential emotional impact of the book and can be a tad grating. In this novel, one gets the sense that the balance of humor to seriousness, and fantasy to reality, is a bit off.     The premise definitely asks readers to suspend their disbelief: Colin, a geeky, socially awkward child prodigy on the wane, has miraculously had 19 girlfriends, all named Katherine, in his 19 years. After Katherine #19 dumps him, Colin's parents grant him permission to go on an aimless road trip from his Chicago home all the way to Tennessee, where a tough-taking but kind-hearted matriarch offers him a job on the spot (she just happens to have a charming, beautiful daughter Colin's age, too- although a Lindsey this time, not a Katherine).     Green knows how to brighten this plot with humor (largely in the form of Colin's best friend and road-trip accomplice, Hassan) as well as fill it in with deeper questions of identity and morality. But even though Green makes this a story worth reading, a story that draws the reader in and really makes one want the best for Colin, Lindsey and Hassan, some of the more egregious improbabilities of the plot are just too big to disguise. Foremost among these weaknesses is Colin's 19 Katherine streak, which is a tenuous premise to balance a whole book upon no matter how well Green glosses it. The novel is cute, clever and charming, to be sure, but leaves some lingering qualms unaddressed.

9889979942|5.0|I like this book. The pictures aren't meant to be National Geographic. They are meant to be \\"in the moment.\\" The author talks about this in his introduction. And it works. He isn't trying to convince you to love China or to hate it. He is just showing you what he sees.     This book comes with heart that many books of a similar nature miss because they are striving for perfection. When you study a foreign culture, you don't have the luxury of perfect. You only have the stunning beauty of being there in that moment. And you live and love and take pictures. Think of this as someone's summer vacation (but it is so much more) where they want you to look at their pictures of this amazing trip they took. The photos speak for the author.    Sometimes they are not as crisp as a perfectionist might desire, but I guarantee you will be pulled in to this book. How can you escape the intensity of the direct gaze of such a multi-cultural people? Dive into China through the lens of a guy with a camera and a backpack. Experience a different way of living with few words. Imagine yourself there with a limited grasp of the language but a love of humanity.    Then, I think, you may just grasp the true wonder of this amazing book by Tom Carter.

I'm not a runner by any stretch of the imagination but I whipped through this book so fast I could hardly believe it.  The author's pace and voice are entertaining and fast paced, the story lines are great and the content is absolutely fascinating from both an athletic and an anthropological stand point.  I loved it so much I went out and bought it so I could re-read it and lend it out.  It's inspired me to run more and run better.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Good quality DVD.  Purchased as a gift for a die-hard John Wayne fan.  Thank goodness I read a Review that suggested only purchasing authentic collectors edition DVD
B001GCUO5M|2.0|IMHO, when a movie resorts to the cheap scare - people jumping out, accompanied by loud blasts of discordant music - it's time to move on to something more productive.  This amateurish conceit must have been used half a dozen times in Shutter Island.  One would expect better from Scorsese.  The good acting and gothic sensibilities of the movie were weighed down by plot holes and a &#34;surprise&#34; ending you could see coming long before it arrived.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|Positives:   They employed more visual arts personnel than actors. Downside - graphics, although good, were largely stolen from 5th grade Greek mythology story books.   Negatives:  (1.) Whenever a film relies upon darkness to convey darkness I know immediately - cheap film. This one is so dark that when I turn the brightness to the highest level - it's still black. In effect you see nothing! So what's the point of creating a monster if you can't see it?   (2.) It takes a creative mind to write/direct creative & plausible fantasy. It takes a \\"short-cuts\\" mind to write/direct ridiculous fantasy. This movie would have fit perfectly into a Disney, Hannah Montana dream episode.   (3.) It takes no mind to utilize the following formulae to sell to the 9-16 year old demographic: Scenes with a dysfunctional family; defiant teen; a black, an attractive female, good looking male (the typical triumvirate with minimal acting skills) and a fourth nerdy-techy providing backup. Lots of close ups of aforementioned male & female teens checking each other out to provide filler and sell the sex-appeal.   (4.) Dialogue utilized the minimalist quickie dictionary of the 100 most frequent words in a 9 year old's vocablulary. Further degraded into contrived and artificial cliches such as Percy's first & primary question to Hades on learning his mom might be dead in his domain, \\"What have you done with my mother?\\" - Ughhh  (5.) The camp for demigods looked more like a Boy Scout's summer camp with playground equipment added in. The fight scenes, with obviously plastic swords, looked so staged I was waiting for the director to yell \\"action\\" or whatever and suddenly every evenly spaced/paired group starts swinging their swords about. And why swords? Hello, 21st century teens that are half gods and do have some god-powers and besides there is technology such as what's found in any gun shop.   (6.) Music consists of,  let's see what we can find cheaply in the library that fits the scene, like AC/DC's \\"Highway to ...\\"; a country song for traveling to Nashville; an Elvis for Las Vegas; a Gaga for Hollywood.

B0000062FL|5.0|Along with 'Band of Gypsies', 'Focus 3', 'Cheap Thrills', 'Live at Budokan' (Dylan), 'Sticky fingers', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Stop making sense', 'Dark side of the moon' and ISB's 'Earthspan', this masterpiece - Santana's 'Abraxas' - has got to be one of the 10 definitive albums of the golden era of rock and beyond.<br /><br />From the first note to the very last it is exciting, unique, exotic, captivating, exhausting and unparalleled - even by Santana themselves. Whatever else they did may be good, but pales into insignificance relative to 'Abraxas'. If you can listen to the cover version of Tito Puento's 'Oye Como Va' on Abraxas without standing up to sway and jive to the rhythm, then you need neurological surgery, and psychiatric and psychological assistance.<br /><br />Then there is the cover of all record covers - ! - to match the almost shocking excellence of the music. This album (along with a magnificent live performance at the '69 Woodstock festival) rocketed Santana from relative obscurity to the constellation of the shining ones like Miles Davis almost overnight, and quite rightly so. Get this now or you'll surely live to regret it.
B002SG8A56|5.0|My girlfriend and i started watching this show a couple weeks ago and LOVED it.  Jemaine and Bret are so funny.  A few tv shows that i believe are hilarious is How I Met Your Mother, Chuck, The Office.  Im not saying that they have similar types of humor, but if you like these shows you will probably like FoTC.  They sing songs about there lives and its very catchy and humorous (deadly combination).  I was just in the market for both of these season so i was browsing around a few days earlier and stumbled up this from slickdeals. This is a great vaule for a great show

Even the minor character's are well done, although it seemed to me that Nelson, who plays the father in this film, did not have his heart in it- maybe because his character was so one sided.

B001PPLIEG|1.0|Perhaps it's a little fitting that MGM went belly-up recently as their most important property is clearly being treated like so much rubbish.<br /><br />A long time ago...on an island far far away...existed a series of movies about a Secret Agent named James Bond. They were intelligent, exciting and quite ethereal experiences for all of us old enough to remember the theater back in the day when Hollywood still produced heroes.<br /><br />Somehow, the formula was able to subsume and highlight all that was good about being a heroic man - yes, the Alpha Male was still loved and cared for, particularly if he spoke English properly. Political fascists were clearly the enemy, whether they were Nazis, Communists or 3rd world dictators. The Bond women were unknowns and mind blowingly beautiful, classy and dignified. And more often than not, it was the velvet and translucent voice of Shirley Bassey that would once again welcome us to this world where a man's dreams were real.<br /><br />While Sean Connery was Bond, Moore brought a slick, sly and witty sensibility that also worked. And so the mythos was established. Real men wore plaid, drank martinis and kindly softened the blow of death by sending the bad guys to their end with intelligent sarcasm.<br /><br />Then somewhere along the line, political correctness, nihilism, anti-Americanism, man-hatred, anti-capitalism, anti-British(ism?) mixed with a mindless worship of...mindlessness (violence and otherwise), took hold. It turned our world and economies into a faint echo of their former selves. And it turned this franchise from what young men aspired to be...to a long running joke of a videogame without a controller or stop button. And oh yes, the movie posters suck too.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace is likely the greatest culmination of all of this senseless idiocy that bears a shade of a spec of a remembrance, to what Ian Fleming and the Brocolis created.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan could have both been masterful Bonds. Brosnan demonstrated that when he actually played James Bond in The Thomas Crown Affair. Instead, the suspension of disbelief in flushed down the toilet and we end up with storylines where the evil-Western-Corporation-Media-Monster is once again going to get us all. Oh yes. Nike is the enemy. Sadly, they don't check us at the airport looking for American media terrorists or Running Shoe operatives but who cares about the truth when you can sell people bs that they are hungry to buy.<br /><br />Maybe I'm wrong, but nothing would make me happier than seeing Daniel Craig light up a cigarette - a real one - drive while drinking a martini, smack a girls ass and kill one of those nasty middle eastern terrorists that would like to blow all of us up for having the audacity to state that 2 plus 2 is still bloody 4.<br /><br />Something is wrong with a world where you can't say \\"terrorist\\" on the BBC for fear of offending the um... terrorist. And something is even more wrong with a James Bond that dances on the strings of mental infants that don't need, believe or understand the heroic spirit of man.<br /><br />I await you James Bond, to return to us. Perhaps Sony will buy you up lock stock and barrel. The Japanese aren't scared of heroes. Never have been. What the hell happened to the rest of us?<br /><br />In the meantime, check out Sandbaggers and Callan, both on DVD.ul Bonds.

B002Y4Z4UQ|5.0|I am the only one who sees fit to give this a 5 star review? Ummm, I hate to break it to you but this album rocks. Their versions of \\"You Need Love Like I Do\\" and \\"Reflections\\" are brilliant. The title track is short and sweet and funky as all get out. Now I do think that \\"Hum Along and Dance\\" goes on a bit too long, and is sort of pointless. Not sure why we need close to 9 minutes of this, but it's not a bad song. Same goes for \\"Mama Got A Brand New Thing\\" but I think that's the better of the two. The two slower numbers  \\"Don't Say Goodbye Again\\" and \\"It's Too Late to Change the Time\\" fit nicely into the mix. And then there's \\"Dancing Machine\\". Well that song just makes this white boy want to dance all night. Oh and the original album artwork was cool back in the day of vinyl records.

Have had to purchase 4 dvds because friends want to buy my copy off of me.

In addition some are saying they are allergic to the gmo wrapping on seeds, not the gluten.

The Legendary Roots Crew take an introspective journey from \\"tragedy to triumph\\" as Black Thought proclaims on \\"The Fire.\\"  The album starts out with Truck North declaring \\"trapped!\\" and progresses from that moment toward the hope of \\"getting over.\\"      Beats are heavy at times and trippy at other times.  Always organic.  This is definitely in the top 10 Roots albums ;)

They have nothing of importance to say except to try to resurrect everything that Milton Friedman preached .

Total cost of military , (including  VA , interest on military debt) is $1.4 trillion a year   Shouldn't this have been mentioned in a book on  our debt crisis ?  One suspects a right wing agenda .
B001D52XO2|5.0|The set of TO BE FREE: THE NINA SIMONE STORY is the perfect box set for those interested in getting to know this wonderful singing legend. It encompasses Simone's singing career from 1957 - 1993, '93 being the last time she recorded professionally, and gathers recordings that were done for different record labels and puts it all on three CDs.<br /><br />If that weren't enough this set also includes one DVD that shows Simone being interviewed and performing in the recording studio and at cabarets and concert halls. Even though this documentary is short, running about 26-minutes, it's more than enough time to get a feel of the person behind the legend. I've read that she was bi-polar and it's clear that something is a little off in her demeanor in this doc, but the power and intensity really comes through. Like all geniuses, Simone comes off as a little eccentric, but very cool and highly intelligent! She seemed like someone who would've been great to hang out with. The picture quality is clear but it's obvious that this was filmed in 1969-70.<br /><br />This set also comes with a booklet that's attached to the CD package that includes bio information by Ed Ward and liner notes from the CD set producer Richard Seidel. And there's detailed information written for each track included on this set, as well as photographs.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent with no discernible difference between tracks recorded in the 50s to the 90s, including the \\"live\\" performances peppered throughout this collection.<br /><br />I'm new to the music of Nina Simone and this collection has more than brought me up to speed. In fact, this collection has such a variety of songs and styles from her body of work that it'll probably be the only one you'll need unless you're a hardcore fan and/or completist. I definitely recommend TO BE FREE.<br /><br />Simone may not have possessed the most gifted singing voice in the business, but she worked that voice like warm molasses -- whispering, screaming, talking, singing or shouting -- until it covered your senses and made you feel something. Perhaps that's why her work has endured.ng -- until it covered your senses and made you feel something. Perhaps that's why her work has endured.

It made me open my eyes to the abusive relationship I was in and that I needed to find my true self, if not for me then for my 2 daughters. I now am a 28 year old divorced single mother of 2, a college student with a full time job and 3 days after finishing this book said I have had enough  and left my boyfriend of 3 years. I just want to thank Elizabeth for having the courage to write her pain out so others could read and relate, I now know I can do it alone and dont have to spend my nights in a river of tears on my bathroom floor.

0307387178|5.0|The movie was excellent and made me want to read the book to find out more details on Chris Macandless's journey and some of his entries in his journal. I am loveing the book because the author presents information about Chris and others who are inspired to minimalize thier existance and live more naturally without labeling or creating a martar of the person. Love all the facts and insight from other individuals in past who have a similar story.   Author does a great job getting his opinion across without trying to sway the reader to think one way or another. Thought the book might be to dark and sad because of excerpts from Chris and others personal Journals but it was not and was very interesting and made me want to know more of why and what was the emotion behind many of the decisions Chris had made. Excellent read and better than the movie!!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|There are plenty of substantive reviews of this book, and I agree with most of the positive ones.  But as a Kindle user who reads a lot of fantasy, once again, the publisher has utterly failed to include usable maps in the Kindle editions of Song of Ice and Fire.  You can see the landmasses, but good luck trying to read any of the labels.  Simply including scans isn't enough -- when scaled down for the 6\\" Kindle, they are useless.  Publishers need to break the maps up -- if each map had been broken into two, it would be fine.<br /><br />Fortunately, the Internet can help.  [...] has a number of good maps you can use online or download -- search the Citadel's gallery area for maps and you'll find what you need.
B001HN694K|4.0|First, this movie was not to supposed to be the original story of Alice in Wonderland or through the looking, nor was is supposed to the movie adaptation of the cartoon.  The movie is set with an adult Alice who returns to Wonderland.  It has elements from both book in it.  In teh books Alice is seven when she goes to wonderland the first time and I think she is eight or nine in \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\"    I found it entertaining, as it tried to give more depth to some of the characters in the books.  They do not mention Alice's second visit to wonderland any where in the movie, though there were elements of the second book in the movie.
B0007R4TAS|4.0|It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past. And while there have been lots of movie and TV adaptations, one of the absolute best is the 1970 TV movie starring Susannah York and George C Scott. \\"Jane Eyre\\" spends too long on Jane's school days (and not quite enough on the Thornfield days), but the two lead actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles.<br /><br />Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected at a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone push her down -- and many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele. Then she encounters her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield.<br /><br />They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat. But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- injuries, fires, and a mysterious \\"danger.\\" Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the 1970 adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\" is that it spends too long at Jane's rotten school, and not quite enough time at Thornfield -- it could have benefited from another half an hour to flesh things out slightly, and include a few more important scenes that the TV movie didn't have (like the gypsy fortuneteller). So it's a credit to everything ELSE in this movie that it's still very good.<br /><br />Director Delbert Mann does an excellent job here, smoothly gliding through the three phases of Jane's life, slowly building up the gothic feel of the movie until Rochester's secret is revealed. And he weaves in some truly brilliant, intense scenes, such as when Rochester wakes to find Jane missing, and races around Thornfield searching for her, or when Jane joyously rejects the fanatical advances of the self-righteous St. John (\\"You cannot love just God alone!\\").<br /><br />But the best part is York and Scott, who have electric chemistry. York gives the role the passionate, rebellious undercurrent that you'd expect from Jane Eyre, and she's more striking than conventionally pretty. Scott seems a bit too gritty at first (breaking stuff?), but he soon turns on the passionate, embittered aspect of Rochester -- especially when the truth about Bertha comes out, and he sits sadly in her tower cell murmuring softly to the madwoman.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre\\" is definitely one of the better adaptations of Bronte's classic gothic romance -- it's a bit too short, but the performances are absolutely awe-inspiring.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Well, I did it.  I figured when this full-series box set arrived, I would watch a few episodes now and then, maybe check out the extras.  I enjoyed \\"Daria\\" when it first aired, enough so that I made the investment in the DVD's.  And then I started watching.  Two weeks later, I've viewed every single episode from every season, and every second of every extra--and I loved every moment.  The show is even better than I remembered, definitely funnier than I remembered, and infinitely more touching.  I'm astonished at how something so determined to be dry could end up wringing tears out of me, but I swear a few of these episodes did it.      All right, enough sop.  The bottom line: if you have the least inclination to purchase this box set, I'd encourage you to go for it.  I think it's worth every penny.  The animation looks more crisp, clear and colorful than ever.  (Granted, I watched these discs on a blu-ray player, but even still...)  The extras are plentiful and terrific.  And of course, the episodes themselves--the characters, the writing, the animation and the delivery of every actor involved--are among the best and smartest to ever come across the small screen.  Special recommendation here if there's an adolescent in your life who's brainy and maybe a bit of an outcast.  She or He will find a kindred spirit in Daria Morgendorffer.  I'm glad I met her all those years ago, and I'm very glad I bought this DVD set.
B003HE2B6C|4.0|For their last few albums, Hanson has been more serious and introspective, as if they wanted to prove to the world they wanted to be taken seriously.  So what a surprise that their latest album SHOUT IT OUT is their most carefree and joyful album since their early MMMbop days.  But boy, have these guys matured over the years.    Shout it Out is a very R&B and soul infused album.  There is a lot of brass in the arrangements and plenty of dance rhythms.  A few songs like the gospel tinged Carry You There and the introspective, effects laden Use Me Up remind one of Hanson's more recent efforts.  But there is no denying the endlessly hummable opener Waiting for You, the quite danceable And I Waited, or the singalong quality of Make it Out Alive.       Hanson continues to evolve, with their songwriting skills improving with each album and their singing/instrumental playing as good as ever.  As usual for Hanson, the second half of the CD is not nearly as strong as the first half, but it still beats way too many albums released so far this year.

1584282584|4.0|I purchased this book to compliment other references I have on flash photography. Hesitant that some of the information may be redundant, I was pleased with the information this book contained.

B0000041Q3|3.0|Yes, this is the \\"best\\" recording of Turandot in terms of technical quality and production values.  Nobody on it is truly awful, as is the case with at least one, or more, participants on all other commercial recordings of the opera without exception.  Here, for example, we have the John Alldis Chorus, doing much more justice to the only opera by Puccini in which the chorus plays an important role, than the choruses on any other recordings except the 1955 Decca/Erede and the 1981 DG/Karajan.  Sutherland here is surprisingly convincing, given that all too often before she had been indistinct in both her characterizations and in her pronunciation of words (in whatever language she was singing).  She isn't quite Nilsson, but she's better than Nilsson in the evenness of her low, middle, and top registers.  And I think Caballe is the best Liu ever, vocally and dramatically.  All that said, I remember that when I first heard this recording c.1980 on LP I was quite disappointed with it, and remain so now that I have it on CD.  The \\"spectacular\\" moments mostly come off quite well, but little else does, to my mind.  It's a slick, superficial performance of the opera, in my opinion.  Paramount in my disappointment was the relatively thin, colorless voice of Pavarotti in comparison with Jussi Bjorling, who managed far more with the role in a recording of less \\"spectacular\\" sound-quality than this.  Pavarotti also annoys me on this recording by his showing-off, holding his highest notes as long as possible (in brief duet with Sutherland holding the final Ab several beats longer than she does; Corelli would have bitten her for that, according to at least one story).  I'm quite aware that Pavarotti's most popular individual track is \\"Nessun Dorma\\" excerpted from this recording (usually with a concert ending added later), but to my mind one hasn't heard this aria with the utmost expression until one has heard Bjorling sing it, either from the complete RCA recording or, even better, from a mono recording he made about a decade earlier in Sweden, still available today on EMI.  But the 1959 RCA recording with all its faults, most especially the inferior orchestra and chorus, remains for me the most compelling recording of this opera.    Despite this, I continue to sigh for the fact that Franco Alfano's original ending for this opera, left incomplete at Puccini's death, has yet to this day not been recorded, except by itself for Decca in 1990, a disc sadly not available on US Amazon but only on UK Amazon.  The truncated second version that he produced at the insistence of Toscanini, the conductor of the world premier in 1926 (and the *only* version ever presented on any complete recording of this opera) is vastly anticlimactic and inferior, not just according to me, but according to no less than Mosco Carner, one of the foremost Puccini scholars.  The original ending composed by Alfano is c.5 minutes longer, and not only contains music which does not appear in the more familiar, shorter version, but also contains passages which are substantially different from what we almost always hear in this opera, in live and/or recorded performances.  Not only is his first version of greater substance (including his only setting of the words of Turandot which are absent from the second version, in which she shows far more spirit than in the second version, making it obvious that this is no mere capitulation to Calaf as is almost always the case, but instead more complex enlightenment, which might lead to a more successful marriage between these two fabled characters), but Alfano in his first version only makes a good deal more of the melodies, motives, and themes from the bulk of the opera that Puccini completed.  Even the kiss itself, abrupt, brief, and woefully unconvincing in Alfano's familiar second version, is in his first version far longer and far more complex and ambiguous in its portrayal by the orchestra alone.  The only positive thing that I cansay about Alfano's second version is that is is somewhat more stylistically similar to the music that Puccini completed for the bulk of the opera than Alfano's first version (at least one passage of which reminds me more of Janacek than Puccini); but Puccini himself is on record as stating that he wanted to compose music for this opera that was somehow different from all previous music that he had composed.  To some extent he already achieved that in his completion of the opera up to the final third of Act III, but I wonder if his spirit would be all that displeased with Alfano's initial attempt to complete the opera.    I have little doubt that he'd be excessively displeased at the second attempt, even if the second effort sounded a bit more like the rest of his opera than the first attempt.  Puccini almost certainly would have found the second version to be dramatically inviable, at the very least, given how even in the most unconvincing of his dramatic climaxes in all his operas (some say this occurs in Suor Angelica) he could still manage to deliver, in at least a basic visceral sense, the climactic dramatic/musical point of an opera.  Had he lived to complete Turandot, the final climax might have been no better than in Alfano's first version.    But I have little doubt that no matter what it sounded like, it would have still been tremendously better than Alfano's second version, even if it still had to some extent been an inadequate climax and resolution.  Even at his worst as a composer, Puccini knew how to compose at least a marginally-effective climax to an opera far better than Toscanini, and I'm thinking that even Franco Alfano knew better than Toscanini.  It is a shame that Toscanini did not leave well enough alone, as in, as \\"bad\\" as he thought it was, leave Alfano's first version intact, so that it would be subsequently be the standard published and recorded ending.
B003B02PF4|3.0|Overall good read- great explosive start that made me read the first 120 pages in a single reading (normally I'm a very slow reader). Enjoyed getting to know the characters, enjoyed the various plots developing and the continued change of pace, scenery, etc., but slightly disappointed at the cut-off ending- made me wonder about the fate of a couple of the other characters, so unless they're in one of Grisham's other novels- we'll never know what happened to them.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|the casting was superb !!!!!!!!  each of the actors personified the people they portrayed-not just as historical figures but as real vital people.  james purefoy(spelling?)  as marc antony was outstanding-from soldier to political hack to cleopatra's dissolute boy toy-his was a gem of a performance-  the character of atia --mother to octavian/augustus- was just incandescent -she reminded me of the role of livia in \\"I Claudius\\" -a harpy one has to love.  the arc of development for augustus was brilliant as was the eerily handsome actor who portrayed him.  augustus --by all accounts-- bided his time and struck like an asp at those who killed his adoptive father and great uncle-julius caesar-  and took the romans from backwater to empire-well played!!!-  the sets were briiliant -  direction was subtle and apt-  in all its aspects a great adventure-it brought home the feel of the era-transporting you there  just superb!!  gerrf
B002RAREAK|5.0|oh em gee!  Like I luv this album so much!  I played it so many times that wore out my vinyl.  Usher and Bieber are the bomb.  I luv internet privacy too.
B003BKF696|4.0|This album has some really beautiful songs on it--in particular Conversation 16 and Bloodbuzz Ohio. It is more mellow than The National's previous albums, lacking the occasional faster songs on Alligator and Boxer(Able, Mistaken for Strangers), but it is very musically solid and interesting. However, as is the case with this, and most, bands, there are a few songs I just can't bring myself to want to listen to ever (Afraid of Everyone, Anyone's Ghost). That being said, the good songs and musical effort put into this album make it worth it for sure.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|no complainants what so ever and i also got a poster in the vinyl which was a surprise to me
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is the best it is my second one. It stays on my head and in my ears. I can't use anyother headset when I workout.
B003GDYN24|5.0|I love this new direction Kelis has taken with Flesh Tone. If you like Dance music then this album is for you. Fresh funky dance beats that will have you dancing from beginning to end. She worked with the best producers of Dance music from Ammo, Jean Baptiste, Benny Benassi, Burns, Diplo, Boys Noize, Free School, DJ Switch, Will.i.am and David Guetta. Flesh Tone can be described as a pop album but adopts electro pop, synthpop, house and dancehall elements to form a \\"euphoric dance album\\" which tributes the birth of Kelis' son. .. buy it!
B0036EH3U2|4.0|The one big thing about this Blu-ray series \\"you'll hate the grain\\".  Mr. Moore mustn't do any previews of the shot footage because some senses are so grainy with noise you can almost not make out what's being shot. In some ways it looks amateur...grainy one sense and clean the next, it goes back and forth like that all through the series.<br /><br />This Battlestar Galactica series is the best scifi you can buy. I recommend buying it.
B003D8KH9A|4.0|Definitely a must have item to keep your pool water cleaner.  I would have given this product 5 stars if it weren't for the cost.  The cover costs just as much as the pool itself...why???
0307454541|4.0|It's a good book, sometimes get boring in the first chapters, but i think it's a good one
B000A6EXNO|2.0|I bought this eyecup to attach to the back of the magnifying eyepiece I bought for my Nikon D2X.    The construction of the eyecup is OK, but the way it attaches is NOT good.  It won't stay on and keeps slipping off.  Now maybe I haven't attached it properly, but it should not be designed so it's difficult to attach anyway.  It's functionality needs work.    My dissatisfaction with the eyecup has nothing whatsoever to do with Adorama, who I have been dealing with now for over 5 years.  I have found them to be one of the best, if not the best, photography equipment houses in the USA.  Their prices are reasonable, their return policy is good, and returns are handled quickly and efficiently.   Great company!!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Having been a Cyndi fan ever since Girls just wanna have fun hit the airways I have been waiting for this cd for months on end.  From the first note to the last this entire album is amazing. Cyndi's vocals are out of this world. It should not stun anyone who truly listens to this album with their heart and soul that it is climbing the charts. It was no1 in the billboard blues charts.  If you do not buy this cd you are truly missing out on a priceless gem.
0739384155|4.0|It was a little difficult to get into the book but once I got about half way through I enjoyed it.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|A real nice follow up to the earlier \\"Old Mans War\\" which I highly recommend for its originality and interesting characters.
073937771X|5.0|I am reading the final in the trilogy and I am enjoying it alot. I am having trouble getting my every day work done because I can't put it down. Can not wait to find out what happens.
B003L16FAE|1.0|This 2010 release of Predator was one of my most anticipated Blu-Ray releases. And at first glance, it looked like it might be a winner. But alas--only a few minutes into the feature and it becomes painstakingly obvious that the people responsible for the technical aspects of the encode went *completely* overboard with their desire to apply DNR to the feature in order to artificially 'clean up' image noise and grain, while at the same time severely reducing the amount of detail in each frame and making the overall result look like it has been put through a meat-grinder (to use a phrase from the film itself) ;)<br /><br />As stated on various forums and in other reviews, this practice is bound to be controversial, as some actually mistake this as being 'sharper' and more 'HD-like' (often when viewing on an 40-50 inch LCD sitting 3-4 meters back). But let me assure you; it *is not*. Compare it to older releases which were done _properly_ (like North By Northwest, Dr. No) and John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China (released around the same time as McTiernan's Predator), and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />All evidence that this movie has actually been shot on film is gone. It now resembles more an FPS game with waxy, unrealistic characters (just look at Carl Weathers' mustache!)<br /><br />In short, this release is a complete travesty and an affront to the Blu-Ray format. FOX's customers deserve _a lot_ better than this. Liberally applying Digital Noise Reduction is an extremely quick'n'dirty way to 'spruce up' (in some people's eyes) a picture. Had it been properly re-mastered from a better print than the previous Blu-Ray version, and encoded using a _proper codec_; eliminating the digital artifacts which came as a result of the old MPEG2 encode, the end result would have been so much better.<br /><br />Too bad a great movie such as this had to be returned to Amazon. But I for one will not stand for this at all.
0440241901|2.0|I guess I had super high hopes about this book because of the plethora of rave reviews...however, the book did not live up to its reviews.  Honestly, the book had a cute plot, yet it could have been told in 200 pages not nearing 400.  I felt some parts of the book just dragged! Needless to say I was happy when it was over.
0061673730|4.0|Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a great read. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a non-fiction philosophical novel.<br />Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is an autobiography, allowing Pirsig to narrate his own life experiences.  Along with sharing his motorcycle trip with his son Chris and some friends, he mainly focuses on what quality is. What is quality and how do you define it? He believes that it doesn't exist. In this certain area of the book it is harder to comprehend, but he does prove a good point that I agree with. He goes into great detail explaining his belief that quality is something made up, and he actually gets pretty emotional about it as he struggles to find the truth. On top of all of this, Robert Pirsig is schizophrenic, dealing with his battling alternate personality, Phaedrus.<br />Some weaknesses I found include going into too much detail about some ideas; they seemed unnecessary. He drifted into too much detail about some philosophical ideas and terms that the reader wouldn't be prepared for and didn't explain them well enough. Also, at the end of the book, his Phaedrus personality actually takes over; however, throughout the book he reflects back on how he was a student in India and his experience there, but that was his alternate personality. Since he went through electroshock therapy, there is no way he could have remembered any experiences Phaedrus went through.<br />Though he couldn't have remembered these things as Phaedrus, Pirsig does do a good job at helping the reader understand what he's going through as he battles his alternate personality.  As mentioned before, he reflects on his experiences in India and has multiple dreams about those experiences. Though he wants to deny it, his son Chris also struggles as he tries to figure out if there is something wrong with his dad; asking questions and reflecting on good times in the past with his father makes his dad realize that it was Phaedrus that experienced those good times. Along with this, the reader is able to understand how Chris feels about the whole situation: he wants his dad back, you know, the dad that he has great times with and loves so much . . . Phaedrus.<br />This book really makes the reader think about how to find truth and if quality actually exists. It also lets the reader take an adventure inside the narrator's mind as he battles against his schizophrenia disease. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to think. As Pirsig himself writes, \\"The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there\\".
B003A4IFGY|4.0|I enjoyed this album very much, I wasn't crazy about the first song which is okay but the rest is good. I recommend it to everyone.
B003K025V4|5.0|I would like for people to understand that Miley has to grow up one day just like the rest of us. She does not want to sing pop bubble gum songs forever. Okay, our children enjoyed Hannah Montana now lets put her to rest. I hate how people judge this album and that is why the CANT BE TAMED message is for you. Leave her alone and let her move into her next stage. First Brittany now Miley. Who's next Justin Bieber leave her alone!!! The album is great
B003A4IFGY|4.0|Anybody who has been to a laid back jam in the basement of good musicians know it's not filled with loud or pop music, but music that flows gently and smoothly. Petty & the Heartbreaks have written mostly simple tunes based on blues riffs and perform them as if they are enjoying a good time. It's a warm and inviting performance, even if the songs at times are a bit too simple. This isn't pop music or even rock and roll that so many expect from Petty, but it has the sound of timeless music that will never get old. \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" and \\"Candy\\" already are favorites of mine.  I guess based on other reviews this isn't for people who expect an artist to be one dimensional, but I suggest people get rid of the notion of what the Heartbreakers are and sit down, relax, and listen to Mojo - they got it working.
B001AQT0OU|5.0|Other than 2001, if there was ever a Kubrick film that demanded a Blu-Ray release, this one is it. Can't come soon enough....
1453605738|5.0|I didn't buy my copy through Amazon because it was an impulse purchase and I am so glad it was.  It is unfortuante I waited until my 30s to read it.  A true classic I'll never tire of reading again and again!
1439165645|4.0|This book combined two of my likes - food and reading about India. The style of writing was somewhat old fashioned. Overall it was enjoyable.
1435106342|5.0|I have not been able to read all of the material yet, but I find his works mysterious and chilling. The book was delivered in a timely matter. The product was exceptional.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|Kylie's 11th studio album proves to be amongst one of her best albums ever. The style of Aphrodite is fresh, the production is remarkable, and the atmosphere to the songs are all very powerful. Every song is packed full of energy and creativity.    Best songs: All The Lovers, Everything Is Beautiful, Better Than Today, Too Much    A++++!!!!!
B00104W8T6|5.0|this soundtrack offers the same youthful angst that the movie conjures. the mix is eclectic...and features the charming kimya dawson.
B001G8NW6Y|5.0|This is an excellent book that refutes so many misconstrued theories that are floating out there.  I wish they required all highschool students to read this as this one book would serve them many times better than disecting a frog.  Once you read this you will never look at the world and hear a news report on the economy the same.
B001DUJNGS|4.0|I have held Enigma in the highest regard since the very first release in 1991, and this music has become what I consider to be a soundtrack to my life. It means that much to me. However, I must say that after Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!,  the music had changed so much that it lost the essence of what it once was. The Screen Behind the Mirror was, to me, the beginning of Enigma slipping away. This collection has a few good tracks, but it was apparent to that the project was headed off course. I half-heartedly purchased Voyageur and A Posteriori even though I could tell from samples that they lacked all the earlier Enigma embodied, and they most certainly do. I waited quite a while after the release to begrudgingly purchase Seven Lives, but this collection has really surprised me. Here, MC seems to have re-captured the original magic. Most of the tracks have real feeling, emotion and purpose again. This disc has really grown on me. For fans of the first three discs who may have parted ways with Enigma since (as I sort of did), I see Seven Lives as MC meeting us halfway, and it works for me.
