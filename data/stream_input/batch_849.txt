B001EYGOG0|5.0|We added Tony Bennett's holiday record to our collection this year, and it moved some other classics aside.  We enjoyed if for the whole season, and decided it would make a nice stocking stuffer to several relatives besides.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend!
B000I2J6K0|4.0|This DVD is a great supplement to walking or whatever else you might do to stay fit during pregnancy.  There is a warm up, some dynamic movement (squats, lunges), some floor work, and a cool down.  Erin has a relaxing, calming influence, which I enjoy.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that I expected to sweat more and to have more aerobics in it.  If you have done aerobics for a while, even in your past, you shouldn't have trouble following the moves.  I definitely feel stronger since starting this (I'm currently almost 21 weeks along).  Sometimes my legs and butt are a little sore, so I know it's working!  Definitely a good choice for an at home workout.  Also, comes with a Post-Natal DVD that I'm looking forward to!  Haven't tried the partner workout.
0743455967|4.0|First, I am not a fan of Stephen King. I dislike his vulgarity. Like rampant mistletoe, it chokes out the story with dead wood. Second, I recognize his talent as an author, which I why I bought the book. He has something to teach me, and I want to learn.<br /><br />This book begins with a quick autobiography, from his birth to publishing \\"[[ASIN:0451157443 Carrie (Signet)]].\\" Next is King's philosophy of writing--Mental Telepathy. The third section is the analogy of the toolbox, with the fourth being an expanded description of the nuts and bolts of writing.<br /><br />King's 1999 accident occurred during the writing of this book. In the last section \\"On Living,\\" he discusses at length how the accident impacted his writing, his impact with the van, and how you still need to write, regardless of how the pain impacts you.<br /><br />Compared to other craft books it has an odd organization. But as you read, it flows.<br /><br />Some of his pointers include:<br /><br />1. \\"Take out the boring parts.\\" (47) He compares writing a story as uncovering a fossil (160). You have the story there, and slowly chip away the bad.<br /><br />(\\"Omit needless words\\" [[ASIN:0205313426 The Elements of Style (4th Edition)]])<br /><br />Not only does he tell, but he also shows how this works. He includes an early draft of \\"[[ASIN:B000TJ6PBK 1408 (Widescreen Edition)]],\\" then has the same draft with the chicken-scratch corrections. This is quite a find, and is exactly what a budding author needs. If this exercise helps, then get the 50th Anniversary edition of [[ASIN:0452281253 Anthem]]. The Appendix has Rand's first version of the story, with her cross-outs and emendations.<br /><br />2. \\"2nd Draft=1st Draft minus 10%.\\" (224). One of King's first rejection letters included this quick comment. It changed his life. And with our word processors, doing this is child's play.<br /><br />3. \\"Write with the door closed. Rewrite with the door open.\\" (47) When we write the first draft, we are writing to ourselves, and should not worry about what other people think. But when we rewrite, we need to make the story presentable for the world.<br /><br />There are other pointers--write ten pages per day, have an isolated workspace (James E. Talmage's was the best), have a six-week break between writing and rewriting, and so forth. Most writers discover these on their own. But it is nice to have King vindicate our experience.<br /><br />Surprisingly, King doesn't worry about plot. Read why on page 159ff.<br /><br />King also provides two career-path models. The first is his own, contained in the autobiographical section of the book. The second is a [[ASIN:0743453255 Forrest Gump]] compilation called Frank (243ff). Frank shows the incremental aspect to career building. We climb the career ladder one rung at a time, publishing one story at a time. Be patient.<br /><br />He also offers advice on handling rejection letters: as a teenager, he would impale his letters on a nail in his attic bedroom (28). Later, that nail became a spike, and is depicted on the cover of the paperback book. Get the message: ridicule rejection, crucify it.<br /><br />As I said, I am not a fan of King's vulgarity.

B00003CX8Y|4.0|I bought this DVD for my Grandkids for Christmas. I had to wait until Christmas to view the DVD. I had the video in VHS back in the early 90s. The DVD is great compared to the VHS. The DVD was as described and I would purchase more products from the seller.

B001GKJ2DO|2.0|fun movie very poor singing and a little dull.  Only the young couple could sing well .  Scenery was nice.
B001DPHDCY|2.0|Technically dazzling, this is a movie with an unclear motive - or perhaps it is a film with a cobbling of many diverse messages.  The end result is a tedious movie with unmistakably great moments.    As an educator and parent, I am always concerned with the messages movies convey to children. Among the many messages in this movie: the evil kangaroo woman (a character who wants to save the jungle community from Horton's 'wierd ways') 'Pouch Schools' her little one.  This comes across as a cruel shot at homeschooling. Even global weather change messages are added to this story of a generation ago.  Nevertheless, the time honored original moral comes through: a person's a person no matter how small. Perhaps this salient line could be used as a pro-life slogan!    We endured nearly the entire movie - fast forwarding through the song at the end, etc.. While we loved some of the WhoVille scenes, it is not worth the money in our opinion.  (Also be prepared for a scene in which a character is hit with objects in his front private areas for a notably long time.)
B001K98MFU|3.0|Just a quick warning to those after the \\"high Definition\\" experience with this blu-ray, while the domestic US release has an English dub, there are no high definition audio tracks on this disc at all.  Just plain old Dolby Digital.  The Japanese versions (there are 2) have either Uncompressed PCM or Dolby True HD and DTS HD MA.  If you are happy with subtitles, these are far superior versions.  I have compared both Japanese versions against the US and would recommend the Japanese Absolute Edition over this US one.   You can pick the Absolute Edition up from amazon.co.jp or other sellers, however it is quite a bit more expensive than this release.  But if you love this film and have the sound system for HD audio, it is well worth it.    One other point for international buyers, this version and the 2 Japanese releases are region locked to \\"Region A\\"    Score marked down for the poor audio.
B000AP04OM|4.0|Nice digital reproduction of this all time favorite. The colors are satisfactory. I am not sure if there were ending credits in the original, but it seems that they were omitted on this DVD.
1439130833|5.0|I bought several copies of this wonderful item as gifts for my closest friends, as well for myself. I find it to be a daily reminder to stay on track and stay positive.

B001P1FZDK|5.0|From the first note to the last...brilliant!  The new sound is a blend of classic Animal Collective with a digital undertone that has Panda Bear's signature all over it (which I adore!) Highly recommend it!  Strong tracks: My Girls, In the Flowers, Summertime Clothes, Taste, and Brother Sport...but all are delicious!
006091307X|5.0|Thomas Pynchon writes the perfect guide to paranoia in The Crying of Lot 49 (published in 1965). His gutsy and self-reliant heroine, Oedipa Maas (more about Pynchon's fabulously funny names later) is named executor of the far-flung estate of an ex-boyfriend.  Pierce Inverarity had his fingers in pies of all sorts, including a possible shadow group fighting the monopoly of the US Mail system over mail delivery.  The struggle to control the mail dates back centuries (it really does: Pynchon is not making this part up) and the Trystero conspirators are gearing up for an overthrow, offering clandestine methods of getting mail around.  Or are they?  That's where the paranoia comes in.<br /><br />As Oedipa finds out more and more about seemingly unrelated (but are they?) subjects such as the history of postal subversion (including the philatelical dimensions of forged stamps bearing small, incongruous details in black), and the bones of GIs left at a the bottom of a lake in Italy during World War II and then brought back to the United States to serve as interest for scuba divers in a lake built and outfitted by Inverarity, and the history and performance of Jacobean revenge plays (including one play considered so pornographic and destabilizing that the Vatican keeps it locked up in its library -- another paranoid conspiracy waiting to be written) and resurgent Nazism in San Francisco (not so paranoid, after all), we are as drawn into the twisted story of Inverarity's schemes as she is, and left with the same question: has he created the whole paranoid conspiracy to punish Oedipa or is it a real conspiracy that he was a part of  or are all the concurrent acts and facts just coincidences?  And if you cannot understand a thing I wrote in this paragraph, don't blame me: read the book.<br /><br />The book was written over forty-four years ago and yet it not dated.  The California he writes about is perhaps a bit more innocent and open-spaced than now, but the groundwork for the future is being laid in spiraling real estate developments, spreading smog, and disconnected persons seeking connection, even if it is only the most paranoid grasping for a connection that does not exist.<br /><br />However, there is a noted difference in The Crying of Lot 49 in the 1965 perspective on the Holocaust and World War II, and in today's.  In 1965 many survivors and perpetrators of the holocaust were still alive, and WWII was the war people still talked about as a participatory event. It was not an academic discussion of genocide and war, and Pynchon makes the war and the genocide horrible and immediately relevant to his characters.  In a way, the characters are seeking to distance themselves from that history, and aligning themselves with an even older history of the struggle against repression while at the same time flying on the balloon of the sixties, trying to get high and find themselves and get laid.<br /><br />I loved how Pynchon uses the 1960s backdrop for his naming of the characters.  Pynchon is a timely and sophomoric (but still funny) version of Dickens with his Oedipa Maas (sometimes called \\"Oed\\" and sometimes just \\"Edna\\"), married to Mucho Maas; we also meet Manni Di Presso, Dr. Hilarius (a Freudian shrink), Stanley Koteks, Mike Fallopian, Genghis Cohen (who calls Oedipa \\"Miz Maas\\"), and so on and so on.  Pynchon uses silly humor, slapstick, and sly inversions of reality to hold the readers' attention and it all works.  The plot of The Crying of Lot 49 is crazy but Oedipa holds it all together, works out all the kinks and twists for me, and makes me a believer.<br /><br />Our Oedipa is an honest and serious girl (she does have some fun in a very funny scene of undressing layers upon layers); she is also an optimist and as dogged as a pit bull.  By  the end of the book, she accepts paranoia as a necessary state.  And she is right, after all.  Better to question and wonder, than to be complacent and therefore, unwittingly compliant in the conspiracy.  What conspiracy?  Take your pick, there are many out there, so keep your eyes open and your brain open, and your options, open.  Great good comes from reading great books.  For more go to [...]onspiracy.

B000002L9B|5.0|With appearances by familiar names - billed as The Revolution; Jonathon and Susannah Melvoin, Sheila E, Wendy and Lisa - Prince bolsters his \\"solo\\" vision to create some of his richest artistry ever.<br /><br />The album reached #3 on the Billboard 200 chart and the single, Kiss, hit #1 and is an intriguing mix of minimalism with pop sensibilities. The other singles had mixed success; the wonderfully picturesque Mountains, #3 and the funky duo of  Girls & Boys, #11 and Anotherloverholenyohead, #63. Do U Lie? is an incredibly powerful song and the initial four tracks - Christopher Tracy's Parade, New Position, I Wonder U, Under the Cherry Moon - have a textured flow that brings into focus the key elements in the movie.<br /><br />Released in 1986. the music remains a vital part of Prince's vast discography, with Kiss being a classic single that paved a new direction for the \\"top 40\\" sound.
B00065GX64|5.0|GREAT FILM about a child murderer (Peter Lorre) who likes kids,but kills them, he has issues that he cant control is impulse to kill. He gets caught and pleas for his life , so an argument happens among the citizens about what do to about him. Should he be killed/tried or should they attempt to help him with his problem. Fritz Lang directed this thought provoking way ahead of its time movie. I really enjoyed it - it focuses on a really serious issue that does happen in our real world, not just in cinema. Criterion his a home run again with the transfer, as good as possible for a 1930s movie. The DVD has clear English subtitles,lots of extra features and is very highly recommended. If you like Lang, Lorre and German silents, then I suggest giving this early talkie a try. This is great German cinema from the man who brought us Dr Mabuse<br />I have the Criterion 2 disc DVD as it was an improvement over the first in terms of features - pricey but worth it

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Jamal Malik is only one correct answer away from winning 20 million rupees on India's version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" He's a waif and tea-server from India's slums, so the show's producers think that he's cheated. As they nearly beat Jamal to death, the movie repeatedly flashes back to his early childhood and the random events seared in his memory that enabled him to answer the show's arcane questions. But Slumdog is not about how he could answer the game show questions but why he became a contestant in the first place. He's clearly not interested in the money itself. This remarkable film is many things -- action thriller, human drama, social commentary on contemporary India, a story of human destiny, and, most of all, a tender romance. Slumdog is far and away one of the best films of the year.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Updated review:  Still amazing, but.....Blu-ray version does not contain all of the special features that the DVD version has.  I was disappointed to find that it did not have the behind the scenes or making of sequences found on the DVD version.  This is a shame because through out the movie you keep wondering \\"how did they get that shot\\".  Don't get me wrong...this is an excellent series and the HD is amazing, I just wish it had all of the same features as the regular DVD.    I bought a Blu-Ray player just so that I could watch this series in Blu-Ray.    Every episode captivates my attention and leaves me wanting more.  I am blown away with the breathtaking views and beautiful landscapes.  The colors are rich and vivid and the attention to detail is wonderful.  This is cinema at its best.  The camera work is really the center piece of the show and from time to time, i am awe struck at the camera crew's patience and perseverance to get that \\"one special shot\\" that might have only lasted 1 second but made you go WOW.    Con:  There are some scenes that are not shot in HD and can be a bit disappointed when contrasted with a vivid HD image 1-second before.  Usually, though, these non HD images occur when we are taken to some remote location where the rarity of the image far out weighs the fact that its not in HD.    In summary,  I love watching this series both alone and with my kids.  I know that this is something we will watch over and over, unlike many other DVDs that I own.

B000002TYX|5.0|Review no. 100. I, of course knew all about this must-own Beatles 2-CD box set for years now - but I've just gotten around - here recently to purchasing a a copy. Total of sixty tracks - many that I simply do not recognize right off hand - like &#34;Free As A Bird&#34;, &#34;Cayenne&#34;, the swinging &#34;Three Cool Cats&#34; and &#34;One After 909&#34; to name just a few. As for the familiar tunes, I absolutely loved hearing again gems such as the toe-tapping &#34;Roll Over Beethoven&#34;, the first Beatles hit that I had acknowledged (when I was like six) &#34;Want To Hold Your Hand&#34;, &#34;A Hard Day's Night&#34;, &#34;Shout&#34; and too many to list here. Couldn't get enough of flipping though the irreplaceable 46-page CD booklet - jam-packed with info and must-see Beatles memorabilia. Essential.
0670019925|4.0|There is something appropriate about David Lodge writing on the ruefully comic trials and tribulations of deafness. He is a master chronicler of the seriocomic frustrations of daily life, whether it be the sexual frustrations of young Catholics post Vatican II in \\"How Far Can You Go,\\" or the family frustrations of a beleagured grad student juggling the demands of home life and academia in \\"The British Museum is Falling Down.\\"<br /><br />\\"Deaf Sentence\\" is a work of fiction, but Lodge admits in a postscript that he drew on his own experience with hearing loss, as well as that of his father's, to tell the tale of Desmond Bates, a retired professor of linguistics attempting, with mitigated success, to navigate the world minus one reliable sense. The subject suits Lodge because \\"deafness is comic, as blindness is tragic,\\" in the words of Bates (whose namesake is the hard-of-hearing Miss Bates from Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\"), and Lodge specializes in that particularly British brand of wry, dry humor, that is more appropriate to the mishaps of deaf-induced misunderstandings than the arguably bleaker fate of all-encompassing darkness.<br /><br />\\"Deaf Sentence\\" touches on weighty topics like suicide, mortality, and bodily degeneration, but Lodge never lets the gloom overwhelm his highly cultivated taste for slapstick, wordplay, and the comic hijinks of a hapless hero. Lodge's Desmond is a humane, sympathetic portrait of a sixty-something man struggling to find meaning in his unstructured retirement, and human connection in spite of his isolating deafness. A visit to Auschwitz during a lecture tour reminds Desmond of the true nature of silence, that overpowering silence that is the silence of the tomb, or the silence of God. He writes, \\"Deafness is a kind of pre-death, a drawn-out introduction to the long silence into which we will all eventually lapse.\\"

0810970686|3.0|Jeff Kinney's third installment in his \\"Wimpy Kid\\" series lacks the wit he displayed in the first two books.  And while the third edition was billed as \\"The Last Straw,\\" it seems Kinney's editor and publisher have convinced him that he can milk this cow a little longer (a fourth title apparently will follow).  The first two books in the series were fresh and clever. This volume seems tired and repetitive.  It's missing the cutting humor that made the first two titles inventive and popular with younger boys, especially.  I imagine these audiences won't be deterred by my criticisms, but honest reviewers and newcomers to the series will likely feel cheated.  I certainly was hoping for more, having thoroughly enjoyed books one and two.  Kinney has done much to capture reluctant readers with this series, and that's a good thing, but \\"The Last Straw\\" is the weakest link in the collection thus far, and that does not bode well for future installments.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age).  A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion.  He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a \\"merchant of death,\\" but he balks at being called \\"the Da Vinci of our time\\").  Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity.  Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and pulverizing the bad guys.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man\\" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards.  But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time.  He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made \\"Iron Man\\" what it is without him.  Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory.  These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen.  James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.<br /><br />Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in \\"Iron Man\\" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie.  It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film.  And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be.

B0019EXZY4|4.0|There are many bank robbery movies out there that are fun to watch.  This one may be a bit more interesting just because it is based off a true story.  Bank Job was a good movie to watch though not necessarily one of the most entertaining movies I have scene.  Part of the drawback probably is that the movie is based on actual events so crazy things aren't as apt to happen.<br /><br />The movie was enjoyable and the cast of relatively no namers was solid.  I had higher expectations based of other reviews and may have been let down a bit but it was still very fun and entertaining to watch.

B0000683DH|5.0|In the aftermath of Star Trek:The Motion Picture, Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan went back the original format established during the television series. Gene Roddenberry wanted an action packed movie. The story of the movie was basically a fight for survival.   In the beginning, Captain Spock and his cadets, were in a bridge simulator in preparation for a training cruise on the Enterprise. Admiral James Kirk would be evaluating crew performance during the cruise. The movie seen the introduction of a new character, Lieutenant Saavik. Kirstie Alley did good job in portraying the character. Robin Curtis would do a better job during Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and during her brief appearance in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. In original storyline, Saavik was to be half Vulcan, half Romulan. When her character was introduced in the movie, Saavik was a full Vulcan.   The main part of the story takes place in the Ceti Alpha star system. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, is a continuation of the Star Trek episode \\"The Space Seed\\" The late Ricardo Montalban, reprised his role as Khan in the movie and turned in an outstanding performance. In this part of the movie, the Reliant is on orbital approach to what they believe to be Ceti Alpha 6. Reliant was part of the Genesis Project. In this part of the movie, we were introduced to Kirk's past. The affair he had with Dr. Carol Marcus and the birth of their son David. By mutual agreement, Kirk agreed to stay away. David grows up to be scientist and a research partner with his mother. While growing up, David was never informed, Captain James T. Kirk, was his father. After landing, Chekov and Terrell,are captured by Khan and his people. This is when Chekov and Terrell find out,they're on Ceti Alpha 5. In the series, Khan and his people, were sent into exile on Ceti Alpha 5, rather than face charges of hijacking the Enterprise. Six months into their exile, the orbit of Ceti Alpha 5 was shifted when Ceti Alpha 6 exploded. Overthe course of time, Khan was hoping to seek revenge on Kirk and the Enterprise. With the arrival of the Reliant, gives Khan the opportunity he was hoping for. While waiting for Reliant to be transporter range, Khan learns about the Genesis Project. Kirk is alerted of possible trouble, when Dr. Marcus attempts to contact him on the Enterprise, requesting verification of an order of Starfleet taking procession of Genesis, only to find out, their communications were being jammed. With the Enterprise, the only ship in the area, they're ordered to active duty. Kirk's concern, is for the training crew on the Enterprise. They were being placed in a threat situation before they were ready.     The rest of the movie, was a fight for survival. Khan ambushes the Enterprise and disables her. The ace up Kirk's sleeve, was the Prefix Code. After making whatever repairs they could, Kirk's concern was for Dr. Marcus and the Genesis Project. Upon arrival at the Regula I station, Kirk finds the aftermath of Khan's anger. After finding Chekov and Terrell, Kirk makes a coded message to the Enterprise. Upon transporting inside the Regula 1 planetoid, Kirk finds Dr. Marcus, his son and the Genesis Device, only to find out, they walked into a trap. After taking Genesis, Khan was under the impression, Kirk was going to be marooned inside a dead planet. Khan was unaware of the coded message. The Enterprise was in hiding and was able to restore partial main power. Two hours later, Kirk and his party, were transported to the Enterprise.   This is where the fight for survival, get intense. Kirk knows the only way to even the fight, is to play hide & seek inside the Mutara Nebula. During their battles, both the Enterprise and the Reliant were heavily damaged. In his last attempt to destroy the Enterprise, Khan activates the Genesis device. What Khan was not aware of, Dr. David Marcus was on the bridge of the Enterprise and seen the sensor display from Spock's science console. With Warp drive unavailable, the Enterprise tried to get away from the Reliant at best possible speed before the Genesis Device detonates. Knowing they are facing certain destruction, Spock makes the ultimate sacrifice when he makes repairs to the Warp Drive. With seconds to spare,the Enterprise escapes destruction. After knowing his wife and son are safe, Kirk has to endure the ultimate pain of losing his best friend.   The funeral ceremony was a fitting close. The special touch is when Scotty was playing Amazing Grace on the bag pipes. Their window of opportunity for the next movie, is when Spock's burial tube passed through what remains of the Genesis Wave Radiation. During some quiet time in his quarters to grief over Spock's death, David acknowledges that Admiral James T. Kirk, is his father and very proud of him.    Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan, is the best of the action based movies of the Star Trek movie series involving the original crew. This was the first Star Trek movie to use George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic to provide the special effects for the movie. Ricardo Montalban was outstanding in reprising his role as Khan. He was being considered for the Academy Award. However, he did not make the final cut. In the Special Collector's Edition, the edited scenes were restored to this version, including the introduction of Scotty's nephew, Peter Preston and the scenes in Sick Bay where Scotty loses his nephew and scene between Kirk and McCoy asking the question, \\"How did Khan find out about Genesis?\\" The restored scenes, added to the storyline.   Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut, would be an excellent edition to anyones DVD collection. The movie is a continuation of an episode that appeared during the original series!
0312263120|4.0|When I started reading this book I was a little worried that Brown would not get a lot of the technical stuff right. I am a programmer and the book would soon get unreadable if it miss-used terms, and it does in several places. Yet, the pace and action that Dan Brown puts forth soon got me hooked. His quick chapters that leave you wanting to know what happens next works to make the book very fast paced and adds to the excitement of the action that is taking place. I just love his style of writing, and then you add nerdy technology and talk about codes and you have me at Chapter 3.

B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is fresh every time you play it-- no two rounds are ever alike.  This is a really fun strategy game.  I love that the rules are simple (I HATE reading endless convoluted rules), but the strategy and thinking that go into it can be complex. This is a game that both kids and adults can enjoy.<br /><br />I noticed an explanation among the reviews of a way to play with fewer players-- that explanation was kinda complex.  Here's a simple way for 2 players to enjoy the board:  just use one color to create a design in the middle of the board or around the edges before you get started (a phantom 3rd player, in effect).  This is actually a really fun way to play-- it adds an interesting twist of difficulty, depending upon how you lay out your design.

It was...well, as bad as the movies it was spoofing.  Yet I watched the whole thing because I wondered what the gimmick would be that killed off the Martians.

One thing that amazes me - over the last decade I've lent this book out to several folks who were 'interested'.  Funny, they returned the book to me acknowledging they didn't get around to reading it...but, hey, at least they are driving nice new cars!

0596009208|5.0|I have been struggling for years to get the concepts of object oriented programming into my head.  I have failed miserably until this book.  After reading this book I finally understand things like polymorphism, encapsulation, and wrappers...concepts that all other books gloss over because the authors just presume you know what they mean.  I have wasted time with a dozen other books and learned nothing.  This book made it all clear to me.  I have been dancing a jig ever since I got it.  This is the first technical book that I would place in a top ten category regardless of topic or whether it is fiction or non-fiction.  The authors are geniuses.  I wish I could kiss them both and thank them for teaching an old procedural programmer how to finally get it.  Hey, and learning Java was nice, too!

Taking a chance left me VERY \\"F----- HAPPY\\" that I made a blind purchase-after only listening to \\"SEX ON FIRE\\" on the radio. Reviews saying that from the past say they have evolved. Not that they were not very good, but have changed their style. Will I soon find out I am wasting money if I blind purchase?.?. I will let you know....... Back to this CD. These guys are a band that will pretty much strike the MIDDLE of the ROAD listeners fancy, they are contemporary main-stream here on this CD. A main-stream band that shows quality with a difference. This is just my oppinion. Get back to me at gregorybardakos@aol.com to compare notes. Thanks for reading.

B0002F6AH0|1.0|At one time I too owned this set. I returned the box set back to the seller for a full refund. Possibly the best footage of WWII ever put together, HOWEVER both my sets were defective. The picture constantly broke up (pixelation) and some chapters were entirely missing.<br /><br />The World At War was released prior to the 30th Anniversary Box Set and the quality was worse than this version.<br /><br />The original release was a mess...Example: Disc 4; Side 1 and Side 2 were exactly the same and EVERY disc had a pixelation problem.<br /><br />The 30th Anniversary Box Set I experienced pixelation on a number of discs.  You would think they would get it right the 2nd time.<br /><br />I ended up returning both sets and decided to wait for another release.  Too bad, I LOVE THIS SERIES.<br /><br />My recommendation is to wait until the series is re-issued by another manufacturer. If you wait long enough, the set may also be remastered.

B0017R5UAA|3.0|I saw FF on SNL and was quite impressed by their vocal harmonies.  It's been a very long time since a band has made it, at least, to the national music scene that harmonizes as well as FF.  I was also intrigued by the acoustic feel with keyboards providing atmosphere.  Being a huge fan of 70's British and Canadian progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Genesis, Yes, and Rush, FF's current sound is still a little too much on the folk end for my taste.  I'm not a huge fan of Grateful Dead or CSNY even though both consist(ed) of talented musicians.  Nor am I a huge fan of EARLY Jethro Tull.  Tull's early stuff was a bit too folky for my taste.  That said, I'm definitely going to keep an eye on FF and see what they sound like in a few years.  I can tell they've got some major talent.  It's more of a personal preference thing with me.  I'd like to hear something that delves deeper into both rock and progressive from these guys without completely losing the acoustic and/or folk feel.  Something that could compare, in style, to Genesis' Trespass or Tull's Thick As A Brick.  From the SNL performances and snippets available here at Amazon.com, these guys definitely have potential.  I'd just like to hear them be a bit more adventurous.  That's my personal preference.  Nobody needs to agree with it.    [additional information below entered 01-21-09]    Fans of this band might want to check out the latest remastered editions of From Genesis To Revelation and Trespass by Genesis.  These albums were originally released in 1969 and 1970 respectively.  FYI, Phil Collins wasn't a member of Genesis for either of these 2 albums.  Phil first appears on Genesis' 1971 release called Nursery Cryme.  The cover of this FF release reminds me of some of the early Genesis album covers.  Especially that of Nursery Cryme and Foxtrot.  Since so many young people probably never even heard of Genesis or are only familiar with the 3 person line-up consisting of Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks, I thought I'd offer the above information.  The songs from both FGTR and Trespass are largely acoustic and some do have a folk flavor.  Best of all, they feature Peter Gabriel before the age of 21!  He (co)wrote some of the material on these albums when he was just 17!  Believe me, unless you're familiar with this era of Genesis, you've never heard Peter Gabriel sound like this!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|and the best cd of 2008. i haven't heard every release of 2008, but i dare any cd to be better than this one.  they create the kind of mood that early simon & garfunkle used to bring to the table. \\"scarborough fair\\" anyone.    this piece of music will be a tough act to follow, even for the 'fleet foxes.'

This book, if turned into a movie, would be R. By page six, it says the F bomb twice and on page 60 it starts going on about seeing oral sex on some guy. It really makes me sad to see that this series seems to do so well in the book stores.

As soon as I entered my credit card number a page popped up with a message that it would not be shipped until Dec. 29th.

While I have gotten lucky in the past getting some good books that others didn't like, I was completely disgusted with this one. The main character is a awful mary-sue with super magical powers and a brain the size of a pea. I can't stand her. While I liked some of the other characters, Zoe was awful.     Do not buy this. You will not like it.

Before I saw this movie I really did not appreciate Blue Grass, now I love it. George Clooney, and all the stars in this movie were Great! Love this movie! Will watch again and again!
B001KL3GWM|5.0|Listening to this fine recording makes it apparent that Derek Trucks is well acquainted with a wide range of blues music, both classic and contemporary. There aren't many musicians who can play different blues styles with authority, but Derek Trucks can.<br /><br />\\"Already Free\\" will appeal to most fans of traditional blues, rock blues, soul blues, and contemporary blues. There are a lot of different moods represented here, and each blues color is interpreted tastefully by Derek and his group of pros.<br /><br />They are taking blues in a new direction while staying true to the essence of the style.<br /><br />It is exciting to imagine what sort of music we can expect from Derek in the future. He is a top-flight slide guitarist and singer with deep roots in the blues. I don't think it's a stretch to imagine that his legacy will eventually match that of blues greats such as Johnny Winter, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and even some of the Chicago blues masters of the postwar era. Keep up the nice work, Derek.
0812975219|5.0|This work is written in a friendly and engaging tone. I tore right through the pages. The author makes you feel as you are conversing with him in his living room. Don't expect to pick up a great deal of insight on how to become successful trader, do not expect a tutorial in how to trade stocks and options, that is not what this book is about. This book is mainly about mistakes that people can make, and that they make these mistakes because they are lulled into a false sense of security due to past events. Many of the events depicted refer to trading because this is the life experience of the author, but you can apply the lessons to any aspect of life. The author helped me recognize one of my mistakes in managing my family finances which is the failure to have a pre-determined exit point. Hand in hand with this idea, the author introduces the notion that to be a trader, you need to be able to tolerate a loss. I'm sure many of us are wishing we were this insightful before the big meltdown.
B0012GMUI6|5.0|It is well known that the Pink Floyd faithful cleave brutally between those who cherish the dreamy, noodly prog-rock inflections of Richard Wright and the luscious, wet embrace of David Gilmour's soaring Stratocaster on the one hand, and bitter and twisted adolescents drawn to the bile-curdling world vision of grumpy bassist Roger Waters on the other. The former complain that Rogers was a control freak who couldn't really sing and by failing at any stage to stop, ruined whole Pink Floyd albums. The latter complain that, absent Waters' grand vision, there wasn't a lot to ruin, and point to [[ASIN:B000002A3T The Division Bell]] to prove it.<br /><br />The \\"Waters\\" take on Pink Floyd is most unflinchingly represented by 1981's [[ASIN:B0001KZM3O The Final Cut]], an album universally damned or feted - depending on your perspective - as in all but name a Roger Waters solo album, but the post [[ASIN:B00000254C Wish You Were Here]] output ([[ASIN:B000024D4R Animals]] and [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall]]) tend to be similarly indicted.<br /><br />The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking is in all *including* name a Roger Waters solo album. Noodly prog rock types, therefore, really should stop here for their own good. Gone are not only Rick Wright's jazz-inflicted organ swells and Nick Mason's cheerful but uneventful drumming, but crucially also the leavening euphoria of David Gilmour's stately and ethereal electric guitar. Instead, the album is graced by crisp piano and the chops of another guitar god, Eric Clapton. And here the ironies begin compounding. For, as is his wont, Clapton plays in the blues rock idiom. Once upon a time, the Pink Floyd devised their signature sound by being at great pains to sound as little like a blues band as possible. In this way as many others, does Waters thumb his nose at his former compadres.<br /><br />Nor, surprisingly, does Eric Clapton's playing have the stately and mellifluous quality you might expect from a guy known as Slowhand, especially when accompanying the creative impulse from Pink Floyd<br /><br />To the contrary, Clapton's guitar playing is vigorous and angular, his tone cold and bright - perhaps not entirely intentional in an era when digital effects processing was a new and exciting idea - perhaps the sound engineer made him leave his [[ASIN:B0002E3GLY Fender Twin]] at home.<br /><br />But most likely not, for on this album Roger Waters is clearly intent on sketching dissonance, and Clapton's accompaniment fosters this ambience perfectly. As a songwriter and lyricist, Waters' ambition, finally unchecked by the need to pander to noodling instrumentalists - and without the subeditorial quality of David Gilmour's knack for a middle eight, is given full throttle. Roger Waters is not a man to let up: pedal stays to floor: (to quote the man himself \\"The reason, between you and me, was she'd just seen my green Lamborghini\\").<br /><br />In parts The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking goes places a more reflective and less damaged psyche might not, but the results are still often exhilarating. Warped and messed up his head may have been, but still managed some beautifully spiteful and venomous lines such as: \\"Fixed on the front of her Fassbinder face/Was the kind of a smile/That only a rather dull child could have drawn/While attempting a graveyard in the moonlight\\" which are almost funny they're so nasty - and interestingly counterpointed against similar imagery from the Final Cut where more charitably, \\"She stood in the doorway/The ghost of a smile haunting her lips/Like a cheap hotel sign\\". Muscal motifs are also carried over - listen carefully and you will hear themes from the Fletcher Memorial Home and In The Flesh - and no doubt others - reflected in Clapton's guitar.<br /><br />It's a very complex, multilayered album - utterly impenetrable in parts, taking as it appears to the form of a series of transcluded dreams and nightmares, featuring an attack by some knife-wielding mediterraneans, infidelities with a flaxen-haired hitchhiker, a woodland retreat in rural Germany (complete with s stoned reading of Winnie the Pooh!) and an encounter with a Hell's Angel somewhere on the way to Wyoming: I have owned this record for 20 years and listened to it as much as any other in my collection and I still don't understand it. Noodlers will declare it unsufferably dense and tuneless; the bitter and twisted adolescents will say that is the point, and the joy is in its repayment of further listening). I can't imagine anyone would unconditionally fall in love with this record in one sitting, but it may (if your tastes run to the Waters rather than Gilmour end of the Pink Floyd spectrum) be interesting and engaging enough to persevere with, and it will in time bear fruit. I encountered it at a point in my life (as a bitter and twisted 19 year old) when uniquely vulnerable to its ugly charm and I might not tolerate it if I were to come across it afresh now, but for all that it is still the most rewarding (if not accessible) of Roger Waters' solo works, and in the few places it is pretty, it is mightily so.<br /><br />But, useful tip for awkward adolescents (acquired through painful experience): If you're a-wooing, don't put this on a mix tape for your intended. You'll never hear from her again.<br /><br />Postscript note on the American sleeve: how odd that, in the land of the free, someone felt it necessary to mask a perfectly healthy (and if I might say, rather well-formed) posterior!<br /><br />Olly Buxtonin rural Germany (complete with s stoned reading of Winnie the Pooh!) and an encounter with a Hell's Angel somewhere on the way to Wyoming: I have owned this record for 20 years and listened to it as much as any other in my collection and I still don't understand it.

B001KZVQJI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie at the theater and am glad to see it on BluRay.  Regardless of whether it is the long or short version.  It is cheaper than what I paid to see it and the concession stand tax (;-). Jack Black is not my favorite actor and I thought it would be just another makeover of a classic film but I was wrong.  This is well worth the cost and on BluRay it should be fantastic.
B001LRJH0U|2.0|As Samuel Johnson apparently never said, the original parts of Appaloosa are not good and the good parts are not original. There are fragments of the script that could have been expanded into effective movies on their own by real directors like Mann or Boetticher, but under Harris' direction, it just ambles along in a unenjoyably distracted fashion without bringing anything new to the western genre. The DVD extras consist of deleted scenes (which somehow must have been even worse than what they left in) and the usual the-making-of propaganda shorts that explain what a great movie it is. Wait to check this one out of the public library unless you want to help fight the recession by foolishly paying twenty dollars for it like I did at the local big box store.

1439102813|5.0|Still Alice is a remarkable love story not only between a man and woman, but also between a mother and her children.      Dr. Alice Howland, a Harvard professor of psychology, developes early-onset Alzheimer's disease while she is at the pinnacle of her career.  Slowly Alice watches her mind unravel and she loses lifelong connections with her collegauges, family, and friends.    This book is unique because Alice tells her own story from the perspective of an Alzheimer's patient.      Lisa Genova, the author of Still Alice, holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Harvard University.  Her mastery of the science of Alzheimer's provides a realistic picture of the disease and the rampage it leaves in its' wake.  Lisa's compassion shows us the inner turmoil caused by Alzheimers and the heartache of family as they watch Alice slowly fade like distant music blowing away on a breeze.  Lisa Genova writes her heart within the words of each page.    My heart broke as I read Still Alice.  I now have a better understanding of disease and a better understanding of my grandmother.  Still Alice is a story that must be told and a story we must hear.     Lisa Genova is not only a doctor of nueroscience and a novelist, but she's an amazingly kind person.  Her own grandmother's life was stripped naked by this harrowing disease.  She is a woman of great success and yet she took a moment to read my small tribute to my own gradmother.      BUY Still Alice today.  You won't regret reading this book.
0316017922|2.0|I read Blink and Tipping Point and Outliers is a lot more watered down. A lot of what Gladwell says is common sense. And yes he does site some interesting studies and makes some interesting points, the book wasn't consistent.

This album shows the remaining band picking up the pieces from tragic loss and showing not only that they could go on, but that they'd continue to reach the soaring heights of their perfected craft. This is more than an album: It is a classic statement of faith in each other and allegiance to the groove.

B001E75QGG|3.0|I am a huge Indiana Jones fan and really looked forward to seeing this movie.  It was a bit of a disappointment but probably because I am comparing it to the original trilogy movies(which were all much better).  It was entertaining.... just don't expect too much.
0679746048|5.0|Girl, Interrupted: the book, the movie, the real life behind the story, and a rant against the mental illness system  You may have heard of the book: Girl, Interrupted.  You may have seen the movie of the same name.  The book came out in 1993, the movie, in 2000. The book was re-issued at the time of the movie debut.  This was based on a memoir by Susanna Kaysen, a young woman in the late 1960s who lived in Cambridge, Mass. and was hospitalized at the famous McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Massachusetts, the psychiatric institution affiliated with Harvard University.  When the movie came out, people I know said:  Oh yeah, I remember Susanna. So and so dated her. I remember when all this happened to her. Great book. Terrific movie.  ***  Susanna Kaysen grew up in an upper-middle class family in the Cambridge area of Massachusetts. Her parents were professional and well-to-do. Her father was director of an institute in Princeton, N.J. Not sure what position he held in Cambridge, but it was not dissimilar. Her family lived on Wendell Street in Cambridge, which is in the Harvard area. They had moved one year earlier from Princeton, New Jersey.  In the mid 1960s in this part of the world, and affiliated with the movers and shakers of the intellectual power structure of this area, her parents were status oriented, and likely cool, distant, or just clueless as to who their daughter really was.  Susanna Kaysen wanted to be a writer.  She overdosed on vodka and aspirin and ended up in McLean hospital. She was 18 in 1967, the tail end of the worst years in the mental illness system.  The movie makes some significant departures from the book, and the author, Susanna Kaysen, was quite upset about those, mainly about the movies' melodramatic tone, and also with the event of Susanna (Winona Rider) and the sociopath Lisa (Angelina Jolie) running off together, which never happened.  Susanna had an affair with a professor, apparently giving him rim jobs, and was confronted by the professor's wife about this.  Susanna was a sensitive girl, surrounded by parents and a society insensitive and largely unaware of her needs.  Though she technically signed herself into the hospital voluntarily, she was not able to leave on her own free will.  She basically had to sign herself in. She spoke to a psychiatrist her parents recommended, she recited the section I included below as an excerpt, and she was told to sign herself in.  The hospital in the movie is &#34;Claymoore&#34; but it is McLean Hospital in the book, with actual documents from Susanna's life, including the admitting document of an 18-yo girl, who presented with:  &#34;psychoneurotic depressive reaction, personality pattern disturbance, mixed type, R/O  undifferentiated schizophrenia,&#34; and was finally diagnosed with borderline personality.  According to the DSM-IV, the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association  psychoneurotic depressive reaction: - not in the DSM- IV, 1994. The DSM manual current at the time of Kaysen's hospitalization was the DSM-1.  personality pattern disturbance, mixed type: - not in the DSM-IV.  undifferentiated schizophrenia: - this is in the DSM-IV, but it was considered as R/O (Rule out) only. I consider this to be a garbage diagnosis; most dx of schizophrenia are either paranoid or catatonic.  borderline personality: - this is in the DSM-IV, below.  301.83 describes a prolonged disturbance of personality function, characterized by depth and variability of moods,  typically involving unusual levels of instability in mood, such as &#34;black and white&#34; thinking, or splitting - chaotic and unstable interpersonal relationships, and behavior, as well as a disturbance in the individual's sense of self. In extreme cases, this disturbance in the sense of self can lead to periods of dissociation. These disturbances can have a pervasive negative impact on many or all of the psychosocialfacets of life. This includes difficulties maintaining relationships in work, home, and social settings. Attempted suicide and completed suicide are possible outcomes, especially without proper care and effective therapy. Onset of symptoms typically occurs during adolescence or young adulthood.  It is also noted that in cases of overdosing or cutting, that the diagnosis of borderline personality should not be applied.  I  onsider the dx of Borderline personality disorder to be a wastebasket diagnosis.  Every symptom or behavior above can be attributed to stress, PTSD, abuse, or other environmental cause, none of which are the fault of the patient.  Most people in counseling or psychiatric care only need the following:  To socialize with people and to have meaningful work.  Isolation will drive a person nuts.  Lack of meaningful work leads to low self-esteem.  The combination of isolation and low-self esteem, especially when combined with an environment that does not understand the person, is not a recipe for a good outcome.  There was really nothing wrong with Susanna Kaysen, yet she spent 18 months in the hospital, paid for by her parents, and/or her health insurance.  James Taylor,  and later Kate and Livingston Taylor also enjoyed stays at McLean Hospital, a place, James Taylor said was where rich parents put their kids when they didn't fit in. Not far from the truth.  In fact, in the case of the Taylors and with Susanna, it was the absolute truth.  There were decades in which husbands who were tired of their wives (who often became lonely and depressed) could get them institutionalized. Parents who didn't understand their children institutionalized them. Minorities and the poor, who are most often the most misunderstood of all, and acting out because of the abuse the poverty and their status in society heaps upon them, were also heavily institutionalized, usually in the county hospital system.  There are people with actual mental disorders, mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or bipolar illness, but Susanna was not one of those.  In the book and the movie, her boyfriend (a young guy her age, not the professor with whom she has an affair), want her to leave.  There is a lot wrong with a professional field, especially one dealing with human relations and the human psyche, in which so much has changed, in which a field could be so very wrongheaded not so very many years ago.  I should reframe that statement to say: I should be grateful that the mental health system has improved its diagnosis and treatment of people who are misunderstood, instead of treating them with professional blinders.  At McLean Hospital with Susanna, among others, was a young girl who had thrown acid on her face, an anorexic young woman who was sexually abused by her father and who later hangs herself in her apartment after she leaves the hospital when Lisa mercilessly accuses the girl (Daisy) of having enjoyed having incestuous sex with her own father, but most of the young woman on the ward are not actually mentally ill.  There was also the sociopath, Lisa, the most seriously so-called 'disturbed' and I suspect, among the most seriously abused by her family.  Some of the movie was actually filmed in Belmont at McLean Hospital, but most was filmed at Harrisburg State Hospital, and the town scenes were from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.  There was some front-door film footage of the actual McLean Hospital.  Jolie received an Oscar for her role as Lisa, as best supporting actress in a drama.  Most people of that era (1950s - 1960s - pre 1970s) who sought  counseling, psychiatric help or who entered psychiatric institutions were often more the victims of their environment than actual sufferers of serious mental illness.  Yet the system at that time failed to recognize the difference between a shy or misunderstood person brought up in a cold, hostile or abusive environment who made suicide gestures (overdosing or cutting) and a person with actual psychosis.  I am not going to defend the mental health profession of those days for their ignorance. They were professionals who were brought up in affluent environments, who studied with blinders, who never thought out-of-the-box, and who treated many people poorly, both in their offices and in the hospital settings. Many never tried to think out of the box.  Sadly, this is often the case, still. The diagnoses are different, perhaps a bit better, but many in the field are not necessarily well-suited for their job, with many themselves being shy, or not particularly well-adjusted, or acquainted much with the real world of people and problems. Most are outsiders trying to look in, rather than insiders looking in.  Only insiders looking in actually know the score. The vast number of outsiders trying to look in can do more harm than good.  Susanna was fortunate in that she was in a private hospital, rather than a state facility, where people were routinely given ECT therapy, which was much more common and much more damaging than now. Many were given ECT therapy in private hospitals, also during those years, but it was even more rampant in the state facilities.  In both the book and the movie, Susanna's boyfriend both confront her by saying she really needs to get out of the hospital - that the hospital is simply using her, that there is nothing wrong with her, and that if she doesn't leave, the hospital will keep her forever.  The book and the movie end with an epilogue that within a few years, in the 1970s, all of Susanna's co-patients had been released from the hospital.  ***  Susanna's writing is simple, direct, entrancing.  In the first chapter, Toward a Topography of the Parallel Universe, the book opens:  EXCERPT  &#34;People ask, How did you get in there? What they really want to know is if they are likely to end up there as well. I can't answer the real question. All I tell them is, It's easy.  And it is easy to slip into a parallel universe. There are so many of them: worlds of the insane, the criminal, the crippled, the dying, perhaps of the dead as well.  These worlds exist alongside this world and resemble it, but are not in it.  My roommate Georgina came in swiftly and totally, during her junior year at Vassar. She was in a theater watching a movie when a tidal wave of blackness broke over her head.  The entire world was obliterated  -- for a few minutes. She knew she had gone crazy. She looked around to see if it had happened to everyone, but all the other people were engrossed in the movie. She rushed out because the darkness in the theater was too much when combined with the darkness in her head.  And after that? I asked her.  A lot of darkness, she said.  But most people pass over incrementally, making a series of perforations in the membrane between here and there until an opening exists...In the parallel universe, the laws of physics are suspended. ..Time, too is different. It may run in circles, flow backwards, skip about from now and then...Another odd feature of the parallel universe is that although it is invisible from this side, once you are in it you can easily see the world you came from. Sometimes the world you came from looks huge and menacing....other times it is miniaturized and alluring. a-spin and shining in its orbit. Either way, it can't be discounted.  Every window on Alcatraz has a view of San Francisco.&#34;  END EXCERPT  Brilliant.  Not crazy or unorthodox or weird by any one's estimation today; yet, no one understood this at the time.  What does that say about previous decades?  Only now are some writers and some mental health professionals able to look at their field as skewed from human reality, as in the book: The Loss of Sadness: HowPsychiatry Transformed Normal Sorrow into Depressive Disorder. (Horvitz, Wakefield, Oxford University Press, 2007)  This book is being touted as a tour-de-force that will alter professional thinking.  Billiant. Absolutely brilliant premise.  And it is about darned time psychiatry came around to the obvious.  Susanna Kaysen, who at one time doubted a life could be made from boyfriends and writing, managed to do very well, making a life out of boyfriends and writing.  An excellent book.

055357342X|5.0|From my experience there seems to be little quality control by fans of fantasy fiction. People will give 4 and 5 star reviews to just about any pile of junk containing swords, wizards and dragons that gets slapped into publication. So when a truly great piece of literature is released it doesn't stand out among Amazon reviews. George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice is a truly great piece of literature. Unlike many fantasy writers who crank out books assembly line style Martin crafts his meticulously over the course of years. His books are so good I honestly worry that something might happen to him before the series is complete. There are three books in The Song of Fire and Ice series that have yet to be published and given his rate of output I estimate that seventh book, \\"A Dream of Spring\\" will arrive a year or so before 2020 at which point the author will be in his seventies and he's not the healthiest looking fellow on the planet. The point is the series is so good I actually fear its non completion.<br /><br />There are some caveats when reading the Song of Fire and Ice Series.<br />1. The good guys don't wear white and the bad guys don't wear black. The bravest, most selfless act in `A Storm of Swords' was done by one of those rotten Lannisters. Martin is so good at invoking sympathy for a character that I actually found myself wishing that Sandor Clegane would recover from some vicious wounds he received in battle despite the fact that he had previously been one of the most despicable characters in the series.<br /><br />2. There are perhaps no safe characters in the story. Eddard Stark was the main character from \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and he was beheaded before the book was complete. A handful of major, and I do mean major, characters do not make it to the end of this book. Two of the deaths dramatically changed the dynamics of the book and I wasn't happy with the new path the story was going down but as if in answer to my displeasure Martin ended the life of a character who was sorely in need of a violent death and I immediately forgave Martin for his prior transgression.<br /><br />3. This series is a major investment in time. The first 4 books average over 1000 pages apiece so this isn't a series for the feint of heart.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin has been called the American Tolkein not because he has in any way ripped off Tolkein. In fact, besides both being fantasy writers, their stories couldn't be any more dissimilar. He's called the American Tolkein because the quality is high and the quantity is low. The Song of Fire and Ice continues to be the best fantasy series I have read and after 1128 pages Martin still offers up an ending that caused my jaw to drop. I can't say enough about this series. It truly rises far above other fantasy fiction and it would be a real shame if it never reaches the highest pinnacle of recognition as C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia or Tolkein's Lord of the Rings have achieved.f a character who was sorely in need of a violent death and I immediately forgave Martin for his prior transgression.<br /><br />3.

0440178002|5.0|Shogun will always be a book. They can't make it into a successful screen event. Why? Because it is about the writing. The plot is one line: Western Civilization invades Japan. The plot is one line: Dutch Captain lands in Japan and learns their culture. The plot is one line: Feudal Lords battle for the rule of Japan.<br /><br />There are other one liners. A movie would have to choose one. Clavell interweaves all these and more. BUT<br /><br />Beyond that, this book is beautifully written. You can say that about many books, but this one is like a flower that is a twelve course meal that goes on and on, getting better and better.<br /><br />Really, the only other books you could compare it to are Clavell's own works. King Rat was autobiographical and took you into the complexity of a prison camp. Tai-Pan was historical and every son and father can eventually identify with the main characters. Noble House was sort of like Dallas 2. But Shogun... you are looking at a masterpiece. And like a masterpiece, you can read it again and again.<br /><br />Get it.

B001JRB16U|5.0|A fantastic and magical family film, \\"Mary Poppins\\" continues to be a Disney classic that would win five Academy Awards and would be remembered for being a film that combined Disney's cartoon animation and real characters, the film debut of Julie Andrews but most of all, the spectacular chemistry and musical dance numbers featuring songs that continue to be classics.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />Mary Poppins was digitally restored and remastered in this 45th Anniversary Special Edition.  Although an older film, the remastering does look good for a film of its time.  Granted, I would love to see how this film would look on Blu-ray but  for DVD, the video looks very good.<br /><br />As for audio, the film's music and the dialogue comes out quite clear on my home theater.  Audio is presented in either Dolby Digital 5.1 or Original 2.0 Theatrical Mix.  The film sounds wonderful via Dolby Digital 5.1.  Music really comes alive but I didn't really notice all channels being utilized for those who were wondering but I did notice certain instruments being used in my front left and right channels of my stereo system which was nice.  But this is pretty much a dialogue and music-driven film and both come out quite clear.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This 45th Anniversary Edition of \\"Mary Poppins\\" is absolutely loaded with special features.  Included are:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and Richard Sherman recall the making of Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke did a commentary one one day, Karen Dotrice (plays the daughter in the film) and film and songwriter, Richard Sherman did a commentary on the following day.  Both commentaries are spliced together and done quite well.  What I found so fantastic is that Julie Andrews has not watched the complete film since the premiere back in 1964, so this was her first time watching it completely since then.  And to hear these talents just commenting on different parts of the film and what they remember of doing those scenes was just nostalgic and informative.  What a great commentary!<br />  * Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts--Select this option and fun-filled facts about the creation of this classic film pop up during viewing.<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />  * Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins--The definitive behind-the-scenes.  This 50+ minute featurette takes a look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.  Featuring interviews with the cast and learning so much about the film.  A great featurette.<br />  * Movie Magic--A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life.  For 1964, to combine both animation and live action film together and create this magical world was a technical marvel.  So, this featurette was also great to watch!<br />  * The Gala World Premiere--Footage from the Red Carpet.  This was aired on television as a one hour special but the footage had been lost.  Several minutes (not the complete version) of the archived film of this premiere was found in two countries, a black and white version and color and it was pieced together to create the 17+ minutes of footage from the red carpet premiere.<br />  * Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test - How Dick Van Dyke was made to look like the very old bank owner with make up and all.<br />  * Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film - From the original 1964 trailers, TV spots, Julie Andrews theater greetings and the re-issue trailers from 1974 and much more.<br />  * Mary Poppins Still Art Galleries - A lot of art was created for this film.  So, these are the still art galleries.<br /><br />Music & More<br /><br />  * Disney's Song Selection--The whole family can sing along to \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen. Each song can be selected separately or while watching the film.<br />  * Magical Musical Reunion--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and songwriter Richard Sherman reminisce about making Mary Poppins and the music that makes it so special.  A fantastic featurette especially to see them sing once more.  Fantastic!<br />  * A Musical Journey with Richard Sherman --A delightful magical journey through some of the film's locations with co-composer Richard Sherman, who reveals surprising secrets about the music of Mary Poppins along the way.  Another fantastic featurette with Richard Sherman revealing some tidbits about the songs used for the film and how Walt Disney reacted to some of the songs.<br /><br />Bonus Short<br /><br />  * The Cat That Looked at a King--Live action and animation bring a chapter of P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins Opens the Door to life! Julie Andrews takes viewers into a magical animated world created in the style of the whimsical chalk drawings in Mary Poppins.  This segment is about 10 minutes long.<br /><br />Deleted Song<br /><br />  * \\"Chimpanzoo\\"--A reconstruction of a song that did not appear in the movie using original storyboard and concept art, accompanied by a new rendition of the song performed by co-composer Richard Sherman.<br /><br />Backstage Disney:  Disney on Broadway<br /><br />  * Mary Poppins from Page to Stage --First a beloved children's book, then a classic movie and now a smash hit Broadway musical! Fans can follow the story of Mary Poppins from page to stage as the creative team and cast discuss the creation of the musical production and preparations for the upcoming North American tour*.<br />  * Step in Time--The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the never-before-filmed number \\"Step in Time\\" from the show.<br />  * Step in Time - A downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing \\"Step in Time,\\" featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.<br />  * Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley<br />  * Bob Crowley's Design Galleries--Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical<br /><br />\\"Mary Poppins\\" is definitely a true classic.  The film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and eventually winning five academy awards for Best Actress, Film Editing, Music Score, Music Song for \\"Chim-Chim-Cheree\\" and Special Visual Effects\\".<br /><br />It's hard to believe that in 1964, there were two major musicals being created \\"Mary Poppins\\" and \\"My Fair Lady\\", \\"My Fair Lady\\" which eventually went to Audrey Hepburn and \\"Mary Poppins\\" going to the unknown actress Julie Andrews.  It was probably a blessing that Julie Andrews wasn't cast for \\"My Fair Lady\\" since \\"Mary Poppins\\" really jumpstarted Andrews career and eventually winning her the Academy Award for Best Actress.<br /><br />Of course, actor Dick van Dyke was popular with his television series \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\" but these two talents and their musical performance were well done.  I was quite impressed by how both would nail their dances and have them in sync and Julie Andrews would comment how the most difficult part of the film was syncing their mouths to the song and making sure their foot would match for that moment.<br /><br />This film back in 1964 introduced a family film with state of the art technology at that time. Real life actors working together with animated humans and animals, the actors flying around and most importantly, the music that came from this film.  Classics such as \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\", the award winning song \\"Chim-Chim-Cheree\\", \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" and \\"Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)\\", to name a few.  But what I discovered by watching the special feature was how important it was for Walt Disney.<br /><br />\\"Mary Poppins\\" by P.L. Travers was created back in 1934 and for 20 years, Walt Disney would try unsuccessfully to get the rights for the film.  But he eventually managed to and while on one hand, really making sure the cast and the staff were well taken care of, it was quite surprising to know how much P.L. Travers actually detested the film (she wanted the animation to be eliminated).  So, there are interesting tidbits including audio that appears on the special features of Travers showing her discontent as an adviser to the film.  So, you get to learn more about this through a featurette on the DVD.  But it shows you how much Walt Disney really wanted \\"Mary Poppins\\" and how he tried so hard to get the rights to it.  But you really learned how much love went into the creation of this film and how much Walt Disney wanted this film to be loved.<br /><br />Just interesting details of how special he wanted this film, from giving people a chance such as signing Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman (the Sherman Brothers) to a contract to write and compose music for \\"Mary Poppins\\" (and future Disney films), casting an unknown Julie Andrews which Walt Disney loved her performance in \\"Camelot\\".  Disney wanted her to be Mary Poppins and despite her being pregnant at the time, he waited for her until after she gave birth to become part of the film.  Another tidbit was while meeting with Julie,  Walt Disney met her husband at the time, Tony Walton (a costume and set designer) and eventually giving him a chance to work on \\"Mary Poppins\\" (who also eventually inspired the Sherman Brothers for the music of \\"Winnie the Pooh\\").

So, you get to learn more about this through a featurette on the DVD.  But it shows you how much Walt Disney really wanted \\"Mary Poppins\\" and how he tried so hard to get the rights to it.  But you really learned how much love went into the creation of this film and how much Walt Disney wanted this film to be loved.    Just interesting details of how special he wanted this film, from giving people a chance such as signing Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman (the Sherman Brothers) to a contract to write and compose music for \\"Mary Poppins\\" (and future Disney films), casting an unknown Julie Andrews which Walt Disney loved her performance in \\"Camelot\\".  Disney wanted her to be Mary Poppins and despite her being pregnant at the time, he waited for her until after she gave birth to become part of the film.   Another tidbit was while meeting with Julie,  Walt Disney met her husband at the time, Tony Walton (a costume and set designer) and eventually giving him a chance to work on \\"Mary Poppins\\" (who also eventually inspired the Sherman Brothers for the music of \\"Winnie the Pooh\\").

B00006AFF5|4.0|This is a good adaptation of the classic.  The original will always be the best, but a live-action movie is good.  To turn 20 minutes into a 2-hour movie required a lot of added imagination, but does not take away from the original concept.
B000000OA6|5.0|Growing up Queen was always one of my favourite bands, and I still love them as much today. Very talented, never sounding like anyone else, excellent live band, it's too bad this CD is their swan song with Freddie. I loved Freddie Mercury, amazing voice, so talented. Some of these songs just make me want to cry cause you know what was happening at this time. There are a couple of songs that are just ok, but in all outstanding work, even Delilah(Freddie's song for one of his cats) is bittersweet.
B001FB55LM|4.0|I went to \\"Yes Man\\" with my 15 year old daughter just to pass the time, not expecting much based upon Jim Carrey's latest failures.  My daughter really enjoyed the movie and I was glad that I went.  The movie is predictable, but still very entertaining.  If you are a JC fan, then don't pass this one up.  I would highly recommend buying the soundtrack for the movie as well, it is very well done except for the glaring omission of the Journey song from the movie climax.  See the movie, buy the soundtrack, you will be pleased.
B000002KGT|5.0|\\"Rumours\\" is definitely a masterpiece and one of the very best works that Fleetwood Mac ever created. All of the songs are excellent and all could be considered hits. This is definitely a must-have Fleetwood Mac album, one of the essentials. I love it!
B000J10ER4|4.0|This is a good movie with 100 times better special effects than the 1977 version, yet it fails to capture the essence of Superman as the 1977 version did. This movie is yet an another example where superior special effects do not make up for inferior character development.<br /><br />What makes Superman super?<br /><br />Is he super because he can bend steel, fly faster than a plane, and run through walls? Would Superman be super if he had used his powers only for his personal gain?<br /><br />Superman, as the 1977 version so beautifully conveyed, brought hopes and dreams to youngsters during the Great Depression. Despite his powers, he is very human inside. He is capable of insecurity, anxiety, jealousy, love, and even hate. What sets him apart, however, is his willingness to do the right thing even when the tempation to do otherwise is great. He chooses to hide his powers and not use it for his personal gain. He chooses to sacrifice himself for humanity who often rejects him as an outcast. What makes Superman super is his unyielding moral character against all tribulations and temptations.<br /><br />The movie casts aside character development and relationships that make Superman story so compelling. Smallville, the TV version of Superman, is popular because it focuses on the trials and tribulations of becoming Superman. It also focuses on Superman's relationsips with his earth parents, his high school sweetheart and best friend, and his alien father Jarrell. This movie mostly fails to capture that magic.<br /><br />Lois Lane's character in this movie is too simple. This movie could have expounded the reasons why she loves Superman. Is it because he is such a good news story? Or is it because he has superpowers?<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent movie worth seeing. But too bad the movie could have been far better, deeper, and visceral if the producers had focused on the true super qualities of Superman.
B00062NEA0|3.0|This was my first viewing of the original cast series of films and while it contained beautiful visuals, there were too many lingering shots of space.<br /><br />I believe that at the time of the film's release it was more the novelty of the original cast re-uniting than the plot that brought people to the theaters.  Although interesting enough to keep my attention, it was very slow and this extended cut wasn't helping.<br /><br />Although I haven't see the theatrical cut, I can only imagine that instead of it taking 5-10 minutes for Kirk to reach the newly re-fitted Enterprise for the first time, it only takes 2-3 and that we do not watch every minute of the ships approach toward the mysterious cloud on the front view screen.<br /><br />The performances and story were much improved by the time the sequel was released.  There is no insight gained into the characters through this extra footage.
0060935464|5.0|This is one of the few books in my life that I treasure deeply. I have read it at least a dozen times. I am an avid reader and always have my next book lined up while I'm reading my current book (or books). A trainer at my gym, who always sees me reading, recently asked me if I had a favorite book and whithout hesitation I told him it was \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" I bought this copy for him and told him to pay it forward. I hope he sees the beauty in it. If you are considering reading this book for the first time, PLEASE do not hesitate. You will not be disappointed. It will fill your heart and it will stay with you the rest of your life.<br /><br />Peace
6300213803|5.0|I had always heard his movie was the best in the series, but wasn't sure if it could live up to the hype.  I'm happy to say it did.<br /><br />Each character is given their moment to shine in this finely crafted film that moves at a perfect pace to keep the audience enagaged. Best was the return of the humor between Kirk, Spock and Bones, while the villain actually posed a threat worthy of the crew's involvement.<br /><br />I am watching the series for the first time and am now looking forward to the continued adventure in The Search For Spock.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|When Supernatural started it started with a bang. From the first episode it had me. You learn about the brothers and family dynamics. Then when season 2 the brothers started to get on each others nerves and it show what siblings actually are like. Then in season 2 finale Sam died and Dean made a deal to bring him back to life if Dean would go to hell. I can't wait until Season 4.

B001MW0J2O|5.0|This is yet another wonderful album from Animal Collective.  The album is solid from start to finish, with a handful songs that are near impossible not to jump up and crazy dance to. I have found that my appreciation keeps growing for it the more I listen to it. In my opinion from Summertime clothes to Taste is the highlight of the album.  Summertime Clothes is enthusiastically catchy, it captures that glorious feeling of sunbeams caressing your body on a summer day.  It follows with Daily Routine, in which the transition flows excellently.  It's mellow but upbeat, with some mad electronic beats.   From there it rolls into Bluish, a beautiful song that is like being in an electronic underwater world.   The lyrics on Taste are exquisite. The beats have a rolling feel to it.  It poses the question \\"am I really all the things that are outside of me?\\"  Which I find fantastic.

B001MW0J2E|3.0|Overproduced and fluffy at the same time.  Kind of like the masters for an Animal Collective album got tangled-up with some new-age gift shop didgeridoo-doo.  It makes me sad.  Three stars because it is at least something different from Strawberry Jam, which was damn near perfect.  They were due for a clunker after a string of beauties, and this one is it.
B000000XB9|5.0|I listened to this hits package so many times I wore it out.  Amazing songs from one of rocks greatest bands to date.  Truly works of pure greatness.  CCR forever!
B000056HE9|5.0|OMG! I've watched this film or 30 plus years and still love it just as much every time I view it again.  Definitely worth your time to see.  If you haven't ever watched this movie - then you're really in for a treat.<br />Great acting, extremely enjoyable, heartwarming and a good lesson to be learned.  Just because it is an older film and there isn't a bunch of cursing and blowing things up you will not enjoy - trust me, you will.<br />Give it a chance and please check it out.

Her story is 'a searing spotlight into a surreal wonderland' that will continue to haunt and humble her readers for years.

B001MW0J2O|4.0|Here comes another solid record from the psych-pop standard bearers, Animal Collective. Because I could go off on a nonsensical tangent about a billion different things while talking about AC, I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. MPP is probably the band's most \\"accessible\\" record to date, which basically means that it is the record that will bring in the greatest number of new fans who don't want to work too hard for their music. The complexity and depth of previous works like Strawberry Jam and Sung Tongs is gone, paving the way for a more clear cut, Beach Boys-esque brand of sound, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Unfortunately, expect to see a lot of annoying new hipster fans at AC shows this time around; this record will no doubt bring in the crowds.<br /><br />8/10

This is a gripping and captivating story from one of my new favorite authors.  The story is not  pretty, but I would imagine it is true to his subject.  Stories such as these should make everyone who lives in America, or any other country that offers more freedom and peace to their citizens, extremely appreciative.  I loved learning about his homeland, both the good and the bad, and look forward to any of his future novels.

B001HZK8FO|5.0|I have owned this movie on DVD since it's original release and have watched it many times.  It is based on my favorite book (of the same name) and is an excellent adaptation!  When I first heard it was being released on Blu-Ray I was absolutely ecstatic!  I was so excited to see all the beautiful scenery in hi-def and I was NOT disappointed!  It was like watching it for the first time!      The gift set aspect of this makes it even more of a treasure!  It comes in a box reminiscent if a cigar box.  When opening it the first thing you see is the photo book.  It is hard cover and spiral bound.  It has pics from the movie, character descriptions and a breif retelling of the events in the movie.  That is the first half of the book.  The second half is blank pages for you to fill in with your own pictures and memories from your personal love story.      The Blu-Ray disc is on the last page of the book.  I'm always worried about getting movies where the disc is in a special case because these alway break on me and then I have no way of replacing them so my discs always get scratched.  But this seems very sturdy so I doubt I'll have any problems with it.      Behind the book is an envelope that contains the adhesive corners to attach your photos, two sheets of stickers and two beautiful (but very small) laminated bookmarks.      Behind the envelope you will find a set of 16 notecards and envelopes.  These, too, are beautiful but all 16 cards are of the same design.  I was hoping they would have diferent pictures on them and that they would be folded cards.  They all have the same picture (featuring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gossling's back.  The scene where they are in the row boat)and are more like postcards than notecards.  This is my only complaint with the gift set.  And as you can see by my rating, it is a VERY minor complaint.      I was able to get this at a local video store who must have accidentally put it out a day early.  I am absolutely pleased with this purchase and would recomment it to anyone who loves love stories!  Get it, you won't be disappointed!
B001F12J48|3.0|[[ASIN:B001F12J48 The Polar Express Presented in 3-D]. As with the original movie, the theme was excellent but I was not impressed with the 3D effect. It often distorted color and created too much visual  interference which quickly led to eye fatigue. I was glad that the DVD set also included a disk of the original movie. We switched to it and thoroughly enjoyed the magical ride.
B000EU1PKA|3.0|This a a good album by Helloween, the first without Kai Hansen (and better than anything realeased in the Andi Deris era...)<br /><br />There are awkward moments (like \\"Heavy Metal Hamsters\\"), but the opener \\"Kids of The Century\\" and \\"The Chance\\" are real killers.<br /><br />A good album to get, since this edition is also remastered.
1574535811|5.0|In my opinion Dr Campbell wrote one of the most important books of this century.  His writing style is excellent; the results of his studies, as well as others, make an overwhelming case for a vegan diet in order to maintain or recover a healthy body.  After 38 years of being a lacto-vegetarian I am finally convinced that a vegan diet is essential to maintaining a healthy body.  I am thankful for this work.
B00006CXSS|4.0|We were given this set on video many years ago for Christmas.  My husband wanted it on DVD so he could watch it on our portable DVD player whenever he wanted without disturbing anyone else.  It is a great story, especially for those that like history as my husband does.  He is a big fan of WWII and when we were stationed in Japan, we acquired the Victory at Sea series and have watched it many times over the years.  For those that would like to learn more about the reality of WWII, I highly recommend either one of the these series.
B00127RAJY|1.0|No-one should ever do jumping jacks for any reason! It puts too much stress on the whole spine especially the lower back and also the hips, knees and ankles as well.  It is irresponsible with all the information and education available to allow this type of exercise in any workout. It would not be as bad if it was labeled a workout for people who are not overweight - or if it had a disclaimer stating \\"may cause back, hip, knee problems\\".
0545128285|5.0|Like most Fairy Tales, this book teaches lessons of life.  The stories of coarse, reflect the Harry Potter series of books, but as in those stories, there is always true life lessons.  The stories themselves are cute and interesting but I have to say the narratives from Dumbeldoor are even better.  As a reader of the Harry Potter books, I had to have this one to round out my collection.  It ties the stories together.  Read it to your children or grandchildren, then ask them what they think about the stories.  It'll be fun.
0810970686|4.0|My 8YO son could not wait to get this book. There's lots of humor and interesting observations from a child's perspective. These books are written like a diary (like the title says). There is not much of a story line. That doesn't seem to matter. My son and his friends all think they are great. I like them because the kids enjoy them and I haven't seen anything that is not age-appropriate in the books. The simple style they are written in also makes them appealing. The illustrations look a lot like some of the artwork my son and his friends come up with. The kids seem to really relate to these books.    Your kid doesn't have to be a \\"wimpy kid\\" to enjoy these books. I think every kid feels like a \\"wimpy kid\\" sometimes and these books bring the feelings out into the open.    Great read, enjoy!
B00006AG5N|5.0|I'm a baby boomer....grew up listening to Elvis...and I've been looking for a CD of his greatest hits.  I love this compilation of his songs.  The sound is fantastic.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this movie, but by the third song (if you count the abbreviated \\"I Have a Dream\\" in the opening as a full song), I had suspended all disbelief (the plot is, admittedly, rather contrived) and was completely enjoying the heck out of this show.  Suddenly, all these old Abba songs from my youth (I was still in single-digits during most of the '70s) came rushing back, and I couldn't help but sing along.  My six-year-old son has been singing bits and pieces of \\"Mamma Mia\\" ever since!  This movie isn't particularly profound (although, as a mother of two girls who are growing up too quickly, the song \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" was quite poignant) -- if you're looking for that, see \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" (an outstanding movie that horribly reveals to anyone who didn't pay attention -- which was most of the world -- the terribly real extremes of man's inhumanity to man).  \\"Mamma Mia\\" is, however, quite entertaining, and the events play out to a happy ending for all the main characters.  Thanks for the music, Abba!

0152048049|5.0|A good friend introduced me to \\"The Little Prince\\" (original English translation) when I was still in college ... I remember enjoying the book back then.  20 years later, I added the new translation to my Amazon wish list, and voila! my wish was granted.  Several other reviewers have posted negative comments on the new translation, considering the words selected by translator Richard Howard as inferior to the words selected for the earlier edition(s).  However, I have to wonder what the Little Prince himself would think of quibbles about word choice ... is it not the thought behind the words that is most important?  I think that Howard's words better than adequately tell the tale, with all its full meaning ... a meaning understood by children, but possibly only fully appreciated by adults (at least in my case -- I enjoyed the story as a 20-year-old, but only fully see the irony in the planet-hopping personality studies and the extraordinary value of the fox and the rose now that I'm a parent and no longer living in my own egocentric little world).  I think this is a story worth reading, regardless of the translator.  Enjoy!

0684833395|5.0|\\"Catch  22\\" is unlike any other book I've ever read.  It is hilarious, absurd, shocking, disturbing, and one hell of a ride.  I can understand why it holds such a place of high esteem in the canon of 20th Century Literature.  The story revolves around John Yossarian, an American bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean, during World War II. Yossarian no longer wants to fly missions, and attempts to find a way to get out of further bombing runs.  The problem is catch-22, the unwritten, unofficial rule that states that an insane crewman can be grounded from missions, and a man who willingly continues to fly combat missions must be insane.  However, if he makes the necessary formal request to stop flying such missions, the very act of filing the request proves that he is sane and, therefore, is ineligible to be grounded.  Caught on this bureaucratic hook, Yossarian keeps flying missions while Colonel Cathcart, the squadron commander, keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly before they can go home.  This is one of many bureaucratic absurdities that Yossarian encounters, and the ridiculousness of bureaucracy in war is one of the major themes in this book.<br /><br />Bureaucracy can create a unique type of madness in war.  Trivialities (such as clerical errors) grow to be of extreme importance, while critical matters (matters of life and death) are marginalized.  Soldiers are marched off to their doom with a false sense of duty, bravado, and patriotism, worrying about trivial matters, while giving no thought to survival.  Yossarian labels this for what it is - insanity - and decides that to survive in an insane world, one must become insane.  His insane survival techniques lead to some truly enlightening moments of lunacy, which are quite fun.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Catch 22\\" is biting, satirical, and has some truly hilarious moments.  Heller uses slapstick humor and situations to get across the esprit de corps that soldiers in combat share.  However, as the story progresses, it suddenly spirals from the comically absurd to the brutally cruel and irrational.  In the last few chapters, the story takes a steep emotional drop that catches the reader by surprise, dragging them off a cliff into a dark emotional abyss.  The story's sudden and abrupt turns to the cruelty, inhumanity, and unfairness of war is done in an understated manner which amplifies the irrationality of the situation.  The reader comes away feeling the anguish and despair that Yossarian feels as his friends die, disappear, or commit atrocities abhorrent to Yossarian.<br /><br />Heller does an excellent job of communicating the inhumanity of war and the madness of bureaucracy in war.  He shows that a bureaucracy, ran by cruel or insane men, can utterly destroy the rights of an individual, sometimes with the passive or active assistance of the individual themselves.  The circular, non-linear story line is a little off-putting, but it allows for the reader to view situations from several different points of view which gives enhanced breadth and depth to the story..

B001CDLATE|1.0|From reading various posts on other sites, it appears that there is a known problem with this Blu-Ray title. I don't know if it is a bad batch of discs or what. When I play the disc on my Samsung BD-P2550 with the latest firmware as of 1/19/2009, it freezes in Ch 18 in the scene showing the Egyptian ruins. I am unable to move forward and get the player to continue. I have to return to the menu and then select Ch 20 to be able to get past the problem. I requested a replacement from Amazon and received it. The replacement does the same thing. I don't know whether to return it again or not.     Other that that, I love this disc. The cinematography is beautiful. I would give it 5 stars instead of 1 if I could get this issue resolved.
1419551795|5.0|The book covers problems of all possible kinds and has very good practice content. The difficulty level might be slightly higher than that of the actual exam - but precisely for that reason, it will prepare you very well for a high score. The explanations for each problem solution and also the theory in every chapter is comprehensive and descriptive. While you practice, its important to read the explanations for the answers you got wrong and ALSO for the answers you got right - make sure you got them right for the right reasons.     The theory in the Sentence Correction chapter was especially useful. Even for the Data Sufficiency problems in Quant, the problems given in this book are well-chosen examples. If you get comfortable with the methodology to solve problems of every kind in this book (plus the OG11 official GMAT guide) I believe you would not have any surprises in the actual exam.     Wish you good luck!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|If you are a history buff, then this is the mini series to watch. It gives you insight to how things happened and what the relationships to each person. School only touched the surface. This will excite you. I wish I had seen this in school. I hope they do this for other famous heros and heroines. This mini series may get you back to your roots and to what all the fuss is about. I purchased sets and gave them as Christams gifts this year. Actually I think it should be a prerequisite to run for office! :)
0920668364|5.0|a picture books about the love between mother and child. I found it a bit strange, when she went through his window to rock eventhough he was a grown man, but it fitted in with the rest of the story.  The ending was beautiful
0061562408|5.0|This book is amazingly written.  It is a book you do not want to put down, it sucks you in.  The chapters are short so if you are trying to read, \\"just one more chapter before bed\\" it is easily done.  Told from the dogs point of view makes this book wonderful for any pet owner past or present.  The Art of Racing in The Rain is a book I will definitely read again!!!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|It's a short film, it's a musical, it's silly as all hell and not meant to be taken seriously in any way. If you can understand all of that going in, then you should enjoy Whedon's \\"for fun\\" project he put together with almost no budget on borrowed sets during the writers strike. I'm sure most of us can agree that we'd like to see more projects with Nathan Fillion and Neil Patrick Harris in them and this project uses both of them in roles you haven't seen them play before. Remember folks, it's just for fun.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Shockingly good picture quality for a comedy. In fact, it would be great for any genre.  A satire of Hollywood convention, conceit, and phony sanctimony with demo quality visuals?   Seriously -- most of it is that good.  Fine natural grain throughout, didn't see any halos or ringing, blacks, shadow, and contrast extremely satisfying and well handled. Perfectly resolved ultra fine detail everywhere, three dimensional jungle scenery. It's true that there is a lot of tasteless humor here, but most of it is in the service of a larger point about Hollywood. I found it more of a consistent smiler than a laugher and some of the pee-pee-caca seemed a little gratuitous, but  nit-picking aside, no matter what you think of the movie, are you looking for a comedy with demo quality visuals to show off your blu-ray set-up?  You've found it here.
0783226888|5.0|THE JACKAL 1997    With a cast like Sidney Poitier, Bruce Willis and Richard Gere, THE JACKAL is a compelling film.  Michael Carlton-Jones' direction is well done.  The screenplay by Chuck Pfarrer is well crafted.  Carter Burrell's music adds the right tones-catchy and subtle.    It was a fine day when Sidney Poitier at 70 could play the FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston with such vigor and excitement, especially in the closing scenes where he becomes the hero.  His scenes with Declan Mulqueen showed a growing friendship between the well disciplined Carter and the complex Mulqueen.  When Sidney Poitier is in a film, it is a rare pleasure to watch this distinguished actor at his craft.    Richard Gere as Declan Mulqueen gave a performance of an IRA member with a heart, especially for his lost love Isabella.  There was a sadness quality to Mulqueen which Gere played so well.  The moments with Major Valentia Koslova were humorous and touching.    Of course, Bruce Willis playing the Jackal with a zest of coldness and emotionless added a motif throughout the film that a man with no conscience could do horrible things for the sake of money or just the plain joy of killing.  When the Jackal could kill another person and continued with his meal, revealed a man with no remorse- a human quality which sets a person apart from the savage animal who kills for pure joy.  It was this joy of killing that made the Jackal a man who could only be stopped by killing him.       The history between the Jackal and Mulqueen was touched on in the film first half.  It was when the two of them met again at the Chicago marina where one saw the dead chill between the two of them.  Without a word but with a look, these two men shared a past and a pure hatred for each other. The climatic chase and shootout in the subway was a thrilling ride until the very last moment with an unexpected twist.    A comment has to be made about Jack Black.  His Ian Lamont's performance was classic Jack Black.  Hisscenes with the Jackal were priceless, especially the last one.    Overall, this is a well done film.  Violent.  Sometimes bloody.
031606792X|5.0|I am a 37 year old mother of 3.  Never even heard of Twilight until my 20 year old Babysitter told me about it.  She also told my oldest daughter about and then the rest is history.  After seeing the movie, and the love story \\"addict\\" I am, I had to read the books.      I think that Breaking Dawn was the BEST way to end this series.  If you love true romance, you always want a happy ending and this book did just that!      My one concern is how they are going to handle this movie.  My daughter is a pre-teen right now and if the movie for this book was out she would NOT be able to see it.  Of course, they can down play the movie but you would really take away from the book.  That is going to be tricky.    But still yet, loved the series, loved the stories, loved the characters....What more can I say.  Way to end it all...with a HAPPY ENDING!!!
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Just awesome quality you'd expect from Pixar.  The Blu-ray is reference quality and sound is just amazing.  Buy it Buy it Buy it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been using Jillian's Thirty Day Shred for a couple weeks and not only has she been kicking my butt, she's also been part of helping me lose 5 pounds using level one and two and mixing it up with my treadmill and better eating. My body should be toned and ready to go when I run my first 10k in May after I reach my goal of a forty pound weight loss!
B001BR5F4C|5.0|I love the DVDs!  Perfect picture, no scratches- arrived in no time.  VERY FAST SHIPPING!
B00129H7VS|5.0|So I had bought Band of Brothers last year on dvd and enjoyed it very much, but then Blu-Ray struck. I sold the dvds and bought the blu rays, and what a difference! The sound, picture, and features of the blu ray trump the very good dvd version. The crown jewel of the Blu Ray is the bonus feature \\"In the Words of Easy Company\\", which allows the viewer to listen to commentary from the real soldiers as we watch their characters in each episode. Actually hearing Dick Winters speak of an event while we watch a recreation of that event is brilliant, and truly completes the experience. All in all, the dvd version of Band of Brothers is very good, but if you've got a few extra bucks and a blu ray player, go for the blu ray edition.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|It's something that doesn't happen too often.  Corny yet it's a cornyness they go with.  The music is great and the story throws ya.  I wish it was longer, but I love it the way it is.  It's a definate buy for the goofy one in you.
B0013D8LCW|3.0|Cute actors who do a pretty good job but the plot was way too preditable and boring.
B0001US62I|4.0|\\"Angel Heart\\" is a very sordid story. I usually don't go for that sort of thing, but there are a lot of other good things about this movie that made me add this to my collection.  I just watched it last night, for the fourth time.    One of the attractions is the outstanding cinematography and camera-work in here, made even better by this special edition enhanced-for-widescreen DVD transfer. This is a film with big-time visual appeal and is wonderfully directed. I just marveled at what I was seeing, shot-after-shot.    I liked the old film-noir type atmosphere in the story, which is an interesting one overall.    There are no really good-guy characters in this film. Mickey Rourke plays the star of the movie: private eye \\"Harry Angel.\\" He's somewhat of a low-life but so is everyone else. Lisa Bonet looks spectacular and has a steamy sex scene in here. Robert De Niro gets big billing but he doesn't have that many lines in this movie.    The ending of this modern-day film noir has a very unique twist to it, but it's certainly not a satisfying one.  That's all I can say without spoiling it for you who have not seen the film.
B000UZ4G8M|4.0|This CD has an eclectic mix of songs - which I really liked. I have since transferred most of them onto my iPod and listen to them while I work. Looking forward to the next CD!
0143038419|4.0|It is a good book so far. I have not gotten as far into it as I would like. the short chapters make me feel as if I have accomplished something. This book will make a good argument paper for my AP LANG class.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Want to know what life will be like in a couple of years.  Watch and learn.
0525951113|5.0|I loved this book - once I got started I couldn't put it down.  It is so refreshing to read a book that doesn't abuse technology but rather handles it accurately and raises interesting questions about the possibilities.<br /><br />I've developed a reflex to cringe when many books or films approach anything to do with tech.  Finally one of our own has written something that handles the topic with intelligence and knowledge.<br /><br />Of course it is a thriller and things are pushed out to the max - but rather than being ridiculous or stupid, these possibilities are intriguing and fun.  Awesome, awesome book.
0312427646|5.0|I loved this book.  This is the funniest book I've read in years.  Delicious.  Delightful. As light as a souffle, but with a wicked mischievous bite.
006056251X|3.0|Despite being unimpressed with the other books in this series, I was looking forward to reading Devil in Winter, partly because it seemed the most popular, and partly because Evie Jenner was my favorite out of the four Wallflowers.  I was also intrigued by the seemingly incongruous pairing of shy Evie with a the purportedly ruthless villain.  Unfortunately, Evie's character isn't much dealt with in this story.  The Devil in Winter is mostly about St. Vincent and his path to redemption.  It's a bright, fun read that is alternately hot and heart warming.  St. Vincent isn't nearly the evil cad he pretends to be, (there's not much in the way of his so called redemption), and Evie is the gentle, ministering angel that brings him into the light.  I guess some concessions are made to anguished remorse on his part, and reservations regarding his capacity for fidelity on hers, but really those are incidental, no more than the smallest of hiccups on this smooth, easy ride to true love and happiness - if you don't go into this book expecting more than that, then you will have a good time reading it.  Besides that, I don't see what's so special about this book.
0743497465|5.0|Great book...I loved the occasional bits and pieces of factual military and governmental tidbits spread out throughout the book, all tied in nicely to the storyline. Brown's writing definitely improved with his third installment, as nothing was predictable, and yet I didn't feel at any moment bored, or that he was dragging anything on too far. The only complaint I have is that the book did tend to bog down a bit with scientific details, in the same Tom Clancy OCD with military details, but that didn't drag down from the great quality of the story. Great book with believable characters and a story that hooked me from page 1
1416909532|5.0|Every mother should give their daughter this gift of wisdom so they know it's not just happening to them.
0312944926|4.0|This book is defintiely Brown's freshmen attempt at writing a novel, as no more apparent than several points of lazy character and plot development in the book (ala David Becker in Seville magically sumbling upon Meagan). However, it drew me into the story like no other author has done in quite a while, and I can not wait to read his next few attempts
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|There have been many, \\"greatest hits,\\" collections of Donna Summer's music throughout the years and unfortunately Donna Summer was labeled the queen of disco, and dismissed as a relic of that time.    It may be that she took too long to release a new album, yet listening to Crayons, that is understood. A great album takes time.    Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, and Donna Summer are just a few recording  artists that released quality recordings in '08.    I like Crayons, because of its diversity and also, its relevancy with dance and pop music released in the past few years.     Donna Summer, has done it again. I look forward to her next album, hopefully sooner rather than later.    All the songs on Crayons, were co-written by Donna Summer. Outstanding tracks include, Stamp Your Feet, I'm A Fire and Sand On My Feet.
0385339585|4.0|Great book that flowed well. This being my first Grisham novel, the writing was extremely polished, with vivid descriptions all around. The flow of the book was a bit dull in points, but what made this book a great read was that the dull parts actually reflected the simplier Indian life that the main character pursued all along. From a non-Christian author, I was pleasently surprised at how missionary life was portrayed along with a wordly lifestyle compared with a heavenly one. Good book!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is one of the few CDs that I can listen to beginning to end, over and over, and never tire of!  Gavin is a genius song writer that manages to tug at your emotions with every single note!  I highly recommend this, and any CD, by him!
0312330871|3.0|Decent mystery book. Didn't have a chance to get into it fully as quickly as I would have liked, and it seemed to match something that I would find on any run of the mill television series which might have been my problem. Regardless, it conveyed a well written personal touch of each of the characters, and drew me into the story enough to lament their respective deaths, which is really the goal of the book anyway
B00129H7VS|5.0|This Blu-Ray release of Band Of Brothers is what made me finally go to Blu-Ray. I got it for the rock-bottom price of $35, which I would have paid more. Unfortunately, with the economy the way it is, I had to keep it cheap. I was lucky enough to be able to buy a new computer with a 21\\" LCD screen that was Blu-Ray capable, so that is my only limitation to watching this. I have an older 52\\" Rear-projection TV that is not HDCP, so I look forward to the day when I can watch this on a big screen and using my home theater speakers.
0316017922|5.0|In \\"Outliers\\" Malcom Gladwell studies and discusses the \\"ecology of success\\" and to a lessor degree the \\"ecology of failure.\\"  Some people reach their potential, some succeed above what they thought was capable, some fall short, sometimes far short, of what they could have achieved.  This isn't confined to job titles, and income.  Reaching or not reaching potential can happen or not happen in a variety of life's situations.  (Another question can be, how does a person even know if they've reached their potential in life? But that's another question.)    \\"Outliers\\" touches on a variety of areas.  It's a quick and easy read, that reinforces Gladwell's curiosity and free-flowing writing style.  This book at times reminds me of the phenomena in \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" by Taleb.      I agree that in addition to an individual's innate gifts, talents, and ambition, that a major factor in one's achievement professionally, economically, and socially is: a person's attitude, family, culture, luck, timing, situations/circumstances, and exposure to successful people and/or mentors, for guidance and encouragement.  Also critical, is recognizing and seizing the opportunities that present itself in front of you.      An example that comes to mind is Malcom Gladwell's own background.  You can make assumptions about how his life would be different today if he stayed, grew up, and was educated in Jamaica.  Where would he be today?  What job would he do?  What would he know?  Would he be an author?    When people call themself a \\"self-made\\" man or women, they are often self-congratulating him or herself.  Jeb Bush, From a wealthy Ivy League family is the son of a President, brother of a President, and grandson of a Senator  He called himself \\"A self-made man.\\"  Is he?     Gladwell claims the core foundation of what made these people \\"Outliers,\\" is the \\"10,000 hour rule.\\"  For a person to be a master at any craft or discipline, they must have the motivation and drive, and also the 10,000 hours to practice, learn, and hone their craft.  Makes perfect sense.  If you focus on 4 hours of work per day (actual task based specific work, not the typical 8+ hour day), you reach the 10-Thousand hour mark at ten years.      Genetic Determinism + Cultural Determinism.    Yes, some people are more gifted by genetics than others.    And Cultural Determinism is only an obstacle if a person blindly accepts it, or fails to take steps to circumvent cultural restrictions.      The most positive aspect I found was that in the majority of crafts, professions, and occupations, it's drive, tenacity, and mental focus to \\"get good at something,\\" that propels these people to be Outliers.  The author cites that Outlier people often do not come from Ivy League institutions or from elitist backgrounds (although many do, the majority actually don't.)      Look at any profession or trade you've personally come into contact with: think of the people you've known (or not known, but read about) that were at the top-tier of their trade, or profession.  How did they get there?  Not because of the piece of paper they received many years prior to achieving \\"success.\\"  Obviously we know that intelligence alone does not guarantee achievement, as attitude, persistence, and Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Practical Intelligence are significant factors.    So of course, you will find common sense and many things most of us are intuitively aware of in \\"Outliers.\\"  But it's still very interesting (to me) and people who dabble into these books occasionally.        STUDY OF FAILURES:    Some failures are noted also. A fatal Korean plane crash was because of mis-communication due to cultural deference from the co-pilots to the Captain.  The Captain couldn't understand ground control.  It was an unnecessary lack of direct inter-personal communication.  Once this was discovered as a cultural issue, procedures in communication were changed.  In the \\"ecology of failure,\\" humans adapt.     This bookhas spurred debate about superior East Asian math scores Gladwell links to thousands of year of rice farming, which he claims is linked to cultural perceptions about work, etc.  Rice farming requires one to be persistent and methodical.  East Asian students will work longer on a math equation to solve it, even when the task is not only difficult, but not entirely understood in the beginning.  An American will quit trying to solve the task in a much shorter time.  Gladwell sees this as a difference in not only *how* to approach a task or problem (to, figure it out), but also as a difference in persistence.    In sum, many readers will peruse and challenge Gladwell's methodology and his arguments.  This is needed for any book, in any circumstance.    This is a book that makes you think.  It's good for teens who are finding their way, as they discover their interests, talents, likes and dislikes. It's important for people not to sell themselves short, and follow the path that mainstream society often lays out for you, in all areas of life.    \\"Outliers is an easy-read that stokes your curiosity, but at the same time it's a coffee table book if you only have a few minutes or more.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|The show is amazing.    The commentary on this season is HILARIOUS!!!!!!  I laughed out loud - it is so brilliant.  Anything with Vincent Kartheiser or Jon Slattery commenting will have you in stitches.  John Hamm is good, too.  Elisabeth is a little boring.    The only sad part is that the commenters are not all in a room together - there's usually separate recordings that have been edited together - but thank goodness Slattery and Hamm were there on the same day because they are so funny together.
6305308659|5.0|This movie was written, produced, and directed by Gary Ross, who also produced another successful movie, Seabiscuit (2003). Pleasantville is a comedy drama in which two teenagers; David Wagner (Tobey Maguire) and his twin sister Jennifer Wagner (Reese Witherspoon) physically move-back in time to 1950s into a town called the Pleasantville, which is actually a setting for a 1950s television show (shown in black and white).<br /><br />David Wagner and his sister Jennifer are two different individuals. Jennifer is concerned mainly with relationships and popularity, while David spends most of his spare time on the couch, watching television. While their mother (Jane Kaczmarek) is on vacation with her boyfriend, Jennifer and David fight for the control of TV, then a mysterious TV repairman (Don Knotts) shows up uninvited, and quizzes David on Pleasantville before giving him a strange-looking remote control which transports them back in time into Pleasantville in the Parkers' living room. They acquire the roles of two teenagers in the family of George (William H. Macy) and Betty Parker (Joan Allen) who have two children of same age; Bud and Mary Sue Parker. The setting says it all; the town is conservative, women stayed at home, took care of home and children, and men went to work. Typically teenage dating is limited to going to a movie and eating at local burger joint. Holding hands is perhaps the most romantic and sexual behavior practiced at that time. Jennifer gets bored with life and introduces her boyfriend Skip (Paul Walker) into a fast lane promoting sexual promiscuity. Soon the entire town comes to know that all teenagers of town are hanging out at Lover's Lane. The town start to change; large size beds become available in stores, colored paints show up on walls, and the women start to gossip. People in Pleasantville begin to explore hidden abilities and revel in their new freedoms. Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), the owner of local burger joint, and the boss of Bud Parker begins to paint, and Betty Parker always had a \\"soft corner\\" for Johnson. She finds out about the \\"happenings\\" in town by having a conversation with her daughter Mary Sue. The conversation is intimate and personal;<br /><br />Betty Parker: Mary Sue?<br />Jennifer: Yeah?<br />Betty Parker What goes on up at Lover's Lane?<br />Jennifer: What do you mean?<br />Betty Parker: Well, you hear these things lately... kids spending so much time up there. Uh, is it holding hands? That kind of thing<br />Jennifer: Yeah! That and...<br />Betty Parker: What?<br />Jennifer: It doesn't matter.<br />Betty Parker: No, I wanna know.<br />Jennifer: Well, sex.<br />Betty Parker: Oh. What's sex?<br />[After Mary Sue explains to Betty about sex]<br />Jennifer: Are you okay?<br />Betty Parker: Um, yes. It's, uh, just that your father would never do anything like that.<br />Jennifer: Ahhhh.<br />Betty Parker: Mmm.<br />Jennifer Well, you know, Mom, there are other ways to enjoy yourself... without Dad.<br /><br />Betty Parker peruses her inner side, to be romantic and to be herself soon revolts against the daily chores and leaves her husband and start having an affair with Johnson, and his nude painting of Betty Parker posted on the wall of his diner makes the town real angry. Mayor Big Bob and the men of town are disgusted at the decay of moral values declare the \\"Pleasantville Code of Conduct\\", a list of rules preventing people from playing loud music, or using paint colors other than black, white or gray. Eventually Bud Parker makes his father and the mayor, understand that they have hidden feelings they must pursue that and live \\"freely.\\" Betty and George make up and Bud goes back into the future, his original home. Some of the critical dialogues (conversations) are cleverly written. In one conversation in which George persuades Betty to change to old traditional ways, the conversation is as follows:<br /><br />Betty Parker [Betty is in color (signifies liberated woman), George isstill black & white (signifies conservative)]: George, look at me. Look at my face. That meeting is not for me.<br />George Parker: You'll put on some make-up.<br />Betty Parker: I don't want to put on make-up.<br />George Parker: It'll go away. It goes away.<br />Betty Parker: [firmly] I don't want it to go away (meaning she doesn't want to change her liberated look and she wants to keep it).<br /><br />The movie ends with a shot of Betty and George reunited (sitting side by side); however, when Betty turns to look at her husband she sees Johnson, a some what bold move on the part of writers and the director. In spite if making up with her husband she expresses her true feelings for Johnson with whom she is clearly in love. This is an excellent movie; at times it gets very sensual, but tackles some old values in a gentle and sometimes clever conversation. This film is highly recommended.<br /><br />1.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|First off I fell in love with Pam, played by Kristen Bauer. She could take all my blood and I would die happy. Okay, that said. The only thing I found annoying with the show was the weakness of the vampires. I've read books and saw movies regarding silver being a type of 'bad thing' for vampires, but never liked the idea. I always left that precious metal for werewolves.<br /><br />Eddie, for instance, he was the vampire they kidnapped and were going to drain, was a prime example. Unlike Bill, who tore down a whole darn house and said, \\"well, I'm pretty strong,\\" Eddie just couldn't get loose of those bindings. I just couldn't get past that.<br /><br />Will I watch next season? Yes. I'll be there. I'll just put all the negativity aside and enjoy.
B00005U122|5.0|This is little know Roger Waters album done live in Portland, Oregon.  I first saw it on PBS and was so impressed that quicklly ordered the DVD. (not sure if a CD is available)  He does songs from 3-4 Pink Floyd albums.  It's a lot of the same band as the Live in Berlin album.  It is now in my top two along with Pulse....maybe better.
B000NY133G|1.0|This book is drivel, pure and simple.  The author obviously wished for money and, proving that the concept works, has made tons of it.  Oh, it wasn't sufficient to just decide that money would start appearing in her mailbox (one of the examples in the book), she had to invent a fairy tale and sell a book to a bunch of suckers, THEN money started appearing in her mailbox.  (I got the book as a gift from one such sucker).

OK entertainment, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overt the top with the PC.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Very interesting series, but would likely only make sense if you have seen the first and second seasons. Most episodes have an independent story, but there is a larger story, a thread if you will, in the backdrop which you need to be aware of to make sense of it all.    I really enjoyed watching this series and can't wait for the release of the next season on dvd.

B00005JLCI|5.0|This version of Hamlet offers the definitive version of Hamlet's \\"To be or not to be\\" speech, making it very clear the prince is debating murder, not suicide as some have claimed. The cinematic sweep shows Mr. Branagh's astounding talents in yet another dimension, as director. Were I castaway on a remote island for life, this is one of the few films I'd want to take with me, to see over and over again. I'd actually pick this \\"Hamlet\\" over Branagh's other masterpiece, \\"Henry V.\\" Viewers of this film owe it to themselves to watch another Branagh movie that should have swept the Academy Awards, \\"Dead Again.\\" [[ASIN:6305882525 Dead Again]]
B001DXS4E2|4.0|This movie has long been a Christmas tradition in our family. Even our children, now grown, have made it part of their families' tradition. I was very excited when I saw on Amazon that it was available in color. I ordered it right away and couldn't wait for it to arrive. Seeing it in color for the first time was like seeing a new movie. We watched it New Years Eve, which was a great way to start off the year. I'm hoping next year we'll be watching another Christmas classic in color, \\"Christmas in Connecticut\\".

The acting and directing are great, even more amazing considering that much of the filming was done using blue-screen backgrounds and stand-ins for the robots, who were created later using computer generated figures. Bridget Moynahan pulled off her role brilliantly. She became a scientist involved in a puzzling crime, instead of looking like a strident feminist or a hot bod mouthing lines she didn't understand. Will Smith was amazing and fluid as always. Even the minor (human) characters sparkled.
B00068TJM6|5.0|The watch is a masterpiece. Nice finish and well design. I cannot stop watching it for the first couple of days after I got it.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|Animal Collective are one of the most acclaimed indie bands around.  They're also one of the most polarizing.  You don't often hear someone say, \\"Animal Collective?  Meh.  They're okay.\\"  It's either, \\"Man, they're freaking awesome,\\" or \\"Ya, I just don't get it.  What's the appeal?\\"  I was a longtime member of the latter group until about a year ago.  Admittedly, I hadn't heard too much of their stuff, what I had heard was mostly their oldest (read: weirdest) stuff, and I had never really given them the time of day.  Then I heard the song \\"#1\\" from the album 'Strawberry Jam' and really liked it.  I listened to the rest of the album and it all just clicked.  From there, I fell in love with the band, dutifully scrounging up their past albums.    It was with great anticipation that I listened to 'Merriweather'.  I had never heard any live versions of these songs at all before playing this album.  I went in with completely virgin ears, free of any expectations or preconceived notions.  IMO, this is their greatest album to date, and frankly, it isn't even close.  That says more about the quality of MPP then it does of their previous albums.    This has more of an \\"electronic\\" sound (for lack of a better word) than past albums.  It's not electro-pop or anything like that (maybe \\"Summertime Clothes\\" is), but it is very bassy and beat driven.  You could almost put this on for a dance party (almost.)  I could even imagine an avant garde hip-hop artist rhyming over some of these beats.  After finding out that this album was produced by Ben Allen, who has worked with the likes of Gnarls Barkley, P. Diddy, and Christina Aguilera, it made total sense.    It starts off mellow enough, with the wonderful \\"In the Flowers.\\"  It's all beautiful ambiance until about 2:00 in, when Avey Tare says the words, \\"If I could just leave my body for a night.\\"  Then all hell breaks loose.  Huge, epic, bassy, synthy awesomeness ensues, until it all simmers back down towards the end.      \\"My Girls\\" is probably the catchiest song they've ever recorded, with an amazing, club-ready beat and a chorus of: \\"I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status/I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls,\\" followed by a sick drum fill and a shrieking \\"Woooo!\\" that would make Ric Flair proud.  Not sure if it was intentionally meant to be ironic or not, but I couldn't help but notice that a \\"social status\\" isn't really a material thing at all, while \\"four walls and adobe slats\\" most certainly are material.  Maybe I'm just over-analyzing.  Either way, you'll be re-playing that song over and over in your head for some time after hearing it.    \\"Summertime Clothes\\" just might be AC's answer to M83's masterful album from 2008, 'Saturdays=Youth'.  The first 30 seconds sound very similar to the beginning of the Battles song \\"Atlas\\", then it veers into territory that is definitely 80's-ish, but not in a cheeseball way at all.  It's a super-catchy tune and is probably the second single behind \\"My Girls\\".    \\"Bluish\\" is easily the most beautiful song on the album, with a repeating refrain of, \\"I'm getting lost in your curls,\\" intermingled with lines like, \\"I like your lips when you get mean.\\"  It's a wonderfully ethereal song that evokes memories of high school crushes that felt like they were the only thing worth living for.    The two closing songs, \\"No More Runnin\\" and \\"Brother Sport\\", couldn't be more different, but they work together wonderfully.  The former is a very mellow, sparse, piano driven song that serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the album.  The downtime doesn't last long, as \\"Brother Sport\\" goes right back to the deep bass and big beat sound, with Panda Bear telling us, \\"You've gotta open up your, open up your, open up your throat!\\"  It's bouncy and crazy, building layer upon layer to create an incredibly awesome house beat.  It's a fantastic end to a fantastic record.    Those are all the highlights, but there aren't really any lowlights to speak of.  Whether it's the \\"#1\\"-esque synths of \\"Daily Routine\\"; the metaphysical musings of \\"Taste\\" (\\"Am I really all the things that are outside of me?\\" asks Avey); or the didgeridoo driven excitement of \\"Lion in a Coma\\", I really can't find any fault with this album.  It might alienate some of the hardline, old-school AC fans, but it's just their loss.  For anyone who has previously ignored them or just hasn't been feeling this band, give this album a chance.  Once it sinks its claws into you, the grip will hold on for quite some time.
0345451325|5.0|I love and play the game all the time. People who play the game will love this book. And if you dont, you will get a great intrest to try it. But do you even know what halo is really about? What happens in the characters life before he was a soldier? It makes the game more exciting because it gives you way more background information about what is really going on. Because it is the prequel to the game,it tells how all the soldiers were recruited. It details the Advanced training that the Spartans did. You will never even know what the characters had to go through to get where they are now. You're not a true halo lover until you read this book.

I never really liked the whole vampire genre but this was a series that was very relatable in the sense of how it was written with teenagers.  I didn't feel as though it was a series made for young adults.  I can't wait to see what else Stephenie Meyers comes up with.  I would love to see more of Edward and Bella and Renesmee!

0375826726|5.0|Another wonderfully-woven tale of the land of Alagaesia from Christopher Paolini. Eragon's character is given much more depth and purpose, as is Roran's, and we are given much more information on the history of the Dragon Riders, specifically Brom, Morzan and Galbatorix. Spahira's character is fleshed out further and we are given a greater insight into the bond between Dragon and Rider. A hero's quest continues, his own past and destiny questioned, and edging ever closer is the inevitable confrontation with the evil Galbatorix. Paolini has done an absolutely wonderful job with this series thus far and I almost cannot wait for the final entry, though I am sad to see the series ending. I highly recommend this book as well as its two predecessors, \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\", for fantasy and adenture fans; you won't be disappointed. Paolini is a storyteller the likes of which does not come along but once, maybe twice, in a single generation, and not a word of his is to be cast aside.

0316017922|2.0|The author of this book says, in short, that elementary and middle school children should work like workaholics to be successful starting from a young age to be successful.       This is the basic argument being presented by Malcolm Gladwell on pages 267-269 in the chapter titled \\"Marita's Bargain\\" [1].    Overall, this books mentions some interest facts about success early on, however it has a disturbing ending.    He makes the argument that since 12 year old kids test scores drop right after they return to school from summer vacation that all vacation should be eliminated (the bottom of page 259 - middle of page 260, \\"Suddenly the causes of Asian math superiority become even more obvious.  Students in Asian schools don't have long summer vacations ... America doesn't have a school problem.  It has a summer vacation problem\\").  Also, he uses first to fifth grader's test scores as an example on pages 255 and 257.    He goes further to imply that recess and lunch should be eliminated for the sake of higher test scores (page 261, lines 5-8: \\"If you take an average day, and you take out lunch and recess, our kids are spending fifty to sixty percent more time learning than the traditional public school student\\").  What? Excuse me?  Reduce physical health to be more successful?  Being healthy and getting exercise has been shown to improve brain function [2].      He further states that young kids would be better off going to school on Saturdays, and spending an average 12 hours a day at school (top of page 261, \\"The day goes from seven twenty-five until five P.M.  After five, there are homework, clubs, detection, and sports teams.  There are kids here from seven twenty-five until seven p.m.\\" and the middle of page 265, \\"She (Marita) had the hours of a lawyer trying to make partner, or a medical resident\\").  In other words, he argues American students should adapt the \\"Rice Paddies\\" mentality or Asian work ethic like Marita has in order to be more successful in life.He reasons that because persistence (or hard work with many hours) is a characteristic in almost every successful person, all children should be persistent in school work, in particular (on the bottom of page 259, \\"The only problem with school, for the kids who aren't achieving, is that there isn't enough of it\\").  One flaw with this logic, is what about the Children who want to the persistent in something else in life?  Malcolm, did you ever think that maybe kids aren't achieving in math because they are not interested in it?            The author claims that this idea of long school hours is only necessary for poor students since their bad environments at home over summer vacation affects their success in life.    However, if one considers that if this policy is implemented on a large scale for almost every poor school, what would the results be?  The students from rich schools would in turn increase their studying effort to in general remain on top in the competition.  In other words, the whole system is dynamic and reacts to changes.  The result would be EVERY elementary and middle student in the country would be spending 60-80 hours a week working in order to beat the competition and stay successful.  Not just the poor ones.      And all these long hours are for what?  There is not actually proof that high test scores lead to real world success especially at a young age (see reference [3] for example which statistical surveys are done with Millionaires in America, i.e. asking Millionaires if their grades in school were a major factor in their success?  It wasn't).      He is basically ok with the idea of children working non-stop (see the bottom of page 265-top of of page 266, \\"Marita's life is not the life of a typical twelve-year-old ... Children, we like to believe, should have time to play and dream and sleep.  Marita has responsibilities\\").  What!? This is ridiculous.  Are we saying children should act like 40 year adults with huge work loads, stress, andresponsibilities.  He is implying that playing, dreaming, and sleep are not as important as test scores in order to achieve success.      All I can say to that is \\"wow\\".  This guy is really off base and out of touch with reality.  What he is missing is that persistence and passion are what drive success, not substituting summer vacation for a geometry assignment.      I will pass on the \\"Rice Paddy\\" theory present in this book which requires long classroom hours for young children.  The author cites Singapore as a model example to follow in the footnotes on page 231.  It reminds me of the following quote from reference [4]:    \\"When the education minister of Singapore came here [the United States] ... people [asked him]: \\"What are you looking here for?  Your kids ... score on top of all international [standardized achievement tests] ... He  said ... \\"all that our kids can do is take tests\\".    [...]
B0018QOIXU|3.0|My partner's and my love affair with Adele was a slow-starter.  We first heard her on SNL.  As we heard \\"Chasing Pavements\\" every now and then,  we'd say to one another, \\"I think I like that song, \\" then \\"I'm really starting to love that song,\\" then \\"We have to buy that CD.\\"    Well we bought the CD at Christmas time.  I have got to say we love all the songs.  LOVE THEM.  We are the kind of people who will listen to something over and over until we are sick.  The back buttons on all our CD players are worn from repeatedly listening to the same tracks over and over.    It would be the same with 19 if the quality of the recording wasn't so damn poor!  It's horribly distorted and difficult to listen to unless the equalizer is set to flat.  I thought it was our stereo at first, then perhaps that the CD was damaged but I have seen a few other comments on the web about the quality of the recording.  It's a shame because it really distracts from the pleasure of listening to the album and robs her great voice of its depth.

031606792X|5.0|On the one hand, having finished all four books, I feel as though I've awoken from a month long reading trance during which I neglected all human responsibility.  I am the proverbial addict that can now re-join the land of the living.<br />On the other hand, I am actually depressed that the story is over!<br />Breaking Dawn is without a doubt the most \\"out there\\" book in the series.  Much like my experience with Twilight, I spent the first half of this book rolling my eyes and shaming myself for giving any sort of credence to this blatant bitch-slap to my intelligence.  However, once again the romantic in me took over and I let myself get carried away with the thrilling climax of this lengthy storyline.  I don't know how she does it but I've never encountered a writing style that translates into a bewitching reading addiction!  There were actually a couple nights where I stopped myself from picking the book up because I knew I would never be able to put it down and get some sleep (and even if I did put it down, I'd be so wound up thinking about what would happen next in the story that I wouldn't be able to sleep anyway).  It's insanity!<br />Book 4 puts you through the ringer:  It is suspenseful, it is erotic, it is devastating, and it is pure elation.  Bravo, Lady Meyer.  Bravo.<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.<br />Suggested With: Champagne...there are many points in the book where you'll feel like celebrating!
0316017922|4.0|OUTLIERS is the third book which slices the world view in a slightly different way.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell looks at the world differently than other people. Soon, I suspect, he will conclude the world is actually flat and I will happily walk to the edge with him, look over and be surprised I was wrong about it for so long.<br /><br />OUTLIERS looks behind the curtain of success. Does natural ability rule professional sports or  accidents of birth? Can anyone grow up to be President or are the cosmic deck of cards stacked in certain people's favor? Does it take more than hard work to succeed? Perhaps a wink and a nod from fate?<br /><br />These questions find their voice in this fascinating book. One thing is for certain: Gladwell believes in the looking past conventional wisdom, the common belief of our day and shouting, \\"Hey! There is something else going on here!\\" And I enjoy his perspective.

6302206294|4.0|This is a very good movie of the underdog genre, where good triumphs over evil and a rag-tag gang of untrained men overcome professional soldiers.  The script obviously deviates from the traditional Robin Hood story, with an interesting twist that adds to the drama, but the plot flows together well as the prodigal Kevin Costner returns from the Crusades to find his father murdered and the Sherrif of Nottingham attempting to overthrow the absent King, who himself is still tied up fighting infidels in the Holy Land.    Robin of Loxley ralleys the merry men of Sherwood Forest and this band of brothers proceeds to wreak havok on the Sheriff's plans.  There is the classic sequence were clumsy bowmen become accurate archers, and raw recruits make home-made swords and become deft at handling them.  The drama builds to its final crescendo, where Robin and the Sherrif meet to play their version of final combat.    It's all a lot of fun with the required bantering, teasing and flirting between Robin Hood and his beloved.  The film has a good number of scenes where values like courage and others are taught, as Robin tries to convince the townspeople of the moral strength of their position.  On the downside, there are the typical incredulous happenings - last minute getaways and such - but all approprioate for the ultimate goal of the plot.  On two occasions the film renders itself inappropriate for children: once when a merry man gesticulates about the size of a certain part of his body; the second, when the Sheriff is attemting by force to consumate his marriage to Lady Marian.

B000002H33|3.0|...Yeah, i know... Most people claim this is the best album in the world and you should buy it now. My opinion is the only 2 good songs on it are     -Batery: Great acoustic intro, but as the song goes on, can get a little boring.  -Master of Pupets: No doubt, the best song EVER, which brings my rating all the way from 1 star to 3. If you love metal, you want ever stop listening to it.    So the better deal would be to buy the MP3 for Master of Puppets the song, still if you want just another album to pick up dust, buy this one.    p.s. Metallica is still the best band in the world in my opinion.

If you are buying for a kid, or if you have kids, you should know there is a lot of swearing, especially the F word, and some satanic references (no, they aren't satanists).

B000005JA8|5.0|REVIEW: Perhaps the weirdest double album (now on one CD) ever released. Captain Beefheart's (a.k.a. Don Van Vliet) magnum opus \\"TROUT MASK REPLICA\\" is a quirky, offbeat, and charming piece of avant-garde blues/jazz/rock that pushed the boundary of music to its absolute breaking point: yet still manages to be warm, bizarre, funky, and cool. As it stands the record is infused with a twisted notion of Americana filtered through the Captain's stream-of-consciousness/beat poetry, and brought to life by his versatile Magic Band. Thus such compositions as \\"Frownland\\", \\"Dachau Blues\\", \\"Ella Guru\\", \\"Moonlight On Vermont\\", \\"Neon Meate Dream Of An Octafish\\", \\"Dali's Car\\", \\"Pena\\", \\"The Blimp\\", \\"Old Fart At Play\\", and the rest sounds completely at odds with conventional pop music: yet is so enchanting as to be almost other-worldly in its length and breadth and scope. Even the cover photo and the Frank Zappa produced montage serves to enhance its wild reputation. Yet there is a serious side to Beefheart's musings: as he takes on the cruelty of human beings throughout the ages (\\"Dachau Blues\\", \\"Ant Man Bee\\", \\"Steal Softly Thru Snow\\", etc.) which he views as an affront not only to man's natural environment but also to his SPIRITUAL environment. Such depth not only enhances the importance of this record: yet also helps to establish its reputation as a major artistic statement that goes to show just how original, daring, and fantastic music can be if devoid of the conventional limitations of the \\"Billboard Top 40\\". The fact that it even got MADE is a miracle in or itself. But I must warn you: only buy this album if you really desire to experience something TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE EVER HEARD BEFORE. Your life may never be the same again.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: None    HIT SINGLES: None
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|This movie looked like it was going to be good in the beginning.  Some guy going nowhere accidentally ends up in the middle of a shootout at the drugstore (while picking up his anti-anxiety medication).  But it ended up just being one ridiculous action scene after another.  There didn't seem to be much of a point.<br /><br />My positive comments are that I always love Morgan Freeman and the last scene was humorous.  If you're looking for an action movie, I suggest that you keep looking.

0471267554|3.0|\\"The Paleo Diet\\" seems to be Dr. Loren Cordain's attempt to give us a Low Fat Atkins diet. Dr. Cordain claims this is the diet that humans ate in paleolithic times and for a long, long, time.  Yet, the large amount of protein in this diet is a little bit scary.      After reading through the book, I am not terribly happy with it.  However, I am not totally unhappy with it.  I do feel that the hunter-gatherer societies of ancient times probably ate more grain and legumes than Cordain gives them credit for doing. There are a number of instances where the book seems to have accepted some PC dieting ideas that are not well proven, such as a total avoidance of dairy foods.  I have never liked Vegan ideas, so I guess it is relatively normal to not like the total opposite notions.      I, honestly, do not see how we can be very faithful to this diet.  It does not seem to be a reasonable diet in today's world.  It calls for a very large change from the general diet used in your world, today. Well, we shall see how it holds up over time.  I would be a lot more optimistic if the change were less radical.    Meanwhile, if you want to try this diet, please have a discussion with your physician, first.  Another discussion with a reputable nutritionist would also be a good idea.  Do not, simply, rely on this book.

It was a different time then and I am happy to share it with her. Thanks Amazon for your speedy and trustworthy service, I am always looking at movies now on your site that you just cannot get anywhere else. Thanks, Stacy.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|I've been a huge Dire Straits fan for almost 30 years now, and have just gotten around to replacing all of their albums with CDs and giving everything a thorough listen. While Love Over Gold had long been my favorite, I have fallen in love anew with all of the earlier CDs, particularly Communique. There simply is not a weak track on the disk.<br /><br />While Mark Knopfler has consistently written exceptionally strong music (and his voice, while not technically very good, suits his compositions perfectly), each of the band's disks has at least one, if not more, weak track. Even Love Over Gold has, well, \\"Love Over Gold,\\" which while lovely, probably goes on about 2 minutes too long. Communique does not have that problem. The songs, while for the most part understated, each showcase different aspects of Knopfler's playing that would come to the forefront on later songs. Particular favorites are \\"Where Do You Think You're Going?\\", \\"News\\", \\"Lady Writer\\", and \\"Single-Handed Sailor.\\" The lyrics show a maturity and darkness not readily available to the casual listener. The variety of playing styles is incredible.<br /><br />If you're a fan at all of the band and have hesitated checking this disk out because of it's age or some of the reviews here, please give his disk a chance. You will be greatly surprised and thoroughly pleased. Besides, it's only $7 brand new.<br /><br />Haunting, lovely, and a clear roadmap for the band they would become in the future. A best buy.
B000065V3H|5.0|I love Patrick Dempsey and it all started with this movie. I am 37 now but will always love this movie! I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and the whole family watched it and loved it. She recently brought it to watch at a slumber party and I thought that was great. Thanks Amazon for your speedy delivery, I don't like to buy over the internet but will continue buy through you, Stacy.
0307454894|5.0|A wonderfully told story of the pain of individuals using each other for their own purposes.  I enjoyed this book very much and as the author diligently builds upon two people using each other to satisfy their loneliness and then the numbness of the suffering that is created from such a codependent relationship.  The unfortunate pain of almost redemption but never resolution at the end of the book left me feeling the way I should feel: a bit saddened for both of the characters.<br /><br />Bernhard Schlink captures you quickly as he progresses through his short novel.  I will avoid to much description of the story so as not to take anything away from the power of the book. The main character is Michael Berg and this is his story of obsession with an older woman during World War II; though this provides only a time frame for the book as there is little description of the war itself. The author sums up this book so well when the main character, Michael, says, \\"Sometimes the memory of happiness cannot stay true because it ended unhappily. Happiness is only real if it lasts forever? Because things always end painfully if they contained pain, conscious or unconscious. all along?\\" The insightful thoughts such as these hold you so tightly to the story as it develops wetting your anticipation with each turn of the page.<br /><br />Yes this book is well worth the read.
B001ADPMQS|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites! Now I get to share it with my little boy!
B001I8C498|5.0|Dr. Seuss is such a universal presence, and he seems to represent universal wisdom.  As an example, I recall the Peanuts cartoon I read during my childhood.  Linus had filled out an application form, and he explained to the listener:  \\"It asked for family physician, and I did not know what to write.  So I put, `Dr. Seuss.'\\"  The last book that came out before his death, \\"Oh, The Places You'll Go\\" was Dr. Seuss's (Theodor Geisel's) legacy of sage guidance.  Most known for his children's books featuring such animal characters as The Cat in the Hat, Horton, and Yertle the Turtle or fun concepts such as Green Eggs and Ham, he came up with something a little different:  a book about facing life's challenges. Ostensibly for children, it is also well-suited for adults facing graduation, the next job, the next challenge in life, etc.<br /><br />Just as life can take you everywhere, the main character seems to go everywhere here:  walking down paths, roads, and mazes; climbing hills; riding balloons; wandering over rock-faces; rowing in the sea; and encountering disjointed cities surrounded by oddball arched constructions.  Lots of Seuss-like people and animals appear on the journey, but they are just for scenery:  the prose concerns only the  young boy, \\"you.\\"  It is the middle of the book onward that is most important, for it warns of the letdown from ambition.  Dr. Seuss persists with the theme of challenges until the end, fittingly, because everyone will not find life to be only a bowl of cherries but will encounter disappointments and rough seas as well.  A universal point made by an everyman's doctor, who ultimately betrays his optimism, confident that the reader will meet the challenges.
6304696558|5.0|This Warner Bros. 1980 comedy flick is about a spoiled Jewish-American woman Judy Benjamin(Goldie Hawn)who joins the Army after her new husband dies right on their wedding night during sex and duped by sneaky recruiting Sgt. Jim Ballard(Harry Dean Stanton)convinces her that military life to be glamorous, she gets a rude wake up call in boot camp after getting in trouble constantly, especially by Judy's hard-nosed superior officer Capt. Doreen Lewis(Eileen Brennan)prompting her to want a quit the Army, but then Judy has a change of heart and decides to stick it out leading her to a series of adventures that eventually lead her to a promotion and a transfer to Paris, France.<br /><br />During Judy's time in the service, while being stationed in Europe she meets and has a short-lived romance with a dashing French doctor Henri Tremont(Armand Assante)and ends up leaving the service when Capt. Lewis gives Judy an ultimatum to choose between leaving the service and leaving Henri after Henri proposes marriage to Judy, but then Judy ends up walking out on their wedding ceremony when she discovers that Henri has been unfaithful by having an affair with his maid, but Judy also comes to the realization that she's capable of doing whatever she wants and doesn't need Henri for it either especially after Judy walks out on him at the altar to go live her own life and make a new beginning.<br /><br />PRIVATE BENJAMIN was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a leading role(Goldie Hawn), Best Actress in supporting role(Eileen Brennan), and Best Writing done directly for the screen in the Spring of 1981.<br /><br />Additionally, PRIVATE BENJAMIN was such a big smash at the box office that they had decided to make it into an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning television series using the same name, which starred Lorna Patterson as Private Judy Benjamin replacing Goldie Hawn along with Eileen Brennan reprising her role as Capt. Doreen Lewis and Hal Williams reprising his role as Sgt. L.C. Ross from the film to the TV series which ran on CBS from 1981-83.<br /><br />This hilarious flick also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president.
B001KVZ6FC|1.0|I had high expectations for this movie.  The preview seemed great - Eastwood cast as the character he was born to play.    The movie itself was utterly disappointing.  Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the grumpy, racist, old man is far too cartoonish to be believable.  But it only gets worse.      The rest of the supporting cast is utterly amateurish - almost laughably so.  The best scene is when the Hmong boy gets locked in the cellar by Eastwood's character before he goes out to do the final deed.  The cries were so intensely ridiculous it was painful to watch.  The dialogue appears wooden and rehearsed - like something rehearsed for a middle-school play.      I cannot believe that the director let some of these scenes actually pass and go to print.  It is blatantly obvious that this was a rush job (filmed in the Summer of 2008) that needed to be released before the end of the year for Awards consideration.  This movie definitely does not deserve the critical acclaim it has gotten.  Let's hope that this pretentious mess does not taint Eastwood's great legacy.
B00005EAXF|5.0|I was looking for the Acoustica cd in the musical store but couldn't get it, so I went to the DVD's section and bang! Acoustica DVD and the CD!!! I loved the cd the first time I heard it, some time ago, but since I bought this package a week ago I love this piece even more. I have to say I expected a darker ambient to the whole show (a little bit too colorful for my taste) but the great thing in here is the music. Excellent versions of a bunch of really good songs (I have to say thank you for Love of my Life from my favourites, Queen). It is a shame you don't get to listen to the cellist except in Dust in the Wind, but I guess what you wantto hear is Klaus' voice and Schenker's guitar playing, along with a great formation of musicians that, not so known, give a lot of feeling and good playing to the whole set. A worth having one.
0446615641|1.0|First of all, I was shocked with how little introduction Baldacci gave for the members of his so-called \\"camel club\\".  Unfortunately, I did not read the previous entries to this series and was dumbfounded when I realized that I was supposed to \\"know\\" these characters.  I would not recommend this book as a stand-alone novel to any reader.    Furthermore, Mr. Baldacci tries too hard to make his book read like a movie script.  Very short chapters \\"twists and turns on every page\\" that would make every USA Today reviewer jump up and down with joy.  It just appears he is trying too hard.    The story itself starts out fairly interesting, but the confusing array of unnecessary characters makes it tedious to read.  The novel becomes progressively less interesting and is too long for it's own sake.  The action becomes very unrealistic and Clive Cussler'esque.  I would expect more realism from Baldacci.    His technical research:  This is an area where Baldacci is absolutely to sloppy.  Another reviewer already pointed out that Baldacci refers to the desktop computer case as a \\"CPU\\".  You do not need to be a computer wiz to know that this is incorrect.  This is unacceptable in this day and age.  In addition, during one of the \\"action scenes\\" he uses the age old trick of blinding agents, who using night vision scopes, by turning on the lights.  This does NOT work - you do not loose your eyesight for days (not even minutes) when exposed to bright lights when wearing night vision goggles.  I believe Mr. Baldacci has watched too many spy movies.    Last, but not least, I must say that any passage in the book that involves the Finn character having interactions with his kids is absolutely unreadable.  The way these kids talk are not even Hollywood - it is so corny and unrealistically saccharine it gave me horrible toothaches.    I strongly suggest Mr. Baldacci gets a better editor before he releases his next novel.  He has shown in the past that he can spin a decent yarn, but hiswork needs fundamental editing and proofreading.    Baldacci - if you read this give me a call - I'll do it!

B000YCLRBA|4.0|I gave this version of Onegin 4 stars because, in spite of the outstanding performance by Dmitry Hvorostovsky and Valery Gergiev, one that thoroughly revealed the greatness of Tchaikovsky's score, the rest of the cast, in my opinion, did not fully reach that level of perfection. Renee Fleming has a gorgeous voice, her pitch is perfect but at moments in the first act she acts too much as a grown-up woman rather than as a sixteen-year-old Tatyana. Tatyana finds her emotional turmoil inexplicable until she discovers that she is in love (Pouring water on herself is a bit  extreme, particularly for a very young Russian country girl). However, Fleming is superb in the last scene of the opera. That scene is unforgettable. It takes one's breath away. Fleming and Hvorostovsky not only sing brilliantly, they succeed in making one forget that this is a stage and not real life, they are totally identified with their characters.  No one else comes close to that level of performance. Olga is excellent, but she and Vargas do not make a credible couple. I find his Russian pronounciation not good, and his Lenski aria is too full of Italianate rubato and  sentimentality. In my opinion, that aria is one of the most beautiful and profound in the repertoire. It, by the way, is beautifully and expressively played by the cello soloist in the introduction to the duel scene.     Other artists in this recording who do total justice to their role are Larisa Shevchenko (\\"nyanya\\") and Sergei Aleksashkin (Prince Gremin).  Shevchenko sings beautifully, has a warm personality, and is a kind and devoted nyanya. Sergei Aleksashkin's version of his aria is the best I have heard. The tempo is excellent, his voice is rich and of accurate pitch, and his delivery soberly conveys nobility of sentiment.
0765350386|5.0|I enjoyed fantasy books as a teenager, then I grew up and could not get into them anymore. It's like many fantasy authors use excessive detail of strange lands and people to get past their thin plots and boring dialogue.     Then Mistborn was highly recommended to me so I read it. Wow. The raw talent of this author is evident from the first few pages. Each of the characters exude personality and reading of their interactions is enjoyable, humorous, and often insightful.     Then there is the action. Instead of the typical confusing battle sequences with vague magic use, the action in Mistborn is tightly focused and creates a vivid picture of what is happening. Many of the scenes reminded me of The Matrix for their sheer intensity and grace.    But, what good would a book be without an intriguing plot? I won't describe it, but I was hooked from the beginning and the ending left me amazed and thinking about it for days afterward.    This is not just fantasy at its best, this is writing at its best.
B00138JAB8|4.0|It could reasonably be said that this, Bob Dylan's debut LP, was like any other artist's (or band's) first LP.  There is really nothing about this record that gives away anything of what Dylan would become, even just 12 months hence.  Even Bob's appearance--faux-sheepskin jacket and fisherman's cap--is borrowed from influential contemporaries (in this case, Ian Tyson of Ian & Sylvia).  And, like so many other newbie folksingers during the revival of 1958-64 (a period during which rock 'n' roll was laying low and waiting for the British Invasion which would revitalise it and even influence the folkies to some degree, even bringing some of Britain's own folksingers to these shores), Bob packed out his debut album with covers and traditional songs.<br /><br />Even so, we have two originals on this album--\\"Talkin' New York,\\" in the talking-blues style that some have blamed for the eventual rise of rap (although there are many differences which I won't go into here), and \\"Song to Woody,\\" Bob's tribute to the older folksinger then resident at Greystone Hospital in New Jersey, suffering from the Huntington's Disease that would ultimately be the cause of Guthrie's demise.  Bob pursued the talking-blues form further on his next album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (although only a couple results of that would actually appear on the record, the rest left as outtakes that would be bootlegged heavily until 1991 and Sony's inception of the Bootleg Series); similarly, his Woody-influenced stylings would appear in greater detail on his next few albums.<br /><br />The other tracks here borrow from other singers as well--Dylan's arrangement of \\"House of the Risin' Sun\\" is, by his own admission, lifted directly from the late Dave Van Ronk (who was outraged at the time, but later forgave Dylan and took great amusement when Dylan was forced to retire the song from his repertoire after the Animals had a hit single with it in 1964); \\"In My Time of Dyin'\\" (covered by others, most famously by Led Zeppelin on their Physical Graffiti album), \\"Fixin' to Die,\\" \\"See That My Grave is Kept Clean,\\" and \\"Highway 51\\" bear resemblance to the singing styles of such as Blind Lemon Jefferson, Howlin' Wolf and perhaps a touch of John Lee Hooker (for whom Dylan opened in his first major gig in the Village--Dylan's first gig, that is, not Hooker's).<br /><br />So this debut album is really Dylan's formative recording; for those of us, like myself, who weren't there for one reason or another (I wasn't born yet), this is a little slice of Bobby's beginnings.  It's really not bad, either.  It's not hard to believe that this album sold only 5,000 copies on its initial release--or that John Hammond, who discovered Bob and produced this album (as well as Freewheelin'), when told that Columbia was prepared to drop Dylan from their roster as a result of the album's disappointing sales, heatedly told the exec who gave him this news that \\"You'll drop him over my dead body!\\"  And it's a good thing Columbia acceded to Hammond's wishes...who knows if we'd have heard what Bob had to offer in the coming years?their Physical Graffiti album), \\"Fixin' to Die,\\" \\"See That My Grave is Kept Clean,\\" and \\"Highway 51\\" bear resemblance to the singing styles of such as Blind Lemon Jefferson, Howlin' Wolf and perhaps a touch of John Lee Hooker (for whom Dylan opened in his first major gig in the Village--Dylan's first gig, that is, not Hooker's).

4770030096|1.0|I was very disappointed in this package. The title was misleading. My situation is that I am going to Japan in a couple of months, and, while I am there (for work) I have a series of tasks to accomplish in a very limited period of time. I needed to learn Japanese phrases for all situations that could help me to speed things up and get done faster. For example:<br />\\"Could you hurry up with those Ramen noodles?\\"<br />\\"Sorry I pushed past you to get on the Bullet Train.\\"<br />\\"I believe I am the next to be allowed entry into the Royal Palace.\\"<br />Essentially, I needed a phrasebook for busy people in busy situations. The title led me to believe this is what I would get - I had no idea they were referring to people who, because they are busy, have limited time to *learn* Japanese. That's very different.

031606792X|5.0|To me, even the title of Stephenie Meyer's fourth book in the Twilight saga suggested it would be vastly different in many ways from the previous three: \\"Breaking Dawn\\". To me, the title itself depicts a whole new kind of drama and the need to adjust your thoughts. Thus, I dove into the book with as open of a mind as I could. I was not disappointed.    I'd like to share some of my thoughts about this book, and the saga in general, as a 30-year-old wife and mother.    From the moment they met, I wanted Edward and Bella to be together forever. This is not to say my heart didn't ache when she had to choose between Edward and Jacob. I also hoped maniacally that something wouldn't happen that would force her to stay human. This is not to say I didn't feel a twinge of sadness when she had to leave her mortal life behind. Is this not what we all do when we grow up, get married and have children? We must sacrifice parts of ourselves and our former lives for greater rewards and changes, and I think that is what Stephenie is trying to show us. This little aspect will probably go right over the heads of most teenage readers, as will many other underlying thoughts.      Though I was more than satisfied with the way the author tied things up in Breaking Dawn, I can understand why some people, especially the younger crowd, may be upset with it. Some characters change or take on new roles. Some things get messy (Bella's near-death experience with delivering Renesmee and subsequently becoming a vampire) while other potential problems kind of go away (such as, what is Bella to do about Jacob and the war between vampires and werewolves? Easy, Jacob just imprints on Bella and Edward`s daughter, etc). However, like I said, I had an open mind. I kind of expected that things may go in different directions. Some things I sort of foresaw, other things were completely unexpected, but nothing took away my joy of the story.    Yes, Bella becoming a vampire and therefore, becoming just as strong as Edward, sort of takes that \\"sexy superhuman hero\\" aspect away from Edward. This part is definitely more for Stephenie's older readers. And of course, Bella and Edward having a baby may not feel very sexy to some readers. \\"A baby changes everything\\", as I'm sure you all have been told. Therefore, it will change our beloved story a bit. Yes Bella is young, BUT since book one she has been described, even by her parents, as a \\"middle-aged child\\". My only advice to parents of young teens wanting to read the saga: read the books first yourself, so that you can discuss what happens with your children as they experience this awesome story.      With that being said, I want to reiterate that I love that Bella becomes \\"equal\\" with Edward. We all know it NEVER would have worked out for them if Bella stayed human. So what if Edward's not as sexy now? In a way, I'm glad, for I can now look at my husband and not wish he was Edward Cullen, haha! He and Bella becoming equals in their relationship makes them more like the rest of us, aside from the whole immortal and superpower aspect. Some readers are mourning the loss of their sexy superhuman hero, Edward. However, what I see is a different kind of hero, one of the greatest unsung heroes in the world today--the Family Man. This is, after all, what Edward has always wanted and so has Bella.     I'm sure there's people out there who hoped for a more \\"vague\\" ending. Some people wish Stephenie would've tied things up more simply, perhaps by telling us just enough at the very end that Bella becomes a vampire or is about to become a vampire, and leaving it at that. As in, giving us a little glimpse and then leaving us with only our imaginations. I would have been happy with an ending like this, I suppose, but I think a lot of books end in a similar way. It was nice to see the characters \\"get everything they want\\" after one final hash-out against foes that would try to end their perfect \\"happily ever after\\". I'm sorry, but I like the \\"tied up with a bow\\" the author presented in this saga! Aren't there enough sad or loose endings in other books (and life in general) already? Why shouldn't the characters get any and everything they want? Didn't they all suffer enough?      So what if Stephenie seemed to write this book more \\"for herself\\" than her audience? It's her story to tell and it's been a pleasure to behold. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course, but Stephenie is the one who invented these characters and their story, and no doubt sat for countless hours doing the research and the writing for this book. It saddens me when people bring shame down upon her for going with her heart of hearts on how this adventure should end. Though I can understand why some can't embrace it, I couldn't help but love it.      It is my opinion that most level-headed people will appreciate Breaking Dawn. I like picturing Bella and Edward out there, enjoying their love together for all eternity. The first three books were fun in that they presented the giddiness and adventure of forbidden love, mystery, heartache and juicy fantasy. Breaking Dawn has tied everything up just right.    This is my personal message to Stephenie: Thank you for such a refreshing and exciting adventure away from reality with the first three books in your Twilight saga, and thank you for the safe return back to reality with Breaking Dawn.
B001MW0J2O|3.0|On this album, there is too much smooooth Panda Bear, not enough K-razy Avey Tare.

159448385X|2.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a tearjerker written for the bestseller list; it attempts to tug at your emotions with a trite storyline in a background of war.  The characters are paper cutouts without depth; the storyline of oppressed women has been heard before; the Afghanistan background is a compilation of events that might have been taken from a newspaper; there is nothing new in this book.  What could have been a spellbinding story if written by a master story teller, is just a shallow rendition of a few Afghanis in a violent period of their lives.

0671015206|5.0|Solid, unshakeable, foundations are essential for constructing anything - whether erecting tall high rise condominiums or amassing great wealth. That said, The Millionaire Next Door, by Thomas J. Stanley, PhD and William D. Danko, PhD, is perfectly suited to become a cornerstone for any serious wealth builder's ascent.      Though the vast majority of people still have the absolute wrong idea about who really is wealthy, The Millionaire Next Door literally draws the blueprint that explodes the myths propagated by the popular media.     The wealthy really aren't into conspicuous consumption, expensive cars, large homes, and outsized lifestyles. Instead, they are more likely to:    * live well below their means  * be business owners rather than employees  * separate the idea of income from wealth   * develop and follow detailed plans to become wealthy, and  * believe financial independence trumps social status    While the book does read like an academic study, its importance to those building wealth brick-by-brick is difficult to overestimate. Reading the book and absorbing it's lessons will help wealth builders effectively ignore the noise all around them and free them to focus on building wealth without the need to prove anything along the way.

0545128285|4.0|Comparing THE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD to the Harry Potter series is like comparing Aesop's \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\" to WAR AND PEACE.  The comparison is unwarranted and doesn't do either justice.  These tales are not an addition to the Harry Potter story but ancillary to it.  Both Ms. Rowling's light hand and dark edge are evident here.  And it is a pleasure to hear Dumbledore's voice once more.  His commentary after each tale is the highlight of this slim volume.  But with only five tales in the collection (one reprinted from DEATHLY HALLOWS  at that) one worries that this particular well may at long last be dry.  The author's artwork is so-so.  I would have stuck with Mary Grandpre as illustrator for consistency's sake.  Still, all in all, these five tales, however slight, are a perfectly charming way to spend an afternoon.

I am not going to sit here and sing her praises, my comments are more for the hyper critical reviewers and commentors that I glanced at, and trust me, I did not click over to the second page.<br />Why all the haters?  First, for those of you who are whining about her putting out a double CD when all of the music could have fit onto one.  Buy a clue, the music is divided onto seperate discs by genre.  This is not something new, in fact, Nelly made music history when he released two simultaneous CD's a few years ago...you do remember Sweat and Suit?  Yes, this is a dual CD with a total of 12 songs for both discs and yes, they would have all fit on one CD.  Some of you laid the blame on the record company but there is no blame to be handed out.  By releasing a double disc the company increased it costs, not their profits because the double CD sold at a single CD price, and a cheap CD at that!  I have taken to buying more and more downloads because I got tired of dropping [...] bucks on a single CD with maybe 4 songs that I truly enjoyed on the disc.  And that price only climbed higher when it was a dual CD, and rightly so because of the number of cuts on a dual disc.<br /><br />Yes, we only got 12 songs but I know I only paid [...] bucks for my copy and that was at Borders, not exactly known for its discount media!  Let's see, 12 songs [...] bucks, exactly what I would have paid for downloads only I came home with 2 discs that I can load onto several different players and home computers.  All mine of course, because while we were all taught to share in kindergarten we have also been taught that making copies of a friend's CD is copyright infringement and deprives the artist of their lawfully earned income.  I love every song on disc 1 and have turned disc 2 into my latest cardio disc, why schlep to the gym when I can get my heart rate up while dancing around cleaning the living room to Beyonce's club music?<br /><br />As far as comparing Beyonce to Leona Lewis and even her former band members and having someone come out on the bottom, why can't we appreciate all of the ladies for their talent?  Why do you have to tear one down to give props to the other?  All of those women are using the talent that God gave them to do something with their lives that they enjoy while giving us something to enjoy our lives with.  Stop the hatin' and just thank God that we have so many talented artists to enjoy.e in kindergarten we have also been taught that making copies of a friend's CD is copyright infringement and deprives the artist of their lawfully earned income.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|This dvd is a pure dream for old school Maiden fans like me.  The old concert footage has been restored as well as possible.  Some of it almost looks high def.  Disc 1 has the three concerts from the three different tours (Killers, TNOTB, Piece of Mind).  Disc 2 has an awesome documentary.  And disc 2 is also full of dvd easter eggs.  There are some very full clips!    Thank GOD for Iron Maiden.  Best band.  Ever.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Needed this badly for Christmas, but ordered just a few days before.  Was prepared to tell son that it would be in after Christmas.  But, it came either the 23rd or 24th.  Wonderful!!  He is very happy to have it.
1400082773|5.0|In \\"Dreams of My Father,\\" Barack Obama writes with such cinematic clarity, with such feeling and conciseness that it borders on the poetic!  This is more than simply a coming-of-age story; it is more than a mere search for an absent father or a reconciliation of identity.  \\"Dreams\\" is, in essence, the story of what it means to be an American and it speaks to just anyone of any race!      Obama's story is of course very well-known:   The product of an African father (who returned to his native Kenya shortly before the Obama's birth) and a White American mother, Obama was supremely blessed not only with an attentive, inquisitive, ambitious and passionate parent,  but also doting maternal grandparents who greatly helped inform and expand on his view of the world.   To be sure, he conveys a deeply-felt appreciation of his mother and grandparents, although he acknowledges their limitations.  Having grown up in Hawaii--where issues of class and race were less pronounced than on the mainland, Obama was eventually prompted to wade into the thick of politics--first upon arrival for college in the Pacific West (University divestment in South Africa was all the rage then, in the early to mid-eighties), then by memorable stints in New York City, the South Side of Chicago, Harvard Law School (where he became the first African American editor of the Harvard Law Review) and, finally, back in Chicago (where he eventually became only the second Black senator since Reconstruction).      \\"Dreams\\" ends with a very detailed and lengthy description of Obama's journey back to his father's native Kenya, where he meets a colorful--and seemingly endless--multitude of paternal relatives. It is finally this  Kenyan clan that fills him in on his ancestry, thus allowing him some answers to the many questions surrounding his missing father.  All told, Obama's \\"outsider\\" status appears to have helped rather than hindered his odyssey--despite the angst during different stages of his life.  By the end of \\"Dreams,\\" we feel as if we know Obama more, but he never completely tips his hand:  he remains somewhat aloof, mysterious and intriguing.  Oddly enough, this may well in part explain his near-universal appeal. Of course one of the most delicious pleasures of reading this book right now is that we know how his story will turn out! \\"Dreams of My Father\\" surely ranks among the very best autobiographies (no less by a sitting President). On a scale of one-to-five, I'd give a ten!
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This movie deserves its recent honor as Best Documentary. I saw it in the theater and loved it so much I bought two copies for Christmas gifts for friends. What an unbelievable feat. Can you imagine someone actually doing this...tightrope walking between the two World Trade Center towers? To see how the whole thing came about is engaging and entertaining.
0205632645|5.0|If you're writing without first consulting Strunk and Whites, Elements of Style, STOP! This book should be standard issue for anyone writing anything. By it, refer to it often, and watch your writing skills improve. Bon Appetite!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I bought this for my husband's Christmas gift. We watched it together and really enjoyed it. Will watch it again each year.
6304711891|4.0|I love this movie and my husband and I did not have the DVD so I purchased it.  We both love it, how could you not?
B000VNMMQ6|2.0|Boy did I get screwed!  Having previously enjoyed this film as a rental from Netflix in standard DVD form, I took advantage of a special \\"buy 2 get one free\\" offer from Amazon on selected Blu-Ray titles.  It never occurred to me that Fox would put LESS on the Blu-Ray than the standard DVD edition.  SHAME ON YOU FOX!!!!!!!
1400063515|3.0|I agree with the review by Gaetan Lion below.    I would like to add that to support a few of his views, he resorts to a fictitious story of a writer who publishes on the internet and attains karma. This use of fiction has undermined (in my opinion) the author's position. I could not help feeling cheated on that.    Read only Chapters 15 to 17. No need to read any more.    An over written book.
B001CQONKY|5.0|I love the CSI series and have collected all the dvds. Am about to get the 8th season but does anyone knows if there is english subtitles in this box set? It's not stated in the product details...
B000WGWQG8|5.0|got this for my dad for christmas, and amazon had it cheaper than walmart two weeks before the holiday
B0015AARJI|5.0|Well, there is not much to say...is for your PS3, is Sony and what else you can buy if you want to play with the gang?...just go for it!!...and don't forget to buy a fancy skin...
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Mr. Flynn and love all of his swashbuckler films but I do believe that Robin Hood is his best. No one else IMO could say Welcome to Sherwood and mean it like he does. He simply IS Robin Hood. Frequent leading lady Olivia de Havilland has never looked lovelier than in this Warner Bros. masterpiece. The character actors are superb..Alan Hale, Ian Hunter, Una O'Connor, Claude Raines and my favorite the dastardly Basil Rathbone all bring these characters to life like no others could. Backed by Michael Curtiz and his masterful direction and filmed in glorious technicolor this film truly defines the word CLASSIC.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This seat came as described and our daughter loves it! The only issue is, the description does NOT tell you that it comes with the bike bar that the seat sits on. So I ended up purchasing another one for $20.00 and I didnt need to. Im going to hang onto it anyways in case we get another bike, because the seat detaches very easily. But overall it is a great product. Fits on my wifes 26\\" bike very well!!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|loved it!!
1400082773|5.0|I'm glad I held off on reading Barack's memoir until now. Reading the inner human struggles of someone who becomes an intimate friend, then waking up to find this exact same person splashed all over the newspaper as a symbol of the hope and change the world so desperately needs is a very moving, spiritual experience.<br /><br />With so many opportunities to fail--to misunderstand himself and his world--the author nevertheless finds the strength and grace, not to make it to the top of a winner-take-all society, no, rather to choose the better path of shared struggle.<br /><br />This book, and the author's beauty of character inspires me to find my own way back to my own better self. All cheers, hugs, and love to Barack Obama, President of the United States of America. We begin again.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she is just thrilled with it.  Not just the show but how the set comes; \\"not just in cheapo plastic cases\\". The shipping was very prompt also! Thank You!
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This movie looks amazing in Blu-ray. Plus, you cant beat the price that amazon sells them at.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|The Good Shepherd is easily one of the best spy films ever made. It's got brilliant (and understated) acting, perfectly paced direction, and excellent use of (a very cold) tone running throughout it. It's also an excellent story using human drama (much like John Le Carre) to move the various scenes forward.....in short a great movie given lack-luster DVD treatment.<br /><br />The DVD itself has \\"16 minutes\\" of deleted scenes and...well..that's it. No \\"making of\\", no interview with the cast, no story-boards, NOTHING. This is a huge shame mostly because the film itself turned alot of people off with it's dense plot and cold characters and I think a commentary or \\"making of\\" would've been the best thing to help people along. This could've opened the movie's fan-base and given people a new respect for it. Again, this is a totally missed opportunity.<br /><br />I'm still giving this DVD 5-stars because the film's just that good. The picture quality is great and if you're a fan of this movie while it was in theaters you'll love revisiting it.
B000P1KTW8|5.0|Great svc everything went just like they said it would A++ all the way and what a great DvD
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Within the past and recent past even more, there have been far too many attempts to \\"Re-Write\\" History in order to fashion it into a more palatable presentation for entertainment.  This is terrific entertainment!    This also is a straight in look at the actual circumstances involved with the military, it's men and their personalities, and the harsh realities of war.  War is after all, the whole reason for the military to start with!    Blend these realisms together, and you have the \\"nuts and bolts\\" for a sure enough whiz-bang of a movie that is highly entertaining and well worth one's time to enjoy an learn as well.    George C. Scott is \\"Patton\\"!
B000UBMWG4|1.0|I bought this set from Amazon on January 1, 2009. Like other reviewers I too received a duplicate disc, the \\"work print\\" content on both discs 1 and 5.    Just contact the Warner service hotline at: 1-800-553-6937. The operator I talked to was very helpful and fully aware of the problem. She took down my information to send me the correct disc 1 when they become available. She said currently they are waiting on more to be printed and it will take at least 3-4 weeks before they are available.    *FYI, I rated this item one star to get the attention of folks who are having the same problem.    2/10/09 UPDATE: I have now received my replacement disc 1 with the correct content so my set is now complete. I'd highly recommend you contact the number above if your set came with the defective disc.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Oh this is one excellent movie. I can't stress it enough!! The music is awesome too (duh!!).
0525478183|5.0|I love that this book is funny, poignant, and that it tackles some serious issues about how we see each other and how we see ourselves. The central character (Quentin) is utterly relatable and compelling. I see my high school self in the person that he is and can relate to his inherent need to be a rule follower. John Green's quick wit translates beautifully to his writing and it leaves you wanting more (always the sign of a good story). I am not a young adult (instead a nearly 40 year old mother of 3), but I found this to be literature that transcends age groups. Keep it up John!
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I saw Momma Mia on the London stage, before it came to this country.  It was one of the best musicals I think I ever saw.  Told evereyone in the States I knew to go see it when it came to Broadway.  Obviously, millions of other people loved it also.  I grew up listening to ABBA, and was not disappointed when I saw the film.  I'll  look at it often.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|All of the 4 dvds that were in this set were no good.  Did not play at all.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Greatest opening chase scene I've ever seen.  Better than all the other Bond films--which are all terrific.  Beautiful locations At the One and Only Beach Club on Pardise Island, Montenegro, and Venice.  Great action.  The ending really blew me away.
B000NZL268|4.0|Fun game with others or the solo version.   I love visual organizing and love this game.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|Folie a Deux is FOB's cd that seems like a more refined Infinity on High. They have a different sound, of course, than when they began with say, Take This To Your Grave, but it's really not as bad a sound as some people may tell you. The style is a bit different, but it's FOB and you've got to love it in whatever form it comes out. Don't forget to get the bonus track (a remix of American Suitehearts) by inserting your cd and going to the website)!
B000001EG6|5.0|Simply stated, this is EJ's classic debut and not a dud track.  Also, the remastering is perfect, removing the entire, horrible tape hiss.  If not Sir Elton, then someone had the original master tapes to do the job right.  Audiophiles will not be disappointed.
0312965788|5.0|I really liked this memoir of being an English countryside vet in the late 1930s. The book, though it did follow a loose chronology, seemed more like a series of articles or anecdotes than a cohesive novel. Some chapters did flow together, but the vast majority did not. That's not to say that I didn't like the book, because I did, I loved it - it had many parts that were laugh-out-loud funny - the brother, Tristan, was an especially comical character. The memoir was educational too, but the veterinary technicalities were well explained. It actually had less to do with animals than I thought it would - there was a great deal about people - even a central romance!
0060751967|4.0|This is a book I read after getting addicted tot he Twilight Series. It is geared for adults but is defintly worth the read. It's a good intro to characters that will come up later in the series.  If you love vampires and scottish highlanders in kilts look no further!  Don't decide to not read it if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea.  I think some of the supporting characters you meet and learn more about later will appeal to the masses.
B00006I53S|2.0|If you think that the $200 more for getting this lens in a Body+Lens kit package over a body only is worth it - you might be right.  But paying anymore for this lens on it's own merit is a waste money!  Mechanically this lens works decently, if you discount the zoom drift when the lens is pointed down. It has a poor feel.  The images are inferior to other EF lenses in the same price tier.  AC is poor, every focal length seems to have an issue: blur at 135mm, pincushion at about 55mm and up, vignetting apparent at low focals.  It gets 2 stars just because it works.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This DVD is a real treat for me, I've watched it twice already.    I have a large (52\\") screen LCD and upconverting DVD player, and I think the video quality is quite acceptable, despite the acknowledgement that it is \\"hazy\\" at times. The sound quality on my 5.1 surround system is, to my ears, excellent :)    I've had the opportunity to see Pink Floyd perform in person, but with this DVD I feel that I've perhaps come close to the experience. Certainly as close as I'm ever likely to, at this point, and I appreciate it deeply.     The extras on the disks are also great. I liked the \\"Bootlegging the Bootleggers\\" feature, where bootleg video of Pink Floyd concerts has apparently been cleaned up and presented. The documentary about how a huge rock concert is put on is fascinating.     I would certainly recommend this DVD.
0061649694|5.0|If you have a child like mine that appreciates things that are a little different and mystical, they will love this book.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I was reluctant to buy this CD when it first came out because I figured that like most veteran artists, Bruce couldn't keep his success going forever. I was wrong. I bought the CD about a year after it came out and while I can't say it's my favorite Bruce CD, it does contain some pretty good songs. \\"Gypsy Biker\\" is not only my favorite song on the CD, it's now one of my all-time Bruce favorites! He and the E Street Band really rock on this one.  I also enjoyed \\"Your Own Worst Enemy,\\" \\"Magic,\\" \\"Last To Die,\\" \\"Long Walk Home,\\" and \\"Devil's Arcade.\\"<br /><br />When I was going to college in New Jersey in the late 1970's, I was ridiculed for not being a Springsteen fan.  They asked me how I could love rock'n'roll but not like The Boss.  I guess I didn't like his big hits at the time but once I heard The River album, I became hooked.  Since that time, I've seen him in concert a few times (nobody puts on a better show in person), and I met him a couple times at a New Jersey club in the early 80's.  Even if you don't like his music, you have to respect the fact that Bruce is just your average guy who made it big.  He never let success get to his head and has always been very approachable.  I'm looking forward to hearing his new CD which is coming out later this month.  Maybe I won't wait a year to buy it like I did with Magic.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|Megeadeth is one of the best group in the world, and this just highlights them in all their awesomeness!
B00007KWHG|5.0|I convinced my parents to buy this CD, and I'm SO glad I did. I can listen to it ten times in a row and never get tired. I'm 18 and its definitely one of my favorite CDs. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind men singing in high-pitched voices haha.
B001AEF6C2|5.0|This is literally my favorite movie. I can't say anything about how well this remastered version is, because I don't own it, but I have rented it and if you are reading to see how good the film is, let me tell you, it's amazing! It's a great high-school flick for boys and girls alike. The jokes are literal side splitters. My best friend and I watched it last night and laughed throughout the entire movie. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith are excellent. Kelly Lebrock is amazing. All the characters are believable and seeing young Robert Downey Jr. is a nice surprise! He sure was a cutie.<br />The idea is that sex-crazed and unpopular Wyatt and Gary make a sexy woman on their computer and she comes to life and helps them become popular. In the end, they get the girls they really wanted and Lisa (computer woman) becomes the male gym teacher. There is also a TV series, but I don't know if it is any good.<br />If you liked Buddy's character (played by Billy Jacoby/Jayne) in \\"Just One of the Guys\\", \\"Hocus Pocus\\", and other 80's movies where unpopular boys get the girls they want, you will enjoy this movie. A younger kid probably won't understand most of it, but if you are an overprotective parent, Wyatt does wear girl's underwear, there is a brief naked woman scene (just a flash, literally only like two seconds from far away), and Lisa is often dressed in clothes that show lots of leg and her belly button, but never her breasts or bra. Lisa also kisses Wyatt, who is fifteen, and Lisa looks in her twenties. There is a lot of sex reference using 80's slang, a drinking scene where Gary gets very drunk and uses a fake ID, and a scene where Gary and Wyatt are asked if they would \\"lend\\" Lisa to some bullies. There is very little to no cussing.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|Good but not Harry's best. If you like a Jazzy take on Christmas songs it is pretty good.
B000007OY0|5.0|This is been described as a cult phemenon, and there is a reason because it is really that good so would I recomend the movie? Without a doubt you must see it.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The Dark Knight is the culmination of all of Bob Kane's work and tireless devotion, to his masterpiece, of comic book genius. I first viewed said film 3 times in the theaters, and could not wait to have my own personal DVD copy. On 1/23/09, theaters will start showing this film in IMAX form. What a star for my own private collection!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Amazing story.  You can't go wrong if you love war movies/shows.  I had a good deal also when it was $37 here at Amazon!
B001MW0J2O|5.0|At first I was getting skecthy that all reviewers were prasiing this so much so I thought it was just hype atleast that was my thought going in to it so my exceptions weren't that high but boy was I wrong    I have been a AC fan since their debut \\"Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished\\" (When it was just Avery Tare and Panda Bear)this album is easily Animal Collective's most mainstream album by far you can tell they wanted this to be enjoyed by all because if your an avid AC listener you will know alot of their music is very hard to hear when I first got introduced I skipped so many songs on various CD's because AC is a complicated band and takes more then one listen to see how briliant these guys are    Now to get on to this marvelous CD, I think Panda Bear's Peron Pitch had so much influence on this you can see where they wanted to take some of Panda Bear's Solo sounding music and mix it with the weird/childish Avery Tare their is best CD where these two work so wonderful together, I'm going to pick my 5 stand out tracks but maybe besides one song this CD is amzing    In the Flowers - Beginning track at first you listen and your thinking to yourself is this sounds alot like \\"PeaceBone\\" beautoful but still very alike, and then 2:31 hits and BOOOM!!!! what stands out is the percusion by Panda Bear I don't see how this guy is rated as one of the best drummers in the Indie Scene this guy can rock the hell out, And Avery Tare still has his weird sound but as I said you can tell he dropped down a tad bit so everyone can enjoy how much of a genius he is 5/5    My Girls - Avery Tare did the intro awesome but let's get some of that Panda Bear person Pitch a try, Panda Bear is amzing on this track Lyrics are wonderufl sound is beautiful you think it's person pitch then 2:13 the AC comes togetherand actually creates a beat that could bump in your car so awesome!!! 5/5      Daily Routine - Starts out like a brain just being confused/lost atleast that's the vibe I got and then at 0:25 it comes together and these guys just make music no other words can explain this song besides \\"Music\\" if you aren't feeling the song it's bound to grab your attention at 0:53 I don't see how anyone could not find that catchy 5/5    Blushish - As another reviewer said this is their cutest song, \\"I'm getting lost in your curls\\" What the hell that's not even AC but how good it fits! like Avery Tare is singing this to his wife (Former Mum member)this is the must romantic song on the CD and one of my faves 5/5    I just had to pick two songs for my 5th because I could not choose, first \\"Lion in a coma\\" here is good old school AC the only word to describe this catchy poppy song is WEIRD!! but this is AC if you don't like it then you don't like AC Avery Tate is so silly but it had to be Avery Panda Bear could not make this song wonderful like Avery, and Last is the outro \\"Brothersport\\" another weird song that just shines from Avery Tare Oh my goodness i could have this song on repeat they are just a tease to end with such a wonderful song hopefully they get some B-Sides because after this you need some more AC Loving!!! 5/5    As I said this is their most mainstream album and I am so glad they made it that way!! I have every Animal Collective CD and even though so many Gem's I skip tracks on every CD, this CD is different I don't skip one song and it just takes you on a journey, if your sketch about picking this up because the reviews don't be for once Critics got it right
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|The first time I watched this version of Pride and Prejudice I didn't like it at all.  I am not a n Austen purist, but have read all her work and have watched all the film versions.   I watched this version a second and third time, and to give it a real fair chance, I watched it as if it were a \\"Readers Digest\\" version and did enjoy it.  However, I still had problems with it.      These are some of the mistakes that I consider unforgivable, because they could have easily been avoided.    In the scene of the first ball I found it ridiculous that everyone stopped dancing and the music stopped, when the Bingleys and Mr. Darcy entered.  In such a large party how would everyone at once realize they entered?  Why would they all stop dancing?  Like another here wrote, the Bingleys and Darcy are rich not royalty.  Then the Bennets approach them to be introduced.  This would not happen.  They would have waited to be approached and introduced by a mutual acquaintence.       Keira Knightly is very cute in this version even if she acts more like a 14 year old than a 20 year old.  Keira Knightly delivers many of her lines too fast, which is the way most silly teens talk today.   Women matured early back then at least in their mind and manner.  You can see this in Jane Austen herself and what and how she wrote even before her teen years.  Mathew Macfadyen seems more depressed most of the time rather than arrogant, or proud.   I can overlook this as there seems to be not much time to develop any nuance in any of these characters in this short version as the producers were more interested in certain scenery, or their own \\"art\\" and cutting costs.  There were some very beautiful scenes.  I especially liked the gorgeous scene where Elizabeth with her aunt and uncle stopped to eat at the huge tree on their way to Pemberley.  The scene of Elizabeth standing at the edge of the cliff was beautiful, but disturbing.  Who in their right mind would stand that close to the edge of a cliff with, or without, that wind blowing?   The Longborn house was very shabby and unkempt looking.  Not at all like the home of a \\"Gentleman\\" and his family.  Donald Sutherland is a disappointment as Mr. Bennet.  As another commented here, he looks more the hobo than a gentleman.  He shows none of the wit of the mini series Mr. Bennet, but is a rather bland character.  I did not find this Mr. Collins particularly funny.  The very idea that he would interrupt everyone's breakfast to propose to Elizabeth is ridiculous. I think he would have at least waited til after breakfast.  All the comedy was taken out of Mrs. Bennet.  I did not find much humor in this version.    At Rosings Elizabeth meets Darcy again.  She says, \\"Mr. Darcy, what are YOU doing here?\\"  How rude is that?  And, as if she didn't already know via Mr. Collins  that he is the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Later Darcy barges in on her unannounced as she is writing to Jane.  Apparently he was so bold as to let himself into the house of the Collins'.  Creepy!  Then later on, the first proposal in this version is strange.  Keira Knightly practically spits in the face of Macfayden as she almost screams out his offenses to him.  Then Macfayden comes in so close as to look as though he would kiss her.  How strange is that?!  Again Darcy creeps up behind Elizabeth to deliver his letter of explaination after his proposal has been refused by Elizabeth.  Apparently having again let himself into the house and unannounced.  Again creepy.    Another thing that struck me as ridiculous was the statuary, which I thought quite over the top, at Pemberley.   but the biggest mistake was Elizabeth leaving on foot without her aunt and uncle.  For Pete's sake!  Granted she is supposed to be a great walker, but It was 5 miles back to Lambton where they were staying.   Her aunt and uncle must have been besides themselves wondering what happened to her.  Would Elizabeth be so childish as to run off like that?  I think not.      Back at Longborn the letter comes from Uncle Gardiner regarding Lydia and Wickham and Elizabeth tears it out of her father's hands.  Shocking!  This is one very rude girl.  Very out of character for Austen's Elizabeth.    And finally near the end Lady Catherine de Bourgh comes to the Bennet house at night waking the whole household.  This seems to me the height of impropriety, something completely out of character for this Lady considering her station in life.  She mentions the Bennet's \\"very small garden\\", but I doubt she would even be able to see it in the dark of night.  They had no outdoor lighting in the country.  In the early morning Elizabeth goes for a walk and meets Darcy walking toward the house. He is on foot yet, and in the fog three miles from where he was staying with Bingley.  This is a very rich man, who would have, if not a carriage, a horse at least.  Neither Elizabeth, nor Darcy could sleep, but Darcy doesn't know Elizabeth will be out walking. What had Darcy intended to do once he got to the Bennet's house?  Was he going to wake everyone at that early hour?  We are to believe, except for Elizabeth, they are all still asleep.      Looking on all these faults with humor, I was able to still enjoy this version for what it is.  However, it is best to take the time to view the entire mini series and enjoy the great acting in it.  Colin Firth becomes the ultimate Mr. Darcy on screen and Jennifer Ehle is true to Austen's very lovely Elizabeth.  I much prefer the mini series Bingley, Mr. & Mrs Bennet and Lydia.  I loved all the actors in the mini series and think they played their roles brilliantly.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We love this game! It is challenging, fun, competitive, and it works your brain! We played it at Christmas with family members of all ages 2nd grade and up. Even one of the uncles that 'doesn't play games\\" played and enjoyed it.  I would highly recommend this game.
B001PE26QQ|5.0|Yip Man Is the most important piece of Sifu Bruce Lee's beginnings as a Martial Art God. This movie is a cross between Jet Li's \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Fist of legend\\" which both are Kung Fu classics. Superb action and great story. I knew he was a great person other than being a fantastic teacher. Best martial arts movie of '09 so far. Worth being in your library!  4.5/5!
1423107233|5.0|This book is an absolute delight. Stunning artwork, high quality presentation and design, great production values. If you like Disney animation you'll love it. What a great beginning to what I think it will be a great line of books, this Disney Archives series. Count me on for future volumes for sure.
B000002IR9|5.0|I had this album when it first came out and loved it.  Although dated, it still pleases the mind, soul, and body.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I have watched Sex and the City since it first aired on HBO. I have bought all of the seasons & now the movie. Needless to say I am a fan. However when I first heard there was going to be a movie, I honestly thought the worst. Maybe that's why I thought the movie was perfect. It left me perfectly satisfied.   You have to take into consideration that they made a movie out of a long running show. They had to squeeze all the laughs, DRAMA, fashion & everything else in only 1 hour & 45 minutes. I thought it was a great movie. I wish it wasn't the end, but even for an end it was a wonderful ending. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Sex and the City. I think Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie), Kim Cattrall (Samantha), Kristin Davis (Charlotte) & Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) played true to their charaters, just like in the show.
031606792X|1.0|Horrible, horrible book.  I read the Twilight saga in 4 days and love all three first book.  I was desperate to find out the ending and I bought \\"Breaking Dawn\\", which was a big dissapointment.  The story goes from a beautiful love story to a weird alien/ mutant story, trying to find a happy ending for every single character.  I felt the strength of the characters were lost.  I hope they don't make a movie out if this book, rather end with the third book, which probably is much better.  It seems that the fourth book was written just to take advantages of the huge success of the other rather they thinking on the audience or the characters.  If you are reading the saga....just read the first three books and imagine the ending yourself, it'll be much better than reading \\"Breaking Dawn\\"
B000GCG59W|5.0|Concha Buika in the hands of Javier Limon.  Two great musical minds.  Buika's smokey, silken voice is filled with sincere feeling. She brings a flamenco sensibility to jazz and soul and other genres.  Limon's orchestrations and solo guitar elevate the expression.  Very wonderful and masterful music.  I would also recommend Buika's and Limon's most recent collaboration, Nina de Fuego!

1878424505|5.0|I've been having a very rough time dealing with a friend who is very draining. Her actions and words were infecting me, and making me depressed and confused. I decided I needed to confront her about it finally, but I needed some help. I went searching for some books, and I ended up buying three, but I only needed to read one. This one. This book was the perfect prescription for what I needed.     My mind was so full of toxins and poisons that had been planted there by both myself and my friend, that I had no idea who I was or how I was supposed to be anymore. After I read this book, I realized that it really didn't have to be that difficult, and it gave me a completely new outlook on life and relationships.     The interesting thing about this book is that these four agreements are all commonsense. These are all things that I learned I should do long ago, but I never really fully understood the impact that my actions and words had on both me and the ones I interact with. Now that I've read this book, I feel that finally, at age 30, I've just now grown up. I just now got it. I just now figured out how people are supposed to live their lives: Filled with love and respect for ourselves and the people we encounter daily. It sounds silly, but I truly believe that if everyone could read this book and adopt these four agreements in their lives that this world would be a much better place and we would achieve the \\"heaven on earth\\" that Ruiz speaks about.    I highly recommend this book. It is a quick read (I read it in about 3 or 4 hours, and I'm sort of a slow reader), yet it is so uplifting and encouraging. For a while, I had just resigned to a life of depression and sadness because of all the poisons planted in my head. The feeling of freedom after reading this book was indescribable. This will change your life if only you're open and willing enough to accept these simple agreements.
0061122416|3.0|I sat down and read this book late one night when I probably should have been sleeping. I liked it overall, and I liked the messages it \\"preached\\". But I think I'll have to sit down and read it again because I started skimming towards the end and to me, when the boys heart and the wind and sun and whatever else started \\"speaking\\" to him I got a little lost - I'm sure there is a lovely metephor for all of this, but I didn't catch it.

0515142247|5.0|Have read almost every Jack Reacher book. Every one is very exciting. I enjoy Lee Child books; he never disappoints. You never know what to expect next. Loved it!            PMA
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Came right away and was exactly what I expected.
B001F7XIJW|4.0|I'd heard a couple of songs on satellite radio and thought I'd give the album a try.  I'm impressed.  It's more mid-paced than I expected but the music keeps it interesting enough that the album doesn't drag at any point.  I'd say they sound kinda like Morbid Angel if they slowed down and added some electronics.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Erin Brockovich with Julia Roberts is a film about a woman who stands her ground against all odds, as the divorced single mother who works as a clerk for Ed Masry, an attorney played by Albert Finney and they join forces to champion clients that are wronged by a powerful corporation.<br /><br />Erin takes on the case against this corporation that is spoiling the environment with toxic substances, not only poisoning the water supply of a town in California, but also responsible for the illness and death of many residents.<br /><br />Erin is a woman who has lived through hardship, so she is able to relate to those suffering. She earns the trust of these clients, as they tell her all about their condition. Soon, we see Erin gaining ground against corporate greed and secrecy as she uncovers the details necessary to win a court case against the company that, while not returning individual claimants to health, at least they gain the financial strength necessary to withstand the consequences of exposure to toxic chemicals.
6305882592|5.0|Two eccentric people chance to meet - one very young - the guy - one much older.  The two seem to hit it off and have a grand old time.  This film is quite entertaining.  The music which is great is provided by Cat Stevens.  Very enjoyable.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Most everyone knows of this movie based on the book by Stephen King. It is one of the best and a real thrill ride.
0743277708|5.0|I remember seeing the movie when I was a young child and it stayed with me ever since.  I remembered certain scenes from the film all my life and it did affect me deeply because 30 years later, I still haven't forgotten watching it nor the title.  I realized that I needed to revisit this story for that reason and decided to read the novel before seeing the movie again.  I'm so glad I did!!!    I absolutely LOVED this book, which I finished in a few days.  It is beatiful, sad, funny, epic, and haunting all at once!  This may be one of the best books I have ever read and I read A LOT.      There are some parts that can get a little over-desriptive and boring but they are few and you will hardly notice.  For me, the pace really picked up about halfway through and I couldn't put it down.  This is definitely and ADULT themed book IMO since some of the trials and lessons are emotionally heavy.      Bottom Line:  READ IT!
B0018S6YO4|4.0|Good album don't regret my purchase. Breaking Dishes probably my favorite single on this album.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I have loved all of Brendan Fraser's projects.  He is a very entertaining actors.  This story was so much fun to watch.  Great family movie.
B001GM28HO|5.0|If you like Just Dance then you'll love the rest of this album. I saw her in concert, not only can she perform all of her music was worth listening to. Why isn't her hits on the radio like all of Justin Timberlake's recent album? Enough said.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I've always loved the biblical story of Joseph.  This adaptation was very well written, masterfully acted and intriguing.  Well done!
0525951113|5.0|Wow!  What a page-turner!  Daemon is SO feasible, computer technology being what it is in 2009, that this book is absolutely terrifying!  And yet, it's a compelling read -- page after page, I kept thinking that I was figuring out where it was going, and page after page it surprised me.<br /><br />Even at the very end -- I had that feeling of expecting the climax, since I could tell I only had a few pages in my right hand -- I was so sure I could see how it was going to pull the threads together, and SURPRISE!  I still had no idea.  Even after I finished the book, I had to sit and think about it for a while because I couldn't believe what I had just read.  I see other reviewers (mildly) wishing for a better ending, but I rather like how it ended - though I don't want to give any spoilers.<br /><br />This is an OUTSTANDING book, as a great story, a techno-psychological action suspense thriller, and even a bit of a philosophical quasi-political statement (not a strong, purposeful whack over the head like Ayn Rand, but more of a \\"hey - consider this!\\" statement).  It's plausible, entertaining, AND makes you think -- what's not to like about it?
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Being a Batman fan, I'm already biased about how I feel about this movie, but it far exceded my expectations. Everyone from the excellant first movie \\"Batman Begins\\" (sans one) returns and continue to be wonderful in their parts. The new faces are equally impressive. Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacement for that ghastly Katie Holmes) does a far better job in the part and Aaron Eckhart is fantastic as Harvey Dent/Two Face. Of course Heath Ledger as The Joker, what already hasn't been said about his performance. The new additions: the Batpod and the new suit are awesome on screen never fail to disappoint.     Truely, a movie that redefines the term \\"super hero movie\\". It is a movie that is not to be missed by fans and non-fans alike.
B00026WU82|5.0|So much has been written about Bob Dylan, but what's really so great about Bob Dylan is in the listen, really (greatness is in the ear of the beholder! ha ha).  After listening to this, my beholder is impressed.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I haven't been this fascinated by lyrics in a long time.  Dylan's lyrics on here are cryptic, funny, biting, surreal, literal, and have the capability of telling a story like a poet.  Name dropping is always intact And his smokey (ocassionaly monotonous) tone of voice is timeless, of course.  It's in top form here, where he sneers, tells, soars, sounds beat down, and adds excitement.  Like any great voice should, it is the sound of Bob Dylan, and nothing else.<br /><br />Although you deservedly hear lyrics here, lyrics there when this album is discussed, one thing that also strikes me so: The music behind the voice.  One thing that struck me from the beginning of my many listens is the loose, sometimes lo-fi playing, dirty and untrained yet lushly preformed.  It's an excellent evolution and the real reason why switching to electric was a good idea after all (we all know he switched to electric because he WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW INSTEAD OF THE SAME THING).  Organs, pianos, jangly guitars, ramshackle drums, ripping blues guitar solos, elegant gorgeous Spanish Guitars, tin whistles, and a bluesy harmonica where you can often feel the lips touch the metallic taste of the harmonica's body and blow (which occasionaly goes overboard, but that's not exactly a bad thing).  And don't expect the same type of music, they are extremely varied.  It's one of the reasons why this album is so damn great.  It can't be beat.<br /><br />Wildly consistent for fifty one minutes, this album is eclectic and varied.  It is bubbling with classic songs, and I consider them classic songs being this is a person who wasn't exactly there when his songs were first made (they say sometimes you just had to be there to appreciate Dylan even more).  Even with that in mind, I absolutely love this album.  Here is my track listing<br /><br />1.  Like A Rolling Stone-Between the sparkly piano intro, the howling lyrics, rolling tambourine tinged drums, and the intertwining guitars, it all comes together.  This is hands down one of the most famous Dylan songs, and for good reason.<br />2.  Tombstone Blues-An extremely awesome, ramshackle driven, garage rock song.  The short guitar solos blaze, the drums pound away with swagger, the acoustic guitar is harrowingly good, and The lyrics are wildly awesome.  Dylan's lyrics are surreal, funny, there is some downright brilliant song lyrics in this one.  In my mind, this is the best song on the album.<br />3.  It Takes Alot to Laugh...-A standard Dylan blues song.  Dylan's lyrics and voice are worn down here, and there is a classic harmonica solo as well.<br />4.  From A Buick 6-Showing off one of his new features (an electric band), this is a funny cool rock and roll song.  The bassline is excellent and follows the music like butter.<br />5.  Ballad Of A Thin Man-This dirge of a song is my least favorite, but it's still cryptic as hell, with it's dirge piano slam and the floating organ.  I love the piano slamming.  The camel metaphor is just creepy.<br />6.  Queen Jane Approximately-The Piano is quite gorgeous.  My favorite little part is the open strum that appears in the song, and the organ.<br />7.  Highway 61 Revisited-At the start of a penny whistle, the runnin' blues of Highway 61 Revisited kicks off.  Dylan spins five absurd tales of people going to Highway 61 to have their problems solved.  Just what Doctor Dylan (DD! B____!) ordered.<br />8.  Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues-A lazy, free floating song, with an excellent honky-tonk feel.  A pretty silly story, and there is fantastic playing to back it up.  Dylan sounds all tired as hell here, like he singing recalling a past story of his lifetime.<br />9.  Desolation Row-Ah yes, the epic eleven minute tune.  Dylan's cryptic lyrics drop references as much as any later Bloodhound Gang song did.  Oh, the music is fantastic.  It never falters for it's time and never turns dull.  Consisting of Dylan's dirty guitar strumming (at one point it turns pretty) and beautiful flamenco-esque soloing.  Believe the hype, this song rules.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of Bob Dylan, but this is simply an album without a single bad track.  Buy it please, or else.did.  Oh, the music is fantastic.

B0002U0UKS|5.0|A good Hisaishi score is on the level and often better than many of our Hollywood composers.  Howl's Moving Castle is an excellent example.
B00005JGI6|5.0|I tell people who are not familiar with the band Travis to try and imagine a half-awake Tom Chaplin (lead singer of Keane) singing to the accompanyment of earthy-sounding, melancholic tunes very reminiscent of America, an old, but very good band from the 70's that cranked out such memorable hits as \\"A Horse With No Name\\", \\"Ventura Highway\\", \\"Don't Cross The River\\" and \\"Tin Man\\".  Travis is practically a combination of the two above mentioned parties, yet with quite a bit of their own originality.  I am really surprised that this band is not more well known, like Coldplay, but even when you are terrific, it is perhaps not necessary to be THAT well known.  This album, \\"The Invisible Band\\" is just absolutely superb and just about every song is a winner.  \\"Side\\" is one my personal favorites, as well as \\"Flowers In The Window\\", and \\"Sing\\".  However, my ultimate favorite is \\"Pipe Dreams\\" and I was just shocked when I saw that this was not on their greatest hits album, \\"Singles\\".    At any rate, this is an album that is worth buying and is definitely a keeper for diehard Travis fans.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I got the first season of The Big Bang Theory for Christmas and I have to say that I haven't laughed this hard at a television show in a long time. I heard good things about it, but I could never fit it into my DVR's schedule without getting rid of some other shows that I like. The cast of four nerds and a hot blonde is perfect and the writers have to be just as smart as the main characters to come up with such intricate and funny dialogue. This show is enjoyable even if you don't get all the tech geek talk, but if you understand why one of the characters playing Halo 3 gets pissed off and killed because he got a Needler weapon, then this show will blow your mind.
B0000027I6|5.0|I just wish to say that in addition to the beautiful yet somber melody (Three Wishes) that pervade this gem of a CD; I wish I could state as clearly as Waters' does  with his incredible lyrics, how I feel about the state of the world today.<br /><br />In 1993 the critics labeled Roger Waters as too cynical when they reviewed this work. I think they are wrong. This is a masterpiece and it is even more  relevant today (well, maybe yesterday as I write now in January, 2009, we suddenly have hope... yikes! yet this piece is perfect for the economic situation--\\"it all makes perfect sense/ expressed in dollars and cents /and shillings and pence\\").<br /><br />Can anyone deny this?
B001QB5ZRK|5.0|\\"Fringe\\" is a mesmerizing program that you are forced to concentrate on, thereby allowing the program to completely shut down the day's envolvement. It is the epidomy of entertainment. The half dozen main characters are particularly entertaining and their roles are well done by the actors. I'm glad its back from its holiday break!
B0001IN07Q|1.0|I got this CD and it was completely blank.  No songs on it at all.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I am from the UK and this is played every year on TV. It is a wonderful story and all the animation is set to music. The music tells the story.  I purchased this, so that my children can see the wonder I had for many years. They absolutley love it!! My 3 year old thinks this is wonderful and thinks Frosty the Snowman is a little scary.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|This is an wonderful CD. It answered my question \\"How would the unbelievable songs on his studio albums sound when he plays the songs live?\\" I am absolutely satisfied with the answer.....\\"Incredible\\". I have no other words to describle Mr. Beck's talent. Hear it for yourself.
B001MW0J2O|4.0|On its own, Merriweather Post Pavilion is a top-notch collection of hazy yet rousing pop chants. There are many highlights--including Brothersport, My Girls, Bluish, Summertime Clothes and No More Runnin'-- and only one real weak spot (the awkward Lion in a Coma). Additionally, the warm, bass-heavy production is a welcome contrast to the poorly-mixed Strawberry Jam LP. Overall, this a perfectly enjoyable listening experience, and likely to be one of the better releases of 2009.<br /><br />...And yet, as someone who's been in love with this band for quite some time, and has cherished their every album and EP from 2001 on, this release serves as solid proof that our once-radical urban shamans have grown a bit too comfortable with their lives, and with themselves as a musical unit to make truly forward-thinking music anymore. The sound of Sung Tongs has little precedent, with about five other acts (Holy Modal Rounders, Mercury Rev, etc) used to illustrate its \\"spirit\\" more than its actual music. Merriweather, on the other hand, can be compared not only to past pop luminaries like Brian Wilson and Paul Simon, and not only to countless indie acts who borrow from such giants, but also to the group's own past work (the album sounds like Panda Bear's Person Pitch with bass and a beat), showing that they're looking backward instead of surging ahead of the rest of the music world.<br /><br />The pop structure and mixing of Strawberry Jam was the first indicator to me that AC wants to streamline their sound. To be fair though, SJ has a lot more variety of vocals and moods than this one. Merriweather's really pleasant and fun, but it's all very homogenous, with only one real breather from its relentless sugar high.<br /><br />I'd actually say that Strawberry Jam and MWPP are about equal. They both have frustrating flaws, and they both have a lot to enjoy. Perhaps the only thing that makes this one worse is that it seems like a pattern is emerging with AC in general, and points to future work that is just plain dull.<br /><br />Here's hoping I'm wrong!ust plain dull.    Here's hoping I'm wrong!
0956010903|5.0|I knew I would like this book, if only because I am such a Harry Potter fanatic. But, even if I wasn't, I would still enjoy this book. Each story mimics what we have seen and expect in their muggle counterparts. If you have ever read Grimms' Fairy Tales translated from the original German, you notice that not every story is happy or shelters children from violence. \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is much the same. And children need to learn those lessons as well.     When I have children, I fully intend to read these stories to them, just as I would read any other fairy tales. However, if you're a parent that wants to shelter your children, this book is not for you.     And let's not forget that the collector's edition is gorgeous!
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Since you have probably read many other reviews about the storyline, I'll just cover what differentiates blu-ray from normal DVDs.  Casino Royale is without a doubt the best transferred blu-ray movie I own.  There isn't a single scene that isn't crystal clear.  I was blown away by how great the picture was throughout the entire movie.  The movie itself is good, as you've probably already read.  The actual picture quality alone is worth the price.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia! is wonderful!  Great acting, great music and a charming story.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musicals and upbeat movies.
031606792X|3.0|I'm finally done with Breaking Dawn, so here is my review of the second half, also known as Book 3: Bella (the Vampire). Spoilers Abound!!!!<br /><br />I must preface this by saying I did not want Bella to become one of them. Of all the possible \\"happy ending\\" to the Edward and Bella saga, Bella becoming a vampire - to be with Edward forever - I thought was not only silly, it was not creative enough. The interesting dynamic of the two was because one was the hunter, the other - the prey.<br /><br />So, in Book 1, I was actually optimistic that horny Bella wanted sex so much that she was willing to prolong her human life so she can experience this over and over again. Silly, but I was grasping at straws. I wanted her to prolong her life, so sure, sex away lusty human!<br /><br />But Meyer had different plans. And yes, I did love Jacob's point of view in Book 2 and at best I was resigned to the fact that I will be reading about Bella the vampire in Book 3. So, I took a little while from reading to adjust to that fact then resumed.<br /><br />Book 3, I feel is a whole different saga. It's a whole different vibe, a whole different Bella. It felt so detached from the first 3 books. To me, this was more like reading Christopher Pike's The Last Vampire (which I recommend). The Last Vampire was written to the point of view of the vampire: Sita. It was a good book. So, yeah, I gave this a chance.<br /><br />For the most part, I was into it. I did think Jacob was cute with Renesmee, and this was all about Renesmee. The whole book focused on how the Cullens were going to be slaughtered by the Volturi because they thought that Renesmee was an immortal child (ugh, I won't even explain ths nonsense - just know that it was a \\"law\\" they supposedly broke). So, everything is building up from this. And I am in it. I'm right there with Bella. As a mom, I understand Bella's need to protect her daughter. I feel her pain, her anxiety, the different scenarios running through her head. How does she keep Nessie safe? The steps she took, from getting her the fake birth certificate, to practicing to fight (because she won't give up without a fight!).<br /><br />Suddenly, it was making sense and for a split second, I thought Meyer was a genius. That was why she set the Volturi up in New Moon. We get to see the fall of the Volturi in the hands of Bella! And why won't she win? Meyer was alluding to it all along: how you can't read her mind, how her shield can protect and project. Even Renesmee has powers! Bella may have had her doubts, but I didn't. I knew the payoff was near...and then....came the most anti-climactic ending to a book. EVER.<br /><br />WHAT THE F*** IS THIS!!?? After all that...all the reading...all that build up...all that harnessing of her power...the Volturi walks away??? NO. There was no way. No f****** way! You mean to tell me, I had to sit through and read all about these other vampires from God knows where - and their specific powers, mind you - with names and baggages of their own, to have them just walk away? Why did I even ned to know about Benjamin or Kate or the Amazonian woman or Eleazar or Imun - when they DID NOTHING TO ADVANCE...anything! You mean to tell me all the pages I read about how Bella stretched her fabric shield was for...kicks? I read paragraphs upon paragraphs of how Bella snuck away to get Jacob & Nessie proper papers so they can run away and be safe then the backpack (where she hid all of this) didn't leave Nessie's back? You mean to tell me after all of that, Meyer whips out a few more unknown half-vampires and Aro goes, \\"Oh well! Sure, I believe you, oh random guy from the south, Let's all pack up eh, Volturi gang?\\"<br /><br />That was not an ending. For what it's worth, that was an introduction to the Jacob / Nessie show. So, I'm confused. Why did Meyer leave it all open ended like that, only to stamp \\"The End\\" on the very next page? Why even introduce that other half-vampire? Why even allude that he might be interested in Nessie? Why did it feel like the Volturi is not over? After I put down the book...I just shook my head thinking, \\"Well, there's another book right?\\"<br /><br />Here are my other nit-picks:<br /><br />1) Bella resigned to die if Edward dies. I have a big problem with this. Bella, you have a daughter. You don't get to decide that you WILL DIE if EDWARD DIES.<br /><br />2) Renesmee will grow until she looks about 18 then will stop growing and stay the beautiful age of 18 forever. Really, Meyer. How convenient. No explanation too...just a nice easy way out. And really, a little ageist. What does she have against middle-aged vampires?<br /><br />3) Bella was a super-vampire. Again, how convenient that Bella as a newborn was the best! She's SUPER_DUPER! She didn't even kill anyone (or felt the need to!)...not even stupid strangers like J Jenks. And..AND...she's got the shield thing going on and learned all her powers within a month!<br /><br />4) Bella super loved being a vampire. Ooh, vampire sex is so much better than human sex. Ooh, vampire kissing is soo much better than human kissing. What-ever! I would rather see her having some remorse to her human life. All the other vampires would've given up everything to be human again...<br /><br />5) What happened to Renee?? Did she never just try to find out what is up with her daughter? Hello, apparently she was deathly ill!! And, Bella never made an attempt to contact her mother even though she thought she was going to die? She made an effort to spend Christmas with charlie! What, no time to call her own mother to say, Merry Christmas!? What a fluke to name your daughter after her and not care the slightest about her.<br /><br />6) What happened to the Cullens? In a weird way, even though they were present in the book, I hardly felt them. In Book 3, did we ever hear Rosalie? Did Esme even speak? Where was the sexy debonair Edward? He seemed like a non-entity here.<br /><br />7) Shape-Shifters?? Ugh, puh-leez.<br /><br />8) Charlie not wanting to know what's going on with Bella is Meyer's easy way out. It was like she didn't know how to get Charlie involved that won't derail her story, because, really - you, as a dad, would want to know what was going on with your daughter. I just don't buy that he'd look the other way. I would buy him making Bella tell him then leaving it be. Meyer needed Bella to be as pure and not disobeying the law as possible.<br /><br />9) Jacob & Edward - BFF? Oh Come ON!!!! Meyer just wants to give Bella everything she wanted didn't she? Too unbelievable. Too convenient.<br /><br />My reviews for other books in the Twilight series here:<br />[...]<br /><br />I seem to be having a hard time posting my other reviews....over? After I put down the book...I just shook my head thinking, \\"Well, there's another book right?\\"     Here are my other nit-picks:    1) Bella resigned to die if Edward dies. I have a big problem with this. Bella, you have a daughter. You don't get to decide that you WILL DIE if EDWARD DIES.    2) Renesmee will grow until she looks about 18 then will stop growing and stay the beautiful age of 18 forever. Really, Meyer. How convenient. No explanation too...just a nice easy way out. And really, a little ageist. What does she have against middle-aged vampires?    3) Bella was a super-vampire. Again, how convenient that Bella as a newborn was the best! She's SUPER_DUPER! She didn't even kill anyone (or felt the need to!)...not even stupid strangers like J Jenks. And..AND...she's got the shield thing going on and learned all her powers within a month!    4) Bella super loved being a vampire. Ooh, vampire sex is so much better than human sex. Ooh, vampire kissing is soo much better than human kissing. What-ever! I would rather see her having some remorse to her human life. All the other vampires would've given up everything to be human again...    5) What happened to Renee?? Did she never just try to find out what is up with her daughter? Hello, apparently she was deathly ill!! And, Bella never made an attempt to contact her mother even though she thought she was going to die? She made an effort to spend Christmas with charlie! What, no time to call her own mother to say, Merry Christmas!? What a fluke to name your daughter after her and not care the slightest about her.    6) What happened to the Cullens? In a weird way, even though they were present in the book, I hardly felt them. In Book 3, did we ever hear Rosalie? Did Esme even speak? Where was the sexy debonair Edward? He seemed like a non-entity here.    7) Shape-Shifters?? Ugh, puh-leez.    8) Charlie not wanting to know what's going on with Bella is Meyer's easy way out. It was like she didn't know how to getCharlie involved that won't derail her story, because, really - you, as a dad, would want to know what was going on with your daughter.

Too convenient.     My reviews for other books in the Twilight series here:  [...]    I seem to be having a hard time posting my other reviews....
B001LRJH0K|4.0|The book was good, same for the movie. That alone is a feat not usually seen. The same laconic tough guys kick butt. The plot changes some, but it feels the same. A mean and lean western. One hopes the sequel can follow the book sequel.
1594481717|5.0|Dan's book led me to go on a three-day solo retreat which I considered to be THE BEST THING I did this year.  The book also explained to me better than anything before how the right brain and the left brain are different.  It also inspired, and continues to inspire me towards challenging and transcending my own assumptions about life.  One specific outcome: I started dating again after a long hiatus.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A complete tour de force!  A movie that charmingly pushes its message without preaching.  There's something for all ages.
0345440900|5.0|This book and method was a huge help for us, and advised us on how to keep our schedule and life the way it was. Its suggestions and practices helped us understand our baby's needs and discomforts and since she was 4 months old, our baby had full night sleep! Highly recommended to all beginner parents.   We are 15 weeks pregnant now, and we are planing on staring this method on our second baby from day one. It worked for our first one, hoping it will work on the second, since we have a very god example of what our first one turned into ;)
B001AEF6BI|3.0|The Breakfast Club is a film for nostalgia lovers of the 80\\", repleat with music of that semi-wonderous time.  Molly Ringwald gives a great performance, as does the almost silent Ally Sheedy. Paul Gleason is his loving self, as the headmaster in charge. The film's bad boy Judd Nelson, is entertaining and provides the necessary sparkplug to get things going, innevitably with a love affair, with guess who. No, not with Emillio Estavez, the jock who I guess was the character representing the establishment. All in all, maybe better than a 3 star film, had only The Smiths tunes been used. How Soon Is Now, The Headmasters Ritual,THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE, would have fit well with this film, but alas....
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Superior production of the musical. Newly choreographed and arranged for this video.  Excellent performances by a mostly British cast.  Each word of every lyric understandable.  Each dance a dream come true.   I highly recommend it.

I love the relationship that Dean and Sam have on the show and i liked watching the blooper reels of Jensen and Jared!I also liked their versions of some of the urban legends floating around out there, if ur a fan of scary tale check it out!
B000VDDWDS|4.0|I didn't know what to expect, in fact, I actually expected this to be a long drawn out movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a good story that keeps your interest. Although the picture quality of this blu ray is excellent, the sound steals the show. Those with a capable speaker setup (especially the sub) will benefit the most. In the first scene it sounded and felt like the canon ball was going straight through my room. There are even times where it seems like things were gonna fall on my head. If you've never seen this movie, I would rent it first. If you have seen the movie, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this blu ray just for its demo worthy soundtrack.
006135323X|2.0|Dan Ariely holds a named professorship at MIT;  there is no higher rank in American academia.  I am willing to accept these credentials as showing that he is a very important scholar.  His field seems to be experimental social psychology, and/or marketing    So far so good.  But the book, to this reader, says nothing whatever.     First, it is chatty, but not in an agreeable way.   Three quarters of its verbiage, roughly, could have been omitted  without loss to content.   Don't tell me about how much you like your friends, man, get on with the point.  And please, do you really have to repeat a point over and over, and then once more, for good measure ?    I am sure that many of the experiments that Professor Ariely reports have substance and seriousness. But in the Professor's telling of them in this book, they come across as so much belaboring the obvious.  A whole painful chapter is spent on how apparently serious social scientists discovered that young men are affected by sexual passion while they masturbate.  Come on,  you didn't know that, seriously  ?    Perhaps the author thought that reporting social science to non-specialists requires dumbing down, and then more dumbing.  But he is mistaken in that.  There is a long history of excellent, serious popular writing by scholars.  The volume at hand, by contrast, is an insult to the reader.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell writes in an \\"easy read\\" style to get his points across. I have read 3 of his books.  All brought to my attention new thoughts along with clear explanations of ideas that I had heard or read about but felt incomplete.
0553812211|5.0|Never one to be deterred by legal \\"technicalities\\" when he solves his cases, Patrick Kenzie, a Boston private detective, is up to his eyeballs in his own problems when Karen Nichols asks him to stop a stalker. Kenzie and his long-time partner/sometimes lover Angie Gennaro have worked together in four previous Dennis Lehane novels, but they have now split, and Kenzie is at loose ends. After solving Karen's problem, he ignores a later phone call, then reads six months later that she has jumped to her death. Thinking that she must have had a new problem that he was too \\"busy\\" to investigate, he wonders if he might have contributed to her death and feels honor bound to find out why she jumped.<br /><br />As Kenzie investigates Karen's background and family, he turns up what may be the most dysfunctional family situation ever created. But he also discovers that Karen led a totally different life at the time of her death than the seemingly innocent and vulnerable life she led just six months before. Her mother and stepfather are unfazed by her death--and no one misses her or mourns her--except Kenzie, who is more curious than mournful. Teaming up once again with Angie, who helped him with an early aspect of the case, he continues his investigation, eventually calling upon Bubba Rogowski, another old friend, for help. Rogowski, a Vietnam War vet with \\"lobster tails\\" of scars on his chest and hidden shrapnel within his chest, has even bigger scars and \\"shrapnel\\" within his psyche.<br /><br />As Kenzie uncovers Karen's long-time psychiatric problems and their origin within her family, the suspense ratchets up. Karen's little half-sister died at the age of four, and her stepbrother Wesley has had no contact with the family for ten years. Kenzie's insatiable curiosity about the family leads to new information that complicates what might have been a relatively straightforward case of family dysfunction and turns it into a case of manipulation, psychological warfare, and emotional torture.<br /><br />Lehane, an absolute master of suspense, juggles plot lines and complications with aplomb, in the process creating intense scenes filled with local color and oddball details. As his characters face (and create) scenes of stomach-turning violence (and even sadism), the focus remains on people, not violence for its own sake. Though no one can claim that these are all rounded characters, they are usually unique, so fascinating that the reader always feels their behavior to be at least plausible--for them.

B001GXY92U|5.0|David Fray's splendid new recording of some of the most famous Bach keyboard concertos is an excellent modern take on these wonderful pieces, with superb orchestral backing. Fray reminds me a little of the great Romanian pianist Dinu Lipatti, who died so young. He brings a romantic but powerful approach and makes no attempt at period authenticity. I also enjoy a more historical approach, and even enjoy the very stripped down versions of these works in a recent recording by harpsichordist Octavio Dantone (on Archive) who is accompanied by just four string players. Both approaches work very well and I never tire of these great works. Highly recommended.

B001FB0WBK|4.0|If you've seen the PBS special \\"Center Stage\\" that aired in 2006, you needn't worry that this disc duplicates material from that show. While the venue's the same, the setlist is completely different. Host Bob Littell shows up once again, this time only to accompany Tommy on harp. That's where the similarity ends. That was a great video; this one's every bit its equal.<br /><br />Except for one thing.<br /><br />One of the most endearing parts of a performance by Tommy Emmanuel is the communication he has with his audience. This shows up in Tommy's behavior, energy and enthusiasm while performing, and also between songs, when he talks to the audience. It's an essential part of the show. During the 2006 video the banter was edited but not eliminated. Unfortunately, this time the editors chose to delete almost all of the between-song chatter completely.<br /><br />Instead of contributing to the flow, as apparently was their aim, this editing diminishes it. Without the breathing room Tommy's commentary provides, this video runs more like a studio recording, with each track segueing quickly into the next.<br /><br />No matter how excellent a performer is, without inter-track relief as provided by Tommy's speech the viewer is bound to suffer some fatigue. Yes, Tommy's incredible. But the fact that his show features only one person and a guitar is a double-edged sword. The variety and personal perspective provided by his commentary contributes to an even richer experience.<br /><br />Plus there's the fact that the video is not an accurate representation of what it's like to actually have been there. In reality, Tommy talks a lot more than this. We saw this show 3 months after this video was recorded, and our reaction to the first deletion was \\"what the...?\\" Because of the editing this video is not the same as being there. There's no reason that it shouldn't be.<br /><br />The producers did put some of Tommy's extended comments on the bonus section, but that misses the mark. One can't simply decide that a meal would be more intense without liquid refreshment and include a pitcher of water at the end of it as an afterthought. It won't be as good as providing the diners beverages, and the opportunity for palate-cleansing, between bites and courses. That's what Tommy does, figuratively speaking, during the actual show.<br /><br />Tommy knows what he's doing, and the product he creates. It should have been left as is.<br /><br />Even with this criticism, 4 stars. We are, after all, talking about details.<br /><br />But then, what is the entire concert, other than a study in mastery of detail?ore intense without liquid refreshment and include a pitcher of water at the end of it as an afterthought.

0670020478|5.0|I first learned of Sir Ken Robinson through watching his lecture \\"Do Schools Kill Creativity\\" free on the Internet last year (his talks have been viewed millions of times by people across the world). In that talk he mentions he was in the process of writing a book -- THE ELEMENT: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything -- is that book. I was thrilled to be able to attend a lecture, one of the first stops on the book tour to promote this book and was so inspired I bought the book immediately.<br /><br />This book's audience is every person in the world, every single one of us could benefit from reading and applying the information in this book. In addition to being about changes that a person can make in their own life during adulthood, the book also speaks to teachers and other adults who are involved in educating children. People interested in learning styles, learning disabilities, alternative education and education reform may be interested in this book. All types of artists and creative people may like to read THE ELEMENT.<br /><br />The books starts off discussing children, how all children are unique, have certain interests and natural talents; have an inborn curiosity and a capacity to learn. Sadly, school is sometimes a place where some children are stifled and changed for the worse. Despite best intentions by society for children `to become educated', the issues with designing a `one size fits all' curriculum for mass institutional schools creates its own set of problems. In an effort to raise everyone's educational level up, some fall through the cracks, or their square pegs don't fit in the round holes. The way modern schooling is conducted damages some children. Attempts to educate all children to one standard plan does not allow all children with varying natural talents to shine. The very method of institutional schooling with its standard teaching and standardized testing not to mention the effects in American public schools of No Child Left Behind (when teachers are spending lots of class time teaching to the test or perfecting test taking skills) trains children to think there is only one right answer, therefore killing the creativity that was present within the child before they stepped foot in school. The book is a call for education reformation (transformation) but the author stops short before actionable suggestions are made (I suspect because the issue has been discussed ad nauseum by others over many years time, and still the system is still far from ideal). But, the ideas in the book may plant seeds of change within the minds of school teachers, administrators and parents, and perhaps others can come up with creative ideas on how to affect real change. If not, the individual can always use the advice in this book on themselves when they are teenagers or adults.<br /><br />Discussed is the fact that children who were labeled with conditions such as ADD/ADHD or who are deemed learning disabled were made to feel they are broken, different (in a bad way), or stupid. We hear stories of some people who found passion in other areas of life that were not the focus in traditional schools (especially the arts) but wound up not just fulfilled but successful at their job, wealthy and with celebrity status, sometimes with their area of strength being directly from their `disability'. Somehow, the book manages to come off pro-teacher though, in no way is this book an attack on the teaching profession in general.<br /><br />The book then shifts to a discussion of creativity and of the flow state (citing the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ) and encourages everyone to find their creative selves. It is never too late. Adults can find their passion, in spite of any past negative experiences. We can use our passions to do creative work of our choosing, even in the spare time left over after our main work is completed (such as a full-time job to earn a paycheck) while provides a feeling of fulfillment that impacts theirentire life in a positive way. Sir Ken Robinson seems to hope that all people would find their passion in life (including in mid-life or in one's twilight years) and to not just focus on getting through life with a more basic survival mentality, bored and feeling empty inside but making ends meet (or living with large paychecks but still unhappy). Some people wind up finding a way to pursue their passion full time and can make a living from it too. These ideas are matched with many real life stories, many from personal interviews.<br /><br />Advice on how to find one's passion, how to quiet the voices of the naysayers, and how to find new support by finding one's tribe is discussed. Attitude is very important as is seeking opportunities, not just relying on luck. Robinson outlines his steps to put these ideas into practical application. A thorough discussion of what creativity is and how to take practical steps to use creativity and make things happen is not just inspirational but makes it clear that all people can begin living a creative life at any time they choose to open their minds to the notion and commit to taking active steps to make it happen.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the book!<br /><br />The book was a fast and easy read. Research studies are cited to back up some of the information and statistics, so it is not just a book of opinion and personal theories. References are made to ideas contained in books written by others and my interest was piqued enough to go on to read those next.<br /><br />I have a few criticisms about the book. (Despite these I love the book and still rate it 5 stars!)<br /><br />1. About two-third's into the book I became bored of so many personal stories about celebrities or those who achieved personal wealth through pursuit of their passion (i.e. CEOs and others at the `top of the status chart'). It was a bit too much like \\"celebrity worship\\" or \\"rich people worship\\", something I don't do. He doesn't just discuss happy musicians but tells the story of Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Elvis--some of the biggest names in music history!<br /><br />2. Some evidence for the over-emphasis on the rich and famous is that despite an entire chapter being about how `regular people' can pursue their passion in one's `spare time' and feel fulfilled but never get rich or famous from what they do, there are not enough stories about that type of experience. I'm impressed and inspired by all kinds of success stories and I am sure that others are too.<br /><br />3. There is a great discussion of \\"professional amateurs\\" (aka Pro-Am's) which is about some people being experts on a subject despite not getting paid to do learn or do that kind of work for pay, but the weird thing is that only two stories in the chapter feature happy people pursuing their passion that didn't wind up winning an award or becoming famous or transforming it into a full-time job/paid career!<br /><br />A comment I'd like to make about Pro-Am's is that a perfect example are the Generation X mothers today (like me), who are college educated and had good careers, but left their careers to raise children then wound up using their extra time and energy to find their creativity and to pursue their passion. I can also say that of the past generations of women who society labeled as being 'just housewives' (assuming their lives were boring and unfulfilling), some actually had discovered their passion and were living it (like my mother and my grandmothers did).<br /><br />A comment (not a complaint) I will share is that some of the advice is self-help advice common in a number of other, older books about self-actualization on the market. THE ELEMENT does have a different spin and twist--this was fine with me (because I feel that hearing good advice numerous times and from different sources is useful) but some readers who've read other books about self-help, attitude or self-actualization who want completely new and fresh ideas may be a little disappointed.<br /><br />As a home educating parent who chose this path for my children for an `alternative education' experience reason primarily, I will share that the book never discusses home education as a viable option for children who are suffering or not thriving in school, those with learning disabilities or whose natural talent for the arts are not being nurtured in mainstream public schools. Homeschooling parents will probably enjoy this book as the good messages contained in it can be applied in the homeschooling journey down the alternative education path.<br /><br />The book is fantastic and inspirational. Read it and use the good advice it contains!f the biggest names in music history!    2.

B000W7JWUA|4.0|Great game. First got hooked on it in college. Its like monopoly except with more strategy involved.    I am a bit peeved that this particular edition does not have movable harbors, and to change them you have to use those cardboard circle thingies.    But still a great game, wish I bought the expansion at the same time.
031606792X|4.0|I really liked the book .  When I started the series--- I kept thinking  if someone told me I would like a book about a high school girl in Forks, WA who falls in love with a vampire and has a werewolf for a best friend--I would have said--  you are nuts!  But I really got caught up in the story--  several things bugged me in the first couple of books-- I thought it was silly how clumsy she made Bella-- unrealistic and annoying---  but other than that I liked the whole series and thought Breaking Dawn was the best one of all.

B000000I0I|2.0|I usually don't take the time to write reviews but I feel strongly about this one. IMHO, Mike Oldfield had written one of *the* instrumental masterpieces of all time. And its called \\"Songs of Distant Earth\\".<br />SDE, has been a very influential record for me as a composer and a<br />music lover. Several people have said to me \\"oh yeah, Songs of Distant<br />Earth is great and all but, you do you have Ommadawn?\\" I had heard bits<br />here at Amazon in the past and passed on it but being the huge Oldfield fan I am, I bought it and listened. I admit that the 2 records are pretty different in terms of the period and the approach to production but they are both clearly Mike Oldfield. With that in mind combined with the fact that so many seem to proclaim \\"Ommadawn\\" as his Masterpiece, I must say that I humbly disagree. I would not hesitate to recommend Songs of Distant Earth to any music lover but honestly would not recommend Ommadawn.<br />On a side note, I have been listening to the samples of \\"Music of the Spheres\\" as I have been writing this and is sounds really good! I am really looking forward to buying it after posting this review.<br />Thanks for reading. One of the great things about music is there are all different kinds for all different ears and we all don't really need to agree as to what works for us as individuals. :^) Mike if you read this, you are a brilliant composer/producer!!

0739328271|4.0|Hmmm, I am still wondering what I really think of these between the numbers books. Evanovich really enjoys writing them and that shows through in the story. Its oddball in the extreme. First there is Diesel - that's all he is ever known as - some kind of supernatural bounty hunter who replaces Ranger and Morelli as the guy interest in this series. Well be may or may not be supernatural - he may just be Swiss.     Then there is the type of mystery - it usually has a supernatural element to it - Santa Claus, Elves, etc. Not so much in this one except Diesel's cousin, nemesis and fellow Swiss, Wulf - is the bad guy causing all the problems. He might or might not be supernatural too. This gives Evanovich a lot of fun stuff to play with between STephanie and Diesel - and the rest of the cast of characters. There is some pretty fun dialogue that goes on between Diesel and Steph, and there is a bit of sexual tension there too.     The story, to sum up, is that STephanie is short of cash, can't run down her FTA's but one of them might be involved with Diesel's FTA - Wulf. So they team up - well Diesel does - Stephie doesn't want to - but he just moves in to her apartment, as you do in Plum's world.     She also has a problem with a Monkey called Carl who has been left with her while her friend is on holiday. Carl also seems to be more than a monkey but a bit less than a child, and he knows how to flip the bird.    Together they have to track down Wulf and Munch (who is a weedy nerd who is assisting him) before they put together a weapon of global destruction (well of sorts) and try to take over the world. As you do. It is based in the Barrens, and so allows an even greater number of strange and unusual characters to be introduced, - the Fire Farter, the Easter Bunny and so on.    There is the usual cast of characters here - Lula, Grandma, even Big Blue makes a come back. Cars explode, guns are shot and Stephanie gets her man in the end.     However, while I enjoyed the story, I just can't get my head around the supernatural stuff. I much prefer the numbers ones, which don't involve 'ju ju'.

0061684384|5.0|\\"High Voltage Tattoo\\" is not just the name of the California tattoo shop where \\"L.A. Ink\\" is filmed, but also the title of Kat Von D's first book. You will learn about Von D's upbringing, her influences, and the stories behind some of the tattoos featured therein. The pictures are amazing. The book reminds me of a high-school yearbook with its puffed cover and glossy pages. In some aspects of society tattoos (and body piercings) are not 100% accepted by those who put their noses up in the air over such things. You can aquire one or two tattoos and some tiny piercings, but if a person wants more than one tattoo or a whole body piece their choices should be respected and not seen as a repulsion, which is just a form of discrimination. And this is coming (sorry, Margaret Cho) from a reviewer who currently is a blank canvas. I would love to get a tattoo at High Voltage whether by Kat or her equally well-trained staff. The tattoo lifestyle has a ring to freedom to it which is enviable for those of us who are stuck in day-to-day job ruts. In this day and age where the airwaves are chock full of idiots in their faux 15-minute fame, Kat Von D is the real deal. She deserves her success and she encourages everyone to go after their dreams. The book is awesome and a general good read. I finished it in one day. Five stars.

Take all that out except leave in the special effects and you get Wanted.

Watch it. Have fun with it...and forget about it soon after.
B00127RAJY|2.0|This DVD was a disappointment to me. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the first segment was the better one, however, I could not imagine doing the same segment over and over for days or weeks, because she doesn't cover all the muscle groups. In fact, even if you do all 3, you don't get a balanced workout. I don't recall a single tricep exercise anywhere.  The order of weights, cardio, then core bothered me the most. Basically, after each cardio burst you are supposed to lie down flat with your heart rate way up high - what the heck? I don't think Jillian is very knowledgeable when it comes to fitness and her personality and DVDs reflect that.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|I don't watch shows like Lost on TV.  Too many commercials and if you miss an episode, you might as well give it up.  YOu never catch up.  So I buy these shows on DVD.  However Lost is such a big hit in my house and with my kids, I won't get to see if for another six monthes.  Right now it is in Annapolis with my son.  He will pass it on to the daughter in Rochester and then I will get it back to watch.  But that is the nice thing about it.  I can watch it no matter how far in the future and I dont have to watch any #$%^&  commercials.

B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson did an excellent job on both sides of the camera for the movie, Braveheart. Although Randal Wallace and Gibson took many liberties with the historical context, I personally couldn't care less. The scenery was beautiful, the battle scenes were awesome and the amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable.  Although the level of gore (especially certain ending scenes) might turn a few wimpy spectators away, for the more action-oriented viewers, you won't be disappointed.     The movie is an epic tale of 13-century Scottish leader William Wallace, who leads a revolt against England's oppressive Edward I.  Although Wallace attempts to avoid the conflict, events eventually force his hand and transport us into a passionate story about what a man will truly do out of revenge for his country and people. Despite the fact, the story turns sour for Wallace towards the climax, the movie does not disappoint the audience with a completely grim ending.     Gibson using stunning camera angles and phenomenal battle scenes that weave an all-around good tale. He portrays the epitome of the Romantic Hero and definitely earns 5 stars from me.
B0000009NS|5.0|After the years I've come to consider this my favorite Bowie album.  As experimental music enthusiast, I regard this album best of two worlds: Bowie and forward-thinking music.  Low and Heroes are good, yes, and at first I was bummed that this album had none of the fantastic instrumentals, but I came to realize that the art rock and experimental material of those two albums were just more fused together in Lodger.<br /><br />Some of the music herein is along punk boundaries, but in the way that seems to say 'Call this what you like, it's still what it is regardless'.  Surely a lot of people would call The Berlin Trilogy a flop with Bowie at the wheel on a road to nowhere, but this outcome is in my opinion his strongest album.  While the other two albums are not in the least shaky or poorly produced, as would the albums sound by anyone other than Bowie, but Lodger just feels more refined, taking back some pop characteristics while retaining the strong desire to try new things.<br /><br />Fantastic Voyage is about the most pop-sounding track in all of the Berlin Trilogy, and with that a misleading first step into the album; still a great song though.  It's grown on me after a while and I love it.<br /><br />African Night Flight overshadows the light flavor of FV with jungle-esque percussion, fast-paced and chanting vocals and additional moody atmosphere provided by heavy synths.  One of my all-time favorite songs, it's both catchy and odd at the same time.<br /><br />The music for Move On was inspired by playing 'All the Young Dudes' backwards; with that said, this makes for another strange listen.  It features some strong vocalization by Bowie, as usual, with a tint of something unplacebly foreign sounding.  After all times I've listened to this song I just can't understand what makes this song so great.<br /><br />Yassassin (Turkish For Long Live) is perhaps the most culture-tinged piece of the album, with some odd Mid-Eastern feel, hence the name.  This song was actually released as a promo single in--guess where--Turkey.  It's obvious that Bowie was determined to get a certain feel out of this song as concerned with style, and he pulled it off well.<br /><br />Before I'd gotten this album I had Red Sails on a compilation LP called Golden Years.  I thought it was one of the strangest tracks Bowie'd ever accomplished, until I got the rest of the album.  It does boast a surfer exploitation, but as I said before nothing on this album is exactly what it is, as this song carries a lot of influences.<br /><br />DJ will be, to me at least, among the very best of his singles.  It shows to all the Ziggy fans that Bowie can be creative, modern, and radio-worthy all at once.<br /><br />For some reason Look Back In Anger has never been a song I'm that fond of.  Something about the mixing, I think, that just doesn't feel right, like as how Move On has that great hidden something that speaks to me every time I hear, to me this song has a bad hidden component that just doesn't do it for me.<br /><br />I'm surprised Boys Keep Swinging had become such a big hit despite how fun it truly is; it's weird with slurred guitars and keyboards, but through the vocals and structure keeps a poppy feel.  Very cool song, single, and video.<br /><br />Repetition sort of feels to me like a strange finale for the album, with heavy and somewhat disturbing lyrics and music.  One of the best tracks on the album in my opinion, again it has that indescribable something.  The lyrical content is a little edgier and angrier, which feels like a precursor to the Scary Monsters persona.<br /><br />Red Money is actually Bowie's version of the song Sister Midnight originally released by Iggy Pop, along with Bowie's later super-hit China Girl which they both wrote and produced.  Kind of a weak track, it just sort of sits at the end of the album, with little of the general feel of Lodger.  It's a great song, but to me feels rather out of place.<br /><br />But you cannot forget the two amazing bonus Ryko tracks: I Pray Ole, a solid album outtake that would've fit perfectly well into the mix, and the 88' version of Look Back In Anger which is about the best recording he'd done before Tin Machine; actually I feel that this recording may've been a boost of morale for Bowie, as it took his work back into a harder edge.  Even though two bonus tracks are nice I would've liked to have gotten more, like the '79 session outtake of Panic In Detroit and whatever gems may lie in Bowie's vault, but I'm still very grateful.<br /><br />I love this album and consider it one of the few albums that I cannot live my life without.  Everytime I hear it it sounds fresh, with something new to take in every time.  I only wish that Bowie had maintained his desire to create something new, then maybe his 80's catalogue wouldn't have been so bad.ectly well into the mix, and the 88' version of Look Back In Anger which is about the best recording he'd done before Tin Machine; actually I feel that this recording may've been a boost of morale for Bowie, as it took his work back into a harder edge.

Since then, i bought there albums and attended all their concerts. Just watching Flea play his bass is worth every penny spent on tickets. If you want to attend at least one concert, i highly recommend The Chili Peppers. \\"Freaky Styley\\", in my opinion, is one of their best recordings.A matter of fact, all there recordings are great!
B00168OINK|5.0|Blu-Ray might as well have been created just for digital animation. This movie looks so good it's unbelievable. I told my wife I was buying this movie so I could watch it with our daughter, but I have watched it about 5 times all by myself. The level of clarity and detail is unmatched. If you are considering the switch to Blu Ray go to your local retailer and have them pop this disc in. If watching it doesn't help you make up your mind then nothing will. Oh yeah I forgot, besides looking great it's a hilarious movie. Jack Black's personality comes through in the animation of the hero Po. The other voice talent is top notch too. You have to love James Hong (Waynes World, and Big Trouble in Little China) as Po's unlikely father. A great movie, a great spectacle, tons of replay value, buy it now!!!

The first true episode stars Catherine Tate as Donna Noble, a temp from Cheswick. She is the most energetic, and sassy companion for quite a ling time. There is no romantic interest between the Doctor and Donna, but the chemistry is excellent. The writing is solid, and the actors did their jobs well.

0316017922|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell appears to have found a unique niche in the American literary world, a frizzy-haired faux-naïf who reveals in a friendly, non-threatening way the secret mysteries of the modern world as mere trifles of clever insight. Never mind the lack of academic rigor, or his propensity for allowing a good anecdote to suffice as proof of a generality. Or, as we used to say with intended irony in undergraduate engineering, drawing conclusions from a limited sample of one.     OUTLIERS continues Mr. Gladwell's literary career of stating the obvious. This time, he tackles the question of success, without of course defining what \\"success\\" is other than somehow being as famous as Michael Jordan, Mozart, the Beatles, or Bill Gates. Nevertheless, in Mr. Gladwell's considered worldview, success is just barely a product of intrinsic ability. Rather, it is the product of effort, the result of achieving a semi-mystical 10,000 hour barrier that constitutes for Gladwell the admission ticket for that success/fame. Anyone can be a Beatle or a Bill Gates, as long as they have the rudimentary skill set and the perseverance to reach that 10,000 hour goal. Along the way, though, it apparently helps to be the lucky product of one's environment - being born in the right month or the right country, in the right year or to the right parents, into the right community or religious group. How is one to recognize this socio-parental context and maximize whatever future advantages it confers? Aye, as they say, there's the rub.    Gladwell's book opens with a discussion of the singular lack of heart disease found in an Italian-American community in Roseto, Pennsylvania, arguing that their confounding experience was the result of the isolated community context the residents had transplanted from their home country. This somehow paves the way for talking about professional Canadian hockey players, a disproportionate share of whom were born in the early months of their respective birth years.Their birth dates made them the oldest and (on average) physically fastest and strongest in their particular age cohorts, hence enabling them to achieve places on traveling teams and all-star groupings. This fortuitous accidents of birth gave them in turn more playing time, better coaching, and more and better competition as they strove toward their magical 10,000 hours.     These opening chapters set the stage for a wandering journey through the careers of Mozart and the early Beatles as well as those of information technologists Bill Joy (Unix and Sun Microsystems) and Bill Gates, then on to an unsuccessful fellow with a genius IQ named Chris Langan and finally to bankruptcy lawyer Joseph Flom. Thus ends the first half of OUTLIERS, having accomplished little more than demonstrating the old adage that \\"Luck is the intersection of preparation with opportunity.\\" Hardly a devastating revelation that both elements are necessary.     In the book's second half, Gladwell switches to the coincidence part, placing it in a sociocultural context by arguing that one's cultural legacy influences one's behavior. He scurries from the Hatfields versus the McCoys in rural Kentucky to Korean airline pilots to Asian students' success in mathematics. The author's discussion of this last topic is particularly indicative of his flights of speculative fancy. First he argues that \\"rice societies\\" are more dependent on mathematical thinking than \\"wheat societies.\\" Then he decides that the Western world's math deficiencies are the result of the way we name our numbers, not as efficient or straightforward as the Chinese method. After that, he decides that Asian students are just more persistent in attacking and trying to solve math problems. Does one of these characteristics take precedence over the others? Do they derive from one another? Is there research to back up any of these claims? Don't hold your breath, at least not while reading OUTLIERS. Supporting research would only burden theauthor's light, colloquial touch.     One finishes OUTLIERS with the feeling of having been fleeced, like spending $795 for a \\"Success Seminar\\" only to walk out having been told nothing but the obvious. The speaker may have been dynamic and entertaining, perhaps even a success in his or her own right, but was it really worth the time and money to leave feeling so cheapened?
0385340990|4.0|i did not expect to enjoy this book -- the title is cloying and i feared some cutesy, homey little story.  surprisingly, i read it in two days and enjoyed it immensely.  the protagonist was refreshing, honest and clever without trying to come off as such, and the various characters, while they WERE characters,  were well-drawn and interesting without being self-conscious and artificial.  the storyline itself was compelling.

078401213X|3.0|When my parents came to visit to celebrate my father's birthday, my wife rented Pi, an \\"indie sci-fi\\" film as described by Netflix.  When I used those two words to describe the movie, he said, \\"oh great, I've never seen an Indian science fiction movie!\\"<br /><br />Pi was not made by Indians.  And it's not really a science fiction movie.  It's more of a weird fiction movie, extrapolating a single idea and obsessing over it.  Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a brilliant, eccentric mathematician who is convinced he can apply the laws of mathematics to nature, and by proxy, the stock market.  Since the stock market is a reflection of humanity, which is a reflection of nature, he believes there is a pattern that can be mathematically predicted.  Predict the stock market and get rich, right?<br /><br />From the beginning, we're never sure why Max wants so badly to pursue this path to power.  Is he sick of being poor?  Perhaps it's to succeed where his mentor, Sol Robenson (Mark Margolis), failed.  Sol's stroke stopped him from puzzling out of the answer, which is precisely 216 characters long.<br /><br />And so we have two philosophies that are actually one and the same: that mathematics of sufficient scope IS nature. Or in other words, the entire universe could be predicted if we just had enough computing power to handle it.  Which could be interpreted as the definition of God.  This dichotomy manifests as the Kabbalist Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman) on one side and the corporate goon Marcy Dawson (Pamela Hart) on the other.  Meyer seeks to reclaim the connection with the heavens through the Tetragrammaton, the name of God, and he believes it's 216 characters long.  Dawson just wants Max to figure out the secret of the stock market, presumably to make a lot of money.  It's the old religion vs. science debate.<br /><br />The stark black and white film further delineates Pi's either/or approach.  It's so washed out that it begins to induce the migraines Max experiences as he gets ever closer to the truth.  Aronofsky is a master of translating human misery through visceral images, and the whip-snapshot sequences of Requiem for a Dream's drug addiction are in full evidence here. Even the soundtrack sounds similar, which plucks at the nerve endings in your gums with ever-increasing urgency.<br /><br />Pi isn't a bad film, but it's intellectually challenging.  There's precious little science in Pi, or valid mathematics, or even an accurate portrayal of Kabablism. It uses artistic license to make its point -- that the nature of God is beyond human ken - and ultimately beats the viewer over the head with it in the end.

0743270754|5.0|There are so many glowing reviews that I skipped to the bad reviews, to see what people didn't like. Aside from the people who are simply anti-Lincoln, the biggest complaint seems to be that it's not what people expected. The focus of this book isn't the Civil War itself, and only to some extent Lincoln himself. Rather it is the trade-offs and compromises that make up the political process. It is full of pieces that flesh out many of the characters that we know one-dimensionally (if at all) and makes clear just how precarious the whole thing was. It's easy, after the fact, to see victory by the North as inevitable, but DKG's careful tracing of the competing political visions and personalities shows the weaknesses in the apparently stronger North. It is true, as one reviewer complained, that it sometimes reads like a novel- but that is a credit to how well written the work is: to be able to take dusty historical records and treatises and weave them together into a good read, without sacrificing clarity or accuracy is a great achievement. It is also true, as another reviewer complained, that she does not rap Lincoln's knuckles very hard for his long patience with McClelland (for example). But the book is a great reminder of the complexities of governing in a democracy. And, it is a cracking good read!

In fact, as talented as McCartney is, HIS solo efforts were the least impressive to me, post-Beatles, much less than any of his bandmates' solo efforts, except for one of his most recent releases.

Extremely artistic, out of character, very listenable, original in its occasional deriviteness...doesn't matter...    I won't be specific about each song like SOME reviewer-wannabee's.

B001M5UDGS|1.0|Don't bother.  This isn't even a real DVD, it is a cheap copy of a DVD.  If the people who manufactured this DVD had bothered they could have fit a 1080i version of the movie on a single DVD9 and given you Blu-Ray quality for a DVD price.    Instead they took a low quality 480p version of the movie and just ran it off onto some spare blank DVD-R's they had lying around.  You can get a higher quality version of the movie from iTunes than what is included on the DVD.  It is a complete and total rip off.    Tell the producers to get back to me when they feel like putting together a quality product.  I threw this thing in the trash after one viewing of this low quality pixelated garbage.

I have NOTHING in common with the author. She comes off as such a self-obsessed basket case. First off, while I respect the fact that she doesn't go into the details (I'm assuming they are as petty as she is) of why she couldn't even TRY to make her marriage work, I don't understand why she's trying to invoke my sympathy. No one pointed a gun to her head to walk down the aisle. At first she feels guilty for crashing her husband's world by telling him she needs out (as she should), but selfishly manages to embark on this journey to be able to tell herself, \\"Hey, it's your world, he was just getting in the way.\\" I'm not saying she should be consumed with his suffering, but in this memoir she just doesn't seem to be sincere in accepting and understanding the way he feels. Also, she's been given such a talent to be able to write (I admit that I really like her writing style), plus this talent has given her the opportunity to go to a great university (NYU) and get great jobs enabling her to travel the world and do some interesting work so I find it hard to have a pity party with her. Next up, after her \\"life crisis\\" she's able to walk away from everything and live out of the country for a year making no income to supplement her overseas lifestyle, must be nice. I'm not saying that a divorce and being dumped is easy. I'm simply saying that she came off as incredibly immature for her intelligence (particularly with that David guy) and she seems like she's got alot of time on her hands to be such a navel gazer. Plus, she's so self-congratulatory, it makes the reader want to wretch. All in all, how could this person have a good love life with anyone else when it's obvious to the reader that Gilbert is already in such an intense love affair with herself? How exhausting for her, and for the reader to have to be dragged through this memoir.ave to be dragged through this memoir.

(sort of) ended with this 1996 release, the final album of new material for the company.<br /><br />The 11 tracks were recorded between 1993-1996 and clock in at 39:13. A single was not released, though a music video was issued for Dinner with Delores. Prince billed the songs for private use, which is an obvious shot at the label and the tepid success on the album chart - reaching only #26 - shows that fans were leery of plunking down cash at the record shops.<br /><br />But out of all the chaos is some solid guitar-work by Prince and a cohesive package of music that is not a throwaway to simply fulfill a record contract.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|THE WRESTLER is a small scale, intimate and deeply involving character study, focusing on a man who is a type very unfamiliar to most viewers.  Mickey Rourke plays Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a beaten-down, hard-on-his-luck professional wrestler.  He's clearly been greatly physically abused by his chosen profession, in which he was once a star and now is clinging (barely) to the last shreds of that stardom...participating in low-rent matches in middle school gymnasiums...events attended by perhaps 100 to 200 audience members.  But Ram has also clearly abused himself mentally or emotionally as well.    Although the exact reasons are never specified (and barely hinted at), we imagine drugs/steroids ravaged him...driving him away from his now grown daughter and her mother (we don't know if he was married or not).  He lives in a seedy trailer park in an exceedingly rundown single-wide trailer.  But he still takes his job very seriously.    THE WRESTLER excels in showing us the little details of his life.  Shot in a grainy, documentary style (but make no mistake, director Darren Aronofsky does nothing casually), we see Ram carefully wrapping himself before each show, discussing the \\"script\\" of the upcoming fights with his opponents.  (I hope you weren't still clinging to the idea that this wrestling was \\"real.\\")  He deals with his wounds.  He attends fan autograph signings.  He treats his cheap, out-of-date equipment and marketing materials with great care...they are his livelihood and they are what keeps him attached to his audience.  For Ram loves the adoration of performing and being loved.  His face may resemble ground round, he may wear a hearing aid and carry himself stiffly, but by Golly, he loves to strut around the ring.    Mickey Rourke IS The Ram.  It's the kind of performance where you simply cannot imagine anyone else doing it...by sheer force of will and talent, Rourke has made this character into himself and vice-versa.  But he's not showy about it...he justIS this guy.  And the character he has crafted is a man of constant surprises.  Most of all, I didn't expect him to be so gentle.  He is genuinely encouraging to his fellow wrestlers, many of whom are young and hold The Ram in great esteem.  He is playful with the kids in his neighborhood.  He is tender with the Cassidy, a stripper (Marisa Tomei) who has struck his fancy.  It is almost right to say that he is courtly to those around him.  I expected him to just be this powderkeg ready to go off at any time, but he is far more complex.  He IS consumed by demons of regret and at the frustrations he faces...but he only lashes out occasionally.    Tomei is very good also as the woman who has a hard time believing Ram isn't just trying to have his way with her.  Should she warm to him?  Her Cassidy is also facing the end of her \\"show biz\\" career, as she is clearly not the most desirable lady in the room anymore.  And during a brief conversation with Ram, she suggests to him that he reconnect with his grown daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), an event that will trigger many changes in Ram's life.  I won't say anymore about that, because it is search for some kind of redemption that is the heart of this film.    And mixed in with this already quality story are the scenes backstage and onstage, involving wrestling.  Never a fan, I still found the minutia to be very interesting and convincing.  It is still (IMO) a silly sport...but boy I respect the work these folks do a lot more now.  There is a LOT of real pain involved...and there were moments in this film that were so visceral and convincing, I simply found myself wincing in my seat.    There are many lovely touches in the film...but to give you an idea...one of the very best scenes of the year involves Ram going to work for the first team at the deli counter of the grocery store where he earns the bulk of his living.  Aronofsky's camera follows Rourke through the winding hallways and loading docks of the store...and it's justlike following him through a winding backstage before going in front of an audience.  Towards the end of the scene, we actually hear the sounds of a crowd cheering, but I understood and deeply appreciated the cinematic metaphor long before the sound made it overtly obvious.      Everyone does fine work in this touching little film...but it is Rourke who makes it work on a very compelling level.  While hardly unique in saying this,  I would place him now as the frontrunner for the Oscar.    This is a film I heartily recommend to ADULT audiences.  There is some bad language, very realistic violence and graphic nudity and sexuality.  Yet for all that, it feels surprisingly old-fashioned.  It isn't exactly a \\"feel-good\\" movie, but it sure is a journey I enjoyed taking!

031606792X|5.0|First of all, I want to say that I can understand some of the negative reviews.  Some parts of this book were shocking, or maybe didn't go the way some people had in their heads.  However, this is not our story. This is Stephanie Meyer's story, and in the end it IS a vampire story.  I have adored the entire Twilight series and I am just am thrilled that Stephanie has let us into her world of Bella and Edward.  It has been a joy to read all of the books.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|I rate movies by either its good, ok or bad. I don't mind if things arent right. THe only times things should be correct is if its a bio or a history movie. But In terms of this movie, Shooter is a very great movie I was surprised on how good blu-ray looked. I noticed MarK's beard hairs on one scene when the camera was focused on his face. Pretty cool. Overall the story of the movie was very good, did not get bored with it at all.
B000050X31|4.0|This is simple:  Tamino: boring, reduced to a side-plot.   Papageno: wonderful, hilarious!  Pamina: wow!  Queen of the Night: very good  Levine: meh...  Sarastro: very good, little slow  Monostatos: good!  The three boys: the best!  The overall sound: amazing!      Overall, this production ends up being about Papageno.  I love Papageno so this works well for me.  If you're the type that likes to delve into lots of masonic nonsense (and face it, the plot is pretty much nonsense) you may be disappointed by this production.      Buy this if you're the type who wants to be totally carried away by Mozart's deep, rich music (including a good rendition of the finest overture ever written!) and you enjoy the silliness and beauty of Papageno/Papagena.    No production is perfect.  Find the one that fits your taste.
B00008PX8P|4.0|This is great music and definitely worth purchasing, still after watching this video I have to share that it soon becomes painfully apparent that the ego of Page, personal animosity, or whatever makes seeing any footage of JP Jones in action almost comically absent. You would think he was a leprous session player even in songs like Achilles Last Stand that feature a central & immortal bass line. I enjoy seeing the whole band in action, but apparently Jimmy is worried that someone might discover there is another person on stage playing a stringed instrument and playing it well.  After a bit it becomes a game where you keep telling yourself, they've got to cut the cameras over to Jonesy for this part, but it don't happen.  Great music, but not a gracious video.  Does no one else notice this?

006135323X|4.0|Dan Ariely was a victim of serious burns as a youth which left his body covered with serious burns.  After surviving the burns and the consequent treatments, he designed some experiments to see how to make treatments less painful, then went back to his hospital and shared the findings with the staff.<br /><br />In this book, Ariely shares a host of experiments that he has carried out in behavioral economics (the branch of economics that looks at how people deviate from the standard economic assumption of people being logical, calculating, and rational).  The experiments are fun, fascinating, and insightful.  He shows us our irrational obsession with free things using experiments with Hershey kisses and truffles; he shows the oft unnoticed power of \\"anchoring\\" prices in an experiment with random numbers and an auction.  He and his colleagues do experiments in bars, malls, and classrooms.  This is a great introduction to behavioral economics.<br /><br />One minor weakness is that - like most popular empirical economics books - Ariely is trapped by the work that he himself has done, with minor supplements by others, and so the book jumps around a bit.  That said, he has done enough interesting stuff that this isn't a major flaw.<br /><br />My main gripe was the lack of introspection as to how much these experiments apply to non-experimental settings.  In the introduction, he tells us, \\"I would like you to think about experiments as an illustration of a general principle, providing insight...not only in the context of a particular experiment but, by extrapolation, in many contexts of life\\" (p. xxi).  Why?  Should we just take Dan's word for it?  Beyond the question of extrapolation from the experimental setting, the vast majority of experiments are on undergraduate or graduate students, with little meditation on whether results might vary for different demographics.<br /><br />That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the read.  Read it, enjoy it, share stories with your friends,and take a few minutes to think through the questions that Ariely didn't.<br /><br />And would someone - please - design a better-looking cover for the second edition?!

B001KL3GWM|4.0|After having read the reviews here and elsewhere, I feel I have to voice a few disagreements... and a few agreements, of course.    Given the two-year hiatus between \\"Songlines\\" and \\"Already Free,\\" I actually had less hope for \\"Already Free.\\" I wasn't particularly a fan of \\"Songlines,\\" though it had its moments for me. The live shows were where it was at for me; I have seen Derek Trucks with the Allman Brothers 3 times and with DTB 2 times, each show being a spectacle. I remember one in particular, last summer in Boulder, CO: My buddy took his brother with us, and after a 12-minute cover of \\"The Weight\\" (paying homage to Duane Allman's work with Aretha Franklin's version of the song), the kid goes, \\"... that's f***ing outrageous.\\"     I was convinced that after \\"Songlines,\\" the studio cuts that this band would put out would be more for the mainstream audience. Hell, I don't disagree that it would be a bad path to take: More people need to hear this man and his band. But to some extent we should wonder if the members of DTB really don't care.     So here's what I think of \\"Already Free\\": It's got to be the most wholesome album they've ever put out. (If not, it's a close second to \\"Joyful Noise.\\")    One thing that really put me off were the reviews that were expecting Derek to just go absolutely nuts, to rip up the scene and bring back the glory that he so eloquently brought to the slide guitar, and then saying he didn't do any of that on the entire album. (Yes, I found a few reviews like that.) That begs the question, did they just forget half of the album? Derek shines and delivers on well over half of the songs on \\"Already Free,\\" and if you think he doesn't, just compare it to what he did on his other albums. Simply great work, and the rest of the band is tight as ever. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.    Another I have to ask the columnists and reviewers that expected a \\"Soul Serenade\\" or some such slew of instrumental prowess: Do you even read the inserts in the CDs you probably get for free? It says right in the insert that \\"Already Free\\" is about togetherness, about family, about good music. This was recorded in Trucks' home studio, with family and friends abound. Why would this album be anything but what it is?    This is another successful step for DTB. It's just a natural progression: the debut instrumental insanity of \\"The Derek Trucks Band\\"; the ridiculously true blues of \\"Out of the Madness\\"; the simply phenomenal \\"Joyful Noise\\"; the jazzy \\"Soul Serenade\\"; the elemental live work on \\"Live At Georgia Theater\\"; the wordly \\"Songlines\\"; and finally, the wholesome \\"Already Free.\\" Whether or not the band was shooting for the \\"mainstream\\" audience is irrelevant. They just want to write music, and that they do.    Particular favorites/highlights: \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\"; \\"I Know\\"    Particular lowlights: Doyle Bramhall II. Never really liked his voice, but the songwriting is still there.    And if you lost faith between \\"Songlines\\" and \\"Already Free,\\" just go to a DTB concert. Your faith will be restored!

1932100660|5.0|I have always been interested in being healthy, eating right, excersizing etc.  And I thought I was doing all the right things (and I still do).   This book really opened my eyes to how I'm really eating and how I'm influenced by all the hype about what is healthy, what is a balanced diet, why vitamins help us to be healthier, etc.      I bought this book for my wife who recently decided to eat vegetarian (much to my chagrin) and so she has been beating my up on how I \\"should\\" be eating.  Since reading this book, I have not really changed my basic view of nutrition but I have cut back alot on eating animal protein, fat and processed carbs.  I never was into supplements and now I'm even more not into supplements.      And you know, I have lost 5 pounds in 3 weeks and I'm almost down to my high school weight.  I don't get as tired hiking and jogging and now the dogs have a semi hard time keeping up with me on hikes and I'm 59.  This book is a must read for people who want to be active, healthy and aware!
B000ZN802W|5.0|Our kids recommended this movie and when we rented it, we decided to keep it long enough to watch it twice in order to catch some things that we felt were thought provoking.  One question we asked ourselves was, do we really need so much to be happy? The other realization was that it is very important to share our lives with others for our own happiness. Wow! All that from one movie. We requested a DVD as a Christmas gift from our kids, and bought two more for our friends.  Not everyone will like the flashback format of this movie, and many will not be able to find the revelations we did.  I would recommend it for the fabulous scenery and beautiful music.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|4.5 stars. I'll discuss the gameplay first and then present my thoughts specific to this edition.    If you aren't already familiar, Settlers of Catan (SoC) has been around since 1996. The idea is to populate the board with settlements in order to collect more and more resources. These resources you use to build even more settlements. Resource collection is determined by the random roll of the die. Some numbers roll more often than others, so some resources will be collected more often than others. Players may also purchase \\"development cards,\\" which provide the card-holder with various advantages. The game is over when a player has 10 victory points, which may be obtained through constructing settlements or obtaining certain development cards.    The gameplay is very clever on numerous levels. First, every player is involved during every turn. Players may collect resources on other players turn if the right numbers are rolled, which demands the attention of every player at all times. Second, the game is very open-ended, which allows for a tremendous amount of variation in strategy and play. The board changes every game so you're never playing the same game twice. Many strategies may be employed to reach 10 points, and its not uncommon to switch strategies mid-game to respond to other players. Third, the game rules are complex enough to keep the \\"hard-core\\" gamer amused while at the same time simple enough to bring the whole family to the table. Enough luck is involved so that an inexperienced player can easily stay within two or three victory points of more experienced players.    Regarding this edition, I think that families will enjoy the interlocking tiles more since the board is easier to set up and tear down. The disadvantage is that you're limited to four players, and even with four players the board becomes congested very fast. Nevertheless, its ideal for families---and I imagine that this is the target consumer for this edition. An even easier version to play with is the edition simply titled \\"Catan,\\" though I can't tell whether its sold on Amazon.    My only complaint is that while SoC does contain a good mix of luck and skill for the casual gaming family, the more competitive gamer may sit in quiet misery if the dice fails to roll in his or her favor a reasonable percentage of the time. Whether choosing board position at the start, being unable to move the robber off that valuable spot, or staring at disbelief at why [insert number] has yet to be rolled, its not uncommon to get annoyed when Lady Luck isn't smiling on you. Worse yet, someone who really didn't invest in particularly brilliant strategy might be raking in victory points like there's nothing to it.    Finally, a warning: devices like the robber, as well as certain strategies (e.g., blocking with roads) can make the game pretty cutthroat. In a competitive crowd, a player without thick skin might leave the table annoyed. Though very enjoyable in its own right, SoC isn't a party game where laughs will smother out the soreness of losing. So be mindful of who you're playing with, and play accordingly.    But don't take the aforementioned criticism/warning too seriously. Play SoC a few times with friends or family and you'll quickly see why Klaus Teuber's game remains popular to this day. Forget Monopoly---buy SoC and see what a real board game should look like.
B001NY43L4|3.0|I had the opportunity last week to catch [[ASIN:B001MVYUQQ Quarantine]], the 2008 American \\"re-do\\" of 2007's [REC]. So I said to myself, \\"why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other.\\" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a \\"re-do\\" instead of a \\"re-make\\", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer&oacute; & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]] with the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!<br /><br />I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say that [[ASIN:B000YPUFAQ Resident Evil]] & 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why \\"zombies\\" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of \\"what started it all.\\"<br /><br />So enter [REC} with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.<br /><br />The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a la [[ASIN:B00001QGUM Blair Witch]], [[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield]] or [[ASIN:B001CDLARQ Diary of the Dead]]. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.<br /><br />Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC} as a \\"re-do\\" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said \\"re-do\\" as opposed to \\"re-make\\". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine is clearly just a re-do.<br /><br />I'd recommend catching one or the other for some good fun scares. There is no reason to see both.as a \\"re-do\\" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said \\"re-do\\" as opposed to \\"re-make\\".

031606792X|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be given Twilight for christmas and as all the books are now out available to read I had the fortunate experience of being able to read them in succession with no time inbetween to mull over the story I had just read and make assumptions about where it could be leading, although my desires for the characters were met totally and utterly by her stories.     Breaking Dawn is absolutley perfect. Stephenie ties up all the lose ends incredibly. The story is so beautiful and has the best ending to a series of books that I have ever read. The most consuming, invigorating, engrosing and intense love story you will ever read. She completely drags you into the story, her books are impossible to put down.    If you have not read Breaking Dawn (or any of the Twilight series for that matter) you so severly do not know what you are missing.

B0017VG69U|5.0|These remastered and updated Star Trek Originbal Series DVD's are magnificent, exceptionally well made, and creatively enhanced. However, for a true affection ado, this newer remastered set slightly strays away from the original background setings, colors, tones, and actual ship models, therefore, if one grew up with the originals, these newer remastered sets are slightly different, but never the less, still exceptionally well done. This set also tends to stray away from the 1960's magic represented by television at that time, the colors, as mentioned, and the simplicity, if not even the way they were filmed, the current remastered set represents the series in a way that pulls it forward into our current technology, visually speaking, and enhances it to the level where you may not be able to tell that this was filmed in the sixties.

0307387178|5.0|This story was an inspiration. Those that view Chris as selfish have little ability to be introspective into their own past.

We should never stop looking for new adventures.

I listened to their other albums but nothing tops this one in pure distinctiveness. I particularly like the guitars that's just amazing, the vocals unique. My favorites: Nirvana, Big Neon, Rain, Hollow Man, She Sells Sanctuary. I'd say it again - Wow!
0446693804|4.0|i can honestly say that this is the FIRST BOOK that i do not prefer over the movie... most of the time book are way better than the movie made of them, but i am sad to say that this one is not better.!
0783240236|5.0|The Birds starring Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor is my second favorite Hitchcock film, Pyscho being #1 for me. This film is scary, romantic, and intoxicating. Jessica Tandy also stars, she was such a magnetic actress back then. The birds they used in this film are so creepy and lifelike. You have to see this classic suspense before you die. I highly recommend it!
B000WGX8HY|5.0|You really should own this product.  Whether you have a turn table or not, it's a piece of MCR memorabilia that's completely worth having.  The art on the album is reason enough.  Otherwise, The Black Parade is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard, so I can do nothing but praise this product.
031606792X|5.0|I would rate this a 10 plus. I loved this series and this was my favorite book of the series! And I don't even like to read much!
0307388840|5.0|An example of the book being sooooo much better than the movie.  I loved the film \\"Atonement\\", but boy am I glad I read the book first!<br /><br />One of my alltime favorite fiction books.  Absolutely mindblowing, and for those not familiar with the plot, I will not spoil it.  Just read the book!
031606792X|1.0|My 12 year old daughter begged me to see the movie, which I did. I enjoyed the movie but being an avid reader I checked to see if it was based on a book. Welcome to the Twilight world! I picked up New Moon from the Library. After reading this, my daughter and I were hooked and purchased the other three books later that day! We were in love with Bella and Edward (Jacob not so much). Loved the first three and read each in less than 4 hours.     Breaking Dawn....hated it!! Why!!! It did not read like a young adult novel at all. It strayed from the storyline, introduced far too many new characters (waste of reading time). Bella got EVERYTHING (Edward, Jacob, A Baby, Charlie, Grace, Power). Stephenie tried to go all Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings and Failed!    The childbirth -scary & off putting. The Volturi battle that never happened - just dumb. The annoyingly beautiful, precocious and gifted child! It should be titled Blowing Chunks or Selling Out or even better Just Joking with a picture of a Red and Black Joker on the cover.  It's ok to be creative as a writer and expand your writing chops, but be true to the characters! A reader can respect and live with it if a writer is true to the story and characters. I struggled to finish reading Breaking Dawn - 2 long days! It was a truly terrible ending.    Question: Did anyone else wonder why Jacob had a whole 3rd of the book from his perspective, but Edward never did?     Please complete Edward's story Stephenie! Most of us have not had enough of Edward! It's time for a pre-quel! Redeem yourself.
0140557741|5.0|One of the best books on frames of reference and the power of perspective and context ever.  Works with a 4-year old or a business executive...
020161622X|4.0|This book is similar to \\"Coder to Developer\\": Gives advice on a lot of topics to improve your skills as a developer (to stop being a simple developer and get into the path for an analyst or software architect). One difference though is that this book doesn't even talks about .NET, using C++ or Java examples instead (if you work with C# that shouldn't be any problem!).<br /><br />Overall, the book has an inspiring, motivating speech. The authors have fought a lot of battles when developing software and most of the tips are really useful and will make you avoid common (and not so common) mistakes.<br /><br />In each chapter, small tips and advices are given to the reader, even with small tales and metaphors to make you understand easily some concepts or problems.<br /><br />In some advices they are a bit too extreme, like \\"learn one new programming language each year\\" (a bit hardcore), or ttrying to have 100% of your code uncoupled (performance, or customer requirements to give two examples may force you to tightly couple some components). But this are the minor ones.<br /><br />It gives a lot of intersting principles, like the DRY (don't repeat yourself), WYSIAYG (what you see is all you get), \\"design to test\\" or the very interesting \\"testing saboteur\\" (place someone in the project to brach the source and place bugs to see if the test batteries catch them or not).<br /><br />I like the \\"tracer code\\" concept. Instead of prototyping (throwing away code and redoing it), making a framework and adding code in tiny bits, with constant feedback to change what is wrongly implemented. Looks like saving future effort, and we sometimes do it unconsciously. It just requires having a clear view of the overall system.<br /><br />The book has chapters about prototyping, estimations, \\"basic tools\\", code coupling, code structure, the Law of Demeter, multithreading, design patterns (including the now so famous Model-View-Controller), testing, using use cases in requirements definitions (I actually did this recently at work!), web-based documentation ...<br /><br />Touches multiple ways of doing \\"defensive programming\\": Design by contract, knowing when the impossible has happened, assertive programming,...<br /><br />Another nice point is that along the whole book the message for the reader is \\"you're not just a developer, think!\\"<br /><br />Some topics lack a bit more of depth, but the starting point given is more than enough for becoming a \\"pragmatic programmer\\".ased documentation ...

0439023483|5.0|I bought The Hunger Games mainly based on the overwhelming positive reviews here on Amazon. My track record for books living up to the hype isn't all that fantastic as few books really live up to the raves they get online.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a notable exception where the book is as good, if not better than the hype that surrounds it.  The Hunger Games is a smart, engaging and well written book.  Although it lives solidly in the Young Adult Fiction genre it plays on enough levels that adults will be just as engaged and entertained reading it as young adults.<br /><br />While the general premise of The Hunger Games seems like Battle Royale gone Young Adult, what's actually inside is much more profound and much more extensive.  The Hunger Games is really a story of a girl becoming a woman after being forced to deal with the responsibilities of an adult world. The games provide the template to tell this story.<br /><br />While the action in the book is practically non-stop the strength of the book lies in the more subtle moments between characters.<br /><br />While Hermine represented a strong female character in the Harry Potter series, she doesn't hold a candle to Katniss Everdeen who is by far one of the strongest girls in literature.  Katniss not only eclipses Hermine, she makes Twilight's Bella Swan look positively demure.<br /><br />There are too many great twists and turns in The Hunger Games that can be spoiled. So I'd encourage you to avoid reading too much and just take the plunge and buy this book.<br /><br />I'd be shocked if The Huger Games isn't adapted into a movie and will be extremely surprised if this series doesn't get the broad kudos and adulation it deserves.  If you've been looking for the next best thing in Young Adult Fiction, look no further. You've found it in The Hunger Games.
0375424474|4.0|YOUR INNER FISH reminds me of Richard Dawkins' THE ANCESTOR'S TALE, the reading of which gave me truly new insight into the workings of physical evolution.  Even though I devoured Dawkins' work some time ago, I can say the same for Shubin's book.  Shubin, however, does not delve as deeply into his subject as Dawkins nor present as many details, hence the subject I've used for this review.  Also, while Dawkins' book may challenge the conceptual skills of a college graduate, Shubin's is, I feel, as appropriate for young adults of, say, high school level reading ability, as it is for older adults.<br /><br />Both authors are far, far  more readable and capable of sustaining a reader's interest than the father of evolutionary theory, Charles Darwin, was.  I would greatly prefer to reread both YOUR INNER FISH and THE ANCESTOR'S TALE than to plow through the dry facts in Darwin's ORIGIN OF SPECIES again.<br /><br />While I believe it is fairly accurate to observe that Dawkins explains the process and the proof of physical evolution partly in terms of molecular structure and function, Shubin does so primarily by demonstrating that more or less every part of the human anatomy has its counterpart in creatures of far simpler structure with origins that predated the earliest modern humans by millions of years.  It is fascinating to see how primitive physical structures changed in location, form and function over the 500 million or so years that animals with body structures have existed on the earth.  Not all of these are particularly intuitive, either; for example, I'd have never guessed that the tiny bones in my middle ear originated as gill arches in fish!<br /><br />Paleontology finds a prominent place in Shubin's book.  The importance of the fossil record to our understanding of evolution is well illustrated by the discovery of Tiktaalik, a fossil fish with the rudiments of modern wrist bones in its fins.  Shubin does not stop with his successful comparisons of modern humans and ancient fish, however.  If we proceed farther into the realm of rudimentary life forms, we see the equivalence of the notochord in worms with our own spinal column.  Without belaboring  the fact or using biological names for organisms, Shubin also demonstrates the principle behind taxonomy and the grouping of life forms into kingdoms, families, genus, species and other such categories.<br /><br />Among my favorite \\"pet peeves\\" is the almost universal human practice of speciesism, the faith-based belief that humans are superior to and hold natural dominance over other animals.  (Early Christians even wrote this belief into their bible.)  If there is one thing that should cause such believers in human supremacy to reconsider their assumption, it is the fact that every structure in their bodies has evolved from equivalent structures in the bodies of other animals and that even the structure of their individual cells can be seen in the simplest unicellular microbes.  Without the mitochondria in their bodies' cells to convert sugar and oxygen into energy, they'd cease to live, yet those mitochondria once were free-living microbes!  If our bodies hurt or sicken, the malady is in many cases traceable to the fact that our bodily structures began in aquatic environments and have yet to adapt perfectly to bipedalism.  Shubin's book is not only instructive but, more importantly, is also humbling.  It adroitly shows humans' place in the much larger animal kingdom and helps us see that we are only a point on a continuum of constantly evolving life forms.<br /><br />I heartily recommend YOUR INNER FISH to every reader from teen years through adulthood who wishes to understand humanity's place as a life form among many such life forms on the earth and how we came to be where we are.  I do wish the book were longer, for the final sections dealing with evolution-related illnesses are all too brief, but if Shubin's book awakens one's curiosity. Dawkins' THE ANCESTOR'S TALE would be an excellent follow-on.
B0017MO10U|2.0|Couldn't get into this. Ark of Truth was so much better, it served a purpose in the SG-1 time-line. Continuum, was just another episode of the show, rather contrived I might add. Seeing Claudia Black as Quetesh was one of the highlights. This movie really should have served to add more back story to the characters, revisit a storyline like (\\"2001\\" or \\"2010\\") or advance the SG universe like finally having full disclosure. Basically I'm glad I waited to buy until it was half price.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Whether you call it jazzy blues or bluesy jazz this all too brief cd presents quietly spare arrangements of lyrical melodies accompanying the intimate vocals of Melody Gardot. This is definitely music for the quiet hours.    When I played 'Worrisome Heart' for the first time, I began adding the best songs to my itunes' \\"Jazz & Blues Favorites\\" playlist, as I do with every new CD I purchase. By the time it ended, I found that I had added every song to that playlist, and realized that this was a case of love at first listen.

B00104QSOM|5.0|A message to all the negative reviews: you will always regret your backlash years down the road.     This film is so emotionally powerful and special that it's simply impossible to completely assess it upon first viewing. What PT Anderson has created is one of the most gripping and beautiful dramas in the history of American cinema.     This film will enthrall, excite, and challenge you. Daniel Plainview is one of the most perplexing characters in recent memory, and this roller-coaster ride through his life is not to be missed.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Fabulous. A story of our generation at war. Sometimes brutal, sad, funny, scared and heroic the characters are real and I found them easy to relate to. They could be neighbors, friends, family, and the story made me want more.

B000003TA4|5.0|It's obvious I don't have to say that Nirvana literally changed rock music in the 90's, because EVERYONE knows that did. GO ahead and dislike them if you like, but these three men created a fresh, bold new sound back in 1991. Nevermind and In Utero are the albums that put alternative rock into the mainsteam (thus we now have Grunge, Alternative Metal, Post-Grunge, etc.). Sure, I like Korn and Staind and such, but I always know that Nirvana is the one that gave them a bit of influence, at least.<br /><br />Here in Nevermind, it's all so engaging. Everyone knows \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" and that it's an excellent (but maybe overrated) song, so I'm not going into detail here. \\"Lithium\\" and \\"In Bloom\\" are two of my favorites: both have that energetic and lyrical feel that's found in many later singles in the 90's. \\"Come as You Are\\" is as haunting as \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" in In Utero. \\"Polly\\" is an acoustic song that dwelves away from the hard-rocking energy that's constant throughout the album. \\"Territorial Pissings\\" is so intense that I worry that my neighbors would complain when I play it in a loud volume. Finally, \\"Something in the Way\\" is a stunning conclusion to the album: soft, eerie, melodic, and beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />Personally, my favorite song from Nirvana is \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" from \\"In Utero\\", but the songs here will always be memorable not only to me, but to a vast majority of the human race.<br /><br />Grade: A

0545128285|5.0|Slight book, at a lower price.     Would help in the understanding of Death in the last Harry Potter novel, Book 7. The cloak of invisibility, the wand, and the resurrection stone are all included in The Tale of the Three Brothers.     Quick read, great knowledge.

1400079179|4.0|Before I start, I want to preface this review with the following statement: I did truly enjoy this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.<br /><br />Having said that, I would like to base most of my review on debunking some of the hype that surrounds this novel.<br /><br />As I stated above, I did enjoy this book. My problem is all of the hype that surrounds it. It has been called \\"pure genious\\" and the author referred to as brilliant among many other rave reviews. I feel that some of these comments are a bit overdone. Has Mr. Brown written a thouroughly researched and well written thriller? Yes, indeed he has. Is it \\"one of the finest mysteries that I've ever read\\"? No, I don't feel that it is.<br /><br />I think that the majority of praise and mystique that surrounds this novel is the delicate and controversial subject matter that is its core. Take away the core theme that Brown presents about the Catholic faith, and you still have a solid thriller with some good plot twists, but not one that's any more well written than a James Patterson or a Michael Crichton. I believe that Brown belongs with these two in the upper-echelon of thriller authors, but I do not feel that his work has transcended above them.<br /><br />Anyway, that's my two-cents worth.

0375826726|4.0|Very good book. My 8 year old daughter and I can't wait for the last book to come out!  However, when you read it make sure you have a dictionary handy, there were a lot of words I hadn't heard before or that I just had a hard time trying to explain the meaning of to my daughter. I tried to read it to my 6 year old son as well, but he got bored pretty quick.

B000024E9J|5.0|This is one of the seminal prog-rock releases of all time. In fact, it is one of the greatest albums ever released. From the opening Mellotron intro of \\"Watcher of The Skies\\" to the intensely dramatic closing of \\"Supper's Ready\\" you will be spellbound. Those who think of Genesis as the pop band they became in the 80's will no doubt start a path of discovery that will lead you to their other Gabriel-era classics which include \\"Trespass\\", \\"Nursery Cryme\\", \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" and \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\". Then go for the early Collins-vocal era with more meaty releases such as \\"A Trick of the Tail\\", \\"Wind and Wuthering\\", \\"Seconds Out\\", \\"And Then There Were Three\\" and \\"Duke\\". After \\"Duke\\" Genesis started to really cash in and as a result \\"dumbed\\" the music down to appeal to the masses. Foxtrot is the epitome of what Genesis was all about in their hey-day!<br /><br />Buy this album and give it the attention it deserves. You will be rewarded for your efforts.

B00006FM77|5.0|Most people these days think of Chicago as a mellow pop band with no real soul. The fact is that in their early days Chicago was a revolutionary band both musically and politically. This huge set of music chronicles their week-long stint at Carnegie Hall in 1971. This is the way a live album should be. It's raw and full of energy. The late Terry Kath shines, as does Peter Cetera, Bobby Lamm, Jimmy Pankow, Walt Parazaider, Lee Loughnane and Danny Seraphine. The banter with the audience, the on-stage introductions, etc. make this a true chronicle of the band's stint at CH. If you think Chicago is all mushy lovey-dovey Pablum, this will change your mind. If you like old Chicago (\\"Beginnings\\", \\"Make Me Smile (Ballet For A Girl In Buchanan)\\", \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", etc.) you must get this.<br /><br />Jimi Hendrix is loosely quoted as saying (about Terry Kath), \\"I'm good, but your guitar player blows me away\\". The evidence is in this set.
0385340990|5.0|The charm of the book will draw you in - the characters and important story will keep you.  This is the best book I've read in a long time and I truly hated to finish it.  I never re-read a book, but I will this one.
B00006FR47|5.0|Chicago's fifth album is in my opinion their best. It is everything that the term \\"Jazz-Rock\\" applies to. The musicianship and production are first-rate (especially since they recorded this album relatively quickly). The hit is obviously \\"Saturday In The Park\\", which is a great song. But, the highlight is when Cetera and Kath trade vocals in the obscure \\"Now That You're Gone\\". Kath's soulful voice in the verses is enhanced/countered by Cetera's pure melodic choruses. The rhythm track is Chicago in its prime. Seraphine is on fire and the horn break is one of their best. \\"Dialogue\\" is another song which contrasts Cetera and Kath's vocal abilities. There is no fluff on this release. It's a record of one of the most musically adept groups in their absolute prime.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill fictional characters are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show \\"Monk\\" has become.    Crowe's character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as \\"Monk,\\" but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)    Add some classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins, and the film is even better. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's \\"Cinderella Man.\\"    For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.
0143038419|5.0|This is quite honestly a true gem among many many publications that attempt to reach the heart of hurt people everywhere, trying to find their way. Gilbert is not only a fun read (her use of language, total humility and honesty, and allusions to pop culture as well as intellectual geniuses make the book fun to pick up, touching, hard to put down, and an instant classic), but she truly hits home and occasionally makes you think (as she says to Richard in the Ashram) \\"Stop walking around in my head\\". If you haven't read it yet, do yourself the favor and pick it up; it has the potential to be life-changing and even if it doesn't strike a chord with you and help you heal, it's a great story that's well written to say the least.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.  It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.    Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character \\"Beetlejuice\\"- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..    It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a \\"haunted house\\" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.    Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.    Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.    Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!
1439102813|5.0|There is more we don't know about Alzheimer's than what we do know. One thing that is no mystery about the disease is that we fear it worse than cancer or heart disease, since most of us think of it as a fate worse than death. It does little harm to our physical body, but quickly and completely destroys the connections to who we are, and nothing is more frightening. As the baby boomers enter their fifties and sixties, it is a subject that we seem faced with more and more. How many of us have asked ourself: Did I forget where I put my keys because I'm stressed out, or was thinking about something else, or is this going to happen a lot - and what worse things will follow?<br /><br />Author Genova gives us Alice Howland, a brilliant Ivy League college professor who, on the eve of her fiftieth birthday, is starting to forget little things here and there. Eventually the small things become forgotten seminars and classes, and eventually Alice has an incident where she forgets how to get home from a place she is familiar with. Forced to seek medical advice, she is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.<br /><br />Still Alice is a beautiful and heartbreaking story (I see those two words used to describe this book over and over, and there are no better ones) of a courageous woman first denying, then accepting the diagnosis of a living death. And then going about the work of fighting for whatever she can maintain of herself, of Alice, when the disease has taken everything from her, including her relationship with her children, her husband, and perhaps just as important to Alice, the respect of her colleagues and students.<br /><br />Genova has crafted some amazingly poignant moments - though never maudlin ones - that involve the reader's emotions without manipulating. One such moment has already been mentioned but bears mentioning again. Alice creates an escape route for her future self and what happens when that time comes is the wrenching climax of the entire book. I don't know when I've ever been so moved by a fictional character as I was for Alice.een so moved by a fictional character as I was for Alice.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I remember how this Batman film disappointed a lot of people when it first came out....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn't have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and found it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman.    The first hour of this \\"prequel\\" dealt with his origins. If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more. The third look, a vew weeks ago, was on this Blu-Ray disc which is just almost too good for words.    Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. With the success of \\"The Dark Knight,\\" let's hope Bale continues with this role, so we have some continuity in this film series.    It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of \\"Alfred.\\" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner.    After having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that's my opinion. Don't let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie. You might be missing the best of the Batmans!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm not the best reviewer, but I'll give it a go.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I only recently started watching Firefly, and I love the universe and the characters.  I admit, I was putting off watching the movie because of certain character deaths I'd heard about, and was not looking forward to seeing them die.  The movie was brilliant though.  Anyone who loves Firefly, will love this movie.
B000UTQNKM|4.0|The colorization is great and the overall quality is exceptional.  The film was delivered quickly and in perfect condition.
B001J4E1D8|2.0|Comparing this new adaptation with the two other versions in mind, the 2008 Tess of the D'Urbervilles adaptation is a failure. I felt the script was rather clumsily done on the whole. Although the film did not stray far from the book in plot, it did not portray the despair and bleak feel that was felt in the book by Thomas Hardy.  The actors were alright, although not on the whole perfectly cast. Gemma Arterton is an excellent Tess, better than Justine Waddell and a tie to the role with Nastassja Kinski in Polanski's adaptation produced in 1979.  Eddie Redmayne was a complete disaster in the role of Angel Clare, being too boyish and almost, one could say uninterested in the events taking place. He does not appear to be in love with Tess at all, but rather he appears to be an onlooker.  Hans Matheson needed more evil in his looks and a crueler appearance for Alec D'Urbervilles.  Anna Massey was an excellent Mrs. D'Urbervilles, although she did play just a minor role.  Compared to the other versions this adaptation was not as clean as one would wish, therefore it is a TV-14 rating.   My feelings on this film are rather of disappointment and that more could have been done as a whole, I frankly expected something better. If you want to view a better adaptation of this story see the Polanski's 1979 production.
0767802470|1.0|Disappointed in purchase. The first side of the DVD has translations in several languages. We chose English. The second part of the disc does not have the same options. The remainder of the movie was in German no option for English, nor sub-titles available. For featured as being a special edition directors cut the purchase was a total rip off.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I find that alot of folks my age don't actually know about The Muppet's Christmas Carol but my Brother and I loved it when we were younger and I have since introduced it to my 3 yr. old twins and their 4 yr. old sister who now love it.  This is one of my faves and it will surely be yours too ...
B0013D8LOK|4.0|And there was enough of a plot to keep me interested to the end. The unfolding of events was a bit slow/ uneven, but it all worked out in the end.<br /><br />The movie clocked in at just under two hours. But it would not have been diminished if it was cut down to 1.5 hours. And overall, the movie would have worked a lot better as a drama than a musical.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's voices and Cockney accents were very believable. And Alan Rickman was the star, as always. The casting was *excellent* (most noteworthy was the slimy assistant of the Judge Turpin.<br /><br />What else can be said about a musical that features a vengeful barber that murders people so that his landlady can cook them into pies? Not much. Just watch it and see.
B001L5U15M|4.0|I just received this bag today from Amazon. I will update with more information later when I have had a chance to use this bag.     I had a very difficult time finding a bag that would fit my gear. I wanted a bag that would fit my Nikon D300 with the grip and a 70-200/2.8 attached facing down into the bag. Plus I wanted the bag to hold my 50/1.8, SB-800, 1.4 teleconverter, and a few misc items. Not only can I fit the D300, grip, 70-200 facing down into the bag, but I will probably be able to fit this combo with my teleconverter attached.    This bag is well made and padded. The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is because, like most sling bags, it is not always very comfortable for a woman to carry a bag like this across the chest. I plan to carry this bag more as a shoulder bag so it fits my needs that way. If needed, I can carry it across my chest with the belt in place to take some of the weight.
B000000IRJ|5.0|I was not familiar with this album. I like very much other recordings by Rod Stewart: \\"Atlantic Crossing\\", \\"A night in the town\\" and \\"Tonight I'm yours\\". Nevertheless, I don't like so much later recordings. I bought \\"every picture tells a story\\" because it was recomended in the guide \\"1001 albums you must hear before you die\\", and I am not dissapointed. This album has the strength of the recordings made by good musics when they are starting and they want to show they have something new to tell. It is his third album, and I have enjoyed of every song. \\"Maggie May\\" was the single, but the others songs are also very nice. The Mobile Fidelity edition sounds also very well. Recomended.

B00005JLEU|5.0|This is, as indicated by my title, an amazing film. A friend lent it to me and I hesitated to watch it for about 2 months, until I finally decided \\"why not?\\" I am truly very happy that I decided to watch this film. It is nothing short of a masterpiece. The film is about a young girl who gets lost in a world of spirits after her greedy parents get turned into pigs. During the film she learns many things about herself. Writing from an artists' point of view, the music and art in this movie are absolutely stunning. The animation is very realistic and captivating, allowing the viewer to enter an imaginary world which seems to be filled with surprises for both the protagonist and the viewer. The music adds to the beauty of this animated world. Even more wonderful than this is the story. At first it may seem trivial, but as the film progresses you will notice that it is in fact very deep. The protagonist encounters many tempting things through her journey but refuses them and there are several references to greed in the film. Younger children may not pick up on this, but older ones will most certainly understand the moral of the story. However, this deep side to the film does not by any means overpower the more magical, fun side of it. You will be captivated by the adventure and won't want to stop watching! This is a definite must-see, for all ages!
1582701709|2.0|The concept of the Law of Attraction can be a useful metaphor for attracting the life we want. Unfortunately, this book, with all its 'important' people touting it, buries the basic concept in a bunch of quoted hype. Did all of these people really become successful because they diligently practiced the LOA? Hardly. Most were successful before they ever heard of the concept.<br /><br />This is a collection of motivational quotes, which is hardly surprising since it was put together by the \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" gang. That, in and of itself, does not make it either bad or good. But, the hype around it degrades the potential good that can be derived from focusing on what people really want in life. I believe that we attract what we want by deciding what we want, and then focusing our actions, intentions and attention on getting it.<br /><br />This book is mostly philisophical. There is very little offered as to what a person can actually DO to attract a better life. For that, read the original Law of Attraction book by Jerry and Esther Hicks. It contains more usable information.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Jason Statham.  Wow.  Even a bad movie he makes a small 30 second cameo in is better for his overwhelming badassness...and this movie isnt too bad.  He's what Vin Diesel should've been. I don't think you can really quantify the qualities he adds to a movie, just a sneering, Charles-Bronson-Clint-Eastwood granite-like presence that adds a lot of credibility to an action flick.<br /><br />And this flick could probably use some credibility.  Dont try to approach Death Race too cereberally, it is named Death Race after all.  You can drive the behemoth truck \\"Dreadnaught\\" through the plot holes and circumventing of reality this movie frequently puts out there.<br /><br />But damn its fun.  Ian McShane says it best, \\"That's entertainment\\".  It is, and a 90 minute movie with no lull in the action is something that is sadly missing from Hollywood these days.  As popcorn flicks go, this is one of my favorite in a long, long time.

0670020745|4.0|The author was a guest on WPR and I listened with great interest.  My friend had a very damaging stroke.  His rehab has hit a plateau and he needed a lift.  The book was perfect and inspired him to take the bull by the horns. He is now working harder on his own and not waiting for a miracle. I will be more confident in six months to a year and perhaps will revise my review.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|Spoliers ahead- The Mist is much better than The Happening.  It has great monsters, great acting, good effects but the ending, well, I like seven syle endings etc but this was silly and ruins the great build up. The bleak ending was uncessary. A better King adaptation, no TV movie here but still falls a little short.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Once again, another wonderful CD from Taylor Swift.  I originally got this CD for my daughter who is 8, but since the first time we played it, it has been a permanent addition in my CD player.  Love every song but 2, and my daughter loves them all.  Great CD!
0793518326|4.0|I've been playing Beatle songs in bands for 43 years.  Most of us older guys learned the guitar parts by listening to the records which wasn't easy considering most of the recordings were mixed in mono and made deciphering the separate guitar parts really difficult.  And, very few of us ever really learned the solos correctly, note-for-note.  A few years ago, I played in a band with a brilliant 16 year old girl guitarist who could sight-read and play her butt off.  She'd never really studied the Beatles or played their songs, but she came to rehearsal with this book and played the Beatles' stuff more accurately than I'd ever heard anyone else play it.  I can't read music and most of my bandmates can't either.  The \\"charts\\" in this book must be pretty accurate given how good the songs sounded when this girl read and played them.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I love the music on this cd. If you like Taylor Swift's other music, you'll definitely like this because in my opinion, it's better. Sweet and catchy, Taylor Swift has done another good job with creating music.

B001DU8T6S|4.0|I don't know what it is with Queen and the USA, but it seems they've always been underrated here.  I've been a fan since Killer Queen first came out and have loved their work ever since!    I never followed any kind of news, so it was a shock to me when I heard over the radio in my car that Freddie Mercury was dead.  I knew then that my wish to see the band again would never come true.      However, out of the blue, I found Brian May's website and discovered that he and Roger Tayler were touring with Paul Rodgers back in 2006 and jumped at the chance to get tickets.  The performance was awesome and I was so happy to see the guys having fun on stage.  The promise of an album kept me itching to hear something new, so when the album finally came out, I bought it from amazon uk.  I just couldn't wait another minute to hear what they came up with!    I'm glad to say that the whole album is a true hybrid of Paul Rodgers and Queen sound.  This is something I never expected, but truly love and am so thankful for.  Out of 13 songs, I think 10 are really tops.  Sure the guys are old like me, and not as pretty as they used to be, but heck, they still have creativity and lots of spunk.  I'm thankful that they came out of retirement to color my world with new material that I can enjoy.   Thanks dudes!   You rock!

0307454894|4.0|Michael Berg, 15, falls sick one day on his way home from school.  He is helped home by the beautiful Hanna Schmitz, more than twice his age.  The two become entangled in a love affair, one that ends abruptly when Hanna moves away.  Michael doesn't run into her until years later--when she is on trial for crimes committed during World War II.  Hanna puts up almost no defense: she openly admits to what she did.  But why?  Why does she not try and save herself?  Michael is forced to realize that he never really knew the woman he loved...and that, sometimes, loving someone can be an almost criminal act.<br /><br />As a work of fiction, Bernard Schlink's \\"The Reader\\" is hit and miss.  It is truly an entertaining, thoughtful narrative, and Schlink's writing (at least as it's translated) is crisp and engaging.  However, he often reverts to rhetorical questions the narrator asks of himself (and the reader); Michael also admits, almost every other page, to not remembering certain things.  It serves a nice literary purpose, at first; after a while, it simply becomes annoying, and we must wonder why he is bothering to tell the tale at all, if there is so much he doesn't remember.<br /><br />Taken as a more philosophical piece, \\"The Reader\\" shines.  It is an in-depth, engaging view of guilt in post-war Germany, of how a generation tried to deny the horrors committed by their parents; and how pride goeth before the fall (as someone once said).  \\"The Reader\\" would make fine reading in classes discussing the German conscience after the Nazi regime; it is also a fine work of historical fiction, aiming to analyze and demystify a complicated period of history.  \\"The Reader\\" is a thoughtful little novel; flawed, yes, but well worth reading nonetheless.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|...YES...    This movie is the absolute best film i've seen this year (i've seen a lot), and best since Pan's Labyrinth.  It is acted remarkably...and has a heart-warming story that will have you feeling good for some time after viewing it.
B00004CZIZ|4.0|An excellent yet disturbing movie.  If your looking for action and speed, this will not appeal to you.  Pink Floyd videos and music are very much a part of the movie.  There is no dialogue script.  The movie is quite abstract.  I would only recommend this movie to those that are dedicated Pink Floyd fans.
1594201927|4.0|By any account the subject matter of this book seems huge - the subtitle is \\"a financial history of the world\\". The author has organized it not strictly according to linear time, but has broken it down according to its major developments - banking, the bond market, the stock market, insurance, real estate, and globalized trade - and has traced the evolution of each from its origins to the present day. Looking back into the past, major events crystalize and one has the benefit of hindsight. But in moving toward the present day, events become much more dense and harder to evaluate. I think the author could have more effectively driven home the significance of finance in history if he had limited his scope somewhat. As it is, he introduces personal experience and viewpoints on top of different threads of history, and his story kind of frays at the edges when it comes to current events. Rather than a passing and cursory treatment of the Great Depression, a stronger focus on this very telling period would have been every bit as instructive as the anecdotes and observances the author throws out about current problems.    The history depicted in this book in a way picks up where Jared Diamond leaves off in GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL. The emergence of civilizations depended in large part on the advantage of environmental factors, but once native resources were exploited, as the Spanish did in obtaining the riches of the New World, consolidation of political power depended not so much on the mere access of resources but on the ability of pooling all the brain power and human effort necessary to produce or procure goods on a large scale. Crude methods of exchange now had their limitations. From a scattered set of enterprises the Dutch succeeded in consolidating a hazardous foreign trade with the Far East into the Dutch East India Company and eclipsing the Spanish as a political power. The key was in the financing. The Dutch figured out how to establish a large scale operation bygetting individuals to invest on the hope of sharing in the profit. Their success resulted in a market in which financial instruments were bought and sold.

B0015DYIH2|1.0|I would advise any young girl who doesn't want to waste precious grey matter to NOT buy this piece of garbage, or any of its preceding pieces of self-serving garbage.    Here's why:    1) Reading \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" I came to believe that Stephenie Meyer realized that she'd hit upon something that young girls will throw scads of money at just to get a taste, so she kept on writing and decided she could do whatever she wanted with the plot, because people had fallen in love with her characters. And I think that's so unfair, to capitalize on her fans like that after they were given a huge build-up to what they believed would be the best of the series.    2) Meyer either couldn't - or wouldn't - deal responsibly with the culmination of the sexual tension she created and instead, chose to cut out every time it was about to happen. I'm sure many fans are wondering how on earth Edward can impregnate Bella without turning her into a vampire, and just how exactly the whole \\"vampire sex\\" thing works anyway. Meyer posted some ridiculous blurb on her website about how vamps have some sort of venom that lubricates between their cells so they can move, but she also caps it off by saying it's \\"venom-based\\" and can't actually change anyone. OK, so that makes sense (I suppose), but I'm still a little interested in how the whole vampire sexual function thing works, without her admitting she gets the giggles over the words \\"seminal fluids\\". I mean, if you're going to write a book that deals with sex, be mature enough about it to give full answers about why you made your vamps the way you did.     3) She also has no clue about anatomy and physiology, never mind pregnancy and the birth process. Fun fact: A detached placenta would NOT \\"suffocate\\" a baby, it would cause it - and potentially the mom - to bleed to death within five minutes, as the uterus at term pumps out a litre of blood per minute to perfuse the placenta. I wonder how many of her readership will request c-sections with general anesthesia when (God forbid) they decide to procreate?

For me or any Rush fan it will be a great momento for years to come as a reminder of how great these shows were.

B001GZ6QBU|2.0|This movie moves faster and is far more entertaining than its predecessor, Batman Begins. But that doesn't say much. Batman Begins was thunderously dull, pretentious and oppressive: its central conceit, that the character of Batman can be made plausible if one spends hours and hours exploring every iota of emotional trauma and angst, and hours and hours more explaining where Batman gets his batsuit, batmobile and other gear, was ludicrous from the start.<br /><br />Conversely, the Dark Knight is not bogged down by any attempt to relate the characters and events to any known reality. Moon-size plot holes, too numerous to count, and cardboard characters populate this film.<br /><br />Batman is portrayed as a boy billionaire, scion of the super-rich, affecting a bored and callous exterior that allegedly conceals profound depths of emotion. He is dependent upon the aid and counsel of 2 old men, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, who run his home and personal life, his finances, and provide him with all the wondrous bat-gizmos.<br /><br />Batman is relentless, and while he allegedly is troubled by the fact that his pursuit of criminals is resulting in collateral damage amounting to the destruction of half the city, he does not let it stop him. He eventually becomes reviled by the citizens he is sworn to protect, but ultimately he keeps his 'resolve.' The Joker is referred to, multiple times, as a 'terrorist.' The Joker himself says he is a 'wild dog,' not motivated by greed or power, merely the joy of destruction. He cannot be rehabilitated, nor can he be appeased by the liberation of a people, nor can he be bought off.<br /><br />Ultimately Batman's pursuit of the Joker results in Batman literally tapping into every cell phone in Gotham City, and in the destruction of much of the supporting cast and a hospital full of patients. Oh, and Batman tortures now. But of course Batman is ultimately successful, and this completes this sadistic bedtime story.<br /><br />Writing this now, having had a shallow boy millionaire and 2 old men 'protecting' me for 8 years, having had them tap my phone and email, and having had them blowing up 2 nations and killing a couple million people in the process, I was not pleased by the results. So pardon me, Chris Nolan, if I happen to think you are unimaginative and cowardly for using your bully pulpit to write this $200 million love letter. A lot of creative people use their position to challenge the status quo, or to promote peace and tolerance, but apparently violence and sadism are more your cup of tea. Me, I've just finished 8 years in Gotham City and it was 8 years too many.aire and 2 old men 'protecting' me for 8 years, having had them tap my phone and email, and having had them blowing up 2 nations and killing a couple million people in the process, I was not pleased by the results.

Other characters are great too.<br />*Writing is sufficient (although limited).<br />*There are many strong themes throughout (see below for the more questionable ones).

It portrays a lot of excessive commercialization (although without being too condemning) and excessive pollution (which is very condemning).  Many people seem to have taken offense to the portrayal of people (or specifically Americans) as being fat, lazy, and ignorant.  The filmmakers say that this portrayal is not intended to be offensive or condemning; it was simply a natural effect caused by prolonged multigenerational spaceflight.  You will either see these things and get all mad, or you will nod in agreement, or you will just laugh at it all.<br />*No dialogue for the first twenty minutes or so.  Some people seem to find this aggravating.  I don't mind myself.<br /><br />I never thought another Pixar movie would come along that would be better than \\"Finding Nemo\\" or \\"The Incredibles,\\" but now I would say that \\"Wall-E\\" is my new favorite.  It has gorgeous imagery, from the decadent ruins of Earth to outer space (which is great, because I don't think there are many movies that can capture these kinds of settings so effectively).

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I thouroughly found this movie to be one of the greatest mini-series I have ever seen.  I had to ask for it for Christmas.  It is not only a history lesson but you really find yourself living it.  The acting is terrific, the costumes are period corrrect and the sets are lifelike (it was filmed in Williamsburg).  I grew up in Quincy just down the block from Peacefield and just recently went on the tour.  They did their homework and it shows. This movie portrayed John Adams to be one of the the most interesting of the founding fathers, next to Washington and Jefferson. It think it is a must see.

0307455874|5.0|First of all, the style in which then, Senator Obama communicates with his readers compels you to want to read more, and to look forward to your next opportunity to pick up the book.  He has an appealing ability to make you feel like he is speaking to you personally.     Secondly, if you enjoy American history, and have interest in such things as our Founding Fathers, the ideals on which they based the cornerstones of our democracy, the people and events which have continued to shape that democracy over time, OR, you enjoy current politics, and have an interest in such things as the mechanisms of the modern day senate, policy making, factors which shape and change our politicians, then this book is for you.    Lastly, while now, President Obama does call out numerous personal ideas and strategies to deal with the challenges America is facing, these are NOT truly the things which give us 'The Audacity of Hope'.  It is in the reading of this book that you discover the Content and Strength of President Obama's Character as a human being, the Depth of his Faith, and his Unwavering Belief that America can once again become the Great Nation she was, and that the American Dream can be Reclaimed.  It is THESE THINGS that inspire us to Believe and Dare us to Hope!
1594200823|5.0|As a broke college student, I started avoiding meat after reading books about food that revealed its actual composition and the horrific ethical problems with the factory farm industry.  Reading The OD was an affirmation to invest in high quality meat that will nourish ourselves, the environment, the animals it comes from, and the farmers who care enough to do things the right way - not just the most inexpensive and convenient.   It was a reminder that meat is a treat, something that should be eaten with gratitude for all that enables it, and that everything about eating at McDonald's is unnatural, unhealthy, and overall an utter lack of consciousness and knowledge.  Pollan's writing is extremely smart, engaging, and funny, and the OD will likely affect your life.

0689865384|5.0|I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like this book. But after a couple of chapters I was hooked.  Really good book. Just started Pretties, 2nd book in the series.
B001LRJH0K|3.0|First, to any reviewer, add the word SPOILER to your title if you are going to spelling out major plot points.<br /><br />As for the movie, the gun fights were to fast, the love story developed way to fast and I just couldn't in anyway like Rene's character. The movie is strongest at the beginning and the end.
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|In the span of the last few months of 2008, director Clint Eastwood explores two \\"back in the day\\" characters that clench their fists at America demanding a transformation for the better.  Christine (Angelina Jolie) in \\"[[ASIN:B001NFNFNU Changeling]]\\" roars at an established seat of corrupt power in 1920s Los Angeles; she seeks justice for wrongs appropriated towards her by the LA Police Department. Similarly, Walter Kowalski of \\"Gran Torino\\" snarls with trademark Eastwood defiance at an America reflected in a depleted Detroit; he desires a turning back of the clock to the old [[ASIN:B000002Z20 Motor City Madness]] and what he deems the easier more understandable time of the 60s and 70s when the American automotive industry was king.<br /><br />Is Walter just a dinosaur roaring with all the effectiveness of any soon-to-be extinct creature?  Or is he keening for a lost world where America floated in a gumbo of ingenuity both technological and industrial in a pot set high above the stratosphere in terms of almost everything?  Back in his day, the average American prospered probably because of the fact that most people yearned to be just that--average or rather, ideal Americans.  That idyllic era of gas-guzzling muscle cars that were and still are the envy of every male on either side of the equator was not encumbered by the stifling dynamic of political correctness that in its attempt to be courteous and respectful of each cultural and religious difference of the individual ingredients that poured in the country's unique and ever-changing melting pot somehow managed to weaken a slowly evolving American civilization. Certainly not a Mayflower descendant, Walter represents the second-generation immigrant who got by in WASP-centric microcosm with a high-end work ethic and blew off steam with the likes of ethnic jokes and stereotypical caricatures.<br /><br />Everyone, no matter from what point of origin their grandparents hailed, had the desire to emulate their ideal American. I, with my dark hair and ethnic eyes, wanted nothing more than to be the American girl next door--a combination of socialite sleuth Nancy Drew with her boyfriend Ned driving around their town in her roadster and freckle-faced Trixie Belden of upstate New York living on Crabapple Farm and riding about the countryside on her favorite horse, Susie.  Moms and apple pie ruled supreme, teachers commandeered respect and minding one's p's and q's meant actually holding a door for a lady or smiling while saying `Good Morning' for no other reason than it was impolite not to do so and because that's what one said.  In that era, the homogenization process insured a certain progress towards realizing the American dream of the white picket fence, a requisite dog or cat and a swing on the front porch.  Maybe we were constricted and uptight.  Maybe we repressed things and certainly never talked about sex or made a public display of naked midsections or the top of a thong above a pair of jeans.  In fact, to talk about politics, religion or sex was a breach of etiquette.  We all knew we were different, but we all were striving towards the same goal--to be as American as possible.<br /><br />In our brave new world, the land at which Walter so openly sneers, America has become more wok than melting pot--all the divergent ingredients sizzle together creating an interesting m&eacute;lange but never quite lose their different flavor.  Does it work?<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's Walter doesn't think so. His once blue-collar neighborhood of carefully groomed lawns and well-kept moderately priced homes houses gangs and other unsavory factions that remind him of countries he toured during his stint in the military.  When his Hmong neighbors--two intelligent teenagers (the natural and charming Bee Vang and Ahney Her) that want nothing but a chance to win their own success--are beleaguered by threatening thugs, Walter takes care of business old school in the most entertaining and crowd-pleasing manner as set in motion by the life-toughened avengers like Dirty Harry Callahan, the Man with No Name, and William Munny.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Clint Eastwood's \\"Gran Torino\\" may seem like the usual vigilante shoot-`em-up.  Clint packs a mean gun, but delivers much more than that in this 21st century tale of where America now is as opposed to where it was and what it might take to get some of its bravado back. Eastwood's wonderfully expressive face puckers with anger at Detroit's (and America's) industry-lacking streets and a diversity-friendly focus that may just take America off its game.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"the life-toughened avengers like Dirty Harry Callahan, the Man with No Name, and William Munny.      Bottom line?

0803731094|5.0|I bought this for my son after we went to see The Gruffalo play.  He loves it and really enjoys reading it to me.  He even changes his voice for the different characters.    It's a great book.
B00009AOBI|4.0|Mask is a terrific movie and one of my all-time favorites.  The Director's Cut was interesting in that it showed you some footage left out of the original move.  Although fun to watch, I could see why it was left out of the theatrical version.  It had a goofy tone that was not matched by the rest of the movie.  The use of Bruce Springsteen was also interesting, but not so great that it made me forget Seger's Roll Me Away at the end.  The director uses at least half of his commentary time talking about how great Bruce is and how mad he was that his music didn't make it into the original version.  And if you aren't a Bruce fan, you will completely miss the timeline the music provides.  My advice:  obtain any version of this movie that you can, and watch it - it is a classic!  But I could do without hearing the director whine endlessly about Bruce Springsteen.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I loved this movie. It's so cute and does a great job of portraying its Think Green message without being preachy. A great movie to spark discussions and get kids concerned about the enviroment!
B0017JKEL8|4.0|I became a fan during season 2 and this is a great prelude to that!  Can't wait for the new shows.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Firstly, I think Amazon needs to have all Blu Ray reviews separate from the older Standard Definition reviews. When I look up a Blu title I'm interested only in how well it looks and if its worth my NEW DOLLARS to buy something I've seen before!!<br /><br />Now; this is a fantastic Blu Ray experience and well worth the new dollars, and a chance to see it again in this new format!<br /><br />Continuing: Have you ever gone to a \\"all you can eat buffet\\"? Well, if you have you might have an idea as to the the amount of items on this menu!<br />It is bar none the most spectacular special effects movie I've seen to date! After the crew arrives at Skull Island, it becomes one CGI blowout after another, finally culminating back in New York City, in what I believe is the very best CGI effects in the whole movie {which is hard to define because everything looks so great, but the buildings, cars, etc seem to add something that a jungle can not}.<br /><br />Everybody knows the story, so you won't find a reference to that here. But if you want one HECK OF A BLU RAY RIDE, then I don't think you'd be hungry after leaving this buffet!<br /><br />Last note: wouldn't it be interesting to see the original done in Blu Ray? I bet that would be something really cool!
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|If you're an Abba fan, this is a terrific romp!  If not, experience the fun of Meryl Streep and cast as they show off their singing and dancing talent.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This was given to my granddaughter for Christmas. She begged for it endlessly and absolutely loves it.  She listens to it all the time.
B000UPSKO8|4.0|The \\"Berlin Concert,\\" with Netrebko, Domingo, and Villazon, is much better than the \\"Opera Gala;\\" both, in the quality of the voices, and in the pieces of music selected.
B001P81GO0|5.0|Funny and creative, Marked is truly a good vampire book. I would recommend this book for Twilight lovers and those who like a good laugh with a bit of romance and action.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OMG!!!!!   My new DVD came today.  My friend & I barely made it thru Level 1.  It is a kick-a$$ workout!  (Seriously, she makes you kick your own a$$ in one of the moves!)  I think it may be at least a week before I can do the whole 20 minute workout without stopping for water or skipping the last few reps in some sequences!  Makes me really, really admire all the \\"Biggest Loser\\" contestants all the more.  Every time I wanted to stop I'd think of Jillian yelling at the \\"Losers\\" and tell myself it's a measly 20 minute workout and all those bigger girlies were doing this stuff for 8 hours a day.  Helped me keep at it but I will admit I missed a few reps here and there.  (I kept moving while I caught my breath tho) I watched level 2 and it's even harder... like a couple months away from me being able to do it, little scared to watch level 3.  ;)    I have owned over 100 workout tapes and DVDs in the past few years.  I gave away or sold the ones I didn't like on eBay and kept the 50 or so that I liked.  This is my first Jillian DVD and it is HANDS DOWN my favorite.  (Sorry Gunnar Peterson, your Core Secrets series got bumped to my #2!)    I'm so sore hours after my first workout.  But it hurts in a good way.  Thanks Jillian!!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  I like all the Celtic Woman albums and think their music is really great and so easy to listen to.  DVD makes the music even better (very attractive).
B000SQJ2JG|4.0|As Tommy Bolin fans know he was a great guitarist who could write a good song and had a unique voice that conveyed a real passion and depth of feeling.  This guy would have been putting out more music that would have given him more fame & respect than just his short time with DP. This album stands alongside the 2 he did with the James Gang (Bang and Miami). This is an underated album by those morons who think Ritchie Blackmore was the only one worthy of playing guitar for DP. Tommy was a good choice and now they have the best in Steve Morse.  If you like the David Coverdale/Glenn Hughes DP period then get this album but please check out all the Tommy Bolin stuff, he was awesome most of the time. RIP.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Item was in perfect condition.  Great price compared to other suppliers.  Thanks very much!
0316168815|5.0|This book shows the ability of the writer to describe a very intense topic. She has you on your seat the whole read and you do not know what to think at the end of the book. It is a heavy topic to write about or read.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas... he does have somewhat different sense of humor but says that this changed someone's life! Hopefully for the better... :-) but then, it is funny, strange (naturally) and weird in a way that tickles my funny bone. So I guess I did give something to my son... my weird sense of humor! It's ALL good! Really! Try it if you like something different.
B001GM28HO|5.0|It's a good album, don't get me wrong. But this isn't the second coming or anything. And I don't know if I can agree with \\"lyrical genius\\" like some have said. But it's got a good beat, I can dance to it!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Well chances are if you purchased this than you have already seen SERENITY and more than once. So what is better than seeing it now in stunning Blu Ray? Thanks for finally bringing the Big Damn Movie to this format!
031606792X|1.0|I absolutely loved the first three books in the series. Why did SM have to ruin the beautiful story she created?! Did she actually write Breaking Dawn or was it all a big hoax to discredit her???    The characters had all changed without any progress/evidence of development. It was too instant and convenient. I've read enough reviews that express my exact thoughts so I am not going to waste my time repeating them.     I will definitely re-read the Twilight saga but I will stop once I finish Eclipse. As far as I am concerned, that's where the story ends. I'm putting my copy of Breaking Dawn on ebay in a few days.
0307277453|4.0|For the 50/50 odds makers on creation vs. science, this book will surely add fuel to the evolutionary scheme.  Thought provoking even a year after reading the book. The simple details explained for those either too old or too uninterested to see the anatomy of ancestry develop in the bones of mammals and other creatures. This will open the doors to more introspection, some sadness or denial for the spiritual masses, but in the end, those truly in search of the truth and options for existence will be captivated.  Could have developed more of the cause and effect evolution rather than leaving it to a leap of scientific faith, but in the end, if you have half a brain it does make sense and can be easily understood. Assuming, of course, the 50% odds that the scientific debate prevails over some ultimate creator option. Either way, it is fascinating to see what is undeniably true about Earth millions of years ago. One must fit these facts into the debate about our existence. Good work.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|what an incredible ride from start to finish james cameron takes us back to the brief life of titanic and shows us with great vision what it must have been like to be on board the legendary ship. the acting is incredible with kate and leo giving great performances as well as the rest of the cast. but the most remarkable aspect of the movie has to be the effort and detail that was put into it the fact that most of the sets were built and sank on camera instead of using cgi was incredible and it felt like u were actually there witnessing all the horrific events first hand i highly recommend this movie to everyone!
B00004YKUY|4.0|I like many was very skeptical when first purchasing this cd. I knew Steve Perry was gone, but I was curious as to see if the band could keep it together with this cd. Well they did and they came through big time. This album should have been much bigger than it was. There are at least four songs that had potential to make it on billboard's hot 100 chart. The album itself keeps the signature Journey sound. Some songs that stand out on the album include:     Higher Place  All the Way  Signs of Life  With your Love
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|this movie was an awesome experience from start to finish it grabs your attention and doesn't let go the effects,plot and acting are all flawless with heath ledger stealing it all his performance as the joker was incredible and one not to be forgotten christian bale delivers as batman i recommend this to everyone looks and sounds incredible in blu ray!!
B0013FNC38|1.0|It's just a short video, not the music album that is advertised for sale.  There is talking over every song.  I could not be more disappointed.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Very much enjoyed this remastered film.  Video and audio quality are excellent.  Price is right.  The movie itself is, of course, a classic, and deservedly so.  Only problem is that many lines/scenes/songs have become part of our culture, and you keep saying to yourself, \\"Ah, that's where that came from!\\"  But that isn't the movie's fault.  The \\"special\\" extras are so-so.  If you're a film buff, you'll like them.    A trivia question to which I don't know the answer: Can anyone say whether or not any scenes were un-rescuable?  I would have sworn there was a scene where Eliza sits around at a tea with high-society ladies and shows off her ability to mimic the Cockneys, much to their amusement and her mortification.  This scene was logically necessary to get Eliza off the hook for her Ascot outburst, but it isn't in this edition of the movie.  Was it in the original, or is that scene only in Pygmalion?
032147404X|3.0|I don't know what I read that led me to believe I would find value in this book.<br /><br />It is very basic and if you have been shooting for even a short amount of time it will be of little or no value.<br /><br />Interestingly I found little about digital photography within and so the title is even misleading.
B000006P8I|5.0|Wow you wanna talk about an incredible surprise?  How about THIS David Bowie album released in 1967 being a melodic, poppy masterpiece.  Yes it's true, every single moment of this album leaves me speechless and craving more.      If only I had known David Bowie was so good at writing short and snappy vocal melodies in such a memorable way I wouldn't have waited all these years to listen to this wonderful album.      Yes, it's true- there's no weak spots *anywhere* on his self-titled album.  Furthermore, the lyrics are kind of interesting and Bowie's voice is even emotional from time to time.  Some of these songs have a hint of sadness to them.  The very final song has TWISTED and dark lyrics, which is very odd to say the least.    I give this album a perfect 5 stars without hesitation.  Along with Space Oddity, this is a VERY underrated album.  Anyone who loves the Zombies, Love, or Paul Revere and the Raiders needs to check this album out.
B00003OO3O|5.0|This is a classic GEM, if you are a fan of U.f.O you must own this, It Is so timeless and feels effortless and Micheal Schenker's solo's are always right on time very melodic and always amazing. This disc is for fans it has some of the most memorable song's with some great acoustic tracks, this is UFO in their prime!
B00007LTIC|3.0|This one of my favorite Yes albums and I have had the original Atlantic cd and it is way, way, WAY easier on the ears. I bought this remaster and whoa nelly, it's like nails scraping blackboard. It is very clear that it has been remastered in the current fashion: LOTS of compression, and LOUD LOUD LOUD. Google Loudness War if you don't know what I'm talking about. In other words, this cd sounds like it's meant to be ripped straight into mp3s and unto your Ipod. If that's how you listen to the album, then it will sound fine - but if you have any intention of sitting down and listening on a half-way decent stereo you're missing out on a lot. I am not an audiophile/yes snob by any means, I just am able to compare remasters and believe a word of caution is needed for Yes-lovers out there...
B0015OKWL2|2.0|Has Hollywood become so cynical it thinks that simply slapping the names of two iconic actors on a marquee will cause the throngs to line up at the box office.    The throngs stayed away from \\"Righteous Kill\\" in droves and with good reason--it's a less than routine cop-serial killer movie without a single witty or new idea--had anyone brought this script to the producers of TV's \\"Law and Order\\" they would have been laughed out of the office.    De Niro and Pacino sail through the film using their, by now, patented mannerisms....De Niro mostly scowls as if he's still working in \\"A Boy's Life\\"...what's most amazing is these two exhibit zero chemistry together.    The supporting cast, which includes Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo and Carla Gugino, try hard, but the script gives them nothing to play.    Take any one episode for example, from the five years of HBO's \\"The Wire\\" and you have better acting, writing and direction than what's exhibited in \\"Righteous\\"...    Somewhere, there may be some material worthy of these two legendary screen talents, but \\"Righteous Kill\\" ain't it.............
1416562605|5.0|We are told the story of Balram, the son of a poor rickshaw puller from an Indian village.The story is narrated by Balram as he recites his story to send to the prime minister of China who is supposed to pay a visit to India. Balram would like to to help the prime minister understand the real India. The story takes us and shows us different aspects of the Indian society. The way Balram sees the world around him and tries to make sense of life is fascinating.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show. The dialogue is fresh, this show is flat out amazing, from a societal and psychological perspective. Seeing it presented on Blu-Ray was a real treat for me. It was watched on a 42\\" Panasonic 1080p Plasma, and BD30K Panasonic player. PQ was not perfect, with some noticable imperfections, but close to 4/5. Sound 4/5. The show does not have many instance, where the True HD sound would shine.<br /><br />The show represents a gut wrenching struggle of Dexter who tries to appear normal and juxtapose his serial killer urges, with his \\"Bloodspatter\\" analyst job. Watching the lead character question, crumble, and reconstitute under the rigorous standards of society is very interesting to watch. The show is written and shot with perfection, hilarious, and the Blu-Ray presentation with its upgrade in sound to TrueHD is a real treat for fans. I am watching this series for the second time, and I can say that it is definitely worth the upgrade. Highly recommended!
B001CTA1S4|5.0|To some, Philip Seymour Hoffman may be terribly miscast, physically wise, but he still, alongside the ever-dependable Meryl Streep, provides something to the audiences that refers to the apt title: doubt. There are no definite answers in this film, and the screenplay is intelligent, as the characters, particularly Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn, face off sans boxing gloves, with punctuated and sharply defined words, all the while maintaining the concept of doubting. Meryl Streep is immaculate, no pun intended, as the domineering, condescending but well-intentioned principal. Her performance is to the point, without any embellishments, always with almost melodious tones, and ironically bitingly terse line deliveries, like her unforgettable turn in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" but without the Pradas. Streep is a textbook representation of acting (less is more, though stylistic acting decorum is projected on her sometimes wringing, wriggling fingers, and the movements of her neck). \\"Doubt\\" works not solely within the confinements of the Catholic establishment, but can be applied to any structural regime or beliefs. We need to dare to question anything, just that sometimes we also need to be aware of the consequences such as losing humanity in the face of faith. Thus, is it worth to doubt? Thematically wise, that is up to the person. In any case, looking from a cinematic point of view, there is no arguing that one should not even have a single trace of doubt in seeing this film.
0694011479|5.0|Eric Carle writes excellent childrens books.  They are always very colorful and entertaining.  The board books are very sturdy for smaller childern who either chew on everything and small hands which make turning paper books hard.
B000HIVOI2|3.0|I was expecting much more when I picked this up on amazon hoping for a superior transfer and remaster from the original dvd version but that's not what I got, Obvious flaws in the transfer are present and the fact it uses mpeg 2 isn't surprising but i would have liked for VC usage since it all around seems to be a better format.<br /><br />Video quality: is only a bit better then the ultimate edition dvd which I am currently as I write this up converting on my 360's hd dvd addon a small difference in quality below the blu ray version but in most instances its exactly the same something I would not expect on the bluray version of the film the same graininess from the DVD is present as well.<br /><br />Sound Quality:It would seem the dvd version has the same bells and whistles in this area though the bluray has DTS HD over the DTS 6.1 on the dvd but I've yet to tell a major difference between the 2.<br /><br />All together it seems that they ripped all of the stuff from the dvd version the chapters in the index are all at the same scenes even though they left out-is there a stargate feature from the ultimate dvd.<br />If your gonna buy a version of this get [[ASIN:B0000844I8 Stargate (Ultimate Edition)]] its cheaper by 3 dollars or so and its the better version for the technology that must be used and the features.<br /><br />Edit:Forgot to include the subtitle problems with quite a few bits of audio including foreign languages, and sounds not being described clearly the subtitles were not intended for the hearing impaired.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Both the container and DVD were in perfect condition!  The price was exceptional as well.
B0019CSXAM|3.0|Well i really loved the first 2 seasons - rolling on the floor.    I have only watched 13 episodes of season 3 so far. The first disc containing 6 episodes was absolute rubbish. The second disc was much better but below the standard set by the first 2 seasons which were consistently brilliant.    Maybe it was the writers strike (the season is shorter than the others) I don't know. I will probably get season 4 but I really hope the last disc picks it up a bit.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Pros   - These trigger add-ons make the Dualshock/Sixaxis controller feel so much better.    - Your fingers won't feel like slipping off(though I never had a problem with them slipping off)   - It's really comfortable.    - Playing GTAIV, shooters that use R2 for firing, and some racing games are a lot better now.      Cons   - I bought these with the controller armor so I thought it was overpriced since I didn't need the controller armor(it does look nice but I have the wireless keypad so it gets in the way).  - Also, you CAN lose a trigger fairly easy.  I thought I lost one so I ordered another set.  I found the missing one a couple weeks later.  Maybe super glue them on if you don't ever plan on taking them off.    Once you use these, you won't ever take them off.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|I understand the good guy has to win. But when a villain mercilessly kills so many people without blinking and kills colleagues without an afterthought and then when it comes to killing the good guy, he has to prolongue it and give this whole \\"I'm going to kill you after I do this and this and this and I'm going to get pleasure out of watching you die, etc\\", and this all comes after you've told countless henchmen to kill this person (which means a few minutes ago you didn't mind somebody else doing a killing job that you wouldn't see), I guess I'm just tired of the rehashed ridiculousness.<br /><br />This villain assembles a team that has the entire United States of America by the balls, but then when it comes down to crunch time, it struggles with a cop that can't be killed by hovering aircraft, crumbling freeway overpasses, or henchmen that managed to kill entire departments of security but can't kill this one cop. This villain has everything planned beautifully, and then sends killer after killer, one by one just like the others, to kill this cop instead of just keeping the killers around him for protection, so when McClain does find him, he has to face several people with guns at once. Not that this would stop him, of course. But it's a movie that tries to convince me that a brilliant villain would all of a sudden become very careless and that hired killers would turn into bumbling idiots.<br /><br />The ridiculousness got to a point where I was actually rooting for the villain to win. There he is on the ground. You have a gun. Just shoot him.<br /><br />But this film isn't about believability. It's about special effects and yippee ki-a mo fo. And if that's your thing, than this movie's awesome special affects doesn't disappoint.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Not many shows deliver something that is entertaining and doesn't feel dumb down for the audience.  This show delivers on both accounts, and then some.  The characters are rich and the stories so engaging, you can't help but get sucked into their lives.  I devoured all 13 episodes and am famished for season 2 when it comes out on DVD.  Long live Sterling Cooper!
0385474547|5.0|This is a great book.  It's a hard read, but if you take the time to go slowly, it pays off in the end.  Good story about tradition vs. modernization.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I found this movie excellent.  It has a lot of swearing, gore, sex, and other adult themes, so I'd be mindful of which of my kids I let watch this movie.  But I really loved it's use of colors/cinematography.  And it had great special effects and a great story/plot line.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Especially for its time. I saw this movie in 1968, when it was rated \\"X\\" on the old ratings system. It is SO well done it's almost legendary--unless you're too young to appreciate what it might have meant to an audience in 1968.<br /><br />The \\"poorer\\" reviews here seem to be coming from a younger crowd of reviewers. Perhaps they are disappointed that Polanski chose to put his own mark on \\"The Scottish Play\\" and it isn't \\"by the book.\\" Perhaps they are simply young and lack the real-life experiences that make the play such a classic. Or maybe youth has become inured to the true horror of interpersonal violence because of its current prevalence both in film and daily life.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, I say, \\"Watch it again when you're 60 or so.\\" Your opinion might change.
2913903878|4.0|Many have called this the de facto USGI collectors catalog.  It does cover a lot of equipment.. most general issue items are included.      I did not see it as a collectors guide.  It does not point out the things that make items unique.  It shows a boot.  Gives the name, and maybe a picture of the makers mark.  Well.. how many companies produced that item?  Which company name would be rare and the other common?  Is there a stitch or eyelet type that would differentiate an early shoe vs a late shoe? Little of that information is in the book.    Another example are the Handy-Talky radios (BC-611's) there where at least 6 models (A-F) and the circuit components differed dramatically later in the war.  This book shows a BC-611, and some other items and then moves on.    The pictures are excellent quality, and the construction of the book is nice and heavy.      But to call it anything more than an introduction to USGI equipment is an overstatement.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Rhino has done it again!  This deluxe edition of the Bee Gees classic Odessa is beautifully packaged and is some of the best remastering work I have heard.  It is far superior to the earlier CD releases.  As others have pointed out, it is astounding that these 40-year-old recordings can still sound so beautiful.  They have been lovingly remastered by people who really know what they're doing.  The clarity of the guitars, vocals and lush orchestrations is really breathtaking.  The low end (i.e. Mo's great bass work) has also been brought out like never before.  There is an incredible warmth to these recordings that has been faithfully brought forward into the digital age.  For audiophile purists who say CD's just can't sound as good as vinyl, this CD release is worth a listen.    As for the album itself, Odessa is not quite a masterpiece, but it is an astonishing achievement from 3 brothers who were barely old enough to be high school graduates!  The style is eclectic to say the least, with influences from blues, folk rock, country and orchesteral recordings.  There are many outstanding songs, as well as a few clunkers.  The title track, Melody Fair, Marley Purt Drive, Sound of Love and Lamplight are among the Bee Gees best songs.  A few, such as Edison, don't hold up as well.    All in all, this release is a must-have for any Bee Gees fan.  It is well worth the price, and was well worth the wait.  Thank you Rhino, for the respect and attention you gave to these classic recordings!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Got the movie just in time for Christmas, it was not available in the local stores. Thanks for getting me out of a bind!
B001ER4CNY|3.0|I ordered this for someone who is a huge Jeannie fan.  They loved the idea of the set and the way that it was packaged but not the way the bottle (container) for the DVDs was made, as it is just cheap cardboard (thick pressed paper).  They chose to keep the set since they're such a huge fan.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|How many dumb Batman movies have I subjected myself to?  Only three.<br /><br />The two Tim Burton movies were two of the most overrated piles of goat excrement of the 1990's and then Joel Schumacher turned those vile efforts and made it even worse.  I think I saw about fifteen minutes of the one where Robin is running around with George Clooney and vomit tickled into my expensive sofa.<br /><br />How frickin' hard can it be to make a entertaining movie about comic book heroes?  Batman is horrible and Spider Man is equally as horrible.  The old Superman movies by Richard Donner were pretty good...and then they ruined the memories of those by bringing in Richard Pryor and then Heman to battle the Man of Steel.<br /><br />I never saw `Batman Begins' as I saw no reason to.  It just seems like another desperate plea in Hollywood to make a quick buck because the creatives out there have nothing inside of their brains.<br /><br />I don't remember ever hearing anything good, bad or indifferent bout that movie, but `The Dark Knight' certainly got a lot of hype and there's nothing worth watching after combing the new release section at the video store, so I figured I'd check it out.<br /><br />I was VERY surprised as to how much I enjoyed this movie.  Most movies post `Star Wars' in the late 1970's that get all the hype never live up to it...or even come close to living up to it.  This movie does, and even exceeds it, in my opinion.<br /><br />The story is very good.  The cinematography is great (very important for a comic-book-related feature).  It's literally dark, meaning the villains are actually...villainous.  It's violent and it never makes you feel like it's going to end with a pretty little bow tied around it (and it doesn't) like so many other Hollywood productions do.  It's nice to see a movie end with a not so happy ending (still have a long way to go before anything competes with the end of John Carpenter's `The Thing', however).<br /><br />The only reason it's not five star quality is that, after awhile, it gets a little irritating listening to Christian Bale try to talk like Clint Eastwood in `Heartbreak Ridge' and I grew a little tired of all of the coin flipping of Aaron Eckhart's character....but that is really nit-picking, here.<br /><br />Highly recommended and it gives me a little hope for the future.  Best comic book-esque movie since `Robocop'.little irritating listening to Christian Bale try to talk like Clint Eastwood in `Heartbreak Ridge' and I grew a little tired of all of the coin flipping of Aaron Eckhart's character....but that is really nit-picking, here.

0316010669|3.0|First of all, let me say the examples Gladwell provides in the book are fascinating, from the war game general who succeeds despite having far less information to the police officers who misunderstood a situation.<br /><br />However, once he's done presenting the data, he has one short chapter of summary, then the book is over.<br /><br />I would've liked some additional analysis or other way of incorporating lessons learned into one's personal life rather that just given a collection of \\"raw data\\".

B001KL3GWM|4.0|Derek Trucks has already carved out a place for himself as the premier electric guitarist of his generation.  Like many young players his recorded product has been a bit inconsistent, though each record has shown significant growth.  His last record Songlines showed a maturing talent who was learning to play the studio as an instrument, and showed him absorbing the many stylistic influences into something that was uniquely his own.  Already Free continues that growth, though hard core purists among us will probably be unhappy.<br /><br />Already Free shows the influence of his year working with Eric Clapton, especiallly his embrace of more commercial forms of music.  It also shows the vibe of his work with his own side project (if you can call it that) the Soul Stew Revival, his rollicking rock and blues revue with his wife Susan Tedeschi. Highlights of Already Free include a cover of Dylan's Down in The Flood, Something to Make You Happy which reminds me of mid-70's soul, perhaps War, and Get What You Deserve, a blistering rocker.  My personal favorite is probably These Days is Almost Gone, a Kofi Burbridge tune that works perfectly.<br /><br />While this record doesn't have a song with the highs of Songlines' This Sky, overall it is more consistent and the songs are stronger.  it is an exceptional record, but the lack of transcendental moments knocks it down to  4 stars.  A definite buy, and it will spend hours on the changer.
6300248550|4.0|If you love Bronte's book, it's a leeeeeetle rich staring at those two ugly mugs, the drop-dead Dalton beauty and huge-eyed, winsome Zelah Clarke.  But who cares? This production reproduces Charlotte's little bestseller well and faithfully.  The early videotape makes for weird viewing in the era of Kiera Knightley Austen Extravaganzas, but that's okay--the clothes are spot-on, the moors are forbidding, the casting's superb (Andrew Bicknell nails St. John Rivers' icy moral distain to the wall), and they FOLLOWED THE STORY (with a couple of small side-plot exceptions} Which is more than you can say for costume dramas these days.      Plus--and this is key for Charlotte Bronte fans--we know Mr. Rochester has some pretty high-falutin' lines, ones not nearly as naturalistic as those in sister Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights.  And Dalton actually manages to pull them off.  The two leads bounce off each other superbly--Jane tormenting Rochester with a straight face near the end of the story comes to mind.  All in all, a solid production almost three deecades later.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Great family game - all my children loved it.  The litte ones love to make designs and connect pieces anyway they want!  My older children love to play it according to the rules (me and my husband too).  lots of fun, uses creative thinking skills, and a game takes only 20 to 30 minutes.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The standard from which I judge all other Blu-Ray titles. From training at Toccoa, fighting at Carentan and weathering the weather and shelling at Bastogne, this is one of the greatest World War II series I've ever watched. If you think the DVD set impressed, this will blow you out of the water. Worth every penny.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|I like all the actors and the acting was great,but the whole pkg. was only good not excellent. There were some very clever bits,I especially liked how the drug lord(kid) and his crew were such great fans of the \\"Supid Fresh\\" Ben Stiller  character part from his earlier movies. Robt Downey Jr. was the best of the bunch.Nick  Nolte  his usual well done job. The writing was only so-so. Director and film editing only so-so. I thought that  \\"Superbad\\" was a much better movie in general terms
B001FSDOZO|3.0|I love Nickelback. They're my current favourite. But man, I'm disappointed with this album! There are a few crackers on here, that sound like Nickelback. But to be honest much of it sounds like Def Leppard has made a comeback! If I want cheesy 80's rock I'll listen to cheesy 80's rock... Nickelback, COME BACK! This isn't you!
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|This is another great album from Enya.  The first CD did not play on my CD player so I sent it back and got a new one.  The second one did not play either.  I found out that it plays on my computer although that's not where I want to listen to it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|My wife and I have watched this over and over again.  We love the songs and humor of it, and have shared with friends and family with (mostly) good results.  It's quirky, and won't be for everyone, but I'd say there's a very good chance you'll have a smile stuck on your face and a song or two stuck in your head if you give it a watch.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen ever. The double disc (making of movie) was great as well
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you are a fan of Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Neil Patrick Harris, and/or Felicia Day, or have no clue who they are you still need to buy this DVD. If you are a fan of thought provoking issues wrapped in fun music, witty/irreverant humor, singable songs and never ending sight gags you REALLY need to own this. I love it so much I bought the DVD even though I already have the download from ITunes.  The bonus features are beyond shiney.    If you believe that creative people need outlets other than those controlled by a few Network executives you REALLY REALLY need to buy this DVD. It was an experiment by the Whedon group to see if direct download/internet and DVD access are economically feasible.  Let's show them it is.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Strictly Ballroom made me believe in film making as a true art form. It is a celebration of colour and movement set to music. The story seamlessly weaves in the timeless themes of `one man versus the world' and `the ugly duckling'. The romance across ethnic lines adds to the spice and vigour.     You don't have to love dancing to love the movie, but after viewing it you may gain a new appreciation of dance sport as competition or perhaps art, the movie entertains both lines of thinking.    However, those who have been brought up on slick, big budget, Hollywood films might find some scenes a bit crudely cut. The humour is quirky. But herein lies its charm. In the commentary, the film makers said that a lot of their limited budget went into just a few small things, namely: the scene with the train going past, the rights to the song where they slow danced behind the curtain, and the rights to use the Coca-Cola neon sign as dance prop. Whatever, every cent was spent to perfection.    If the definition of a great movie is one that you can watch again and again without ever getting tired of it, then this perhaps could be the greatest movie ever made. I've seen it about a dozen times and I still cry at the end (and I'm a red blooded male).
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my new favorite workout tape!<br />This is a 20 minute action packed workout. I love the fact that this is more of a circuit training style workout.<br />Level 1: Jumping jacks, jump rope, but kicks, sit ups, lots of lunges (I don't hate lunges as much now that my legs are stronger), chest fly with weights, bent row with weights<br /><br />The good stuff: My plan is to drop from a size 8 to a 6.<br />I'm on my 3rd week, I've lost about an inch on my thighs and waist. My arms are trimmer! When I lift my arm, you can see definition in my shoulder area. I don't know the name of the muscle. I'm starting too look like Linda Hamilton in T2!<br />I do this workout 5-6 days a week.<br />I generally eat pretty healthy. I do have a major sweet tooth and I love breads. I'm sure I would've lost another 1/2 inch if i kept that in check.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm super excited about this tape! I'm still on Level 1. I tried level 2, but think level 1 is harder for me. I've checked out level 3, it's hardcore. I'm not doing that yet. I love the variety of workout. Like I said, I get bored easy. I can see myself doing these workouts for years!<br /><br />Definitely worth the price!<br />I'll add an update in a few weeks :)<br /><br />1/30/08<br />It's been a month and I've lost 10 lbs and another 1/2 inch on my thighs.<br />I'm VERY happy with the results!<br /><br />I didn't lose 20lbs, but I haven't been consistent with my work out. I was super busy and only worked out twice this week!<br />Also, I refuse to give up my sweets and breads. I usually have 2-3 baked chocolate chip Trader Joe cookies after lunch and dinner.<br />I will continue to use this tape! I want to lose another 5-10 lbs now.<br />I will give an update in another month :)<br /><br />Good luck to everyone!! If you buy this tape, PLEASE give info on results. Not many have which is why i chose too.
B001ED7C58|4.0|My Granddaughter loves anything to do with \\"Twilight\\" and so the soundtrack made her very happy!
B0007TKNCY|4.0|Frank Capra rules in the screwball genre!    BRINGING UP BABY is exactly what screwball comedy is all about.  Howard Hawks was great at it, and so is the director of this film, Frank Capra.  Capra has done so many wonderful screwball comedies that we might lose sight at how difficult it is to pull one off.  He does it beautifully.    Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn heat up the screen with great chemistry and tear up the screen with much comedy and antics.  These actors know their craft.    I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B000OVLBGC|2.0|I would like to take this opportunity to complain about the region codes of DVDs. I think that they are a major nuisance and just the consequence of the sort of greed that brought the global financial system so close to collapse. They serve no other purpose than squeezing a maximum of dollars out of the pockets of customers. Amazon as a major buyer might very well be in a position to do something effective against this nonsense. Would be great!
B000EWBKKI|4.0|Terminator 2 is my favorite Terminator movie.  They are all good, but this one hit all of the right notes and hit them hard.    James Cameron should be regarded more highly than he is.  This movie is not just an action movie, it also has to do with time and the horror of dehumanization.   Cameron did a fantastic job.    Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton were never better.    I highly recommend
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Powerful performance, as expected, by Wil Smith. Original plot and great acting make it a must see horror/action movie. A must see of any Will Smith fan. I was very pleased with my purchase.
B001PE26QQ|5.0|This film is one of the best movies ever made about a real life and true Kung Fu Master. Donnie Yen plays the part of Yip Man, at first when I heard that a movie of Yip Man was being made and that Donnie Yen was playing the main role well I thought that he would have to learn Wing Chun for at lease a year to be believable but his Wing Chun was so good that it appeared that he had been learning Wing Chun Kung Fu for a long time. I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times now and all I can tell you is that I can't get enough of it. Now I don't think every scene in the movie was factual or based on the life of this amazing man but I do know that Yip Man was and is the main reason why Wing Chun is even known about today. If it were not for him accepting students in Hong Kong, then Wing Chun would possibly be hidden forever. Yip Man's most famous student was the great Bruce Lee, due to his popularity people around the world learned of the great system of Kung Fu known as \\"WING CHUN\\"
B000OVLBGC|5.0|One of the best films I've been watching for months, and I have seen quite a bit of them! Also I visisted the Stasi headquarters in Berlin some years ago which appear in this film and are in reality now a museum open to the public, tell you: Spooky place! Besides Ulrich M&uuml;he also played in the original \\"Funny Games\\" a stunning sadistic film from Michael Haneke.
B0013L2EDQ|5.0|Highly reccomend this author for anyone who is a big fan of Dan Brown's work. Very easy to read keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through the story.
0316113506|3.0|\\"Spark\\" consists of hundreds of pages of an overview of brain chemistry, anecdotal accounts of how individuals improved their lives through exercise, and results from pertinent experiments - all aimed at convincing readers that most anything is possible if they exercise more.<br /><br />The only problem is that science is not that clear, especially science involving educational achievement.  This is because potential factors influencing education achievement (eg. exercise) are normally confounded with genetic and home environment factors.  As a result, drawing conclusions in this area usually requires numerous replications and large numbers of participants.<br /><br />The uniformity of results supporting Ratey's thesis makes one suspect that he cherry-picked that data available, making the entire book suspect.<br /><br />Personally, I'd guess that exercise does help learning - it's just that the book doesn't provide a credible case.  And I was impressed with the story of several P.E. teachers who had thoughtfully improved the aerobic condition of their students, and how heart monitors allowed them to identify those making a good effort (though their comparative results may not show it).
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I've been a musical,good feeling,movie buff since watching old Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney movies from the 1940's as a child.       I got those same feelings from this wonderful uplifting movie.  Meryl Streep can do no wrong.  She is truly the best American Actress ever, better than Kathrine Hepburn (who use to be my # 1 girl, she is now #2)

B00000DG1R|5.0|For those of you who just want an overview of Duran Duran without buying every album they ever did, this is the cd you should purchase.  All of the songs kick butt, and they are Duran Duran essentials.  Give em a listen.  My personal fav is \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\".
B001GQACGO|4.0|I bought this album because of the amazing If I Were A Boy. I tuned in to the radio and on first listen, I immediately loved the song. Though the title is grammatically incorrect, I can forgive Beyonce for this album is good music.    Fans of B'Day will definitely be disappointed as songs on this album are not as aggressive as those in B'Day. But I greatly appreciate the fact this album is not B'Day Part 2. What I think she tried with this album is to combine aspects from Dangerously In Love and B'Day.    I really don't like it when artists release a standard edition of their album, and then follow it up with a deluxe edition. Fortunately here in the Philippines, the standard edition of this album never made it to our shores. Instead, we get the Deluxe Edition.    I maybe one of the few who liked the splitting of the songs in two CDs. 'I Am' is filled with ballads and softer songs.  'If I Were A Boy' opens the CD and sets the listeners mood to a high right away. My favorite tracks 'Halo' and 'Disappear' are next. Beyonce belts her heart out in the former and tones it down in the latter. Both are good songs displaying her vocal skills. 'Broken Hearted Girl' is another cliche but good song. Though, amidst the other tracks on the first CD it gets overshadowed by the others. One of the songs available only on the Deluxe Edition is 'Smash Into You'. This is perhaps one of Beyonce's better ballads. The songs begins slowly and gets better towards the end without becoming obnoxious as some of her other ballads.     Remnants of the Beyonce from B'Day can be found on disc 2 titled 'Sasha Fierce'. Though, this CD is less fierce than her sophomore album. 'Single Ladies' opens the disc and will surely get stuck in your head. Watch Beyonce perform the song live and you'll appreciate the song more. Despite critics not liking 'Radio', the next track, I find it one of the better songs on Sasha Fierce. Other good tracks are 'Sweet Dreams', 'Diva', and 'Hello'. 'Diva' may not be impressive lyrically and vocally but the production makes up for it. Next to 'Single Ladies', this song will get stuck in your head as well. While others enjoyed 'Ego' and 'Scared of Lonely', two of the three added tracks on the Deluxe Edition, I prefer 'Hello' over them.    With Beyonce's ambition to please a wider range of audience with this album, listeners need to have an open mind and ears to appreciate this album. After all, if Beyonce will continue to keep this 'dual' personality of hers then I expect greater things from her in the future.
B0012GMVG2|5.0|My mom had this on cassette when I was little, and I remember listening to \\"Rosanna\\", \\"Afraid of Love\\", and \\"Africa\\", and just falling in love with them.  They are great songs, and are all on this CD.  This is quite possibly the best CD Toto ever put out.  As a drummer, this is a must have because Jeff Porcaro (R.I.P.) was quite possibly the most talented drummer since Buddy Rich.  Playing to his songs are challenging, but extremely fun.
B001ED7C58|3.0|For being so overtly hyped I should have expected the Twilight soundtrack to be just about as fluff-filled and commercialized as it ended up being, but I didn't. I still maintained one tiny shred of hope that this cd would hold a candle to some of the previous fantastic soundtracks of vampire films of the past (The Lost Boys, Interview with the Vampire, or if I branch out beyond just vampires, The Craft ...)<br /><br />To be short and to the point, I was completely let down after purchasing this album, although it has grown on me exceedingly, the bottom line is it just could have been better. My favorite tracks are 'Full Moon' by the Black Ghosts and 'Eyes On Fire' by Blue Foundation.

0385340567|1.0|I've read and enjoyed all of the Reacher novels, until now.  Not much to add to the other negative reviews, which are on the mark.  The novel suffers from a dull plot punctuated by left-wing rants about the war and religion.  It's a disservice to the character of Reacher to make him spew such nonsense.  Fans of these novels are not going to agree with the oversimplified, lefty drivel that the once apolitical Reacher is forced to deliver.  Don't waste your time.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|It opens with a low fuzz of some monster growl sound, followed by a guitar loop and some lyrics. And then Panda Bear's fast drum beat combines with high-pitched strings, transforming the first song, \\"In the Flowers,\\" into one hell of a rave song.<br /><br />With this opening, Animal Collective dives off the deep end with \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion,\\" an awesome surreal blend of psychedelic rock with rave sounds. Animal Collective has always filled their songs with an amalgam of electronic sounds and samples with psychedelic rock. However, with \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion,\\" Animal Collective instead combine the psychedelic electronica to create one hell of a mix of keyboard loops, blasting synthesizer sounds and echoing vocals.<br /><br />This is one amazing album where all the talents of Animal Collective worked cohesively to make an awesome sound. Although I'll miss Deakin's guitars, Avey Tare and the gang really worked hard to make sure that they didn't sound as awful as the Smashing Pumpkins without their drummer. Panda does incredible work to play drums and synthesizer loops, while Avey Tare layers his echoing vocals with his keyboards and the Geologist's electronics.<br /><br />It all sounds so incredibly beautiful. And this time Panda Bear is helping out a lot more too. In the second track, \\"My Girls,\\" the Panda sings, \\"I don't mean to seem like I care about material things like a social status/I just want four walls and adobe slabs for my girls,\\" his dream sounds so ethereal with fast arpeggiated electronic synthesizers and slamming bass drum sounds. And by the time he shouts \\"Whoooo!\\", I was completely immersed in this surreal world of Panda Bear's booming bass drums and Tare's swirling synthesizers.<br /><br />In the big picture, however, this entire album really captures the beauty of love and hopes for stability, even in this economic depression. In the song \\"Lion in a Coma,\\" Avey Tare sings \\"Please don't leave me/things that feel good/I've been lucky trying to feel good.\\" Perhaps the band is anxious about losing everything, especially in this difficult time of economic recession. However, the gorgeous sounds of didgeridoos, Tare's echoing vocals and a Panda's bass drum thumping an African beat makes their hopes for the future sound so wonderful.<br /><br />It's a little early to make predictions for the best albums of 2009, but this is my hands-down favorite album of the year. It's impossible to resist this swirling mix of surreal hyper rave electronic sounds and psychedelic synthesizers.and is anxious about losing everything, especially in this difficult time of economic recession.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|Wow.  THE GOOD SHERPHERD is such an intriguing movie--and such a departure for Matt Damon; if only director Robert De Niro (and I so look forward to watching his future directorial offerings) had left about half an hour of film on the cutting room floor this film would have been as exceptional as it would have been extraordinary.  With a running time of close to three hours, the story inevitably bogs down and gets in its own way; but that's about as much badmouthing I'm going to give a movie I enjoyed as much as this one.<br /><br />Depicting a promising young Yale grad picked by Army intelligence to work behind the lines during World War II, then tapped on the shoulder to help found what became the CIA, Matt Damon is absolutely riveting.  His character, Edward Wilson, sacrifices everything--his personal life, his family--for espionage, intelligence, and counter-intelligence, as America enters the Cold War.  Damon is stoic, devoid of emotion, soft spoken, unflappable--cold and heartless.  Nothing seems to move him--even when his own son hangs in the balance.  The events surrounding him--the Second World War, the Cold War, the Bay of Pigs, his son's ill-advised contacts with CIA targets--are spellbinding.<br /><br />And you can't go wrong with Damon's supporting cast, including De Niro himself, William Hurt, and Alec Baldwin, just to name a few.  John Turturro plays an effective, sometimes brutal, assistant to Damon's Wilson, yet unfortunately, Angelina Jolie is utterly wasted (pardon the pun) in a reduced role as the neglected, drunken wife.  THE GOOD SHEPHERD is well worth the lengthy viewing; just make sure you have plenty of time to appreciate what it brings to the table.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B001ER4CSO|5.0|All I can say about this movie is about its format. Its a good movie in my opinion so enough said there. What I like is Motion Picture Companies know there are a wide group of people out there that preferr Full Screen to Wide Screen. Wide Screen is only good if you can afford Wide Screen TV's, Amazon.ca also seem to know this and they make it available both ways. Stores in my area like to let on some movies did not come out in Full Screen. Thats when I produce my copy and shoe them they are full of it. Hats off to the part of the industry that wants to sell their product to everyone. To the Companies that are to cheap to make copies of the film in both formats, its your fincial loss, cause Myself I try to avoid buying movies that will only come in wide screen.  I do have one question though concerning Blue ray. I recently purchase a DVD, HD-DVD and Blue ray combo player. I'm beginning to think it was a waste of money, because I refuse to waste my money in Blue ray movies if they are all a wide screen format. Has anyone been able to find a Blue ray movie in Full Screen that wasn't made ages ago. Got off the topic some did't I.
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|The best damn thing about this album is the song \\"I Will Be\\", which should have been on the original. It's one of the best songs I've ever heard. It's going to be played at MANY weddings.  The rest is what's expected from Avril, and it's a great ride. Just not as good as Let Go.  Remember... \\"I Will Be\\".
B001GQACGO|1.0|B-day was Okay but I am..Sasha fierce, No way.  Talk about a gimmick, splitting the album in half to make higher sales.  Shes already rich and her only concentration is more money?  What about Good Music?  Apparently that didn't even cross her mind.  She insulted her fans intelligence by thinking anything she puts her name on is gold.  Well let me remind you not everything that glitters is gold.  Im disgusted and will turn the channel when I see her face from now on.  Sasha fierce is a joke.  Video Phone makes her sound like a shallow pornographer skank.  I am appalled Beyonce, just completely repulsed. I am proud to say I didn't spend a penny on the album I downloaded it all for free ( and deleted it even from my recycling bin after listening to that trash), thank you lime wire!

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|My fun trip continues, I have been mostly lucky with my latest movie choices.<br />Here we have two American girls carousing in Spain and catching Bardem, this time in his charming incarnation, not as a crazy mass murderer. He is not hard to catch, neither is Scarlet. Her friend plays hard to get but is lost when the going gets tough. We pity her poor, mentally  underdeveloped American fiance. Bardem's ex-wife Cruz adds screeming European hysteria to the lovely light-handed fun about love and pretensions.<br />It seems to me, Woody Allen got it right with this satire on cultural stereotypes. Some of the situational comedy is just classy. The parallel in both girls' failed planned encounter with Juan Antonio: Scarlet is entirely willing to go for it, but has not counted on her stomach weakness after all the wine. Her friend is entirely willing as well, but nobody expected the jealous ex to show up with a gun and shoot her in the hand. Hard to explain to the new husband, but the poor sod buys anything. What else can he do.<br />Quite possibly the only entirely sane person in the story is Bardem's father, who refuses to learn English.

I am definitely putting the Guernsy on my travel wish list in hopes of meeting the inspirations of my friends.

B001MW0J2O|5.0|I've always made it a goal of mine in life to try something new when the opportunity presents itself. From my pre-teen samplings of Indian delicacies to my developing infatuation with high-definition television, I've consistently found that new experiences are truly the spice of life. Sure, there will always be missteps along the way, such as my ill-fated attempt to appreciate modern art and my disastrous foray into death metal, but it's the things you discover that make it all worthwhile.<br /><br />Animal Collective's latest album, Merriweather Post Pavilion, is just the kind of new adventure that I look forward to the most: the musical expedition into the unknown. I've treaded the Collective's path before; 2005's Feels was a psychedelic enigma that I tried desperately to get into but never really succeeded; for one reason or another, the lyrics always seemed a bit too obtuse and the music way too far out of left field to ever really grab me. Perhaps that was why I never gave 2007's Strawberry Jam a fair chance despite the oodles of critical acclaim, a decision I will surely re-think after listening to Pavilion. Again, Animal Collective has been showered with hyper-literate blogosphere praise and lauded for their experimental creativity, but don't mistake this for the same old hype for musicians who dare to be different: Merriweather Post Pavilion is for real.<br /><br />The first thing that makes itself fairly evident within the first few minutes of Pavilion is that Animal Collective have fully embraced the pop idiom that they have been flirting with on their last couple of records. Sure, opener \\"In The Flowers\\" rides along an otherworldly synth line and a chugging drum machine rhythm before coalescing into a carnival sideshow melody and the Collective's haunting vocals (all four members share vocal duties, but Avey Tare is the primary singer), but gone are the Collective's often off-putting vocal inflections of earlier records and the confusing musical frameworks that set them firmly apart as an \\"experimental\\" band. The climactic chorus of interlocked harmonies, threatening bass, and searing electronics is genuine, enjoyable pop.<br /><br />The band still throws conventional pop song structures to the wind, switching from verse to interlude to gloriously multi-tracked choruses seemingly at whim, but it's this sense of organized chaos that makes Merriweather Post Pavilion such a well-designed record. At 55 minutes, it's one of their longest yet, but one never gets the feeling that Animal Collective is just wasting space and sound. \\"My Girls\\" starts off with a space-y keyboard riff and vocals that come out of nowhere seemingly only to announce that \\"I only want a proper house / I don't care for fancy things\\" like some cosmic god of the family. It's only when the brilliant chorus comes in, complete with handclaps and unabashedly cheerful \\"yeaaahs\\" that the song reveals itself as a hauntingly affecting pop masterpiece.<br /><br />It's hard to think that Animal Collective could follow up the one-two punch of \\"In The Flowers\\" and \\"My Girls\\" with a consistent batch of songs to last the rest of the album, but they rarely fail to disappoint. There's the nearly tribal \\"Also Frightened,\\" which floats along on a detached electronica loop and vocalists Tare and Panda Bear's (yes, that's what he goes by) droning questions. The excellently unhinged \\"Summertime Clothes,\\" follows, perhaps the most accessible song on the record and easily the most entertaining, with its deliriously happy beat and Tare's drunken declarations of \\"I want to walk around with you / and be here with you.\\"<br /><br />No matter how many seemingly out-of-place dance rhythms are mixed with drug-induced guitar riffs or alien harmonies, Animal Collective never seem to lose their grip on the essential pop pulse of their songs. \\"Bluish\\" meanders all over the place throughout its five-minute-plus length, from a squishy synth line to seemingly random effects that sound culled from an ancient Nintendo game to a poppy outro stuffed full of unnecessary sounds and falsetto vocals, but in the end it comes off as just another wildly inventive song that, for all its wackiness, works on a record full of them.<br /><br />Despite what many blog powers may have you think, Animal Collective is not perfect. The problems here are few, but undeniable, most noticeably the ridiculously annoying ear-piercing synth riff that turns \\"Daily Routine\\" into perhaps the record's most obnoxious experiment. The mumbled spoken-word lyrics of \\"Lion in a Coma\\" lack any particularly intriguing beat to mask them, a surprise for a record that is nearly spot-on with its production and instrumental choices. And whatever you do, don't try to read too much into the lyrics: the Collective might have made their vocals more understandable, but aside from a few choice cuts such as the aforementioned \\"My Girls,\\" what Tare or Panda Bear say is largely inscrutable.<br /><br />Merriweather Post Pavilion is the kind of record that comes around only once in a long while. It's most assuredly not everyone's idea of a good time; it requires an open mind and a willingness to drop all preconceived notions of comprehensible music. It is assuredly a critic's record above everything else, not the kind of product that millions will be clamoring for anytime soon, but in their crazily convoluted vision of pop music Animal Collective have created a record that mixes and matches multiple genres while retaining their uniquely art-house sound and their all-important indie credibility. It's only been twenty days into 2009, but already Animal Collective have set a high-water mark in experimental pop that looks likely to stand for years.

B00000K31Q|5.0|I won't list the 10 things I love about this movie, but I can say that I love this movie. I have since I first saw it when it came out. I'm not one for mushy love stories, or chick flicks, which this movie does fall into. Nor am I a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie is just so fun you can't help but love it.<br /><br />It was the movie that introduced Heath Ledger to America and is a teen classic. It also stares Julia Stiles, who is no stranger to chick flicks, Larissa Olenik(from one of my favourite Nick shows The Secret World of Alex Mack) and a few other people we know pretty well.<br /><br />The movie is based on the play The Taming of the Shrew, but it's set in a high school which brings it home for many people, not just teens. The acting is pretty good for a teen flick, and the dialogue followable without relying too much on teenspeak. The ending is pretty much already known, but still rather cute.<br /><br />This is a classic. If you haven't seen it, you should.
B000W91RUG|5.0|My entire family (and a few friends) are hooked on the Big Bang Theory shows.  We wait for new ones to come out so we can share laughs and comments.  I purchased the first season as I was missing some episodes which had been deleted from my DVR files.  They are all now protected to prevent that from happening again.  We all enjoyed the first season so much, I gave two more out for Christmas. If anyone has not sat back and watched these nerdy nuts, I encourage them to do so.  Then they can laugh with us.  Enjoy!
B00005JLO2|3.0|I watched this because I'm a Heath Ledger fan and I wasn't all that happy with the film in total. I've never read the book, I didn't even know it was a book, but this film gave me no reason to want to read it. I felt it was a little boring. The plot was a bit silly to me even if it made sense. I felt the chemistry between Kate Hudson and Heath Ledger was 0. I felt his chemistry with the other actors was also 0. I don't think this was his finest work, even though he did well. I think the real star of this movie was Djimon Hounsou and I don't think that was supposed to happen.<br /><br />The movie was just too long for me. I felt it should have been shorter by about 30 minutes.<br /><br />The reason I give this a three is because I felt the cinematography was done really well. I really liked the different shots of the desert and the colour was done very well. Even though I didn't like the movie in plot and actors I felt that part was done extremely well.
B001MW0IY8|3.0|Let's start by saying that you either are going to love Antony's voice, or you are going to be seriously scared by it.  If you have not heard \\"I Am a Bird Now\\" or any of his other works, then prepare to be challenged by something completely different.  If you have heard \\"I Am a Bird Now\\", then prepare to be challenged by something very similar.      First, that voice--that wondrous, painful voice.  I think that I love it, but I have to listen to this album and his music in general when I am in just the right frame of mind, or I can't take it.  My wife can't listen to him at all. Antony sings in a high, wavery voice that comes on like a falsetto, but the more you listen to it, the less you are sure that it is a falsetto.  Could this simply be the range in which he sings? Whatever the verdict there, be certain that it is one of the most oddly cultivated singing voices ever to make an impact in music that can vaguely be termed \\"popular\\".  He has been compared to Nina Simone, and I sort of see it--but only based on his very mannered vibrato.  He does not have a wide range, but he is very expressive with the narrow range that he has; at least, if you regard \\"constantly seems to be about to dissolve into tears of despair\\" as \\"very expressive\\".      The music skirts the border between art songs and pop music written by very pretentious people.  Usually, he stays pretty firmly on the \\"art song\\" side of the line, but occasionally, the schmaltz overwhelms everything, and only your personal reaction to his voice will determine if it comes off as \\"bizarre genius\\" or \\"wha...???\\"  If you take the time to read his lyrics, they are often beautiful, confused musings on longing, becoming, love, and the lack thereof, but for me, the words are far secondary to the feeling, the emotion that is conveyed by this singer.  His performance of the songs is so laden with emotion that the words are definitely less important that simply allowing yourself to be surrounded by him on all sides.It is hard to review the songs one by one--the album is definitely a piece as a whole, but there are some standout moments.  \\"Aeon\\" starts with a typically pretty piano figure with a harp backing, but then changes with the addition of an arpeggiated chord on an electric guitar.  Antony seems to be the closest I have heard him to happiness as he sings \\"Oh Aeon! My baby boy! Oh, Aeon will take care of me\\".  What does it mean?  Who is Aeon?  Is it God?  As the song unfolds, I'm not sure if this is a plea for protection for himself, for someone else, or his father?  Anyway, Antony backs himself in a gospel choir of emotion, soaring into an ecstasy.  Pretty amazing song, I just wish I really knew what he was singing about.      \\"Dust and Water\\" has an almost Ladysmith Black Mambazo feel to it, although he sings solo.  Not an easy feat to accomplish.      The final song, \\"Everglade\\", finds Antony at his most poetic.  \\"When I'm floating in the water/And your eyes are lilies all around/When I'm lying sweetly in my bed/The sun plays crystal with my eyes\\", while woodwinds and strings form a lush backdrop.  Beautiful, with just a drop of \\"over the top\\" to the production.    This is actually a very difficult record to review because it is so hard to separate the songs themselves from the performance.  Antony is a true original (for better and for worse), and sometimes, in some moods, I love the courage and talent that he exudes.  I love his heart on his sleeve approach and his wounded butterfly vibrato.  But if I am not in just the right mood, that voice becomes grating, annoying, overly artificial.  If you can't get past his performance, you'll never be able to appreciate his songcraft.  His songs are beautiful, and it would be an interesting exercise to hear them performed by someone else, to see if someone else could draw out the same level of feeling and emotion, or if they are singable only by Antony.  I'd be hard pressed to think of someone who I'd want to try this exercise--perhaps Harolyn Blackwell?  Someone trained in Schumann lieder?  Or someone raw like Patty Smith?  I'm not sure.      If you loved his first two albums, you are going to love this.  He has grown somewhat, but he has not really changed his formula.  If you didn't like the previous collections, then this is not going to do anything to bring you into his fold.  If you, like me, are still trying to figure him out, then you will probably still be intrigued.  My one bit of advice is definitely to listen to a few sample tracks prior to buying this if you have never heard him before.  You'll thank me--either for introducing you to something lovely and new, or for saving you from making the worst musical investment of your life.
B001DHXT20|5.0|This movie was awesome. I can't believe it's a sequel. They usually tend to be less interesting than the first, but this time the sequel was way better. Edward Norton really is Bruce Banner. I really like him as an actor and he did a very good job in this one. Tim Roth was also really good in this movie too.<br /><br />I loved the special effects. They were awesome. The ending scenes were great. The \\"rage fight\\" was so good you could feel your heart pounding and mind racing. You almost felt like you were fighting yourself wondering what was going to happen, even though you knew the outcome.<br /><br />As far as superhero movies go this is one of the better ones.
B0015QWXN0|3.0|Tom Wolfe is a master storyteller in this gripping novel. I found it to pace at just the right tempo as well as being hard to put down. Never having experienced Mr. Wolfe before, his material seems a bit dated for today but the reader is still able to appreciate the machination of the legal/political situation in this book. I recommend it highly. Great ending, too.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|This movie is loosely based on the novel by Jules Verne and is even used in the movie in a few unique and interesting way. Staring Brenden Fraser and Anita Briem this movie is fun to watch, even if it's not what you expected. This movie, for me, was a bit light on the action I had expect there to be more of it. I also felt they could have used a bit more special effects. In that regard I felt the movie to be a bit bare like it was relying on something that just never showed up. But it's not a bad movie because of it. Just don't look for action galore. It's not that type of movie.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|2008 proved to be another busy year for critically acclaimed writer, director, actor, and producer Clint Eastwood. Earlier in 2008, Clint directed the gripping drama \\"Changeling\\" starring Angelina Jolie (\\"Wanted\\"); yet it was the second film Clint was involved with that year that garnered most of my attention. This film is none other than the recently released \\"Gran Torino\\", which Clint directed and also starred in, possibly in his final onscreen performance. Just like so many of his other films, \\"Gran Torino\\" is yet another instant classic from Clint Eastwood, a man of so many talents and a true living legend among Hollywood.    \\"Gran Torino\\" is the story of a Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), who despite his intense prejudices remains in the house he shared for so many years with his wife, even though the neighborhood has seen a vast influx of Asian-American homeowners. In spite of his disdain for his neighbors, Walt soon finds himself inadvertently saving the life of one of the local teenagers who is being threatened by an Asian gang after he failed to steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino. As hard as he tries to fight it, Walt begins to realize that perhaps he may have more in common with his Asian neighbors, despite their vast cultural differences and his pervasive bigotry, than he would ever care to admit.    As one of the most accomplished and iconic actors and/or filmmakers working in Hollywood, with numerous films to his credit, it's a wonder that Clint can still manage to make a film in which he actually may top himself. Yet, with his terrific performance in this film, I believe Clint has given us one of the best performances of his extremely successful career, if not the best. He imbues his character with such subtle nuances, and an irresistible grandfather-like quality despite his abrasive disposition that you can't help but like the guy; while at the same time, his mere presence on screen demands our attention and respect. I never believed any actor could make this kind of character so entertaining and likeable, but Clint figured out how to do it, and has succeeded brilliantly.    Speaking of performances, the supporting cast for \\"Gran Torino\\" was comprised of mostly newcomers to film. I'm referring to the actors chosen to portray the various Hmong characters that live in the neighborhood that Walt resides in. Leading these cast members are two fairly talented young actors Bee Vang (as Thao) and Ahney Her (as Sue), both of their characters' interactions with Walt serve as the primary crux on which the majority of the story rests. Surprisingly, Bee and Ahney do very well with their roles providing an authenticity to their struggle for acceptance in a culture that they don't fully understand and vice versa, while at the same time attempting to reach out to a man who has spent the majority of his life despising those who are different. The remainder of the supporting cast was not focused upon in the film nearly as much as the previous two, yet it would be a disservice to them to not mention that they all delivered very solid, and seemingly genuine performances to further enhance the richness of the overall film.    However, if I had to complain about anything in this movie, there is one performance that is weaker than the others. The one in question would be actor Bee Vang, who seemed a bit unsure of himself in places, and at times he would clearly over-emphasize a line reading, causing his character's dialogue to sound out of place with the other actor(s) in the scene. Although when all is said and done, if Clint Eastwood didn't have a problem with Bee's performance in order to make him change it, then who am I to judge.    A few moments back I mentioned that Clint Eastwood was one of the most accomplished actors and filmmakers in Hollywood, and that perhaps he has actually bested himself with his performance here in \\"Gran Torino\\"; yet, I never mentioned whether I thought his directing accomplishedthe same achievement. As refined as Clint's directing has become over the many years since 1971, when he first decided to step behind the camera, I don't know if I can say that \\"Gran Torino\\" is any better than his previous efforts from that perspective.    One thing that is for certain about Clint's directing, it's that he never shies away from hitting the audience hard with an emotional, visceral, or visual impact, and \\"Gran Torino\\" is no exception. In this respect he is uncompromising, which is undoubtedly one of the many attributes that has made him such a powerful directing force to be reckoned with over the last few decades. Even though he has the courage to go for the audience's gut, when lesser men would pull back out of fear that the audience may be turned off, Clint has come to the understanding that you don't always have to show everything for the full power of the moment to be felt in a scene; which is something that so many other directors would do well to take a lesson in from this living legend.    It's been rumored that \\"Gran Torino\\" marks Clint's final onscreen appearance, and that the remainder of his career will be served behind the camera. If that is true, then this is definitely a powerful curtain call from the actor, and one he should definitely be proud of.    \\"Gran Torino\\" is rated R for violence and language.

032147404X|5.0|This book was a great help, I'm a beginner in photography with some experience from taking graphic design in college. If your looking for a book of explanations on how to get the shot this book is not for you. If you want to learn in easy terms and how to get great shots without all the technical jargon that goes with it BUY this book immediately. Scott will show you a shot and then basically say ok set the F-stop to this, iso to this and point and shoot. He gives some great pointers on what equipment and includes price ranges e.x. if you have a lot of money go buy this, if your on a budget then you can get away with this piece of equipment. He will go over times of day, lighting and angles and points of view to increase you ability to take great shots and so much more. Definitely worth the price and will make you a better photographer whether its taking family photo's, selling stock photos or just a hobby.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale (American Psycho, Equilibrium, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight) is Trevor Reznik, a man who hasn't slept in a year. He is an incredibly gaunt figure, drifting through an increasingly hostile world of nightmare. We go along w/ Trevor as he goes to work, visits his prostitute friend, Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh from The Hitcher and Single White Female) hangs out at the diner w/ waitress, Marie (Aitana sanchez-Gijon), and generally plods through life. Bale captures the insomniac's desperate need for sleep perfectly. His infamous weight-loss only adds to the realism of his plight. He looks like a deranged scarecrow! Remember Pacino's character in INSOMNIA? Well, he was extremely fit and chipper compared to Reznik! I kept thinking that he should just eat a big sandwich and go to bed! I loved the bleak, CARNIVAL OF SOULS / JACOB'S LADDER atmospherics and faded look of THE MACHINIST. My favorite scenes are in the funhouse and the machine shop. If you have a taste for the bizarre, the mysterious, or the redemptive, then give THE MACHINIST a shot...  P.S.- Horror / sci-fi icon Michael Ironside (Scanners, Visiting Hours, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, etc.) is very good in his role as one of Reznik's fellow machinists named Miller...

0525478183|5.0|This book is written in a very enjoyable, witty style, but it also made my literally laugh out loud many times. The characters are interesting and well motivated. The story is about how we figure out who we are and how other people might be different from, and more complicated than, we might ever have figured. The writing is excellent -- you keep reading because you want to solve the mystery of Margo but also just because you want to spend more time with Quentin and his friends.

B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Okay, other than being one of the last remaining members of the human race to finally see this unbelievably fantastic movie, against ALL odd's it actually lived up to the incredible hype that preceeded it--which almost NEVER happens (at least not to ME). Allow me to explain: When the first Batman (with Michael Keaton) was released, by the time I finally saw it-some 3 months after it came out-the advance hype was SO high that other than enjoying Jack Nicholson, I rather disliked the film...and besides, if you want ME to accept the premise of a regular guy-as-a-superhero, honestly, you MUST be taller than ME in order to get me to swallow an actor as Batman (read: Keaton--and I actually like him otherwise).<br /><br />The sequel was horrific. The ONLY original Batman movie I tolerated was with Val Kilmer, and let's not even get into how bad the George Clooney disaster was...fast-forward to the release of Batman Begins and I fought against going to see it because my previous experiences with this particular superhero just wasn't good. I lost the fight and (very reluctantly) agreed to see it. Wow was I surprised. Part of that certainly may be the result of having such incredibly LOW expectations that even a half-decent movie would have been pretty good. Consequently, by the time the Dark Knight came out, and the near-mythic hype that accompanied the release, well lets just say there was a LOT to live up to.<br /><br />I wanted to see it in the theaters--I REALLY did...however my wife is NOT a fan of superhero movies...ANY of them. So we ended up seeing just about everything BUT the Dark Knight. I kept thinking, 'I'll go see it NEXT weekend...' but that never came to be. Eventually it left the big screen and came out on DVD and gratefully my son brought it home and I finally saw it. FINALLY!! But could it possibly live up the unbelievably HUGE amount of hype that I had read and heard about for almost 9 months straight? I braced myself for the worst--and yet I still expected it to be awesome. The major praise for the film coming almost exclusively on behalf of the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and hearing everyone speak of his performance in almost hushed, reverance and awe, saying stuff like Golden Globe and Oscar, made me even MORE skeptical. I mean, WHO thinks of roles like the Joker would EVER receive a nomination, let alone an actual win, huh? Besides, those types of roles simply aren't Academy Award material to begin with, right?<br /><br />WRONG. BIG time. Not only was Heath's performance jaw-droppingly good, but easily the best performance from ANY Batman film to date--including Jack Nicholsons. REALLY. And that's saying just ONE small part of this very well-made, violent thriller/drama. It almost re-wrote the book on superhero movie-making...on second thought, it DID. And the Joker is just one tiny part of what you have to love within this fantastic film. The story was clever and loaded with twists--some that were downright surprising, and some which just made me think: Oooh, that was cool.<br /><br />All I can say afterwards is basically this: Christopher Nolan proved me wrong--and I have never been so happy to admit it.

The major praise for the film coming almost exclusively on behalf of the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and hearing everyone speak of his performance in almost hushed, reverance and awe, saying stuff like Golden Globe and Oscar, made me even MORE skeptical. I mean, WHO thinks of roles like the Joker would EVER receive a nomination, let alone an actual win, huh? Besides, those types of roles simply aren't Academy Award material to begin with, right?    WRONG. BIG time. Not only was Heath's performance jaw-droppingly good, but easily the best performance from ANY Batman film to date--including Jack Nicholsons. REALLY. And that's saying just ONE small part of this very well-made, violent thriller/drama. It almost re-wrote the book on superhero movie-making...on second thought, it DID. And the Joker is just one tiny part of what you have to love within this fantastic film. The story was clever and loaded with twists--some that were downright surprising, and some which just made me think: Oooh, that was cool.    All I can say afterwards is basically this: Christopher Nolan proved me wrong--and I have never been so happy to admit it.

014062029X|4.0|For being written in 1886, this book felt surprisingly modern and completely engrossing. The twists and turns of Henchard's life enthralled me and though many of his actions proved him reprehensible, he was still somehow likable... Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works. Hardy is one of those classic authors that genuinely isn't a chore to read!
B001GCUNVW|5.0|The Wrestler    What a great movie- I heard they had this in the works for years and the director/ producer insisted on Mickey Rourke for the part even though he was considered damaged goods in Hollywood and too much trouble.  His work in this movie was totally believeable  and sadly convincing to those of us who never watched wrestling.  He should win the acedemy award he has been nominated for today
0743454537|5.0|Ah... this is the first Jodi Picoult book I ever read. I read it behind the counter at Books-A-Million and from there, I have bought and read (some of them even multiple times) the rest of her books.<br /><br />In re-reading her books, this one still stands out - it has the different voices of [[ASIN:0743431014 Songs of the Humpback Whale: A Novel]]... though it has a strictly chronological timeline which is pretty new. It follows her courtroom formula, but it comes off as less formulaic in this one somehow. The end, certainly memorable, still shocks - not with the force of the first time, but shocks nonetheless, which may discourage some readers. I think part of my fondness for this book is that it reminds me of the Lurlene McDaniel books that I read in grade school.
140191716X|5.0|I bought this book after experiencing a really rough day.  I went to the bookstore to change my environment and shift my energy; this was the first book that I picked up and emanated an energy that shifted my own. I had not even opened the book yet! So I proceed to open the book and randomly choose a selection, and of course, it was exactly what I needed at that moment.  Each selection is beautifully written, meditative, and thought provoking. I find reading these passages soothing, and the light colors and artwork are so precious.  I've since bought numerous copies as gifts, which are always met with delight!
006085880X|5.0|The first time I read this book, it was in one sitting. And even though I remembered more-or-less how it would end, it still made for an exciting read.<br /><br />It follows the time-skipping format, concluding in the same court room drama as [[ASIN:0743422449 Mercy]] and [[ASIN:0743496736 Nineteen Minutes]]. It is a very realistic novel and more true-to-heart and it's no coincidence that the cover of my copy advertises that it's going to be made into a Lifetime movie. I wonder if it ever did...<br /><br />It also introduces the recurring character, defense attorney Jordan McAfee who is quite likable in each of his sporadic appearances, especially his close relationship with his son.

0375842209|5.0|This is such a powerful and wonderful novel! Though targeted towards children, this WWII-set novel definitely touches on some adult issues, and will undoubtedly appeal to both young and old readers. It's both a moving and beautiful story set within the height of the Nazi regime in Germany. Death as narrator sets the book out of the \\"typical\\" young adult novels to share this setting, and it works so sell here. I have actually read it a few times now, and the novel provides a wonderful springboard for discussion, making it a wonderful choice for use in both classrooms and book clubs. It sounds strange to say, but upon re-reading it, I really savored the strength and beauty of Zusak's writing - that appeared all the more wonderful juxtaposed against the brutality of his setting. I am looking forward to reading more of this talented author's work!
B000ML11RI|5.0|The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. \\"Sin City\\" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes \\"Sin City,\\" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\\" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike \\"Sky Captain,\\" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three \\"Sin City\\" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is not quite a \\"Kill Bill\\" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. \\"Sin City\\" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler.

031606792X|3.0|Wow - I stayed up WAY too late to finish this conclusion in just one sitting, but I'm not sure that I can imagine having read it any other way! I really looked forward to finding out where the characters would all end up, and so I am just relieved that this turned out to be a very definitive conclusion. I don't know how Meyer could extend the series, so it will be interesting (and refreshing) to see what she writes next.<br /><br />As for this conclusion, well, it was a bit of a disappointment, unfortunately. This could be the result of the high hopes and all of the anticipation that had been building up for it, but it just didn't really seem to fit with the previous three books very well. Oh, it's still a relatively fun read, but the soap-opera-like drama quotient is simply off the charts here! Jacob's entire storyline, \\"Nessie\\" herself - \\"over-the-top\\" doesn't even begin to cover the level of ridiculousness the plot took! Although, I will say that this did make it quite unpredictable.. But I am not sure if that is a \\"good\\" kind of unpredictable, honestly. The sheer amount of new characters introduced here was rather shocking for a concluding volume, but it did add some interesting points. It was definitely entertaining, if nothing else. I enjoyed the shift from Bella's perspective, but it would be nice to see Meyer write from a different point-of-view than first-person for a change of pace...  I just wish that this story about sparkling vampires hadn't turned even sillier than it sounds!
B0017MO10U|4.0|There are several reasons to watch Continuum:<br /><br />Jack is back and gets `into it' with Baal.<br />We finally wrap the 10 year storyline of the System Lords.<br />General Hammond returns, but sadly in his final role.<br /><br />Baal changes time to a degree where the Stargate program never got started, the Gate is lost and this opens the door to the Goauld invasion.  Our heroes, with the earlier timeline in their memories (somehow??) fail to convince their counterparts in this timeline until it's practically too late.  Can Tealc be counted on?<br /><br />Edge of your seat suspense - great Air Force jet shots.  This story would almost be a regular episode but the production values are superior to what I've seen on SciFi Channel.<br /><br />Great special effects, space battles and a somewhat twisty time-travel storyline brings the gang together for one final leap in the Stargate universe.<br /><br />I really hope they bring back more movies.  I hear there's a new spinoff which is written by the same guys who wrote Stargate SG-1.

0440241901|4.0|The chick lit genre is often so hit or miss, that even though I picked this one up at the used bookstore, I was still a little nervous that I wouldn't enjoy it. But my worries were completely unfounded! I had a great time reading this cute and funny read. It was fast-paced and just super entertaining. No, it's not terribly thought-provoking, or terribly unique, but it's entertaining and the characters are lively and sympathetic. I'm looking forward to enjoying another one of her books!

0385340990|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I didn't want to read this book.  I didn't like the title and didn't like the letter format.  However, my new book club chose it and I was forced to read it, for which I am grateful. It is a wonderful book that will stay with you for a long time.  In addition, I can let my 14 year old daughter read it - can't wait to see if she likes it as much as I did.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Bought the \\"Mama Mia! The Movie\\" Two Disc Special Edition for my wife and she loved it. I ended up watching it with her and was also please with the product.  Aside from being a Meryl Streep fan, the movie is entertaining, full of energy, has great music and was not as much of a \\"chick flick\\" as I might have suspected.  All in all a good little film.  I am happy with my purchase in all respects.
0812550757|1.0|This was quite a let down from Ender's Game.    It is much more of a discourse on the author's bizarre metaphysical views than anything else.  Xenocide (the sequel to this) is even worse in that regard.    If you enjoyed Ender's Game, don't let this or the other sequels detract from that experience.
0061684384|5.0|All the other reviews are spot on. I would like to comment on the actual BOOK (construction) itself, as well as some of the content.    I, being un-inked (but now am considering a small piece), was surprised at how good Kat's show was when I first started watching it during the first show, the first season. I'm hooked, and plan to watch until it isn't made anymore.    How could anyone so young be so ... what's the word I'm grasping for? ... \\"together\\"?!    This young woman is absolutely AMAZING! She dumped herself out onto her kitchen table, sorted thru everything, then plunked it into this book. She is what she seems and nothing else, yet she's multi-faceted and super talented.    She found her passion at a very young age and has never let go of it. (Go Kat!) Yes, it has transformed/morphed into different versions throughout her young lifetime, but it's STILL THERE.    To me it seems as if Kat was meant to be famous. She thinks nothing of it, yet utilizes it to help others. She's selfless and caring yet this book doesn't brag, it just informs. She's respectful (and in awe) of her colleagues, yet happy to be at the level of excellence she's currently at while continually honing her skills.    The artwork showcased in this book doesn't stop at the individual tattoo artist's work ... no! The beauty of the book ITSELF is mind-blowing!    Each and every detail was carefully considered. It is a classy printed version of (what seems like) a handmade scrapbook.    The cover is padded hardcover. Believe it or not, the book actually feels like it BELONGS sitting in your hand!    Each page is printed to look old and worn, and the printing goes all the way to the edge. The illustrated capital letter on almost every page is gothic, yet elegant and beautiful (calligraphers rejoice!). The calligraphy interspersed throughout is breathtaking. The photos are clear, sharp, crisp, like you are actually looking at the person's skin.    All of the background history is short and sweet,easy to read, yet multi-dimensional. Not one bit of info included could be considered useless.    The intro and outro were obviously handwritten in red ink by Kat with her favorite pen (corrections and all).    The forward by Nikki Sixx ... WOW! This guy gets her. He's got the gift of words. And it's very cool to see the artwork Kat did on him.    I pre-ordered it and got it very quickly (Thanks Amazon!). I have read it all the way thru twice now (in only 2 days), and have shown things to my husband (who doesn't like to read) and he has read a lot more of it than I thought he would. And, no, he's NOT just looking at the pictures!    I have a nice place reserved for this book on our coffee table - and I guarantee that the faux distressing of the pages won't be faux for long!    Kat, if you are reading this, THANK YOU. What a beautiful piece of artwork to grace our home, as well as a heartfelt autobiography! And who knows ... I may make the trip from NJ to LA to acquire my very first tattoo! Congratulations, and best wishes for your continued success.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This breathtaking classic of American film-making frames Francis Ford Coppola as one of the all-time great cinematic craftsmen.<br /><br />Having inexplicablyl missed out on this piece of Americana at the time of its popularity, this reviewer bought the three-film set in time to finish it just after his fiftieth birthday. It was worth the wait.<br /><br />This epic saga of a mob family that cannot escape the burden of honor no matter how hard it tries (or, at times, fails to try) does not glorify gangsters or their ways. To the contrary, we grow to pity Michael Corleone for the centuries-old Sicilian trap into which he has unwittingly fallen.<br /><br />Along the way, gorgeous cinematography delights both eye and ear even as it saddens the soul. The Corleone family, and Michael in particular, passes through the various autumns of their fate en route to the ignoble demise of Il Padrino in his sunlit chair. He is old, bereft, and apparently forgotten.<br /><br />It is a quite splendid sadness that this trilogy leaves in its majestic wake. Evil is not so much a roaring lion as the end game of a thousand small decision, any one of which might have changed the game. Alas, none did.<br /><br />With inexorable, unforgiving and unforgiven beauty, autumn begets winter.
B00004RF9I|5.0|If you missed this one, it's time to see it.  The boob-tube population needs to understand that they are being brainwashed by relying on the corporate media for entertainment and news.  The corporate media are not your friends.  Listen to what this network executive has to say, and turn off the damn TV.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is fun for all ages.  I love that it has very few rules to learn.  It requires strategy, but also relies on moves made by other players.  This interaction is the real fun.  My grandson (14) said he had played it at school and loved it.  I highly recommend the game for family fun.
B0012GN31O|4.0|I agree this is a great album.  Jazzy, lively, enjoyable by all who love a mix of Latin and Jazz.  However, I must say I'd prefer less horns and more piano playing.  That's why I bought a Michel Camilo album, for the piano not the drums or horns.  I liked the Camilo/Tomatito album more.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Whenever I watched the theatrical version of the Two Towers, it always seemed to be missing something. It was just a bridge from the Fellowship of the Ring to the Return of the King.  I still liked it (I'm a huge Middle-Earth fan), but I would have rather watched the first or third movies in the trilogy.  I got the extended edition of the Two Towers for Christmas, and now having seen it, I'm thrilled! It isn't just a bridge anymore, but a full-fledged part of the trilogy! It's 40 minutes longer, with some of the new scenes fans of the book will recognize being Frodo and Sam's scene with the elvish rope; a hilarious expansion on Legolas and Gimli's \\"score-keeping\\"; and an insightful flashback scene that elaborates on Faramir, Boromir, and Denethor's relationship - the biased father, the honored and loyal first-born who cares for his brother, and the unfortunately ill-fated, paternally oppressed younger son.    Having read the book twice, I was delighted to rediscover these memorable scenes, which make the old bridge of the trilogy a completely awesome movie.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|With its self-sacrificing mother character who works her fingers to the bone for an ungrateful child, \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is in many ways the quintessential 1940's \\"women's picture\\" I thought it would be.  But I happily discovered that it's a bang-up, tough, and pretty stylish film noir, too, complete with murder mystery.  And it's all based on a classic James M. Cain novel, another happy discovery.<br /><br />The guns, gowns, and shadows of \\"Mildred Pierce\\" look great in this sharp Warner Brothers DVD, which is also packed with a variety of interesting extra features.  These include a terrific collection of trailers of other classic Joan Crawford films, as well as a generous documentary on Ms. Crawford's career, that- at almost an hour and a half in length- is like getting a whole second feature on the DVD.<br /><br />If you enjoy discovering or re-discovering (I did the former in this case) classic Hollywood films on DVD, you can't go wrong with \\"Mildred Pierce\\".
B001DU8T6S|4.0|I saw these guys a few years ago at the DCU center in Worchestor, Ma. They were great because they did not try to sound like the \\"new\\" Queen. They were who they said they were: Queen + Paul Rodgers. They show was fantastic. Fast forward to a studio album today and you will find (drum roll please) Queen + Paul Rodgers. This is Probably the best album they could make at this time. I will not bore you with a track by track review because you will find that some great and some are better than others. My only grip with this album is the credits. Who played what? I can hear them singing. I can hear Mr. May's wonderfull guitaring all through out the CD but is the rest a bunch of studio musicans like the later Pink Floyd without Roger Waters? It is the only reason this getting 4 stars. If you are a Queen, Bad Co, or a Free fan, you can not go wrong with this.
1416562605|3.0|Regardless of your opinion of the final text, you can't help admiring Aravind Adiga the almost insane ambition of his first novel. To begin with, it's epistolary, a form that hasn't been in style since the turn of the 18th century. Next, the letters are written by a classic \\"unreliable narrator,\\" summoning immediate comparison's to Nabokov's Pale Fire [and John Lanchester's tragically underrated Debt to Pleasure.] Then, as if that wasn't biting off enough, Mr. Adiga makes his protagonist the poor driver of a rich family, one member of which he ends up killing, invoking quite intentional comparison to Richard Wright's Native Son. Okay, okay, I hear you saying, that's already more than he could possibly chew. But, wait! There's more! Beyond all the formal and stylistic choices, Mr. Adiga apparently intends the book to be an incisive social criticism of modern India's chaotically entrepenuerial culture, a la Dickens or Zola. Got all that?<br /><br />The resulting book has been widely praised in the West and won the Man Booker prize. But it has been less welcome in India where the author, though a native son himself, is considered something of an outsider these days, his family having emigrated to Australia, where he went to high school, and having then gone off to both Columbia and Oxford for his subsequent education.<br /><br />When we gather all these various strands together we can begin to see why the novel is ultimately a tad too incoherent for its own good. The letters that make up the chapters of the book are written over the course of seven nights by Balram Halwai, a Bangalore businessman who--for no discernible reason--has decided to relate the story of his rise from poverty to Wen Jiabao, the premier of the People's Republic of China. You'll hardly need reminding that the addressee is the first among equals in a dictatorial regime that oppresses a billion people. Balram's stated identification with such a monster might be said to be less appalling because he's so ignorant about what life in China is actually like, but that leaves us with a choice between a narrator who's a Maoist or a dunce.<br /><br />Meanwhile, as is generally the case where an unreliable narrator is involved, Balram is a murderer and a psychopath. As Scientific American informs us:<br /><br />  First described systematically by Medical College of Georgia psychiatrist Hervey M. Cleckley in 1941, psychopathy consists of a specific set of personality traits and behaviors. Superficially charming, psychopaths tend to make a good first impression on others and often strike observers as remarkably normal. Yet they are self-centered, dishonest and undependable, and at times they engage in irresponsible behavior for no apparent reason other than the sheer fun of it. Largely devoid of guilt, empathy and love, they have casual and callous interpersonal and romantic relationships. Psychopaths routinely offer excuses for their reckless and often outrageous actions, placing blame on others instead. They rarely learn from their mistakes or benefit from negative feedback, and they have difficulty inhibiting their impulses.<br /><br />So what are we left with here? A novelist whose personal knowledge of daily life in India we have reason to question, and a narrator who not only would be uninterested in the society around him anyway, but who is either a communist or an imbecile to boot. And yet we're supposed to take seriously the indictment of Indian culture that follows? I don't think so.<br /><br />Balram is an amusing enough guide that the book is enjoyable for awhile, but such an unpleasant creature under the veneer that he wears thin. The psychopath may fool you initially, but when you figure him out you ought to bail on the relationship. And when tells you that it was all the fault of others that he is what he is, you ought not necessarily believe him. Especially when there are a billion Indians who aren't killing their bosses to get rich quick.<br /><br />Fittingly enough, there is an alternative reading available to us which reconciles these problems and effectively squares the circle. Just as Pale Fire offers a hilarious send-up of Literary Criticism (see link to review above), so could White Tiger be read as a brilliant parody of the anti-globalization Left. After all, when you put people's words in the mouths of psychopaths, you are suggesting something about the quality of the ideas, are you not?e to us which reconciles these problems and effectively squares the circle.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is a fantastic movie from almost every perspective.  Christian Bale is an excellent Batman, but the real fun comes from Ledger's brilliant interpretation of the psychotic Joker.  The Blu-Ray edition is worth ever penny.  You will not be disappointed.

B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld is not my typical pick when I choose a movie to watch, but fortunately for me, it was used in a writing class I took a couple of years ago, so I had to go out and rent it.  I loved it!  The conflict, while comfortingly familiar (vamps vs. werewolves), is presented with great twists rendering it refreshingly different than the bloodfest movie I thought it would be.<br /><br />I love the characters, the mystery, and the cultures created around these two enemy races.  The main characters are flawed, yet prevail.  And what could be better than a little romance mixed in with the monsters?  The sequel wasn't quite as good, but was still enjoyable.  I'll be in line at the movie theater when the third installment is realeased later this year.
031606792X|5.0|My 18 year old sister in law begged me to read the Twilight Saga.  I originally told her that I did not like teenage stories but she explained that it was more than just teenage problems.  So I read the first book and thought WOW what a great story.  I went on to read the second book New Moon and threw down the book after the first 100 pages (where ever it is when Edward leaves her).  I was so upset that Edward left, even though I knew the reason why.  I really enjoyed the ending of New Moon than I did the middle because of Jacob.  I just can not seem to like him all that much.  I did like the parts where Bella was doing the wild and crazy things and Edward in her mind kept talking to her.  I was really hoping that Edward had a mind link to her and was actually talking to her, but I was mistaken.  The third, Eclipse was okay, I really enjoyed the areas where Edward was really proving to Bella that he would not leave and we also learned of his \\"old fashion\\" background.  I can really appreciate that.  I thought it was endearing when Edward to Bella he was trying to protect her \\"virtue\\" as well as his own.  Now for Breaking Dawn... again WOW!!!  The wedding, honeymoon and subsequent pregancy and conversion had me glued to the pages for hours.  I knew eventually Bella would become a vegetarian vampire but my question was when and I like how this turned out.  Edward never wanted Bella to be \\"like him.\\"  So following Carlisle Cullen's footsteps, he saves her by turning her into a vampire at the doorsteps of death.  I don't want to go into too much detail but I have read many Trilogies, Saga and so on and most of them left me feeling as if something is still not taken care of, someone is still left with a problem and etc.  The Twilight Saga I thought ended very well with everyhing answered except for the vision of the Volterre of Alice, Edward and Bella joining him.  May this is a new series with old beloved friends????
0307346617|5.0|I just finished reading World War Z. Then I came on and see some of the bad reviews, because I had a couple little things I think could have been done better. This is the first Zombie book I've read, but I've seen all the George Romero and remakes. The Resident Evil, and 28 days later... all the sequels so far.     There are so many movies about the OUTBREAK and dead suddenly attacking, I found I liked movies that dealt humanity dealing with a world overwhelmed by zombies, and this book actually covers all three parts... the outbreak, the dealing with the zombies, and the \\"victory\\" over the zombies... or is there?     These nickpicks are talking about \\"voice\\", do they realize the whole book is written in the INTERVIEWERS perspective. So the \\"author\\" is just recording what the people are saying in the interview, not be able to give personal voice, it's not that individual who is writing the story, it's the interviewer.    This book is about an interviewer who went all over the world to interview people after the end of the war with the Zombies. This book reads like accounts of a war, the difference is the army is of Zombie.    The book starts with where the virus came from, and different ways it spread, then it went into stories of various types of people around the world and what various countries did or didn't do to Quarantine people.     Then it goes to various ways to kill zombies. Because it's more about killing the brain, because anyone who has seen George Romero movies that even removing the head from the body, the brain could still tell his head to bite. (Recall Day of the Dead where the scientist is examining them, and one of the zombies was a head and still trying to bite?)    The last part of the book is about how people deal. Humanity has been slaughter and there is hope and hopelessness. The difference between someone who only has so much fight in them, and others with the strength to persevere.    Here are some of my slight gripes about the book: The author is trying to tell a story through these interviews, but none of the people are linked together, there wasn't a connection to pull the book into a large story, it was more of a connect the dots. The thing is you have to READ the stories, then when you get to the next one you get a mention of something and you go \\"oh yeah that was mentioned in the last story\\", though some are a bit hard to connect.      Also I felt that some of the stories didn't tell enough, sure you can try to make up in your head what happened to these people. In some cases it was good, and others left me scratching my head about why they would end at that point. Alot of the stories were believable, usually when killing humans, you aim for the heart and most high tech military kills that way which made it ineffective against the Zack(the Zombies) I can believe governments and military can screw up, and I could DEFINITELY see someone coming up with a faux cure for the Zombie plague, and profiting big off it.    One of the complaints was about the Japanese story, the kid who lives on the internet. They seem to think that just because he found a samurai sword and went out hacking apart zombies. I didn't see any mention of that, especially in the other story where the blind man subdues him pretty easy.    I think the people who didn't like this book were a)going into thinking it's going to suck (then why the hell did you read it anyway?) b) had something personal against Max Brooks writing style in the past, or c)wasn't reading the stories well. and finally d)expecting a typical novel.    The title tells it all \\"World War Z\\", you didn't think there would be military involved in the book? The summary tells that it's about ACCOUNTS of people interviewed.    If this is a book that you expect to be a novel about someone else surviving a zombie plague, then this book isn't for you. If it's a book that you don't want to think about, this book is probably not for you. If you want a book that tells several short stories and you really have ti think about how they are connected, pick it up and read it.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|First of all, let me say that I'm a 20-something married male with two children so I'm sure I don't represent the normal demograph or target audience for this album.  My wife received the album for Christmas and it just so happened to get left in my car.  One day I decided to pop it in, as I enjoy many kinds of music and thought I'd give it a try.    Taylor is a genuine talent; able to sing well and utilize her vocal strengths to create memorable hooks but also a gifted songwriter.  I must say that every track on this album is well done.  I don't get the impression of any kind of \\"junk\\" or \\"filler\\" tracks here.  A good mix of slower and faster tempos and each song is really about the joys and disappointments of teenage life and love.  I found myself transported back to a simpler time for myself as I listened to the songs; lyrics are modest and well-written.  The underlying music is mixed well and creates nice emotional moments which often reflect the heart of the song.  One example is Track 9 \\"You're Not Sorry.\\"  The strings and piano in the song create a real sense of resentment and loss.  This album gets more playtime in my car than any other album at the moment.  I'm excited to see where Taylor's future will lead.
0767802470|5.0|This is the best submarine movie made. More realistic than the clean U S sub movies. The sub is cramped, dirty, smelly.  The crew is terrified.  Depth charges don't make their day.
B00138H28Q|5.0|When I first heard this album in 1978/79 for the first time I knew it was a work of art. I was 18/19 and part of the \\"Rock n Roll Animal\\" crowd. Being a musician myself and also involved in the drug scene and having just had a hard breakup with a girlfriend, I was able to relate to the concept of this album. I don't think any other album as a whole has had that affect on me since. There are songs that I relate to but to have a whole record speak to me at where I was at at that time was amazing. Most of my friends thought it was rubbish but I knew it wasn't. I found a copy of it in a thrift store and bought it immediatly. It was in excellant condition, no suprise, and am hoping to find it on CD soon since all that is available here is the mp3 of it.
0800141660|5.0|I received the product in a very quick amount of time. The actors in this movie were great,especially the three main actors.The story was well done and done with excellent attention to detail and in good taste. Emma Thompson Always does a great perfomance of her roles. It is always a treat to watch an expert at work!
B000002QWD|5.0|My mother had this album (an actual record).  I found this on casette for her and we enjoyed many Christmas' being serenaded by Bing.  My mother died last year and I as I was facing my first Christmas without her I wanted to recreate some of her Christmas traditions for our family.  One of them was the Christmas music she played each year.  I was unable to locate this album on CD at any of the music stores.  I went online to Amazon and was able to order it and receive it in time to play during the Christmas season.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Don't jump to the ceiling yet, don't get up into the sky. That's not the film of the next century, nor decade. That's not even the comedy of the present decade. It is just a decent comedy, romantic, sentimental and happy to the highest uppermost acme of what we can conceive as a happy ending. In fact the structure is Shakespearian to the very detail in every scene. \\"As You like It\\" is the model and here we are even nearly modest, shy about the happy ending. Shakespeare managed to have four marriages at the end of his play, and he will do it again at the end of his \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\". Here we have only two couples who find their happy ending in England, because frankly such a thing cannot happen in Los Angeles the country of fake make-believe. The real stuff can only happen in the depth of Surrey, with a cow in the back garden and a tent in the girl's bedroom. But it is funny and at the same time it is slightly ironically critical of what Hollywood has become in its superficial illusionary virtual reality based on special effects and canned sentiments and roles, when it is not preserved music that comes out of the brain of an elevator, even if the British may call that a lift that can lift your fat, flesh and bones but will never lift, not to speak of elevating, your artistic and musical senses. And to prove his point, the director, though I should say directress to be accurate even if that is not politically correct and I cannot use a word like directing person that has not yet succeeded to escalator-ize itself up to the tip of my tongue, has a cameo of an aging Dustin Hoffman appearing in the aisles of a DVD store in the background of \\"The Graduate\\" where he was a juicy short student looking for the way to lose his maidenhead or should I say bachelor-head between the legs of a ripe woman. Maybe Hollywood might be becoming in the coming decade realistic and more human, closer to real life, probably under the influence of the competition that is already simmering in India, in China, in Asia in general, and in Europe of course, though Europe is still bogged up in the mud of the tradition of cultural protectionism which is nothing but the impotence in front of the challenge that comes from outside. A funny film and a question at the end: how in hell are they going to fly a cow from London's Heathrow Airport to Los Angeles International Airport? I guess Air France will volunteer since they are the European specialist of the air-lift of all kinds of cattle in between two strikes when the passengers are treated by the striking personnel as samples of the valueless cattle that deserves nothing  but being sent to the local slaughterhouse to get out of the way of their resistance to change and restructuring, just before the company is bought up by Air China or Aeroflot, now Russian millionaires are buying newspapers in France, and elsewhere.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesering in India, in China, in Asia in general, and in Europe of course, though Europe is still bogged up in the mud of the tradition of cultural protectionism which is nothing but the impotence in front of the challenge that comes from outside.

0767830555|5.0|Before Fight Club, before Blade Runner, before any of the nihilistic urban-decay movies there was Taxi Driver. I'm not going to lie- there's a lot about Taxi Driver that feels very '70s. But about halfway through the movie, in a scene with practically no dialogue, DeNiro and Scorsese supercede time period and genre to make what can only be described as movie poetry.    DeNiro is perfect as Travis Bickle, a hyper-alienated borderline sociopath, a psycho who never noticed his descent into madness. He rides around the city all night, and as all his attempts at human connection fail, he obsessively looks for purity in a depraved world, first with a young political aid, later a 12-year old prostitute. The prostitute, Iris, is played with remarkable candour by a young Jodie Foster.    Travis is simultaneously at home in the squalor of his city and violently disgusted by it. Does it change him into something human or something monstrous? There are no easy answers. But in the end, we are as taken with Travis as he is with his two loves. Taxi Driver is terrifying and fascinating, at times bizarrely funny, at times chilling, always brilliant.

That's reason enough to give this one a try
B00005R0W6|5.0|I dont know what happened with the other reviewer, he obviously didnt get the right cd that is listed here.  I purchased this cd when it was released while i was living in Japan at the time(military).  The disc go in chronological order from albums releases.  Starts with the biggest hits from catch a fire on up.  The first disc pretty much is like the album legend.  The second disc though is why i bought this album.  Just for the rare ending track \\"who colt the game\\" which was not released on the United states version.  I dont know if its worth paying 60 dollars, still a great cd though.

B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I am such a fan of these type of movies.  I long for that time so long ago when things were still so easy and not so fast paced as they are now a days.  Kiera Knightly was so so good in this movie as well as all the other actors.....A great movie to add to anyones collection....
B0015I2P0Y|2.0|All the scenester magazines (and you know who you are) are going crazy with this album. Giving it 5-stars / 9 out of 10 / etc. But truthfully this album is not that good.<br /><br />I liked Elbow's last two albums. True, it takes a few listens to get use to the lead singer's voice. And yes, Elbow isn't the type of band to put out an album that will get any radio play or have a hit song. With that in mind, one must understand that this is not going to be an album that you put on before going out or celebrating. One must slowly appreciate the subtleties and musicianship of this good band.<br /><br />With that being said, this album has done nothing to improve themselves from their previous two albums. The album is extremely boring and doesn't have any catchy songs, beats, or lyrics. I tried listening to it while cooking and at work but I quickly got irritated and just wished that the album would end. It's quite annoying at times and it's pretty much re-hashed (but not as good) stuff from their last two albums. Trust me and not the \\"so-called\\" music critics and pass on this album. Their last two albums will suffice you for now. Hopefully Elbow can improve on their next album - give us something catchy and/or different.

1582701709|2.0|I read this in 15 minutes in the bookstore, and the book is basically the old witchcraft/magic spiel wrapped in a trendy cover.  The law of attraction?  This is exactly the same as the 'if you want for it hard enough, it'll come, magic crap you can find anywhere on the internet.  The most annoying thing about this version of it, is that the author brings up all these famously successful people and geniuses and claims that they followed the rules she lays down in the book.  Whatever, Rhonda.
B000JBWWBK|4.0|Marc Streitenfeld did a good job in selecting Harry Nilsson's three songs for the soundtrack of this movie. Streitenfeld also wrote good music that could be grouped in three independent compositions, but he opted for mixing parts and pieces from these three possible songs. I recognize and applaud Streitenfeld's ability to re-group the music in a way that resulted in three new compositions, that ended up having a certain identity, even though they were built out of three very different and distinctive themes. Perhaps, Streitenfeld wanted to do something more experimental and raise himself to the level of Harry Nilsson. Now I will have to buy a piece of software to remix Streitenfeld's material in my computer.

Several emails through Amazon to Media King with absolutely NO RESPONSE! I've spoken with others who have had similar experiences with this reseller. The only reason there is a star on the rating is I felt it was necessary to get to this point in the review process. If I could delete the star I would.

Can she solve those problems and still be a good dancer? Find out in this movie which also stars Zac Efron, Queen Latifah, John Travotla, and many more. Hairspray is a truly good musical.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It's hard for me to believe you that you can get a good workout in just 20 minutes, but it definitely is possible with this. I work out a good bit, so I thought I could just jump into level two, but I had to go back and start at level one! It is a great workout, especially when you don't have a lot of time to workout and the moves are not complicated and she explains them well. Great for all workout types and ages. Be ready to feel it the next day!
B000002UB6|5.0|Regardless of what the critics have said of this album, I have always liked it.  I recommend it for everyone.  My favorite track - For You Blue - is a great George Harrison song.  And while the Get Back on this album is not the Get Back released as a single, you can barely tell the difference.  I have always liked the Beatles - great musicians able to play multiple instruments and excellent writers and wordsmiths.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The HBO mini-series John Adams is an excellent telling of the award winning book by historian David McCullough.  Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are exceptional as John and Abigail Adams.  The series is as much about our early years as independent nation as it is about their personal relationship.  John could not have been John without his ballast and chief counsel, Abigail.
0312330537|4.0|This book is worth reading but unfortunately I can't say it's a classic.  The main character's transformation begins and then stalls and then ends up completely unconvincing.  I loved the first half of the book; the sights and smells and sounds of Colaba Causeway and Leopold's and Sassoon Dock and the zhodapatty alone make picking up this book worthwhile.  And the way he sets the stage for the second half of the book is very compelling.  But then the plot disintegrates into a mishmash of violence and male bonding and gangster fitness.  I'm going to tell my wife, who is half-Indian and loves to read books about modern day India, especially ones that involve cross-cultural figures like Lin, that this thing is way too violent.  On the other hand, if you think you're an expert on India after watching Slumdog Millionaire, you're going to love this book.
B001F12J0C|4.0|The sad truth is, I only got into this whole Bourne craze last year...I didn't even see Ultimatum! Of course, my cousin thought that was absolutely crazy so she forced me into having a Bourne marathon with her.<br /><br />And I absolutely, positively, LOVED it. And when I absolutely LOVE something, I HAVE to buy it.<br /><br />It's a real treat to be able to have all three movies together in a little set you can pick up and watch whenever you like. All the original extras for each movie are included so that's a bonus.<br /><br />But why only four star? Well, I was slightly disappointed with the packaging of this boxset. For those who were wondering, there are no \\"bonus\\" features for this boxset - it's basically a hard paper case with three slim DVD cases, each containing one disc, which has the widescreen version of the movie with extras. As one reviewer previously mentioned, if you're looking for posters, cards etc., this won't satisfy you.<br /><br />The only thing I'm worried about is...what am I gonna do when the fourth Bourne movie comes out on DVD? Will they release another boxset? Will my love for Bourne make me buy that one too? Haha, we shall see...

055358202X|1.0|I was lent Game of Thrones by a friend and avidly read it, cried at the death of Ned and cheered at the fate of Dany's brother and was gripped by Dany's discovery of dragons. I finished the book in less than three days and returned it to my friend, I then borrowed the rest of the series. I sped through books two and three and finally settled down to read this one.     I was brought up short. The pace had disappeared, most of the characters had disappeared and instead I was treated to yet another batch of characters and situations, all of which were recognisable from the prior books. The Iron Islands invading.. Well how dull.. 'A woman can't rule! Your place is in bed!' YAWN. And numerous nasty characters plotting to 'rob, rape, murder' etc other characters who are also planning to rob, rape, murder them.    Brienne's trek through the wasteland was dull and the only bit of time she got to fight was ruined because Martin shortchanged her in order to 'capture her'. Far from the 'strong girl' described earlier in the books, she is easily knocked to the ground when charged. I would have accepted her being mobbed, but knocked down in a head on rush by Biter seemed forced. In that situation she would have been trained to lower her sword and allow him to rush onto the blade, but instead she was bowled over and bitten.     Cersei went from being the intelligent manipulator seen in book 1 to a vapid paranoid idiot and all of her chapters could have been chopped down to one.    Dorne.. It was the first visit and completely unneccesary. We knew about the situation from talk in prior books why did we have to go there purely to watch a knight shag some bird and fail to place Mrycella in power. Again it was pointless.    The Iron Islands... felt like a 'been there..done that'. Oh someone knows how to take Dany's dragons after a long period of 'I want to be queen!... You can't be queen because a woman must squeeze out babies.. I want to be king.. No I want to be king...I'm King andI killed my wife' YAWN.. Seen it in the rest of the series, felt just the same.    Arya... why wasn't there more of you?    Sam.. WHY OH WHY? Why was Sam here? There was a some nonsense about Gilly and babies and Master Aemon, but once again any point of those chapters is lost in Sam feels sick, Gilly cries, Sam cries and wets himself ad nauseum.    Sansa.. Interesting but again the chapters got lost amongst the dross.    Jaime.. Was he even doing anything in this book apart from whining and lusting futilely after his sister.    It was filler.. Pointless unnecessary filler. I believe that Martin has completely forgotten how he wants to finish this series. This move onto other characters smacks of a complete loss of control with the text. He doesn't know what to do with the characters now he's put them in these positions, he doesn't know how to tie the threads anymore so he's rambling about other places in order to continue the gravy train.    I was loving this series but this book has completely disappointed me.

B0017HPHBM|5.0|This is how I was rewarded for waiting. I'd been itching to buy Batman Begins on DVD ever since it came out but 1) I was broke at the time and 2) I prayed that there would be a special release for it.<br /><br />Well, they didn't disappoint.<br />This Batman Begins release comes in a very case that has a holographic cover. It comes with a USB drive (small memory though), a CD that contains teaser material for The Dark Knight, \\"movie cash\\" to see The Dark Knight (though it's probably long expired for those who want to purchase it now), along with several postcards.<br />If bonus goodies isn't what you're looking for (really?!), then you'll be pleased just with the 2-disc release. It is really loaded with extras, presented in a comic-book-form menu. I actually did not fall asleep during these extras; they were very fun to watch, with commentary from the cast and crew.<br /><br />Don't know what else to say except...if you're still looking to buy this amazing reboot of the Batman franchise, don't let this one slip through your fingers!!

0393312836|4.0|I had \\"viddied\\" this \\"sinny\\" many times at a young age \\"Oh my brothers\\" and it was real \\"horrorshow\\" but I had never read the book.  Let me tell ya... the language takes a bit to sink in.  Even at the end of the book there were bits and pieces that I had to mentally translate to myself.  Burgess wrote this from the POV of Alex, a nasty little 14 year old who enjoys theft, burglary, assault and battery, rape and then the dabbles into manslaughter.  I say manslaughter because I don't believe that Alex and his friends intended to kill anyone, they just laid on the beat down a bit too hard.<br /><br />Oh, and Alex speaks directly to us... the readers, who he refers to as \\"my brothers\\" but Alex speaks in a slang that I hear is a mish-mash of Eurasian languages, particularly a lot of Russian thrown in.  It takes a while for your brain to process this language.  It's not hard to figure out through context what each of the words means, but it will certainly slow down your reading.  The version I read was 149 pages (the original European publishing that DID include the final chapter) and it took me close to a week to finish it.  Now I had been told that this was an ultraviolent book... and at the time it may have been... but I didn't find it to be any more violent than \\"In Cold Blood\\" or some other classics that I was encouraged to read.  However, the book keeps referring to the goings on as \\"ultra-violence.\\"  True there are several beatings, a knife fight, a few rapes, drug use, etc... but with the mental translation it took to figure out exactly what was occurring... sure I knew it was wrong, but it didn't \\"horrify\\" me.  Then again I grew up in an age where this kind of thing actually does happen.  I believe that when this was written, they had a belief that the world was a better place than those of us from later generations believe.<br /><br />The underlying theme is the question of - if you could force someone to be good... force them to only be capable of doing the right thing... is that good?  Or is it better to allow them the option to do evil, provided they have options.  What is the \\"Christian\\" thing to do in this case?  Would God be pleased to see his creations only doing good when they have no choice but to do it?  There are other themes running amok through this book, childhood, growing up, the violence inherent in the system, and the futility of rehabilitating prisoners when our prisons are overcrowded and unmanageable to name just a few.  There is a lot of meaning in this book, if one can manage their way through it.  Some will be turned off by the difficulty of reading the made up language, others will be turned off by the violence... but those who make it through certainly are left with quite a few tidbits to mull over in their minds.  I would suggest reading this with someone, or a group, because I assume that the most enjoyment can be reached by really discussing this book with someone.  Good luck, enjoy and know that this is a very interesting, vile, yet purposeful book.hat good?  Or is it better to allow them the option to do evil, provided they have options.

B0017I1FP8|5.0|I'm sure I'm not the only person who rushed out to purchase this soundtrack when it was released. I was contemplating on buying the Limited Edition or the new 2-disc release but I decided I couldn't wait that long...<br /><br />Anyway. I listened to this right after listening to the Batman Begins soundtrack and I'm extremely happy to say that it was just fabulous. Zimmer and Howard are geniuses. The tracks on this disc range from pulsating-heart-pounding tones to very melancholic and even heart-breaking. Some people say they can't listen to soundtracks without the movie but I say - give this one a chance. (Beats any generic pop singers any day.)<br /><br />Track #2 was quite enjoyable; it mirrors the opening of the film as they introduce Batman's mission to clean up Gotham...it also has snippets of the music from the Hong Kong scene.<br /><br />#8 (Like a Dog Chasing Cars) is the highlight of this album. It gives you a sense of restlessness, action...I define it as the \\"Batman theme\\" for this movie and even though both Zimmer and Howard agreed that they tried not making any \\"superhero cue\\" for Batman, I think this track sounds pretty damn heroic.<br /><br />#12 (Introduce a Little Anarchy) echoes the same tune as #6 but mixed in with some other elements.<br /><br />All in all, a brilliant soundtrack. This should be in the collection of not just any Batman-fan, but also Zimmer-fans.
0061684384|5.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting when I ordered Kat's book. I saw how much work she put into it on LA Ink, so I preordered it. I expected some biography on her, maybe some stories, and some pictures of tattoo artwork.<br /><br />This book has all of that, but it is so much more! Kat tells her story from her birth in Mexico, childhood and adolescence in California, running away at age 14 to Georgia, to her start in tattooing, going to Miami Ink, and being offered her own show, LA Ink.<br /><br />She also includes photos of her favorite tattoos she has done and the stories behind them, as well as other tattoo artists and some of their tattoos. She has tattoo myths and etiquette. The artwork in this book is inspiring. Although it is a biography of Kat, it is more like an art book. I read it cover to cover and studied a lot of the tattoo photos closely.<br /><br />The book itself is very nicely put together. The front and back covers have a sort of padding, and the pages have the look of old parchment.<br />This is a wonderful book and well worth the price. I paid $23 (including shipping) for a preorder and the book retails for $29.95. However, I wouldn't balk at an even higher price for the book. It is that well put together and beautiful. I have never done a review on a book before, but this influenced me to write one.
0810970686|5.0|My son is a picky reader. He likes to read, but only if the book falls within his very narrow parameters. No mysteries, sci-fi, or sappy dog stories. The main character has to be a guy, and humor is a must.<br /><br />I knew we were on to a winning series when he asked me to guess what his \\"favorite book of all time\\" was. Yup, Wimpy Kid. He even knew the release date for this latest in the series and was jealous when a friend at school beat him to a copy. Keep 'em coming, Jeff Kinney!
0385720920|5.0|This story has it all; sex, love, historical recreation, medical information, religious conspiracy, depravity, humor & friendship. I'm not kidding, it's fantastic. Palahniuk is a creative genius with a wild imagination.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|This set is an excellent set of DVD's, well crafted, and the remastering of the originals was exceptionally well done, although the original type of sixties phenomena has been dulled slightly and replaced with high end technology. This set is basically superior to the previous resmastering done in 2004, although again, this set does upgrade by eliminating some of the 1960's nostalgia and drab coloring.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Because I'm completely infatuated and obsessed with The Dark Knight (hey, I grew up watching Batman, don't blame me!), I can't help but give this product a five star.<br /><br />If I were to rate the movie, then I'd give it a 10 star. Yes, of course I'm biased. But I don't care. This movie is at THE top of my list and I really think it's that special.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Warner Bros. did a very lousy job with the DVD release. I mean, you think for the 2nd highest grossing movie in the world, they'd release something worthwhile? Compared to the Batman Begins giftset, this two-disc edition is just BAD. Though I did enjoy watching the extra \\"Gotham news reports\\", I felt that they were a long shot from the extras on Batman Begins. No real interviews to speak of and no worthwhile behind-the-scenes features.<br /><br />I bought a copy for my cousin but I held back for myself. I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that they'll release a giftset for this movie too. If they don't...well...it just wouldn't make any sense if they didn't.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|This is not just a DVD for people who enjoy John Mayer, but for those who appreciate quality audio and video in HD clarity.  After having purchased 41 concerts on DVD, 15 on Blue-ray, It's easy to see and appreciate the difference among various concerts, primarily that of picture and sounds quality.  I'm running common middle of the road equipment, TV: Samsung A650 52\\", Sony Blue-ray BDP-S500 player and Onkyo TX-SR805 receiver.  On multiple occasions, I've played this concert for friends and neighbors at parties for background ambiance.  It routinely takes center stage around the third or fourth song. The sound quality and is tremendous.  The picture quality is clear as any I've seen.  And the cinematography is second to none.  Let me say that again.  The cinematography is second to none.  I can highly recommend this DVD to both music lovers and Audio/Video geeks!
B00004SYWZ|3.0|I have been hearing the A-HA song TAKE ON ME for so many years now but have never really heard anything else from the group so I thought I would pick that song up as well as try another album from them.  I just wanted to see how the music compared.  It's a lot more mellow of an album than I expected but the music is still good and very easy listening.  Not really a chart topper in the bunch but if you like the group, it's worth picking up.
B001EO2UKO|1.0|I got this cd for Christmas and was thoroughly disappointed. It's nothing like her other cds.  My husband is a musician and big Dido fan.  He also didn't like this album.  He said he kept hitting the forward button to get to a better song!  From now on, we'll be listening to an album with itunes before we make a purchase!

B000X5SPBI|5.0|I have been a fan of this show from the beginning, never missing an episode, but season 3 but put the 1st 2 seasons to shame.  Jensen Ackles really got a chance to show what a great actor he is.  The season begins after Dean sells his soul to save Sam and has less than a year to live.  Ackles shows the broad range of emotions that one would feel knowing that they will de soon, along with terror and denial he feels about spending eternity in hell.  I thought that the show wouldn't have anywhere to go after Dean killed the yellow eyed deamon who killed their mother and Sams girlfriend in the S2 finale, ending the storyline that had driven the show for the 1st 2 seasons.  What we got with season 3 was a revitalized show that was alternated between stories that were heartbreaking , ones that kept you on the edge of your seat, and ones that made you laugh so hard you ended up crying anyway.  The best episodes of the season have got to be Mystery Spot, and Ghostfacers.  In Mystery Spot the Jokster Demon from season 2 returns and tourtures Sam by making him relive the same day over and over until Dean dies a horrific death at the end and the day rewides.  You will laugh out loud at the creative ways the writers kill Dean over and over and see a new side of Sam when he loses his brother and realizes that he is alone for the 1st time in his life.  Ghostfacers was a very different episode that brought back the bumbling ghost hunters from season 1.  Thay had decided to create their own show and collide with Dean and Sam on a hunt.  The entire episode is shot with handheld cameras (a spoof of Ghost Hunters on SciFi) and actually has a great storyline included.  If you have never watched the show before, you are missing out.  This is truly one of the best shows on TV, and not just for the action and effects but amazing performances of everyone involded.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|I am not originally a big pink fan, but this album is great. I like almost every song and can appreciate the writing and her singing.
B001KW0C96|5.0|Over all it was a solid flick. I'm not disagreeing saying with people who says that they could have made a better movie...because they could have. I personally thought for a shooting detective movie it was good. The movie itself I would give a 7/10. The Blu-ray picture and sound is definitely at its finest and I give it a 10/10. So don't expect a oscar movie but expect a good time.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|Though my kids seem to really enjoy this movie I find it a little stale and boring after a while. So if want it for a movie you can enjoy WITH your children for years to come, I'd look elsewhere. But if you want something you can throw on for them, they'll surely be content enough with this one.
1400063515|5.0|Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.com    In this book Taleb uses the term black swan as a metaphor for the unexpected.  He chose it because, before Australia was discovered, people in the Old World were convinced that all swans were white.    The bombing of the Twin Towers in New York on 9/11 is a perfect example of what Taleb means by the term black swan.  Other examples are best selling books by unknown authors and insanely popular new restaurants.  He also points out that another type of Black Swan is the highly expected event not happening.    The defining characteristics of black swans are puzzling; a combination of low predictability and large impact.    Taleb's central theme is since Black Swans are unpredictable we need to adjust to their existence and that trying to predict them is futile.  The best way to do that is by focusing on antiknowledge, or what we don't know. This advice provides the grist for his engaging, thoughtful and thoroughly provocative expository mill.    Taleb is an iconoclastic polymath who lays bare the futility in our belief that we actually can predict the future with any degree of success.  And he shows this to be true by demonstrating the abysmal track records of those high priests we rely on like stock market analysts of every ilk including the mathematical economists or \\"Quants.\\"    The true and lasting value of this book is Taleb's ability to write by telling stories that deal with subjects that are complex, abstruse and difficult to understand. But, not to worry; the stories are easy to read, fun and highly thought provoking.      The subject matter deals with almost any situation imaginable and identifies techniques we can all use to protect against being hoodwinked by \\"experts\\" willing to advise us on how best to handle complex situations and how to position ourselves to collect serendipitous Black Swans of the positive variety.    I strongly recommend you read this book.  And, if you do, I promise youwon't be disappointed.
1401902197|5.0|I believe I've found what I've been looking for.  Louise makes it easy.  I've listened to her everday for the last two weeks on my way to work and I can now see what everyone's been talking about.  Be happy and THINK of things that make you happy, (things you want in your life). There should be no poverty in  one's life.  It's all about your thoughts.  The funny part of blaming your parents or \\"THEM\\".  Forgive everything and everybody, let it go so you can enjoy the happy.  Know that everything will be alright.  You just have to believe.  I read the \\"Secret\\" and they basiccally say the same thing, but when you get it you know.  I would recommend this to anybody needing more clarification after reading the \\"Secret\\".
185459768X|5.0|The trilogy of Golden Compass, Subtle Knife, and Amber Spyglass in one book is the way to go here, because once you read the first, you won't be able to resist reading the next two.     The novels are imaginative, well written, and deep adventures that will keep your interest held throughout. Some depictions of the various worlds that the child heroes go through will stay in your memory vividly for a very long time.  It is a great read, with philosophical questions raised that have burdened humankind forever, and the answers he gives are both sobering and hopeful.    No reservations.
0439813786|5.0|I know I will end up reading this to appease my ten year olds pleas, she can't say enough about it! I got it for her because she said the one in the school library is always checked out and has a waiting list. It looks and feels like a daunting novel for such a young reader, but it is so chalk full of illustrations (that also tell the story) that she read it in no time. It's the hot item at our elementary school right now. Give it a try, from what I can tell, you won't be disapointed.
B0013N7AD8|4.0|I have to say that I love the 1989 Batman and it's sequel, Batman Returns.  Batman Forever has it's moments.  And for me, Batman & Robin is like having your teeth drilled at the dentist office.  All and all most of my fascination for this box set is still from my awe gazing while viewing in 1080p 24hz.  I think the movies look great in high def.  But since the first two movies are Burton's noir style, you don't really get the vivid colors until Schumacher starts directing, introducing us to Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  And because of this I really got a chance to enjoy all of the movies in this set.  The first two for how great they are as films and the last two for how great they looked in HD as eye candy.  In a few years when Blu ray movies and 1080p HDTVs are the norm, this set will probably lose its bite, considerably.  But for now, I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Goes great with my Batman Begins and Dark Knight Returns Blu rays.
B00005Y228|5.0|Fast Facts:for Kylie Minogue!    Born 28 May 1968 ( 1968 -05-28) (age 40)   Origin Melbourne, Victoria,  Australia   Occupation(s) Singer-songwriter, Actress, Fashion designer.    Excellent!  Kylie Minogue always creates danceable, yet intense electronic music. I find her keyboard arrangements to be stylish and even complex. She is truly a gifted musician and actress who has appeared in  the 2007 Doctor Who Christmas special episode entitled \\"Voyage of the Damned\\", plus, a few other TV projects.     Minogue's unique electronic dance style adds a positive flavor to the \\"pop\\" culture on an international level.    This is a five star album
B000059GEI|5.0|A classic.  Great musical numbers that always don't make much sense to the script, but who cares.  One of Monroe's best musical numbers, \\"Heat Wave\\", is just that.  A true show business film about how the show must go on.  Ethel Merman leading a cast of hundreds in the finale, There's No Business Like Show Business, is worth the price alone. Beautiful restoration of the film.  Brilliant colors.
B00006GEB4|5.0|This album has such a beautiful continuity to it.  It's sonically beautiful and melodic.  It's my favourite of theirs.
B000002N1E|5.0|Prince marked a return to his classic rock sound, which was backed by three singles and solid music videos.<br /><br />Prior to its September 1995 release, the songs, Dolphin, was released as a music video. It was followed by three singles - which also had music videos - Eye Hate U (peaked at #11 on the chart), The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (#3) and Gold (#88). There are 18 tracks - the mostly brief NPG Operator takes up a half-dozen - for a total clocking of nearly 68 minutes.<br /><br />Recorded between January 1993 and July 1994, the album unfortunately was issued during a time of great friction between Prince and Warner Bros., with the artist mostly abandoning the promotion of the album, though it earned ecstatic reviews from major critics.<br /><br />The album has a solid feel of the 1984 classic, Purple Rain, but is hardly a retrospective look back....it arguably is Prince's best release in this decade of professional  turmoil.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|Seriously.  Just don't!  I am the kind of person no matter how awful or whatever, I just have to finish that book or movie.... But in this case?  I shut it off and felt no remorse.

I would not have ordered this movie for over 10.00 had I have known the movie was not Remastered for DVD or Blu-Ray Not Sharp and Super Grainy, Bad colors ...The sound seems fine. The studio's should not release older movies on the this format Blu-Ray until there has been a total restoration. I recieved Dawn of The Dead the other day now that a beautiful restoration for Blu -Ray. ....Sorry Folks
B001MW0J2O|1.0|If you like meandering stream-of-consciousness pop, then this might be your thing. There are just no catchy bits...at all.  It's just not listenable to me for that reason.  Too many liberties taken..music as indulgence rather than discipline. Not fun.    OK, I was wrong when I criticised this group for avoidance of musical conventions.  Having listened a bit more...    Spacey, a bit jangly. Recalls the very short 60s psychedelic genre. On the one hand, this music adheres to the conventions of pop music, but at the same time, it sounds fundamentally unhinged. There is not order in the sense of rhythm, melody, or chord progression. It doesn't make sense. Now maybe Animal Collective will turn out to be the modern equivalent of Mahler, about whom they said: \\"His music is better than it sounds\\" and who today is much more approachable...who knows. But for now, I suspect that most of the fans are pseudo-music lover/writer-intellectuals.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|The title I gave my review of \\"Man on Wire\\" is a small capsule of the critical raves that have been heaped upon this documentary.  I just finished watching this documentary today, and I have to agree with the other critics who have raved about this movie. The movie documents Philippe Petit's six year struggle to achieve an illegal artistic act-walking on a tightrope between the two Twin Towers of New York city. Petit has a history of defying the law to perform his art, from walking above the towers of Notre Dame in his hometown of Paris to the bridge crossing of Sydney Harbour in Australia.  How he achieves it, up until he is finally in the air a quarter of a mile up on a tightrope between the Towers, is thrilling.  There is never any motivation other than thrill seeking behavior given for Petit's decision to walk between the towers. Petit and all of his \\"partners in crime\\" for this hedonistic, illegal artistic act are all interviewed and give their insights into what they did and what it meant.   This movie, despite the fact there is no film footage of Petit on the towers, will keep you riveted to your seat.       The special features are good as well.  The footage of Philippe Petit's Sydney Harbor crossing (in Australia)is well done. I enjoyed the animated scholastic film of \\"The Man who walked between the Towers,\\" based on an award winning childrens book about Petit's walk across the Towers.  Mr. Petit's interview is also fascinating in providing insights into his behavior, and why he feels the need to perform outside of a circus on a highwire.     An exhillerating ride of a film, and worth it!

058201736X|3.0|The Diary of Anne Frank had many conflicts first going into hiding because the Germans are taking Jews and sending them to their death or killing them slowly torturing them and housing them in a harsh and dangerous environment. As they go into hiding they face rough times in what they call the Secret Annex. There are many to join in the Secret Annex which give the families many heartbreaks of  argument to follow, with shortage of food supply and the worsening of the outside world, watching their  loved ones taken and sent to their death makes the members break down even further. Also worrying about getting discovered and taken by the German Soldiers and facing their potential death as well, hallucinating from the noises from the down stairs warehouse.<br /><br />  The dislike I encountered with this novel was the set up of it, the diary form all though unique from most books bothered me, the pace of the book also bothered me it was slow and took awhile to get to the point of the conflict in the story. What I did like about the story was detail and that behind the book it was a true event and a young girl actually went through it, it was inspiring that after it all Anne was still positive and kept hope in the world.
B00000J2KX|1.0|I am amazed to see that one reviewer called this \\"the best Stephen King adaptation.\\"  This tells me that the reviewer never read the book this movie was supposed to be based on.  Kubrick threw the original story out and wrote his own.  As a story totally separate from the book it might be passable, but if you loved the book then don't bother with this, you will be dissapointed.  Look for the miniseries made later instead, it captured the original story much better.     Of great importance to the original story is the fact that the hotel is an entity, a powerful and evil force which takes the character of the father over.  The father isn't mean or evil.  He is, at worst, weak.  Nicholson's portrayal of the father comes across as mean and crazy from the get-go.  Similarly disappointing for fans of the book is the fact that Shelly Duval portrays the mother as stupid and cowardly, which is not how the character was written.  As far as the little boy talking to his finger, well let's don't even go there.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Braveheart is my all time favourite film. This film is nothing but nonstop adrenaline. Its is only justified that this film be finally produced for blu-ray technology.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I loved this film. I love the sing a long track that came with it. Highley recommend as a feel good film. Meryl Streep is always great.

In this 2 disk version you get back stories and the sing a long version.
0982195702|5.0|\\"The Art of Possibility,\\" first published in 2000, has returned to bookstores as a newly released audiobook from PossibilityWorks. It's thoughtfully read by the authors, Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander, who have creatively included audio clips of the music referred to in the text--something that musician and non-musician alike should find enjoyable.     The Zanders draw on their broad experiences with therapy patients, musicians and students, in this book. She is a psychotherapist and painter, he is conductor of the Boston Philharmonic. Together, and especially in this audiobook, they add a personal interpretation to the transformational tools so carefully described in The Art of Possibility. Their tone is warm and invitingly welcome.    The book is a must read for anyone navigating the challenges of work and family. And, the audio edition is a must hear!

This edition is restored and corrected in parts which do not detract from the film.      Often imitated but so far unsurpassed.  A real cinematic experience and a must see.

If Apple is going to include a port that doesn't work with the rest of the hardware in the entire world it should include a free adapter as a consolation, not rob us of another $30. For shame Apple.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game to play with a group of people.  I got it for my husband for Christmas, and our family had a great time playing together!

(Getting the extension pack makes it even more fun :-))
B000GLKLCK|5.0|My 3 favorite interpreters of Mozart on the piano are Perahia, Curzon, and Brendel, and Perahia, maybe a bit more than the others. This set is simply wonderful. These remastered concertos really bring out the crispness, and clarity of Perahia's style, which I think overall, is a nice blend of technique and emotional depth. In this compilation, the interplay of the piano with the English Chamber Orchestra is beautifully realized.    Beside the operas, if anything destroys the impression of Mozart's music being light and lovely, but shallow, it's his piano concertos, beginning with the marvelous K.271, and ending with K.595 written in the last year of his life (1791). A greater representation of thematic originality, formal beauty, and depth of feeling, can't be found. Mozart perfected the classical form to the point where Beethoven, realizing that he couldn't surpass him, had to break new ground to make his mark. My favorites are K.271, K.453, K.466, K.482, and K.491, respectively numbers 9, 17, 20, 22, and 24. For Mozart lovers in general, the list of favorites will vary, since we are dealing with at minimum, a dozen genuine masterpieces.
B0014DFCMS|5.0|I loved this movie!  When this movie first came out I had no desire to go out and see it.  When it got a bunch of great reviews and was nominated up the wazoo I still had no desire.  I tend to go against the grain a bit, . .and then one day  I just happened to be flipping the channel and caught this movie on HBO and I got sucked right into it.  It is interesting to me to see that some people find that this movie represents a glorified version of teenage pregnancy.  I actually thought the oposite and thought that it would make young girls think otherwise before having sex.  Juno is ostracized at school and has to go through all the stresses and emotional trouble that comes with being pregnant.  The most gut wrenching scene was when she had to tell her parents and see the look of dissappointment on her fathers face and then again another scene with her father after the baby is born.  This movie was so well acted by everyone and now I can understand all the buzz.  The dialog is so funny and sarcastic but seems very real. You just have to see this movie.  It is very whitty and entertaining, it definitely goes against the grain and is well worth the purchase and addition to your movie library.
0807126063|3.0|I'll admit to chuckling at times while reading this book, but in my opinion it's far from the greatest comic novel ever written as some make it out to be. Toole's representation of the lower strata of New Orleans society was more effective to me than the exaggerated humor represented by I.J. Reilly. About half way through the novel, Reilly started to wear thin on me, and I garnered more amusement from some of the secondary characters, like the factory owner and his wife, and Reilly's radical girlfriend. A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is not a bad novel, and had Toole not taken his own life, he could well have become a major author, but for humor, writers like Roth, Irving, Heller, West, and Vonnegut, are more to my taste.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I am a fan of the book and the BBC version of this movie, yet I found this Hollywood version to be quite entertaining.  I thought that Matthew Macfadyen did an excellent job portraying Mr. Darcy.  I wish I could say the same for Keira Knightley but I just didn't buy it. The relationship between Rosamund Pike (Jane) and Lizzie was just not convincingly close as depicted in the book and although this has nothing to do with the movie, . .  Keira always does this weird thing with her lips (trying to make them look fuller while pouting) that really bugs me. I like the way the set design, costumes, and the lack of to much makeup made the movie a little more \\"authentic\\", but what I truly loved was the music.  I felt like the music really transported me into that time. I felt like this movie tried desperately to make this movie authentic (much like the 1995 production of Persuasion) but due to time restraints failed to develop the depth of the characters of the book.  The result a slightly enjoyable, entertaining piece of Hollywood film that is entertaining to watch.
0312370849|3.0|Many of the reviews here have summarized the story beautifully, better than I could, so I'll just say I loved the way the story began, action packed, perking my interest greatly.  I was OK with the short chapters alternating between Sarah's voice in 1942 and the journalist Julia's voice in 2002 for a while, but gradually began to lose interest in Julia's story, found much of Julia's story distracting,  and wanted to hear more from Sarah. I realize Sarah's story is a child's point of view, but I felt like her chapters were geared to a younger reading audience, that the writing was less than gripping, less than mature, less than literary. The potential for greatness is certainly there with this subject material.  I learned about the French complicity in the roundup of the Jews from this book, but felt like the soul of the crime was not really touched upon.  For my personal taste, I would have liked more of that. I was a little put off by the predictable ending...I saw it coming as soon as that male character was introduced into the story. Though I enjoyed many parts of this book, nothing here to make me say \\"wow\\".

0312360266|5.0|I found out about P.C. Cast and her daughter Kristin Cast through the amazing website/blog called Free Book Friday, that is founded by author Jessica Brody. I'm so glad that I read and even heard the wonderful podcast interview of Jessica and P.C. talking about her House of Night series. Listening to the podcast about how P.C. and her daughter Kristin came to write the Young Adult series about vampires and finishing school. I had to find out more about this series and to get them immediately so I can read them all. I also recommend that you all listen to it also so you can decide for yourselves if you agree with me about this series and P.C. Cast's inspiration for writing them with her daughter. I'm glad that I bought these books because it didn't disappoint and now I'm a fan of the House of Night series and I look forward to all the future novels in this series. Especially since I found on her website that the next book in the series called Hunted is coming out in March 2009, which is 2 months away.<br /><br />Marked is the first novel in this series and at first I had a bit of trouble getting into the plot of the story but once I got a couple of chapters in I was definitely hooked. Zoey Redbird is one unique teenager and her world of having vampyres always existing is a fascinating world. Sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird has just been Marked as fledgling vampyre and joins the House of Night, a school where she will train to become an adult vampyre. I think even though vampyres have always existed they are still treated horribly like any race that isn't considered \\"normal\\" and that will not change even in this series. But her becoming an adult vampyre is a possibility only if she makes it through the Change--and not all of those who are Marked do. It sucks to begin a new life, especially away from her friends, and on top of that, Zoey is no average fledgling. She has been chosen as special by the vampyre Goddess Nyx just a couple of hours after she has been marked in a dream of hers. Zoey's maternal grandmother is of Native American descent and her people believe in the Goddess that is the same as the vampyre Goddess Nyx.<br /><br />Zoey discovers she has amazing powers, but along with her powers come bloodlust and an unfortunate ability to Imprint her human ex-boyfriend. I don't know what to make of her human ex-boyfriend Heath because he seems such a jock which is exactly what he is but he's also very into Zoey. He's very different from his friends who really freaked out when they saw Zoey was marked but Heath was very cool with it. To add to her stress, she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers: When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite group, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends. I'm totally loving Zoey's grandmother because she is the only one who understands her and that Zoey's life is going to change for the better not the worsest. Zoey's new vampyre fledling friends are pretty cool and my favorite is Zoey's roommate and bestfriend Stevie Rae. I love this series even though again it's another book in the first person which is starting to grow on me with each new author I discover.m of hers.

B0017TYPIG|4.0|Originally released in the cinema in late 1967, like most people, I came across the fantastic \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" on a piddly little television set at home, sometime in the mid Seventies. And like most folk, I've loved it and its indomitable spirit ever since.<br /><br />Fast-forward to September 2008, and it arrives on the shiny new Blu Ray format - and to see it all cleaned up and pucker like this - and on a juicy big plasma screen too - is a treat few movie fans will be able to resist.<br /><br />As close to 'beautiful' as a man could get, Newman shone from the second he smiled in the opening credits. The rest of the cast too were just fantastic - it's almost a case of spot the famous face now - Harry Dean Stanton and the young Dennis Hopper in early roles, George Kennedy in probably his best part, Strother Martin, JD Cannon, Lou Antonio, Joe Don Baker...the list is endless...and all of it with a top screenplay by DONN PEARCE and FRANK PIERSON and complimented by a cool LALO SCHIFFRIN soundtrack.<br /><br />But the real treat for lifetime fans of the film is the PRINT. From the moment you see the red steel \\"violation\\" sign fill the screen as a drunk Lucas Jackson chops the head off yet another parking meter in his hick home town with a steel cutter, you know this print has been seen to properly - and I mean properly - it's absolutely gorgeous to look at.<br /><br />Most of the action takes place in the blistering heat of a Florida prison and its daily work details, so there's a sort of heat haze over every outdoor shot, but the clarity of the restored print is still fantastic. When some of the prisoners are going through the compounds gates - beautifully clear. Paul Newman as he lays on his top bunk before the 8pm curfew looking at a bare light bulb just inches away...again so clean...<br /><br />And then there's the film itself...there are so many great scenes:<br />...the full-on sex-kitten JOY HARMON (27 at the time, but looking more like 20) washing the car in that clinging floral dress while the boys sweat nearby digging a trench in the road (\\"I'm dying here...\\") is probably one of the sexiest and most delicious scenes ever put to film (George Kennedy calls her Lucille).  Strother Martin's famous lines about \\"communication\\" when one of the prisoners gets shirty, the mirror shades of \\"Boss\\" reflecting everything from the birds he shoots to approaching trucks, the boisterous and loaded card games, the egg-eating contest, hiding out in the chapel at the end of the film as 'boss man' comes after Lucas...George Kennedy dying inside as the spirit of his new friend is close to being broken, but doesn't break (Kennedy won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Role)...all of it brill...and like its title...effortlessly cool.<br /><br />There's a \\"Making Of\\" and Audio Commentary (not on some rental versions) and the subtitles are in French and Spanish only.<br /><br />\\"Cool Hand Luke\\" on Blu Ray is a triumph. What we have here is not a failure to communicate, but a great version of a great movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended.sweat nearby digging a trench in the road (\\"I'm dying here...\\") is probably one of the sexiest and most delicious scenes ever put to film (George Kennedy calls her Lucille).

B0000009RX|5.0|The lyrics describing our society in the mid-60's are by turns hilarious, pathetic,grotesque,sad,frightening and disturbing. The music is like a circus in an insane asylum. Fragments of surf rock,backwoods jazzbo,musique concrete,contemporary classical and other genres are mixed with psychedelic abandon/precision to create what I consider to be Zappa's best album. A must-have for anyone interested in the unique culture of the 60's or with a skewed sense of humor.
B000W91RUG|4.0|The dvds are great, but the plastic circle in the middle was broken... ALMOST PERFECT
0790729407|5.0|Very powerful movie for those who love Irish History in action. Again like Ryans Daughter, the producers cast an American in the movie. Julia Roberts of all people. Miss Roberts was so out of character it was sad. There could have been many British females more suitable for the part than Miss Roberts. Movie was a little long with some scenes redundant
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|After reading several raving reviews of the show on various web sites, I decided to pick up the first book in the series. After reading and loving it, I picked up the first season on DVD. I burned through it far too quickly. I love the characters, and the story mixes the right amount of mystery and dark comedy for my tastes. It is definitely not for younger viewers, which is why it was originally on Showtime. I never saw the edited broadcast version, so I can't comment on that.   It's a show that has a serial killer as a hero. I never thought I would enjoy something like this, but it is realy fun.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I want to tell the people who likes the friends series to better buy it from some other site as the order I place with amazon, which was shipped by amazon never reached me. Also when i asked for a replacement order, they were not able to do that and asked me to place a new order at a higher price from my acutal order, which I didn't do. Its a clear case of mishandling and it doesn't make any sense to give an order at amazon and wait for the order to come. I was too much disappointed. Hope no one else will have the same experience.    Regards  Arun Nair
B000002UA5|5.0|Some of this can be hard to listen to but if you can get a good price on it, it may be worth the cost just for Grantchester Meadows and Several Species... alone.  For some of the other stuff you probably have to be a fan but you can see where they came from.  I don't remember any of the Syd Barrett tunes from before Gilmour but I think Barrett is credited on Astronomy Domine do you get an idea of what he was about.  I guess it gets down to listening to what you like--I like it!
0061684384|5.0|This book is packed full of interesting facts and pictures.  I read it all today; I couldn't put it down.  I appreciate the different sections; it is not super long.  She has a lot of experiences to share for someone of her young age.  I love the show, so I had to pre-order the book.  I was not disappointed; every time I pick it up I notice something new.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|Even the music was bad.  I looked forward to this movie for a year.  I have always loved the original.  The fabulous cast were all miscast; better use of Bette Midler, Chloris Leachman, and Lynn Whitfield would have helped. The settings and clothing were fun, as were the scenes in the store.  Don't pay theater prices - view it when it gets to Blockbuster's bargain bin.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I LOVE the book and all of the books by this author, however, in translating this story to the big screen, a lot of very pertinate details were lost. Also, the film makers changed the direction of the story and completely ignored some of the hard sort historicly based facts that make the book so addictive! My advice would be, if you've read the book DON'T watch the movie - you'll be dissapointed! If you haven't read the book, read it or watch the movie! As a piece in it's own right it is quite entertaining and the costumes, scenery and standard of acting are all really good!
0380730405|5.0|I had heard a lot about Rebecca but never thought it was one for me. While I do occasionally read classic literature, I tend to prefer more modern quick-paced novels.  In Rebecca, I was expecting a sort of gothic romance...and that is more or less what it is. I have to say though that I enjoyed this book far more than I thought I would. The story itself took a little longer to tell than what modern audiences demand. It was a bit like watching an old black and white movie and several times (mostly at the beginning) I grew a little impatient with the pace of the plot.  But stick with it for a very rewarding reading experience.<br /><br />The story is told from the first person POV but since the protagonist is such a timid soul, she takes quite a while to work herself up to getting something done. Lots of musing about what people might think if such and such were to happen. But then again, since the story was published in the 1930s, perceptions and family status were paramount.<br /><br />I have never read a book with so much \\"atmosphere.\\"  The setting is brilliantly written and is extremely important to the plot, in essence another major character.  The characters themselves kept my attention despite the slow spots and the mystery elements were very intriguing.  I am glad I experienced this compelling novel. Overall, it was a pleasant surprise.
0380789035|5.0|I love this book! I just have to say that. I also happen to be a complete Neil Gaiman fan, if that makes me biased then so be it. First off, I have to say that this is a book you will read and reread and read again. I myself just finished it for the 4th time. It is amazingly fresh and surprising, and for me some of the best parts of the book isn't necessarily the proverbial main \\"quest\\", but rather the many caveats that Mr. Gaiman takes in illuminating the histories of various gods and how they came to America. In parts it's deliciously dark and twisted and macabre, and then there are parts that are just plain inspired. I will not go into plot or story too much because I believe that half the fun in reading this book is in seeing the twists and turns that the book takes. Be warned, the book will suck up your time in vast quantities, you swill find yourself neglecting the ordinary tasks of daily life, but rest assured it is time well spent. I look forward to reading more work from this splendid author.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|Just when it seemed like classic styled traditional Hard Rock had been left in the past or only used as something of a campy, tongue in cheek gimmick, a band came screaming out of Australia.  That band was Airbourne.<br /><br />Airbourne has, rightly, been compared to AC/DC, but also has some clear influences from other Australian Hard Rock bands like Rose Tattoo and The Angels (Angel City), among others.  Also likely influencing this rowdy band from Down Under are bands like Motorhead, early Aerosmith, early KISS, Ted Nugent, and Guns 'N' Roses.  Having said all of that, AC/DC is obviously the biggest influence on Airbourne, something that gives the album it's charm.<br /><br />Runnin' Wild features absolutely NOTHING new stylistically, but what it DOES feature are eleven ass kicking Hard Rock tracks with attitude to spare to go along with the solid riffs and great hooks.  The energy and passion coming from this band on this album is undeniable, and it is infectious.  Let's face it, it's hard NOT to start playing air guitar to tracks like, \\"Runnin' Wild,\\" and \\"Stand Up For Rock and Roll.\\"  It's hard NOT to start singing along to the hooks for songs like, \\"Diamond in the Rough,\\" and \\"Too Much, Too Young, Too Fast.\\"<br /><br />The production on Runnin' Wild (the album) is outstanding.  Producer Bob Marlette did a great job of laying down the tracks with Engineer Dave Schiffman, and Andy Wallace & John O'Mahony did a great job with the mix, showing off the bands energy and power.<br /><br />Sure, as noted before, this album features nothing new musically.  But while it may be largely a re-hash of stuff done 20 or 30 years ago it is done with such enthusiasm and honesty that it works.  Not just a little, but it works brilliantly.  On Runnin' Wild Airbourne perfectly captures what makes this type of Rock and Roll so great.  It's fun, and that's what Rock and Roll was all about in the first place.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this album is just another example of history repeating itself.  There was (and still is) a band out of Switzerland called Krokus who was accused in the early 80's - like Airbourne now - of, \\"Ripping off,\\" AC/DC's style.  Krokus' 1982 album [[ASIN:B0000071GC One Vice at a Time]] was another great take on a classic Hard Rock style.  That album was, and is, just as good as most of AC/DC's material - as is much of Runnin' Wild - which makes any stylistic borrowings completely forgivable.  (And a lot of people don't realize that AC/DC borrowed heavily from the band Status Quo when developing their style, so AC/DC wasn't exactly original, either!)<br /><br />Bottom line?  If you like AC/DC or rowdy Hard Rock with great hooks then Airbourne's Runnin' Wild is the album for you!till is) a band out of Switzerland called Krokus who was accused in the early 80's - like Airbourne now - of, \\"Ripping off,\\" AC/DC's style.

B001O9CF1S|5.0|It has been a long time since I read anything so funny!  This book is very well written and the plot flows smoothy.  The characters are very well developed and the main character, Kate Reddy, is intelligent, quirky and resourceful.  When a parental \\"emergency\\" pops up (the need for a homemade treat for the World Fest Day at her daughter's school, for example) Kate Reddy is right there......steaming the label off a store bought jam jar and replacing it with one of her own homemade labels.  There's nothing like a little creativity to make a mother feel adequate and competent.  And what's a woman to do when a rat runs across the kitchen floor while the in-laws are over for a visit?  Well, that's an easy one.....you ply the in-laws with more alcohol and distract them until hubby can chase the rodent out into the garden.    Kate Reddy is a workoholic to the nth degree.  She is rarely home and doesn't even know her own children that well.  But hey, that's what she pays the nanny for, right?  And according to Kate's architect husband, the nanny's take home pay is higher than his.  Guilt money?  Of course it is, but that only adds to the hilarity of the story.      We follow Kate through her work schedule and meet her friends and colleagues.  We get into her head and find out what makes her tick.  She is a working mother (and very good at her office job) but over time she begins to realize that her life is spinning out of control and she begins to question what and why she is doing what she is doing.  Is it worth it?    This book is absolutely hilarious (until the end, when Kate begins to make some serious decisions about her life and her future) and will have the reader cheering our protagonist on as she maneauvers her way around the \\"man's world\\" of fund managing, as well as the \\"Muffia\\" of stay-at-home mothers who feel Kate should be contributing more to her family life.  A fantastic book!

B000002HRE|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. Pure and simple. The people that use the term \\"sell out\\" have not musically evolved. Metallica HAS though. Most people that call them sell-out just repeat what some other person said. Like its not \\"cool\\" to listen to this album. A real shame that such ignorance exists. But it is their loss. This is an incredibly produced album. Every song on it is amazing in its own way. I am a fan of their earlier albums as well but this is by far my favorite to this day. Buy it and blast it to 11 in a car.

B0000JCFPE|3.0|\\"Basic Instinct\\" is absolute trash and yet is is hard not to like. Director Paul Verhoeven's over the top style fits the material perfectly. Why Michael Douglas agreed to appear in such a perverted film is difficult to understand but he is excellent as a troubled cop and Sharon Stone is great as a demented femme fatale. The much-vaunted sex scenes are completely unstimulating, the ending a disappointment, and the story ridiculous and yet it works much better than it should. Sadly the DVD has no extras as Verhoeven provides the best \\"director's commentaries\\" you will ever hear.
0439806119|4.0|I thought this was a great concept especially since we live in a world where people are sucking fat out of all parts of their body, reshaping their noses, getting breast implants, etc.  Whose to say we will not end up in a world where everyone is beautiful.  It is actually a kind of scary thought.  I did find it funny that at one point some of the uglies see pictures of people from our time like the super skinny models and find them ugly because they look like they are starving and that was what we found beautiful.<br /><br />Shay and Tally are both characters.  They almost seem to be two halves of one person.  Shay is the more impulsive, bold half where Tally is the more hesitant side that likes to conform to what people expect of her.  It will be nice to see if they can help each other grow the other half of their personality.  I am excited to see what happens in the next book to see what becomes of the uglies that do not want to become pretties and where David and Tally's relationship go.<br /><br />I think this is a great YA book since it's pointing out that looking like everyone else is not always a good thing.  What some might see as imperfections are not necessarily bad things.  It gives people personality and individualism.
B00005ATQD|4.0|\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is Kubrick's best film since \\"Barry Lyndon\\" and a fitting end to his remarkable career. All the Kubrick touches are there - the air of detachment, the tracking shots, the fisheye steadicam, the banal mixed with the bizarre, beautifully composed shots, excellent use of music, etc, etc.<br />The story concern a married couple played by (at the time) real-life married couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman for whom married life has become a little boring and where both parties are looking for some excitement although they know they shouldn't. Things soon get out of hand.<br />Tom Cruise is brilliant and so are all the other performance with the glaring exception of Nicole Kidman who struggles in a difficult role.<br />Some interesting interviews with Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg are included on the DVD but nothing else.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|Yes, it's over the top, and takes more time to digest than most metal fans might be willing to give. But if you are willing to set aside the time, this album starts to reveal itself in ways that Painkiller and Turbo can only aspire to. There's no \\"Freewheel Burning\\" on here, I'm sorry to say. On the other hand, there's no \\"Locked In\\", either, thank the gods of metal.  \\"Prophecy\\", \\"Persecution\\", and especially \\"Nostradamus\\" should satisfy the metal craving. There's more but those are the immediate heavy hitters. Listen with a pair of really good headphones and it all comes out, all the background stuff you simply won't get otherwise. Or take it on a night drive, splurge for a few gallons of gas and fly down the highway in the dark for the perfect mood.

B00000DOY9|4.0|i bought it when it came out in 1976 and it sounded like crap!  i bought it on vinyl at tower records in fresno, california without first hearing it (i love zep's 1st 4 albums without reservation!).  i took it home and listened, hoping to find something like the 1st 4 albums, but there was nothing!  i took it back to tower the next day and exchanged it for frampton comes alive!<br /><br />however, as i've grown older and wiser, repeated listenings stand the test of time (i since bought a new version on cd).  this is a  near-classic zep album that stands up well today.  tea for one is a classic behemoth; a blues tune that stands out with their best blues tunes; achilles last stand is a tune  that no other band of its time could have evened conceived; nobody's fault but mine is true genius guitar work from page, and with a beat so funky and slick you can lick honey off it; for your life, which i so recklessly panned over 30 years ago is a real gem: nice guitar work from page and great backbeat from bonham; royal orleans has that same funky feel, but the problem is it goes nowhere. hots on for nowhere and candy store rock can't be saved at all.  they both sound aimless, without purpose.  jones, bonham and page seem to be playing half heartedly, or perhaps their hearts weren't in it at all.  robert plant's certainly wasn't.<br /><br />all in all, i give it 4 stars because it has some truly great moments.  i still think their best are the first two albums:  they could have made a whole career doing willie dixon songs and stealing stuff from robert johnson.
0312383320|2.0|To me, I thought this book was full of 14 year old boy humor. I outgrew that in middle school. I miss the cutting humor of the older books. The story was ok, but I could have lived without the monkey and the bathroom humor. I think Diesel is the bomb. I still think the books are overpriced for all the white space there is. I've had that complaint with the last few books. Margins you could drive a truck through. An ok library read, but not worth buying.
0525951113|4.0|This is an awesome cyberthriller for anyone who loves technothrillers and who doesn't mind the computer jargon.

B000002LND|4.0|The Immaculate Collection is greatest hits between the years 1983 and 1990. Here we get tracks such as Lucky Star, Material Girl, Live to tell, Express yourself and Justify my love to mention a few of the many gems included on this amazing collection.  Gene Sculati has written the linernotes and writes a very interesting take on Madonnas every release that is included on this release. The booklet is filled with pictures of Madonna and not all of them look that great. 4/5.
0312360266|5.0|Ok, I will start off by saying that the beginning is week. I almost gave up on it than, but a friend convinced me to keep reading. And I am so, so glad I did. You could almost describe the writing style as \\"corny\\" or \\"immature\\", but somehow, the Casts made it work. And ridiculously well at that. I really enjoyed the book A TON. It was such a good book and i would highly reccomend it to anyone.
0786838655|3.0|I'm NOT going to compare this to another well-known magical children's series.  I read a lot of serial science fiction and fantasy by many writers. Many of these titles are meant to be read by people of many ages. This book is really for children. Really, really.  Adults like me may find the novel predictable and the writing shoddy. I don't know if they writing is really poor or, because it's written from the point of view of a 12 year old boy, the simple dialect is the main character's voice.<br /><br />This book is written like an entertaining ancient history lesson for children.  I think I'm not the proper audience for this book.

B000002UB2|5.0|Abbey Road is one of the best LP's of all time. When you listen to it on Vinyl the album really comes to life.     All of the songs are amazing, especially \\"you never give me your money\\".     The art and photography are classic. The album was originally called \\"Everest\\" which was chosen by Paul due to engineers favorite brand of cigarettes. The Beatles were supposed to fly to Mount. Everest to take the photo for the cover of the album, but when the time came they decided it would be much easier to just walk outside, take a quick photo and call it Abbey Road (the name of the street their recording studio was on) which would also give them more time to work on the album. I'm glad it worked out that way because the cover shot is great and the music couldn't be better.       If you like the beatles this is a must own LP.
B000026OW3|4.0|Artur Rubinstein is widely considered to be one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century and rightly so. Although he was well known for his recordings of Brahms, Schumann and Spanish music, he will always be associated with Chopin. Many Chopinists are able to excel in certain works such as Francois with the Ballades, Arrau with the Preludes or Friedman with the Mazurkas, but to me there is no pianist that can play all of Chopin's works as well as Rubinstein. Aside from the Etudes, this collection contains most of Chopin's major works and is a must buy for any lover of Rubinstein, Chopin or anyone interested in getting into Chopin.
1596680296|5.0|After being a crocheter for over 20 years, I decided to give knitting a try.  A few scarves to start me out, and then I wanted more.  I must have looked at 50 sock patterns before I found this book, and it was pure enlightenment.  I'm now on my third pair, and am hooked.  This book makes it simple to not only knit socks, but knit socks that fit.  The way the author organizes the main portion of the book is excellent,and allows the reader to knit a perfect sock in any weight yarn for any size foot.  I wish I had known it was this easy 20 years ago.
0316067601|5.0|Lone Survivor is one of the best books I have ever read, If not THE best. It is an ouststanding account of the what life is like in the teams and in war. Nothing what the bias media would dare say. Who ever came up with these bs ROE needs to either have their head examined or spend a week going thru the combat patrols that our nation asks of them. I bet most if not all of them would crap their pants and screem home to their moms. The liberal lying media needs to be banned from war zones if they cant be accurate in their reporting. I would highly recomed this book to anyone. It is very insghtful. Outstanding work HM1 SEAL Luttrell!!!! Thanks for your steadfast willingness to protect your country and its way of life Sir!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I trained with a personal trainer for over a year, so when I ordered this video and found out it was only 20 minutes, I thought it would be easy. WRONG. She gets your heart beat up right away and keeps it there. I just got the video and completed the first level. I'm considering doing the second one right away, after I have a water break. She doesn't give you any breaks! I'm still shaking a little after 5 completing the workout 10 minutes ago. I love this video, because she kicks your butt. Here's hoping I shred some weight in 30 days!
0679745653|5.0|Truman Capote was a naturally gifted writer, his prose effortless and poetic, straightforward and metaphorical.  With his novella \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" he created a quintessential American character in Holly Golightly, a persona who lives on beyond the reach of his words.  While most readers may come to this piece based upon the movie and have its characters and outcomes ingrained in their minds, the story Capote weaves in just over a hundred pages is more vibrant and more real.<br /><br />The novella begins with an unnamed narrator recollecting his times with Holly Golightly, a strange neighbor in his cheap New York apartment building.  He inadvertently shares in her joys and misfortunes, falling in love with her at the same time, as most men who come in contact with her do.  As Capote paints her, Holly is much harsher and more real character than the one famously depicted on screen.  Yet the same essence is there in characters who are forever searching for who they are and where they belong.  This novella is capped off by three short stories: \\"House of Flowers\\", \\"A Diamond Guitar\\", and \\"A Christmas Memory\\".<br /><br />\\"House of Flowers\\" is the story of a prostitute in Port-au-Prince who searches for and finds true love, only to have her past revisit her.  It is a quaint, richly woven story with some humorous elements.  \\"A Diamond Guitar\\" is the story of two inmates and an ill-fated escape effort, and is perhaps the weakest link in this collection.  The touchstone is the last story, \\"A Christmas Memory\\", the story of seven-year-old Buddy and his sixty-something cousin who are the best of friends.  He recounts their tradition of making fruitcakes and rounding up the Christmas tree and the presents they made for each other because they had no money and no one but each other.  It is a story that will leave you smiling and broken-hearted, offering perhaps one of the most bittersweet and perfect endings in all of literature.  In just over twenty pages it showcases the genius of Truman Capote.e genius of Truman Capote.
B000068CNX|5.0|This season is really funny. This season shows Phoebes song Smelly Cat. It shows Monica's older boyfriend Richard played by Tom Selleck. Rachel and Ross begin dating, and Joey is on a soap opera and Chandler uh well nothing much happens with him but he does get back together at the end of the season with Janice. They both go OH MY GOD and then they kiss and then everyone says OH MY GOD. I really love this season and I love FRIENDS. I do like it even more when Monica and Chandler go out.
B001KL3GWM|4.0|For a long time fan of the DTB this new cd can be a bit of a let down, though not because of the quality of the songs or the consistency of the performances.  The let down is the loss of the eclecticism of his previous works.  Derek and his band shine on this album; there are no weak tracks.  Derek is spot on and I believe the DTB is one of the best working bands out there.  For Derek and his band it is all about the music and they complement him so well.  For evidence of this see them live; they give one of the best live performances that you are likely to hear.  This album has a more mainstream sound, which for me, is not as exciting, but still very listenable.  Though I enjoy the early DTB, I believe the addition of Mike Mattison has added tremendously to the band.  That said I feel that having Doyle Bramhall guest on a couple of tracks is a misstep.  The songs are good, but I believe that his vocals interrupt the flow of the album and as a result the album has less of a band feel than it could.  This is my only real complaint.  All in all, I'm loving this album.  I can't get enough of the DTB.  Buy this you won't be disappointed.
B000002UAC|5.0|This might be the only album that changed the music biz and then initiated a change in global culture. In fact, it's possible to locate and date pop music before and after its release. Major pop stars, like Frank Sinatra and Elvis, had to adapt or retire.    Although there are some differences, this is much the same album as the Beatle's first US release (Meet the Beatles). Pop culture and fashion would never be the same.    It's also worth noting that the Beatles were the first pop group that was a band. They played their own instruments in the recordings. We take this for granted now, but when the Beatles first hit the scene, every other pop group was backed by studio musicians.    This allowed the Beatles to create a unique sound that had never been heard before. Their strange harmonies were anchored by a deep understanding and command of American pop music, under the guidance of a producer with serious classical roots. And yet, there's a savage undertow that would fuel rock music for decades. Add John, Paul and George's insightful lyrics, and the result is the most influential debut album ever released.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|These videos are amazing.  I couldn't believe how clear the picture appeared on the screen.  The narrarators all have soothing, easy-going voices which makes the videos more enjoyable.  They are very informative and get right in the center of all of the action (which can be pretty sad:( ).  Can't go wrong buying this though.
B0000041Z6|5.0|Solti is superlative in Mahler. Strong,sober and precise. Is the exactly opposite of the affected and pretentious style of Bernstein. The orquestal balance and the management of dynamics is excellent. Is, by far, the best whole cycle. For individual alternatives to some symphonies, I would like to mention Klemperer 2, 7 and 9; Mengelberg 4; Barbirolli 2, 6 and 9; Horenstein 3.

B000XA5K4I|5.0|SHOOT `EM UP<br /><br />**** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- September 7th, 2007<br /><br />Running Time- 86-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Writer/Director- Michael Davis<br /><br />Starring- Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, Monica Bellucci, Stephen McHattie, Daniel Pilon<br /><br />Shoot `Em Up is one of those movies you'll either love or hate; you'll sit there watching it and be entertained or roll your eyes at the extremely over the top action scenes. Make no mistake about it Shoot `Em Up features some of the most over the top action scenes ever captured on films. In the past I have written negative reviews on movies like this, but like I said in those reviews it's all about how it's done. Why does it work well in others and ruin other movies? I'm not quite sure, but these crazy and over the top action scenes work really well here at least for me and I was entertained from the start.<br /><br />This movie totally lives up to it's name with action and more action; any lulls in the action sequences don't last long and while the plot for Shoot `Em Up is a little thin it's also good enough to make up for the breaks in the action. I'm a very harsh critic of the action genre these days. Since the Michael Bay era started action movies got worse and worse; it's gotten to the point to where I barley watch American action movies anymore. When done right like in Kill Bill and Rambo the action genre can still pack a punch, but more often than not they lack and I'm reminded why I don't bother with action flicks, but than Shoot `Em Up comes around and reminds why I love these movies.<br /><br />The screenplay by Michael Davis is filled with silly dialogue all intentional of course and filled with some really crazy action scenes. But yet the script works well and the characters are excellent, which is also thanks to the actors selling it. The plot isn't that strong and mostly just a set up for the action, but Shoot `Em Up is a lot better written than I thought it would be. It's often funny and has some really cool characters.<br /><br />Michael Davis also directs and the pace is always moving forward any lulls in the action scenes are brief. The action starts in the opening and each time out they're just as exciting as the last. Like I said the action sequences are really crazy and over the top, which can sometimes ruin a movie, but to the credit of Michael Davis he really makes it work well and makes it so much fun. I think Davis, makes one of the better action flicks of the decade. Michael Davis is able to craft one hell of a fun ride.<br /><br />In the era of not only poor action movies we are also in an era of really poor action stars, while there are a couple of good ones, most of these so called action stars are pathetic, but where they all fail Clive Owen succeeds. Simply put Clive Owen has one of the coolest characters in recent memory and he totally sells it and makes for one of the top action stars in a long time. I think with more action flicks Clive Owen can really make a name for himself as one of the very best.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent with Monica Bellucci has the talent to match her looks and Paul Giamatti just simply rocks. Despite starring in some Oscar nominated movies, which includes an Oscar, win for Giamatti, plus numerous awards nominations (and some wins) he really is such an underrated actor. Not enough people are talking about this guy and he is truly a talented actor and he rocks in Shoot `Em Up and works great with Clive Owen.<br /><br />Bottom line is this; Shoot `Em Up is a crazy over the top movie and you'll either love it or hate it. I thought this one was a blast, but it's not for everyone.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is top notch with an excellent picture and even better sound. This is the perfect movie on Blu-ray.

B001P36OY2|2.0|This film keeps wanting to be Riddick, or Pitch Black, or Thunderdome, and even has themes out of Resident Evil and the Fifth Element --it borrows bits from a lot of cool sci-fi movies of the last twenty years, but it doesn't quite click. There are some interesting action scenes, like flying missile drones chasing snowmobiles, but it seems to swing from expensive FX scenes, to grim, urban, post apocalypse scenes, which would be fine, except there are no zombies. If you're going to have monochrome gray post-apocalypse scenes you need zombies, unless you're doing a Eastern European love story, in which case, you need zombies shagging. The whole thing could have been shot in black and white and you'd have never noticed the difference.     The upside is that you do get to see Vin Diesel growl at people and blow stuff up, which I think we've all missed.

0525950079|5.0|In a 14th century Kingsbridge forest knights are slain and a secret is buried.   This is the thread that runs through the novel's 1,024 pages.  Merthin, his brother Ralph, Caris and Gwenda are the young witnesses to these events.  The ensuing multiple storylines weaves through the maturation of these four individuals as they develop into strong-willed women, treacherous knight and a builder of magnificent cathedrals.    When I first read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" many years ago I thought it was terrific and had hoped author Ken Follett would write more novels like that.  He did.  \\"World Without End\\" is a worthy sequel to \\"Pillars.\\"  Set 200 years after the first novel, Kingsbridge is now a center of commerce where authority is continually being wrested between the Church, the aristocracy and the merchant class.  Political intrigue, war, plague and salacious sandals are all a part of 14th century Kingsbridge.  Follett brings all of this to life in a sprawling landscape.    Anyone who has enjoyed \\"Pillars\\" won't be disappointed by this wonderful novel.  Score \\"World Without End\\" with 5-stars.
141690977X|4.0|I'm not sure that I needed to read this book, but I'm glad I did anyway.  Both Greg and Liz have that air of 'been there, done that' and it is refreshing to get a guy's point-of-view.<br /><br />The situations presented are ones that crop up in real life and the advice he gives to each situation is sound (and sometimes silly).  Greg will make little snarky comments that are not just amusing but true.  Even when you're getting depressed about your chances of finding a decent man he throws in some optimistic and self-conscious boosting comment that makes you feel hopeful again.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the 'workbook' sections.  I liked having another opportunity to get out my crayons ^_^
B001EN71DG|2.0|I received this item as a gift as it was on my wish list.    When it arrived it had been shipped in a padded envelope and one corner of the item was significantly crushed.    I returned it as damaged and wrote in the comments \\"perhaps if the item were shipped in a box rather than an envelope it would have prevented the damage from occurring\\".    When I received the replacement it did arrive in a box, however, almost as if to be sarcastic, they didn't put any packing material in the box to prevent the item from bouncing around inside of it. Subsequently a corner of the replacement item was crushed as well although not as predominantly.    If the appearance of the box is of concern to you, I would suggest purchasing from a walk-in retailer. After receiving this set from here, I opted to buy the prequel at such a retailer.
B001E75QGG|5.0|Never saw this in the theaters, so I waited to buy the blu-ray. Awesome movie and in highdef.     The end of the movie is pretty much a \\"no way in hell\\" and some of the action scenes follow that same logic... but come on.. it's INDY and it's been 18yrs or so since the last movie when that was supposed to be the last crusade. This movie does have that feel of the old movies in it, which I was glad it did. It was nicely filmed and the plot was nicely done.     I'm not a huge fan of Shia, and the crystal skull logic was a tad off.. The myth about the skulls wasn't about aliens and it being their actual heads, the real crystal skulls in the world are that of human shapes.    But.. rumor has it an Indy 5 is coming and will be the actual final movie of the series. Just hope it has some of the nostalgia of the series as this one did.
0743496736|3.0|This book had such poor editing problems which so ticks me off. Plus, for such a sensitive subject matter, all the editing issues and the non sufficient timeline make such a mess, who was editing here?  Why was this author so quick to rush through writing this book? The time was not taking to get the years and ages of past and present correctly in tact. Also piecing the references together, And..... Starting with the current time of the book only to have it not coincide with the time frame it should've been in. The reader is left with massive gaps and given pieces of a puzzle only to have them later totally ignored (MISSING). That is the problem with these sellout contracts, the quotas are so asinine, that the writer may be prolific, yet lacks that integral \\"substance\\" that make their writing great.   And... Hello! I guess anyone can skip law school and rush in to the states attorneys office to be a public defender WOW!   I am an avid reader, I am quick on detail I absorb it, and I was very disappointed in the sloppy, rushed and massively GAPPED nature in which this book was written.   Such a shame for a book that had such potential.
6305161992|4.0|I saw this movie on skinamax and fell asleep before I finshed watching it, so I came on here and picked it up for 60 cents.<br /><br />I can't complain about it for what I paid. It's basically Drago (Rocky 4) vs Tsung (Mortal Kombat 1). That pretty much sums up the whole plot. It's a typical guy movie and it shows a very nice full frontal of Tia Carrere ;)<br /><br />It's a good movie, check it out.

B001PPLIEQ|5.0|I've heard so many complaints about this movie. It's not Bond enough, where are the gadgets, it's more like Bourne than Bond.     I don't know what Bond movies these people are fans of but I loved it. This is Bond. It is a continuation of Casino Royale and should be seen as such. Which basically means Bond still isn't fully formed and quite honestly after the last abysmal Brosnan Bond, I don't want him to be. The Brosnan Bonds were much closer to Roger Moore than Sean Connery and that isn't Bond to me. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery and I can't wait to see where the series goes from here.    Bottom line is this. QOS is a great addition to the Bond franchise and a great follow up to Casino Royale. See it and determine for yourself which side you fall on.

B001GJOL22|5.0|Fantastic DVD. If you have been watching the R30 concert being shown in HD on cable, buy this DVD. You will see what HD is supposed to look like. Not the highly compressed stuff cable and satellite are showing.    I gave it 5 stars for the main program footage and menus. Be prepared that the archival bonus material on the DVD is not even close to the quality of the Snakes & Arrows concert. It is entertaining to watch so I am glad it is there, but is definitely lower quality.  I guess if the main program did not look so good, it would not be so obvious.
B00005JMX6|4.0|I bought it, because I didn't see the unrated edition. Fiqured with all the nudity in this movie that Elisha Cuthbert would show something... no. You'll be disapointed.    The plot is pretty unbeleivable as it surrounds a highschool kid in love with a girl he has no chance with, and after falling in love with her, he finds out she does porn and freaks out. She leaves... go fiqure.    If you don't mind being C* teased by Elisha then check it out. Never fiqured out how you could make a film about porno and nudity and be the main character and not show anything?? Kinda weird, but apparently she's more popular in the NHL anyways.. lol. Oh well.
0156030209|5.0|Every time I go back to the US to visit friends and family, I always make a visit to a bookstore or two.  I can buy books here in Japan, but the prices are high and the selection isn't nearly as good, so a trip to our local mega-bookstore is like a visit to Mecca for me.    The last time I was home, my father let me wander for a while, and then he came up and handed me this book.  He was picking up copies for a few other people as well, but he gave me this and said, \\"I think you'd really like it.\\"    He was right.    It's one of those books that you feel compelled to share with others once you've finished. It's one of those books where people see you reading it and say, \\"I read that - it's really good, isn't it?\\"  It's one of those books which, the author promises, will make you believe in God.  A pretty tall order, but there you go.  And in a roundabout way, it makes good on its promise.  But we'll get to that....    It's a story of layers, as the best stories often are.  On one layer, it's the tale of young Piscine Molitor Patel, an Indian boy with an insatiable curiosity about everything.  The son of a zookeeper, Piscine - who re-christens himself Pi in order to clear up misunderstandings of his given name - develops a great interest in the world around him, especially religion.  His part of India is home to people of all faiths, and he finds himself moving between Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, despite the protests of holy men of all three faiths.    He grows up in this world, between animals and gods, until his family decides to escape India's political turmoil by moving to Canada.  They sell what animals they can, keep the ones they must, board everything onto a freighter and head off for a trip around the world, destined for a new life.    Until the ship sinks.    Pi finds himself the only human survivor of the ship's sinking, alone on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  Alone except for the zebra.  And the hyena.  And the orangutan.  And, of course, the tiger.  Can't forget the tiger.    Pi's mini-zoo diminishes quickly, of course.  There's only so long such a diverse group of creatures can abide each other's company in such terrible circumstances, so in time it comes down to two: Pi and the tiger, who had the unusual name of Richard Parker.  You would think that there would be no winner in this contest - a diminished teenage boy against a full-grown tiger, with limited resources and a very stressful environment.  But Pi is the son of a zookeeper, one whose job is to know how to control animals that don't want to be controlled.  Pi's ability to survive in these circumstances would, by itself, be a fascinating story.    But the story is not just about Pi and the tiger.  Not really.  It's also about our relationship with the world, with the universe, with God.  It's about who we are when everything we ever loved is stripped away from us.  And it's about how we can survive in even the most extraordinary circumstances.  Pi does survive, and his survival makes sense, within the world of the story.  Would he be able to do it out here in Real Life (TM)?  I have no idea.  But as you read, there is no point where you think, \\"The author is cheating,\\" and allowing his main character to survive when he really shouldn't have.    The overriding theme of the book, however, is stories.  The book itself is set up as a memoir, told by Patel to the author.  It's the story of a story, and it is a story which the author says will make you believe in God.  And in a way, it does.  But not in the way you think.    It's kind of a modified version of Pascal's Wager - the idea that it is better to believe in God than not to believe.  Pascal's idea is simple.  If you disbelieve in God, and you're right, then you'll just wink out of existence when you die.  No harm, no foul.  But if  you disbelieve and you're wrong, then you end up suffering eternal damnation.  Whereas if you believe in God and you're wrong, again, no harm, no foul.There are criticisms, and fair ones, of this philosophy, but I think this book offers a more reasonable alternative.  You should believe in God because believing in God is the better story.  Martel suggests (through Pi) that there is no mystery in facts and reason, no magic and no wonder.  That the unrepentant atheist whose last thoughts are, \\"I believe I am losing brain function\\" lacks the imagination of the unrepentant atheist who has a deathbed conversion.  In other words, by sticking only to what can be known and proven, one misses the better story.    I don't necessarily agree with this.  I think it's an interesting point of view, and as long as one can remain aware that belief is not truth, I think I can let it go, but I don't believe that the world of fact and reason is without brilliant stories.  Look at the story of life on earth - a three and a half billion year epic of survival, death and rebirth.  Look at the story of a lowly paperclip - born in the heart of an exploding star, and representing five thousand years of human progress towards extelligence.  There are great stories, astounding stories out there in the world that don't need to be believed because they are true.  There is evidence for them, and their veracity  can be proven.    But Martel's isn't about what is provably true.      Pi offers a choice: given two possible explanations for something, with no evidence to support either one, which explanation would you choose?  The answer is, whichever explanation makes for the better story.  Pi's adventure is an example of that.  As readers, we choose to believe Pi's story, because it's fascinating.  We don't sit there and think, \\"This is bull.  A teenage boy taming a tiger?  Puh-leeze.\\"  We believe the story, while at the same time knowing that it is not, technically, \\"true.\\"    So it is with God.  We believe in God, regardless of whether God is \\"true,\\" because it's a more interesting story.  And Pi's adherence to three mutually exclusive religions suggests that the God of Pi isn't to be found in a book or a church, in the words of a priest or a holy man.  The God of Pi is everywhere, and doesn't care if we believe or not.  But we should believe, Pi suggests.  Because that's the better story.    The best books leave us thinking, and burrow into our brains to give us something to chew on for a while.  So it is with this book.  My rational part and my romantic part argue over the meaning of this story, and whether or not Pi's conclusion is valid.  Sometimes I agree, and sometimes I don't.  That's just how it is.  But one thing I can say with certainty is that this is a very good book.  And you should read it.
B001MW0J2O|4.0|For my money, Animal Collective's previous attempts at forging some pastiche of tribal spontaneity and skewed approximations of Beach Boy harmonies all failed miserably.  I just didn't \\"get\\" them.  The supposed cathartic power of their whimsical non-melodic non-pop song experiments was, to my confused ears, just pretentious dreck.  The depth of their unconventionality, I was convinced, was matched only by their lack of talent.    Needless to say, this album really changed my opinion of the band.  This is, as has been echoed by all of the fawning critics, their most polished, accessible, and ultimately best work to date.  Which is to say, of course, that this is far from Top 40 material.  The subtle layering of vocals over the wafting ether of what sounds like an orchestra of found organic sounds is really quite gorgeous.    In an age of the quick fix, individual MP3 song download, it is refreshing to hear an entire album that was and is meant as a whole album to be listened to in one sitting, in its entirety.  MPP plays like some alien pastoral symphony, as one long piece divided into subtly shifting movements designated as \\"songs\\".    So maybe I was wrong about the band this whole time?  I will definitely have to revisit their previous albums.
1401201911|5.0|Every culture has its icons.  Characters or figures that are recognizable by anybody who lives there, figures that are almost impossible not to know.  And America is very good at producing those icons and spreading them worldwide.  I remember reading somewhere - I don't remember where at the moment - that the United States' chief export is dreams, and I think there's definitely something to that.    Of all the dreams to emerge from the American subconscious over the last century, Superman is one of the most enduring.  Show that \\"S\\" shield to almost anyone on the planet and they'll probably know what it is.  For most of his lifetime, he has stood for Truth, Justice and the American Way, with the third element to that tag line slowly vanishing as writers with a more global perspective take over the character.    Regardless of his jingoistic past, Superman still remains a popular American figure.  He represents what we would like to be, as a country.  Powerful and just, upright and honest, but at the same time kind and generous and, at heart, good.  Superman has the power to control the world, but he doesn't - he chooses not to - and we like to believe that it was his small-town, American upbringing that instilled such humility in him.    This book examines how things might have gone.    In the late '80s, DC Comics introduced their \\"Elseworlds\\" imprint, with a pretty simple mandate: take canon DC characters and place them in new situations or environments.  This way you could see how Batman might have turned out in an America that had never gained its independence, or what would have happened to the JLA without Superman, or if The Flash had taken the bullet meant for JFK.  It opened creative doors, allowing writers to tell new stories about familiar characters without disrupting the regular continuity of the DC Comics line.    Of these, Superman: Red Son is one of the best.  Mark Millar poses a simple question with a very complex answer: What if young Kal-L's rocket had landed in Soviet Ukraine instead of Kansas?    What emerges is a fascinating tale of a Superman brought up under Stalinist philosophy.  Still the good man that we know him to be, Superman nonetheless chooses a very different means of interacting with the world. We see from the first few pages that the man cannot stand still - he is constantly in motion trying to save people, not just in the Soviet Union, but anywhere in the world.  It is his responsibility, he believes, to keep people safe, much in the manner of Soviet philosophy where the government controls nearly every aspect of its citizens' lives.    Taken in by Stalin, Superman eventually rises to lead the Soviet Union to nearly world-wide dominance.  Under his rule there are no accidents, no wars and no conflicts.  Crime is nearly non-existent, and those who do not mesh well in this well ordered world are mentally reprogrammed until they do.  There are dissidents, of course, like the mysterious Batman, a singular force of chaos in Superman's perfectly ordered world, but in the end, even he falls.  The only true challenge to Superman's worldwide reign is the brilliant American scientist Lex Luthor, who has devoted his life to freeing mankind from alien tyranny.    It's a brilliant take on the myth, with a lot of very familiar characters worked in.  The art is gorgeous, with a style and a color palette that evokes thoughts of Soviet-era propaganda posters, yet never fails to be dynamic and fascinating.    More important, however, is the message of the story.  The idea that comics can have a message is something that a lot of people seem to ignore, fueling the idea that comics are just for kids.  The message in Red Son is very important and very, very timely.    The story was published in 2003, a time when America was in great pain.  We had been badly hurt and wanted to set things right.  By doing so, however, we caused far more damage to the world than we had ourselves endured.  By trying to fix other people's problems, we created even more, and the harder we pushed, the more the world pushed back.  And this was not a new trend - one of the negative labels often affixed to the United States is that of \\"world policeman.\\"  We have a long, long habit of trying to help everyone, whether that is the right thing to do or not.    In that vein, the Superman of Red Son, despite being a Soviet, is a reflection of ourselves.  He is a man of immense power, who decides to help everybody.  His intentions are good, but good intentions are not always rewarded with good results.  His world is orderly, yes - crime and violence are nearly unheard-of - but it comes at the price of individual freedom.  People are no longer in control of their own destinies with Superman in charge, and while that may be a safe life, it is not one that I would like to live.    The political message of this book is subtle, but it's there.  More interestingly, it's a message that can be enjoyed by a broad spectrum of political views.  If you're a liberal, then it's taking a stance against imperialism, against the imposition of one country's values and politics over others', all in the name of making the world a better place.  If you're a conservative, it's a call for individual liberty.  A government that provides everything for its people is just another form of oppression - without the freedom to make their own choices, for good or for ill, people are not truly free.    In the end it's a complex tale, with no real good guys and no real bad guys.  Except for Brainiac, who will probably never be anything but a bad guy.  It's a story about the choices we make, both as citizens and as societies, and the understanding that we must have the freedom to make those choices.  They may sometimes be the wrong ones, but making mistakes is part of the package.  In the end, there can be no Superman to save us.  We must save ourselves.
0790729350|4.0|[...]    FOR THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY, NEW EDITIONS ARE FINALLY ON THE WAY, INCLUDING SPECIAL LIMITED COLLECTORS' EDITIONS (REGULAR AND BLU-RAY) WITH AN EXCLUSIVE EXTRA (FOURTH) DISC FOR AMAZON CUSTOMERS! Or, for those less adventursome, the \\"regular\\" Director's Cut will now come with two discs.    While I must agree with the previous reviewer who finds the current (now, thankfullt, deleted) version of this DVD transfer to be sonically and visually inferior to the VHS version, this is still a great film of a fantastic and pivotal moment in music and social history. The music presented here shows these artists (Hendrix; Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; Santana (and others)) at their most raw and edgy. These may not be the best performances of some of these songs, but the combination of fresh music, excitement, ragged energy, and exhausted elation more than makes up for the roughness presented in some of the music. IMPORTANTLY, A GORGEOUSLY PACKAGED \\"ULTIMATE COLLECTORS' EDITION\\" IS IMMINENTLY DUE (look it up on Amazon), as well as a BLU-RAY VERSION (also to be found on Amazon); so those of you upset by the quality of the current DVD \\"DIRECTOR'S CUT\\" have a real treat to look forward to. Yes, I too am dumping my current DVD copy of Woodstock while it's \\"hot\\" to wait on the arrival of THE NEW VERSIONS! It IS the 40th ANNIVERSARY, ISN'T IT? No more rain! No more rain!
0141018828|5.0|I don't read a lot of philosophy.  I'm not sure why, since philosophy is really the province of the Liberal Arts graduate, and that's what I am.  Even worse, I was a political science major, and pol-sci is really just applied philosophy.  You ask yourself questions like, \\"What is man's obligation to man?\\" and \\"How can a society best benefit everyone involved in it?\\" and the next thing you know it's three in the morning and you're on your twelfth cup of Denny's coffee.    Arguing the meaning of life in a diner, however, isn't considered to be \\"real\\" philosophy.  Philosophy these says means making up your own lexicon, creating words to describe concepts that you have spun out of the rhetorical ether - or, in philosophical terminology, \\"just made up.\\"  So you get phrases in modern philosophy that go on for pages and pages, and have so many recursive clauses that you wind up having to go back to the beginning just to figure out where you left off.    So, if you're like me - and it's not impossible that you are - and you don't feel like delving into the murkiest depths of intellectual waters, I can solidly recommend Marcus Aurelius' immortal Meditations.  There is no beginning, there is no end - you can open up the book anywhere, read for a while, and then put it down.    Written back in the 2nd century, Meditations is a collection of Marcus' thoughts on life, existence, and how to be a good and moral man.  Some of those observations are long, a page or two, but most of them are just a few lines.  It's kind of as though Marcus was hanging out at his camp in Carnuntum and he had a Thought.  \\"Pen!\\" he would yell, \\"and paper!\\"  He'd scribble his idea down and put it away to be filed away later.  Whether he had any great plans for this collection of ideas, we'll never know.   He was an Emperor, of course, and it's pretty normal for Emperors to want to make themselves look brilliant in history.  But, as you read the book, you realize that Marcus' mind wasn't on history.  Whybother, he'd say.  It'll all be the same in a thousand years anyway.    Death is ever-present in this text.  When you start to worry about whether you're living up to the example set by your ancestors, don't bother - they're dead and gone, and they couldn't care less about who you have become.  Are you always concerned with what people will think of you after you die?  Why worry about it?  You'll be dead, for one thing, and beyond caring, and in any case whatever you have accomplished will be gone when the last person who remembers you is himself dead.    Marcus is very clear in his views on death: it's part of nature, part of the ceaseless change which controls everything in this world.  We came into this world, built from the atoms and essences of the dead who had gone before us, and one day we will return to that ceaselessly changing sea of Nature.  Our lives are mere moments when measured against the vastness of eternity, and our powers are meaningless against those of the gods and the world that gave birth to us.  \\"Remember that Man lives only in the present, in this fleeting instant,' he said.  \\"All the rest of his life's either past and gone, or not yet revealed.\\"    In this way, there are some definite parallels between Marcus' Stoic philosophy and Zen philosophy, though they're centuries apart.  Both Zen and Stoicism emphasize living in the present moment - not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  The only time in which you really exist is right now, and so it should be your only concern.  Don't let other people's opinions of you govern your feelings - you can't control them, you shouldn't expect to be able to.  You can, however, control yourself.  \\"Will anyone sneer at me?\\" he asks.  \\"That will be his concern; mine will be to ensure that nothing I do or say shall deserve the sneer.\\"    Yes, this book is very quotable.    Where Stoicism and Zen would probably part ways is on Marcus' reliance on Reason as a supreme governing power.  He maintains that a man's reason is the only thing that he can truly claim as his own, and that it should be ready at hand at all times.  In any situation, presented with any person or object, the first thing that a person should do is turn his reason upon it.  Figure out what it is, at its root, and once you know that, everything else will become clear.    I'm a big fan of Reason.  We're humans, and we're bound to believe stupid things from time to time, but we're also possessed of some very clever brains, and an excellent ability to turn those brains on to solving problems.  But far too few people actually use those brains.  We allow our passions to override our reason and end up doing stupid things to ourselves and each other.  As hard as it may be, I'm with Marcus on this one - without reason, we're not really humans.  At best, we're children, at worst we're beasts.  It is our duty to the world to understand it, without illusion or self-deception.    Frankly, I think Marcus would be very disappointed at how little progress we've made on this regard.  I mean, it's been nearly two thousand years, after all, plenty of time to deal with our superstitions and our illusions.  On the other hand, I think he'd be flattered that his words had lasted so long and had influenced so many people.    It's a great text, one that calls from the past to remind us of some very important truths - that we are here, now, and we are each in control of our own lives.  We are possessed with a limitless ability to understand our universe, and to not use that reason is to waste the best part of ourselves.
0316035904|1.0|I have heard amazing things about David Sedaris for a number of years now and I have always been curious about this book. I decided to go ahead and read it this past holiday season. From what I heard about Sedaris I expected a gut busting, laugh out loud collection of short stories.    The book is a collection of holiday stories. Each story is either set during a holiday or includes holiday ideas. Unfortunately, the stories were not the hilarious type of stories I had anticipated from Sedaris. The humor in the book was more sarcastic than funny. I actually found the book rather boring, offensive, and I only laughed out loud once...in the first story. I have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor and some dry wit but in order to appreciate this book and its stories the reader must be beyond simple sarcasm. Sedaris leaves nothing as sacred. The first story about working as a mall elf in SantaLand was somewhat humorous because I have worked in retail before. However, I was rather distraught and angered by what happened in the second story with the family and the new child. I think this story tainted the rest of my enjoyment of the book.     Sadly, I was disappointed in this book and am somewhat apprehensive to read any other work of he has done.
B001K61O6C|4.0|We all love this album or else you wouldn't be reading this but with so many versions out there which one should you buy?<br /><br />This hybrid SACD (also playable on any CD player or computer) is the ultimate version pertaining to sound quality.  The new Mobile Fiselity Sound Labs (MoFi or MFSL) has been hitting things out of the park lately.  This release is about as good as it gets.  Their new mastering engineer Rob LoVerde mastered the SACD and vinyl editions from the original master tapes and presented us with a clear and dynamic disc.  I'm not sure how you could make these tapes sound any better.<br /><br />Thanks for another fantastic release MoFi!

B001MW0J2O|4.0|The hype has been deafening to say the least.  As soon as this album leaked, there were bloggers and reviewers literally falling all over themselves to praise this album.  They were already declaring the race for best album of 2009 over 20 days in to the new year and some even went so far as to declare Merriweather Post Pavilion the best album of the decade.  One thing is clear, if 2008 lacked a clearly defined critical darling, 2009 already has one with this album.      MPP is sort of a refinement of the direction Animal Collective took with Strawberry Jam.  Strawberry Jam may have been their first major stab at pop songwriting, and it felt like a conscious break from their previous work.  Instead of working with studio trickery and writing songs based on what kind of warped madness and manipulation they could throw in, Strawberry Jam's songwriting felt sturdy, like they could stand on their own with just an acoustic guitar.  MPP has this sturdy songwriting as well for the most part, and most of the rougher parts have been sanded off as well.  There's no crazy howling like on Reverend Green or Peacebone this time out.  MPP is smooth, dreamy, and downright pleasant.  It might be their most accessible album.      MPP makes use of drum loops, samples, and electronics for most of its sound backdrops.  It's not electro-pop exactly, but it uses these elements to make a hazy and dreamy atmosphere for most of the songs.  It fits in with Radiohead's Kid A and Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as albums that make creative use out of electronics while not being full blown electronica albums.        Sonically, it's most indebted to Panda Bear's solo album Person Pitch, particularly on songs like Guys Eyes and My Girls, where there's a lot of repetition and texture.  As usual, the vocals are filled with reverb, and have layered harmonies.  I'll drop the obligatory Beach Boys reference, because Noah Lennox sounds quite a bit like Brian Wilson.  It also seems that Lennox is taking a more prominent position in the band.  That may account for MPP's less abrasive qualities.      For me, most Animal Collective albums have been a bit scattershot.  I usually like three or four tunes one each album, and the rest I can without.  MPP falls a bit in to the same pattern.  My Girls is an amazing song, and maybe my favorite Animal Collective song.  It captures their optimistic, even childish side very well.  He just wants to take care of his girls.  Summertime Clothes is the catchiest song on the album.  It's got a very memorable and very bright sounding chorus.  The closer Brothersport is another obvious highlight, as is Lion in a Coma.      This time around the songs that aren't highlights are better overall.  Daily Routine, No More Runnin, and Guys Eyes are all good songs in their own right, but they don't get as much play as the four mentioned above.      MPP is the most immediate and the most enjoyable Animal Collective album.  There are fewer rough edges, fewer weird and warped moments, and it's a very cohesive album overall.  Animal Collective, though widely loved in some circles, was kind of on the indie rock periphery.  A lot of people didn't get them or outright disliked them.  MPP is their shot at becoming widely accepted.  It wouldn't surprise me if this album actually charted in the Top 30 on the Billboard Charts.
B0009QZ4CO|5.0|I LOVE this album.  This is probably my favorite Van Der Graaf album, even though I frequently point out Pawn Hearts as the perfect starting point for the band.  Both albums rule a lot.      On Still Life, we have sentimental vocals that soar, sail, and RIP through my emotional feelings personally.  The sax solos are quite melodic too.  I'm still a bit shocked how awesome this album is and yet, it HASN'T gone on to become a classic.      I think once you feel the emotional brilliance in the lead singers voice and the way his voice just perfectly sails in all kinds of directions (with each vocal melody hitting the nail RIGHT on the head) you will see why I'm making such a big deal about Still Life.  A CLASSIC!    Oh sure, I'm not going back on my word that all Van Der Graaf albums sound pretty much the same, but there's definitely something special about Still Life.  The band turned it up a notch for this one.  Everything feels slightly improved all around.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the finest Musical OF ALL TIME! I've now watched this over 30 times and it still amuses me in the same way as the first time I've watched it.

B00005UT85|5.0|What makes Caravan's debut so interesting is how the vocal melodies are simply gorgeous and likeable for ANYONE, not just fans of progressive rock.  To me that makes Caravan one of the most likeable bands of all-time.  The way they can be enjoyed by just about anyone.  It's all because of that lead singers amazing voice.<br /><br />I take that back- AMAZING voice!  Amazing because more often than not it feels like he's breathing directly into your soul with his voice.  It makes you wanna cry most of the time (or maybe just me- hey, I cry a lot.  I even cried during Homeward Bound.  Remember that great adventure movie?)<br /><br />Also, the songs are written in a way that's not very challenging, allowing people who don't have a whole lot of patience in an ever-growing financially-struggling world to get into the music fairly easily.<br /><br />The final track on the album titled \\"Where But for Caravan Would I?\\" is nearly 10 minutes of emotional brilliance.  The way it starts with a beautiful vocal melody and then the melodic, eeric organs come out of nowhere and paint a VERY different picture!  Even more strange is the *next* vocal melody that occurs after the jam and the way it gently shifts into the calm \\"We need your mind to be flying\\" line.  This song alone is worth the purchase of Caravan's debut.<br /><br />\\"Magic Man\\" is pure hypnotic adventurousness and \\"Grandma's Lawn\\" takes psychedelia to the highest level it can with a catchy vocal melody.  \\"Place Of My Own\\" has a vocal melody that rolls forward in a way that almost sounds like the lead singer is worried about something but then leads into an upbeat chorus so all is well.  I love the line about living for today because \\"tomorrow you just might be dead\\".  It's true!  This is why you shouldn't believe in bad days.  Bad days don't exist.  You simply have bad *moments* of a certain day.  The entire day isn't ruined because of an unfortunate series of events.  I know you agree with me!<br /><br />\\"Ride\\" is AWESOME!  I love the simple, gentle way the verse melody is sung.  So carefree and beautiful.  I love the line \\"I'll try and find a place in my mind where you know you can go and leave all behind\\".  Hey take me with you!  I don't want to stick around this crappy wor... I mean lovely, excellent planet of ours!<br /><br />\\"Policeman\\" is a WONDERFUL Beatles-influenced pop song with a memorable vocal melody.  The way the tempos constant shift around is highly professional and exciting. \\"Cecil Rons\\" is an odd experimental track that was probably influenced by Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn album.  The psychedelic style is REALLY bizarre on this track thanks to the way the singer changes the sound of his voice and screams \\"CECIL RONS!\\" before quickly switching back to the more familiar beautiful vocal style.  \\"Love Song With Flute\\" is all about the softly sung verse melody.  Nobody writes better ballads than Caravan.  *Nobody*.<br /><br />Something about the way these guys write jams is pretty spectacular as well.  Just a very very good band.  The debut is a very good one, but probably the next two Caravan albums released directly after this one are better.  Not by much though!

0810970686|5.0|My boys like to read, but more than often, need oversight either by a parent or by their daily reading log for a grade.  Somehow they heard in school before Christmas that this book was coming out after the New Year (it was still on their Christmas list along with a real computer and Xbox 360 AND a second Wii) I knew the book was special.  We braved the cold when we knew it would be at Barnes and Noble.  My 10 year old felt as though the heavens opened and the ray of golden light shown down on the display 'waaaaa' we grabbed it.  Now he and his brother fight over who gets their turn at reading it.  I should have purchased two books.  I have never seen such a hunger to read a book in boys  - like this whole series!  Its incredible.  Somehow the story relates to all boys and other children.  Buy the book - you and your child(ren) won't be disappointed!  Nancy in Virginia
1881273156|5.0|The Five Love Languages is a great tool to understanding what makes us feel loved, appreciated, special and important. Isn't that what we all want. Chapman defines the 5 languages as gifts, quality time, physical touch, words of affirmations, and acts of service. He provides useful examples of each of the languages.    Once you know what makes you tick, you can ask for it;  and once you know what makes others feel important and loved, you can provide it. It's so simple.     I was so excited when I read it, I ran out to get the \\"5 Love Languages for teenagers\\". Then my teens and I sat down to discuss it. They were right on with my primary language, as I was with them. We instituted some changes in our household for the better.  It's made an amazing difference in the quality our relationship and the level of peace in our home.    I would recommend reading it with your partner/children/teens.

B000W91RUG|4.0|This quirky little show is a little to close to reality for me to appreciate the humor.  While everyone else in the room is roaring - I'm twitching with unease because I think I dated Sheldon.  Not the star but a real character who, in my reality, was actually named \\"Sheldon\\"!  I thought brainiacs were sexy - NO -  they are just guys who's brains have outgrown their heads.  The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me.  My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe (unto himself) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness.  I think this was the show when I mixed up the TV Sheldon with my Sheldon, another whiney hypocondriac. Oh lord - I'm so confused.<br />Bottom line - this is a funny funny show and well worth the price...bg
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|I'm watching the end of the movie as I write this review.  Too long.  No characters to really like or care for.  Too violent.  Too cruel.  Extremely thin plot (like all Batman movies).  Ridiculous body count.  Even with my surround sound and 1080p upconverting Sony DVD player, it can't be saved.  Nice special effects, but those don't make a movie.  If Ledger hadn't died tragically prior to the release, many of the reviews and ratings would likely be less kind. 'nuff said.<br /><br />Other reviews say this is the best Batman movie to date.  Perhaps, but the previous outings were even worse.<br /><br />And was I the only one wanting to give Batman a Ricola?<br /><br />Thankfully, it was a free rental!
1596434252|5.0|Despite reasons many will indeed find this 'book' as half-baked, the charms lay in its trick of exposing the alphabet to its stripped down basics by interesting (albeit repetitive) paperwork methods. While many books seem to be a complete waste of words, time and money, 'ABC3D' cleverly uses simplicity as a strong weapon in getting one's attention.    This is not a book made to shock, work against or force your (momentary) opinion. It is plain alphabet; it might intrigue a child - however, it won't stop adults from running through the clean, strict pages of black, red and white architectural lettering.     Disappointments aside for the plain aspects of what it is, 'ABC3D' manages to trigger imagination. It is not the first on the issue of paper artistry, still it is a brave experiment in terms of a book with its very own identity. Capitals, designed in some way to surprise us on occasion, do work as minimalist fun - sort of an avantgarde 'picture book', one El Lissitzky would be really proud of.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I thought this movie was great.  It was an awesome way for Heath (R.I.P.) to end his career.  The acting was good, the action was intense and I think this movie deserves a few awards.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Sure This album isn't confessions 2, but it's really good in it's own way. Madonna tries something diffirent besides the same stuff she's used before. Sure It isn't sorry or jump. But there are other songs that make this album stand out,such as candy shop. It has some of the old style from madonna's previous it may a simple minded song but it's really good and worth a listen to and you'll be dancing in no time. Another Track that is worth a listen to is heart beat. Miles away is another hit which I believe is her third single. Spanish lesson is good, so is Devil Won't recognize you. You should really give this album a chance. I have no idea why this album has been bashed sure it isn't madonna's greatest album of all time. But It truly is good in it's own way. So give it a try you might be surprized on how good it is. :)
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Just a few notes.  The Lamb slide show is amazing.  That's how I saw it years ago at the Montreal Forum when they played it in it's entirety.  The Lamb is one of my favorite Genesis albums and listening it in DTS with these visuals is a treat.  That's how all 5.1 remixes should be shown.  The addition of optional lyrics as a subtitle track would have been nice, as it would be for any 5.1 releases of classic rock albums.  But they should have removed the track number and track title on the screen or made it an optional subtitle track.  A bonus would have been the complete shoot of the super 8mm movie that was used only in bits on the DVD.  On the The Lamb DVD is a complete performance of Supper's Ready from a french TV show.  To show it \\"widescreen\\", they cropped it up and down.  I guess that's a bad habit now.  What a shame.  I don't mind seeing black bars left and right of the screen to see the TV show's full frame.  Note to producers:  do not crop!    I would have liked more visuals from the first 3 albums, but what can you get...  Those were the dark days when things were not well recorded, sporadically recorded, and kept in so-so conditions.
0316067598|5.0|This book was quite possibly one of the most important and powerful books that I have read in my adult life.  From Navy SEALs BUD/S training through deployment into the mountains of Afghanistan, Mr. Luttrell vividly illustrates every aspect of his incredible military experience.      This book impacted me significantly, I could hardly put it down until I finally finished it with utter sorrow for what occurred to these brave warriors.  I was left with the profound understanding of their patriotism and dedication, and I remain awed by the selflessness and courage they showed in their darkest hours.      Ultimately, I understand the author's point about the political climate and how it cost his comrades their lives.  I understand, and I agree.  And I think Mr. Luttrell has aptly enshrined the memory of his fallen colleagues as they deserved, and as few men could.  I think policymakers in Washington should read this book and take a moment to consider the unintended consequences of halfhearted decisions and unreasonable standards, because these are the things that cost lives.
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|I'm sure there are plenty of people who will say \\"duh\\" to this, but for those expecting to get some remastered 1080p, hi-def version of arguably one of the coolest sci-fi movies, then you are sadly mistaken. While it comes on a Blu-ray disk and has all the neat things that offers, like pop up in-movie menu and such, it simply doesn't offer a better visual experience. I've had the VHS, and at least one DVD version of this movie, and the picture stopped getting better at the DVD level. Why shouldn't it though, I mean look how long ago the thing was made. Lets face it though, it is still a huge let down because we've been led to believe that Blu-ray = 1080p/hi-def and that just isn't the case.<br /><br />Over all, its an awesome movie, with lots of action and things going on, and I'm not mad that it isn't hi-def because Amazon had it for an unbeatable price of less than $15 and it does come with some goodies. Take it for what it's worth, but don't expect the image quality of the new Iron Man on Blu-ray when you pop this disc in!
B000UJ48XG|5.0|I can't get enough of this album and I've had it for over 6 months! The music is just so rich with feeling. Zach's crooning voice is very unique along with his eccentric writing. Just check him out on youtube or myspace and see for yourself.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|i cant say enough about this show im a 24 year old guy and as one reviewer stated its not just for girls this show is very well written and the acting is flawless especially with alexis bledel playing rory the daughter of lorelai played by lauren graham together they are the gilmore girls they live in a peaceful town where everyone seems to know each other the humor and quirkyness of the characters is so enjoyable to watch as well as the chemistry of rory and lorelai i highly recommend this to anyone!
B000F5GO0A|5.0|I bought this album, fell in love with it, lost it, and now I just MUST buy it again! I can't live much longer without it! Their second album The Flying Club Cup is amazing as well. Great talent this kid has!
B000LPS4BG|5.0|fans of this classic mob movie should be pleased with the transfer it brings out small details in the movie i missed on standard dvd as for the movie itself nothing more to add simply the best mob movie ever liota,pesci, and deniro deliver brilliant performances!!
B000E1155E|5.0|I randomly rented this cd from the library. I had never listened to their music, only heard the the band name. Looks like I've found myself a gem! I really enjoy this cd!  Remimds me a bit of The Clash or The Kooks (newer band). Since music is such subjective taste, I would suggest just listening some of their songs on youtube or myspace to see if you like it.
0385340990|5.0|What a terrific read this is.  Sheer Pleasure.  I savored every word.  Juliet is doing her thing as a columnist/author in post-second World War II England.  She gets a letter from a gentleman in Guernsey (an island off the coast of England that suffered German occupation during the war)and her life changes forever.  What ensues is the discovery, through charming letter-writing, of the island of Guernsey, its inhabitants, Juliet's life and friends, what actually happened during the German Occupation of the island and how the inhabitants handled those events. The author also manages to add a bit of mystery and suspense in the story to keep the already entertained reader on the edge of his or her seat. As the author says in her acknowledgments, the book does a perfect job of illuminating her the belief that, \\"love of art - be it poetry, storytelling, painting, sculpture, or music - enables people to transcend any barrier man has yet devised.\\"  I only wish I had an autographed copy of the book.  The one is staying on my bookshelf!
B000W91RUG|5.0|It's been way too long since a sitcom made me laugh at every episode.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out the humor.  And the casting is perfect and the acting flawless.  I'm looking forward to every episode.  Keep em coming, please.  I'm addicted.  Big kudos to the writers for this show.  I am very, very grateful that such talent is being used so well.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I couldn't find a copy of this DVD at Christmastime and I never saw it come on TV and really wanted to see it again. My wife and I searched all over and then thought of Amazon.com It was shipped before they said it would be which was a real plus. Thanks Amazon.com for coming through again.
0575081244|4.0|I like to discovery new authors and Richard Morgan is a great find. This is a genre I don't read to often but Altered Carbon crosses over so many genres. The mystery and suspense is as heart catching and page turning as any classic mystery or thiller. This science stuff is easy to get into and never goes over your head. The main character is a classic as any anti-hero private eye. By the end, you're rooting for this guy. Great read.
0061684384|5.0|Well I guess I should start off this review by stating emphatically that I don't have any tattoos, nor do I ever intend on getting one. Not that I have anything against tattoos, it's just that they aren't for me, although I do appreciate the incredible amount of talent behind a lot of the great tattoo artists of the past and present. Now having got that out of the way, I absolutely love some of the intricate designs and artwork that goes into a lot of the tattoos that I have seen. Especially those I have seen on TLC's [[ASIN:B0016MJ6HO L.A. Ink: Season 1]] and [[ASIN:B001CDFY4G LA Ink: Season 1, Volume 2]] reality series. Of which we all know Kat Von D is the owner of the tattoo shop High Voltage and star of the series.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that she had a book coming out and learned about it after watching the episode where she talks about it and finally gets a foreword for it by none other than boyfriend and heavy metal god, Nikki Sixx, guitarist for the incredibly talented band, Motley Crue. Ever since then, I have been anxiously awaiting January 20th, 2009 in order to get my copy, which I am proud to say I have and already read through it twice.<br /><br />Kat is very open and honest in this book about her life growing up and all the trials and tribulations that she, and her family, went through as she went from sweet little girl to, how should I put it, not so sweet little girl. At least in the eyes of her parents and certain other people in her life. Not that everyone felt that way, but I am quite certain there were more than a few.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the variety of personal photographs from her early years, and in one instance early seconds of her life that were included in the book. It really added something personal to the book and I felt really allowed the reader to have a quiet personal moment with her.<br /><br />The artwork that is displayed prominently throughout this book, both from Kat and a slew of other artists, is simply breathtaking and quite beautiful especially when you are also able to read the stories behind the artwork. From early childhood drawings, I especially liked the one of Catwoman, to her latest tattoos, Kat Von D shows you in a modest, very personable and quite energetic way why she is without-a-doubt one of the best tattoo artists alive today.<br /><br />This book showcases some of Kat's favorite tattoos and the amazing stories that go along with them. Some are quite funny, while others are tear flowing sad, especially the one about a man losing his best friend, his best friends wife, and their baby, all in the same day. He memorialized them with a beautiful black and gray tattoo on his side. This is just one example of the stories in this book and the amazing artwork that Kat has done to bring them to life.<br /><br />It is also painfully obvious that Kat herself is an amazing human being in the way she looks at life through her tattoos and the almost worship like appreciation and respect she has for other artists in her field. Of which she so graciously names several and, in some cases, showcases them and their artwork towards the end of her book.<br /><br />Even if you are not into tattoos, this book and the life of Kat Von D is such an entertaining and enlightening read, that I would strongly recommend that you pick it up and read it. If you do have a tattoo, you and it (your tattoo) just won't ever be complete until you also have a copy of this book.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.when you are also able to read the stories behind the artwork.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm not normally one for Musicals but I happened to catch this right after it came out and I loved it immediately, everyone in it does such a great job. I enjoyed it so much I just finished my second viewing and I plan on buying it its that good. [...]
031606792X|5.0|Let me preface by saying I am in LOVE with the whole Twilight series.  I have never been so obsessively and completely taken with a book(s) (most nights until 4 a.m., and I have two small children!!!)...ever and this series blew me away.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn was the crescendo to the other three.  With most books of this magnitude you are left guessing at the end result (\\"Did they truly live happily ever after?\\", among many other questions).  Finally an author who answers that question...and then some!<br /><br />*SPOILER*(don't read this section if you haven't read the book):  I loved that Bella finally was able to be with Edward eternally, and there were still surprises in store for them.  I adored how easy it was for her to transition into the vampire lifestyle, because she was a willing human (surprising even Jasper).  I appreciated that Jacob had a happy ending imprinting on Nessie; he wouldn't be heartbroken for the rest of his days.  I enjoyed the Voltari coming into play in such a menacing way.<br /><br />There were so many things I fancied about this book.  Stephenie Meyer is brilliant and didn't even know it when she began.  A truly talented, yet humble author.  The whole series is a MUST READ.  I really hope that Mrs. Meyer continues with Midnight Sun.  This is definitely a book that should be published.  And for that matter, Edward and the Cullen's views on the remaining books, especially New Moon (as they were absent for the majority).  I would like to know where they were, what they were doing, how Edward was dealing with the separation and the agony of it (in detail).<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
0793563836|5.0|This book has only one flaw, but other than that, it is perfect.  It starts you off learning how to sight-read from the very beginning, so that if you have any discipline at all, you can finish book 3 an accomplished bass player capable of creating your own bass line and reading sheet music and chord charts, and not another guitar center hang-out hack who looks up popular song tabs and can only play those 5 songs.  The progression is very nice, you are given enough exercises for each idea that you can integrate it before moving to the next step, although repeating the previous couple chapters every day you before you go to the next is good. I sometimes go back to book one and play the whole thing through, then book 2, focusing on improving my timing and sound on even the simplest tracks. It's never ending.  The flaw I mention is the lack of ear training. This book will take you to the intermediate level for sight reading and you'll learn most of the fretboard and even some theory and how to create bass lines towards the end, but you'll have to look elsewhere to learn about interval recognition and 'playing by ear'.    If anyone knows a good ear-training book please let me know btw.
0307455874|5.0|If you want to get some insight to the thoughts of the new president on a wide variety of of issues ( politics, faith, race, opportunity, family, the world beyond our borders), then this book is mandatory reading.  Written before Obama ran for president, these pages portray a man who spends a great deal of time internalizing issues with great insight and looking for sensible solutions.
B000UVLK1M|2.0|Once again it seems Mr. Hancock merely wanted to produce something unusual and not necessarily good. I was looking forward to his melding of styles with Joni Mitchell, but only 2 of the cuts are any good. The others are lacking.
0545128285|4.0|If you're a Harry Potter/JK Rowling fan, you'll never understand the series completely until you read this book. The collector's edition is beautiful, but the standard edition is within more people's price range and is just as good.
B001G5IJVK|4.0|I agree that this is one of the better comps out of the many that are available. I do like how they limited the songs to the \\"makeup years\\" and gave Ace and Peter equal billing. I don't know about you, but I've always loved Ace's style. Peter's not so much. But it's still nice to see the four originals sharing the spotlight.    Paul's disk is pretty good. Although I was suprised that they didn't include Shandi or Psycho Circus. Mr. Speed was an interesting choice and I've never thought it was a very solid song.    Gene's is hit or miss as his songs tend to be. There are the great ones like God of Thunder and Calling Dr. Love, but then Larger than Life is not exactly a keeper.    Ace's has all his good songs and some good ones from his solo album. Some of his songs, particularly in his later days with the band, are pretty cringe-worthy. Just give Talk to Me and Two Sides of the Coin a listen. Wow, those are some seriously bad lyrics. But Shock Me, Dark Light, and New York Groove are all fun songs and fit his style so well.    Peter's is my least favorite but I've never been crazy about his voice or style. there are a few songs I like on there though, like Baby Driver and Hard Luck Woman.     So, overall, nice set. Fun to listen to them back to back on a long drive.

B001ILFUDC|3.0|I just saw a special engagement of this latest 70th Anniversary version of Pinnochio at Disney's El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood in advance of the DVD re-release. Though I am happy to see the movie be given public exposure on a big theatrical screen, over the years I have seen many theatrical screenings of the movie on at least 12 different occasions including an original nitrate 3-strip Technicolor studio vault print in the early 1980's (before the studio dismantled its last nitrate screening room) and non-digital film restorations and was shocked to see that this latest restored version has digitally tampered with the film's original color palette for no justifiable reason.    Some of the chosen character hues are modern day, popular color hues, but look out of place in this early animated classic including certain pinks, reds and blues which are reused so often in identical shades that to classic animation buffs it becomes distractingly noticeable. For those animation buffs who know about Pinnochio, Walt intentionally muted colors in some of the scarier or sadder scenes. In the restored version, for example, when Pinnochio gets locked in Geppetto's \\"birdcage\\" the nighttime scene is bright and garish where it should intentionally be darker and muted.     The original movie had hand inked character outlines in colors that matched the interior ink colors, none of that is apparent in this restoration. The characters, though admittedly sharper and clearer, look color-wise like they were electronically tampered with, then reinserted in front of the original backgrounds.    At this point, the damage is done and obviously this restoration was \\"stylistic.\\" But in any case, it might be compared with someone redoing the Mona Lisa with more modern color hues for the purpose of improving the artwork or making it more modern day acceptable. Either two things, perhaps no one at Disney was knowledgeable enough to notice what the outside restoration company was planning to do with the film in early test segments or maybe they figured that modern day DVD audiences would not know the difference or care, but this is the first \\"DIGITALLY RESTORED\\" classic Disney film that I have ever taken issue with. What a let down since it is my very favorite Disney film of all!!!    P.S. I was the founder of the former, long time Disney employees' Animated Film Club (later referred to as the Disney Film Club) which included Disneyland and Walt Disney Studio employees. It was founded in 1976 and continued on and off for many years afterward with visits from surviving original Disney animators, screenings of rare Disney footage and more.
B00122Z5RI|5.0|This album introduced me to punk,and has stayed with me ever since. The sound is raw and nasty. This album is also an unflinching attack on mindless,complacent late-Seventies British patriotism in the face of a failing economic and class system. Unemployment was rampant. This is a telegraph from the people aimed at an outdated governmental system! Musically it still holds up as a great example of the kind of thing people are too cowardly to release anymore because all that matters is selling units and not offending anyone. Enjoy!! If you're interested in knowing more about The Pistols I suggest the documentary film \\"The Filth And The Fury\\" It's superb!!
1420931571|4.0|Set at the dawn of the Jazz Age in a blooming New York that is at the same time the picture of decadence and searing poverty, this story centers on the generation of aimless wealthy who, as the descendants of hard-working pioneer fathers and grandfathers, have been handed their money and privilege without too much toil on their part, thereby playing out that ages-old cautionary tale about the children of the rich who grow up listless, jaded, and a little cold because they can't even begin to grasp the morality and ethics of the working class who afforded them the privilege in the first place.       Forwarding the story here is Anthony Patch, a layabout if there ever was one since he's banking wholeheartedly on inheriting his grandfather's millions.  Not that he's entirely unlikable; when he's not partying or sleeping off the latest booze-fest, he can wax philosophical with a few friends and even manages to join the army for a brief stint, although what could be a promising career is soon derailed by his usual bad behavior.  Anthony's counterpart is his wife Gloria, a Midwest beauty of the genteel poverty station in life who enraptures Anthony with her blend of outrageous flirtatiousness and astonishing narcissism.  Equally directionless, Gloria too shows glimmers of insight and intelligence on the few occasions she's not shopping for a new dress or obsessing about getting older (she nearly commits suicide as the doddering old age of 26 looms).  Both of them obsess continuously about \\"the inheritance\\", drink too much and live far beyond their means, and after only a few years of marriage find themselves knee-deep in the kind of gradual deterioration that eats slowly away at love, like a book left outside in the rain.  It's still hanging on, but a shell of what it was.  According to some sources it's loosely - or not so loosely, depending on who tells it - based on Fitzgerald's own marriage to Zelda Sayre.    Written a few years after The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and Damned was not the commercial or critical success Gatsby was, but I found it fascinating.  I think Fitzgerald is the 1920's version of Bret Easton Ellis in the way he examines the American upper classes,  especially the tendency for succeeding generations to become less and less useful or motivated, a sort of dilution in progress, a result of too much given and not enough taught.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Love Abba.  Thought Meryl was awesome.  So much fun to watch and sing along.

B0002W4SWC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I was very eager to own it. So I was very happy to receive in a timely fashion and I was very satisfied with the product.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This is a magnificent film, a true work of art, profound, beautiful and pleasing in plot and content. I would rate this film as an all time masterpiece, certainly not to be missed. I would also note that this film embodies \\"legendary\\" acting, there would be no need for spectacle, as the acting and plot suffice, although it does contain a spectacle for the eyes.
0385338732|5.0|This book was so entertaining! I love Sophie Kinsella's books. I don't have to think while I'm reading them. They're a nice reprieve from the real world. Like a few other reviewers, I was sad to see this one end. I wanted to keep following after Lexi to see what happened next!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|This was a gift for my stepson and he plays it often. Santana is fabulous and it's one of our favorites - a must have for Santana fans.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|Jules Verne! Classic Story! Brendan Frazer! Stunning effects!  Can't lose, right..?<br />Wrong.<br />The relation to the original story is weak, with only the `idea' preserved, none of the richness of character, imagination and depth of detail of the book (or the original James Mason film, for that matter..).<br />The script is geared to kids, and is all about moving quickly through the motions in the same way those short movies that introduce amusement park attractions do.  No-one cares about character development or building tension etc... it's just - when can we get to our next `moment'!  And if it's moments you are after, there are certainly some ok effects on display, and younger viewers might have their interest held.. but I for one was grateful it only lasted 90 minutes.<br />So much for the film - what about the 3D!  Well, there is the option to watch in 3D on one disc, or 2D on the other.  In 2D the movie is flat, lighting looks abnormally bright, and colours washed out.  On the 3D version - yes, you really do get to watch in 3D - or at least as many of you have glasses...  However, the effect though stunning is rather erratic, the glasses uncomfortable cheap cardboard, the images in dark and weird colours thanks to the green / red glasses you wear.  I think watching in 3D is an exciting novelty - but based on this, it's a cinema experience, not a home theatre one, no matter if you do have a large projector screen. And clearly directors have not yet figured out how to make a movie that happens to be 3D, rather than an amusement park ride drawn out to feature length in order to get a release.  It's all just too self conscious.<br />Shame, I love Jules Verne, and even beneath the shallowness of this effort I enjoyed some of it in the way younger kids will.  But my advice - save the pennies, and next time a movie like this comes along, try and see it at the cinema if you want to see it in 3D.
1416575464|4.0|I have been reading Domino since the beginning.  It is the only magazine I subscribe to without fail.  However, I do not clip out images or articles to save (i have a problem getting rid of paper, so I nip it in the butt before it's out of control).  This book solved the dilemma of wanting to save pieces of the magazine, but not wanting to hold on to scraps of  paper.  It's like a \\"Best Of\\" version.  Somehow almost every picture or article I have been drawn to in the mag is here, like they read my mind.    I do wish they had a more style pages... they come up with great labels of style, not just the usual Hollywood Regency crap so prevalent in Elle Decor.  Like edgy classic.  Or brave bohemian.  you get the point.  I like the way they categorize things, I just wish there was more.    Drives me CRAZY that almost all the resources in the back of the book are only in New York.  I'm in Los Angeles, can't you at least give the west coast a quarter of love?    Anyway, the pictures are beautiful, they have great floor plan ideas, spot on tips for types of furniture, and how-to's for merging aesthetics and functionality (in my opinion, that's the most important).    It's so good, I already bought a second one for my friend.
031606792X|1.0|I dont want to give away anything for those who have not read it yet so please bear with me when trying to describe this atrosity....I just recently read the first three books and they were really good. But with this book it seems like the characters had a lobotomy, where are the characters from the first 3 books...these are  not the same people. I was really just disappointed with the whole thing and the story was horrible. Like I said dont want to give to much away but buy it used or borrow from a friend.  After reading the first 3 in a week and a half I did'nt want to even finish the last book... but I brought it so I finished but heartbreaking isnt even good enough to describe my disappointment.
B001FB55YE|4.0|This is Guy Ritchie film all the way; love him or hate him I would assume one would be reading about this film with the intention of seeing it anyway. Hence, let's see what Guy can do with finally getting a BD release.<br /><br />The story would appear to take large paragraphs of text describing complicated story lines, intertwining coincidences, and lots of fancy camera work. He needs very believable performances to carry out this crime caper, and I think he got them, from virtually everyone. Tom Wilkinson always delivers, Gerard, Thandie and even Ludacris get the job done, but I have to give the performance that makes the film watchable is Strong's. A great actor that filled the need to be the right-hand man with grace and strength.<br /><br />The BD, unfortunately, preserves a film that contains hundreds, if not thousands of muted colors and landscapes. The interiors are frequently spattered with infrequent lighting, the exteriors with overcast weather, and any color saturation being blotted out with a strange and bland lens. The two docus are 15 and 8 minutes long covering a decent background on the production, especially the location info. The 2 minute deleted scene was thankfully cut, and the commentary is best summarized by Ritchie saying they are going to \\"waffle\\" through the entire film.<br /><br />Not particularly the best test for your display and sound system, and not a movie for those that have (as a prominent reviewer here at Amazon would say) a SASS. A film you have to pay attention to, preserved decently on a BD containing a commentary about how happy the director is with his work (and himself).
B000002GBD|4.0|REVIEW: Although they hail from Scotland: these hard-rock heroes fashion a sound that combines elements of AC/DC, Black Sabbath, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. If you like the idea of such a bone-crunching conglomeration then \\"HAIR OF THE DOG\\" should put you in riff-happy heaven. Nazareth has been described by some critics as a \\"poor man's Led Zeppelin\\", but with this album they come dang well close to achieving a rock 'n' roll classic. Certainly the title track is a party-hearty, she-done-me-wrong, sing-along dude anthem. \\"Changin' Times\\" is right up the same alley along with their drastic re-working of Boudleaux Bryant's \\"Love Hurts\\" (previously recorded by The Everly Brothers) which garnered them a Top Ten hit. But it is the loose, bluesy workout of \\"Whiskey Drinkin' Woman\\" that comes across as the album's most appealing moment. That coupled with the lovely instrumental breather \\"Rose In The Heather\\" helps to offset the all-out heavy metal mayhem while giving the LP a more varied and experimental edge. Ditto the torturous epic \\"Please Don't Judas Me\\" (with its exquisite tabla/slide guitar accompanyment and heartfelt lyrics) that closes the album on a somber yet lovely note. \\"HAIR OF THE DOG\\" was immensely popular when it came out (STILL is immensely popular thanks to the continuous FM radio airply of \\"Love Hurts\\" and the title track), and has aged surprisingly well (which means that generation after generation can re-discover its head-banging, hard-rocking grandure). ALSO WORTH NOTING: that freaky looking cover!!!      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 17    HIT SINGLES: \\"Love Hurts\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 8)
0525951113|3.0|The summary of the book got me interested and the story as I began it got me hooked.  However, as the story progressed I had to suspend my disbelief, which would have been fine if the book had an ending that was even close to being satisfying.<br /><br />While I could imagine a lot of what happened in this book I was acutely aware of the fact that this book was fiction as I got past the half way point.  While I do believe so much of the technology is possible and even probable, I found it very difficult to believe that one single person could put so much into motion and predict so much, even down to conversations with people he doesn't even know or predict events as they fall like dominoes more than a year after his death.  The list goes on, but humans are highly unpredictable and can react in ways nobody could expect, let alone a stranger to that person.<br /><br />I was willing to overlook the unlikelyhood of the all-knowing person predicting events beyond his death for the sake of a riveting story.  However, as I got closer to the end of the book, I realized that this was not going to end.  The entire book set up a situation of Sobol's world vs. the world as we know it.  The battle was the 'good' (status quo) vs. the 'evil' (Sobol's people/world).  However, the book ends.  Sobol vs. the world is still going on.  Maybe another book?  Maybe you get to write the ending?  To me, so much work went into the setup that the reader at least deserved some kind of pause in the story if there was to be more to come.  Instead I was left wondering why the next pages were blank.<br /><br />A story that may be somewhat far fetched, but highly riveting...with no end.
0439023483|5.0|In the nation of Panem, the only civilization left in the ruins of North America, fear is power. The Capitol keeps each of the twelve surrounding districts on a tight leash by exploiting this fear, particularly through a cruel and vicious ceremony known as the Hunger Games, a yearly contest for survival. Each district is required to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to compete in this fight for life that is televised live for all of Panem to bet on and enjoy.    Things are going fine for sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen of the poorest part of District 12. Her family is doing relatively well and Katniss hasn't gotten caught hunting in the forest or poaching, crimes punishable by death. She even has a trustworthy partner in her illegal activities, a real friend. But when her younger sister is randomly drawn to be a contestant in the Hunger Games, she volunteers to take her place out of love and desperation. And even if Katniss doesn't think she stands a chance, coming from the dumps of the poorest district, survival is part of who she is. But in the Hunger Games, there is no room for the luxuries of friendship or even humanity, because there can only be one victor.    The Hunger Games contains a shockingly disturbing view of the future in which humanity has progressed backward even if civilization and technology continues. It is a completely dystopian future where wealth is unevenly distributed to an extreme degree, starvation is commonplace, and fear rules people's lives. Yet, in the midst of this harsh and unforgiving atmosphere, small amounts of humanity to persevere, especially in the form of spunky heroine Katniss. The fight for survival drives her to the edge between right and wrong, and Katniss struggles between feeling compassion for her human competitors and ruthless killing like a machine in order to win. I felt Collins illustrates this precarious balance very well through this action packed and thought provoking novel. The inclusion of romance and Katniss' confusion over her feelings, even if that part gets rather annoying, only further demonstrates the struggle of humanity against a cruel regime of power, because love and friendship are the most human one can get. Suspenseful and full of hidden meaning, this page turner wills stick with readers beyond the last page and leave them craving more.    If the \\"End of Book one\\" on The Hunger Games' last page is any indicator, this must read will soon be continued in a sequel or series. Fans of other dystopian novels including the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld, Shift by Charlotte Agell, Unwind by Neal Shusterman, Cherry Heaven by L.J. Adlington, and The Giver by Lois Lowry will not want to miss The Hunger Games.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|I just got this CD last week and I love it!  I was a fan of him on American Idol and I don't really listen to much to Secular music.  As one that doesn't care for all the cussing, dirty and provocative music that is out there...this is an album that is clean, yet rocky and mellow all at the same time!  Even my boyfriend loves this cd...and he's not into American Idol.  I love the Rock sounds of Light On and the mellow tunes in Permanent.  It goes to show that he can sing just about anything!  Keep up the great job David!  Love your voice!  This is a MUST purchase for anyone at any age!
0385340990|5.0|Once in a while, a book comes along that really grabs my attention and makes me want more. This is one of those books. I enjoyed getting to meet the character one by one, the descriptive form told from the point of view of the book character and the story of survival during the occupation of this island during WWII. Writting this book in letter format was the only way this story could have been told so well. This book makes me yearn for the days of snail mail, waiting at the mailbox for the postcards and letters from friends and family. It was definitely a book club favorite for our group.
B000BVZ4OA|5.0|Great cd, excellent price and less than a week delivery. This girl can SING!! Why she is so hard to find in the US is beyond me.
B00122Z5RI|5.0|This is still a great record after more than 30 years. It is the album that really launched punk music. Although the Sex Pistols were not really the first punk band, they were definitely one of the first and they were also the ones who really put punk on the map.<br /><br />This record above all has some great music -- much better than a lot of the punk that followed it. It's not just guitar distortion, crashing drums and shouting by any means. The songs almost all have strong melodies with memorable hooks that grab you from the start. (The only real exception is \\"New York\\", which I still wouldn't recognize in a lineup today, although I've heard it hundreds of times.)<br /><br />Steve Jones' guitar playing is remarkably tight, and really is brilliant in many places. His style is minimalist, but you don't immediately notice that through the power and distortion. Where he does use flourishes, they are melodic and memorable.<br /><br />Johnny Rotten (now John Lydon), the vocalist, creates a thoroughly misanthropist persona simply using his voice -- the sound says \\"I hate everything.\\" He created the mold for most punk singers after him, including a way of delivery phrasing that lets you know he doesn't care what you or anyone else thinks.<br /><br />The Sex Pistols were far from a perfect band. Image got in the way of the music quite a lot -- in part because the project was launched by Malcolm McLaren, who wanted a band out there that would let him sell more clothes at his London shop, called \\"Sex\\", dealing in what would become punk fashion.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the band, the image obsession and the desire of Johnny Rotten to change the balance of power in the band led them to replace Glen Matlock, who could actually play his bass and who also played a key songwriting role, with Sid Vicious, who had little musical ability. But Sid looked appropriately nasty, and didn't have Matlock's feathered, Bay City Rollers-style hair. In the end, Vicious proved to be a disaster, and he met a disastrous end.<br /><br />Fortunately none of that really interferes with this record -- Matlock plays bass on much of it, and where he doesn't, guitarist Steve Jones fills in. No Sid here.<br /><br />It would be a mistake to view this album as relevant to punk alone. This album changed everything, including the music business itself. The attitude and some of the fashion ideas of punk were very soon domesticated and repackaged into New Wave, which very quickly turned into the industry mainstream.<br /><br />So without the revolution brought by Sex Pistols, we would not have had most of the music that drove the late 1970s and 1980s -- the Police (and later Sting), U2, Duran Duran, the B-52s, etc etc. In a very real sense, \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" set the stage on which the musical background of the entire Reagan Era was played out.<br /><br />The Sex Pistols were one of the great paradigm shifts, up there with Elvis, the Beatles and Grandmaster Flash in changing music and the music industry. And this is their only real album of studio material.<br /><br />I saw the Sex Pistols in 2008 in a concert in Slovakia, of all places. They are very different today. Glen Matlock back on bass, still with his feathered hair. Steve Jones was bearing baggy khaki pants and a t-shirt, and Lydon, in chi pants and a collarless button-down shirt, has been completely transformed. He no longer hates everybody and everything, but actually seems to really enjoy himself and to genuinely like people in his own \\"in your face\\" way. He pulled up his shirt, waved his naked paunch at us like a belly dancer and told us: \\"We love ya.\\" This was not the Pistols of 1977.<br /><br />I say this just to point out that the people on this record, who seem to make nastiness and destruction their livelihood, are warm and fuzzy middle-aged guys today. They weren't actually hateful, they just seemed that way.Fortunately none of that really interferes with this record -- Matlock plays bass on much of it, and where he doesn't, guitarist Steve Jones fills in.

B0009O9LWK|4.0|I have seen many versions of Jane Eyre and own a few, but this is still one of my favorites.  The musical scores are wonderful.  George C. Scott is just as I would imagine Mr. Rochester (Timothy Dalton-although I do love that version too-seems far to Hollywood handsome IMO).  Susannah York may seem a bit old, but plays the role of Jane wonderfully!  I seem to return to this version because of the scenes at Lo wood when Jane was a child.  Other movies I have seen seem to portray that as such a nice cheerful place and I don't see it as such.  In this movie, the place looks like a charitable institution and the girls are treated like charity cases.  Yes I have read the book and if I want the story to read exactly like the book-I'll just read the book again!  I gave this a 4 because there are pieces missing from this dvd-wonder why that is?.  The quality of the dvd is poor, but no worse than the vhs which I own and have watched to death.

0571202284|5.0|like every person that has talked about this book said It is the best one if your into animation
0061091480|5.0|Have you ever asked yourself questions like: \\"What do I want to do next?\\", \\"What do I really want?\\" and \\"How can I be true to myself?\\". If that is the case, this book will answer most of your questions.<br /><br />What I like about the book is that it is concise, complete and full of practical solutions. Each chapter is a move towards goal like for example \\"taking charge\\", \\"First Love i.e yourself :)\\", \\"Exploring the Unknown\\" and \\"Breaking the barrier of convention\\". It identifies the weakness inhibiting you from achieving this goal, the rewards for keeping this self defeating behavior and finally some easy and pragmatic strategies to overcome the weakness.<br /><br />I have this book and keep it, because I like to read it again and again. I read it recently and it was great to see my progress from the first time I read it, but also acknowledge that some erroneous zones die hard. It is also a book I like to give to my loved ones, because it is truly liberating.<br /><br />The good news is that the rewards of this book are not only felt at a personal level, but they radiate in the workplace and in your family. Once you know how to respect your true self desire, you know how to respect others desires and foster at work an environment of creativity and true added value. With this book you become a true model for your children and learn how to avoid using manipulation to raise them.<br /><br />This book is a true classic full of Dr Wayne Dyer's wisdom. So take charge and see how well you score on the \\"Erroneous Zone\\" spectrum. We all have them :). In summary, a great book.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Australia is a must see movie.  I saw it in the theater and wanted to go back and see it again.  I will be buying this movie the second its out and will again fall in love with it all over again.  If you love Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman, or Hugh Jackman you will love the movie Australia.
0525951113|4.0|Disappointing ending offsets an otherwise brilliant book. This is a page-flipper, the kind of book that makes you stay up late and read \\"just one more chapter\\".<br /><br />The book starts with a series of murders, where each murder victims is associated with an online game company,and each dies in an unexpected and improbable way. As the the book races forward, it is becomes clear that Matthew Sobol, the founder of the company, who has just died of natural causes, is not willing to go quietly into oblivion.<br /><br />Sobol, an extraordinary genius, has set up elaborate software systems that are going to unleash a technological monster on the world. He has cleverly exploited the millions of computers that exist to execute his plan, which is revealed over the course of the book.  The software is the Daemon of the title, tempting people into joining Sobol's conspiracy. The software is very clever, and can adapt to changing events. Daemon is the classic super-villian - frighteningly unstoppable.<br /><br />The book gallops along, with amazing action sequences. When cops try to go into Sobol's home, they get their first taste of Sobol's power, as he throws technology tricks, deception, booby traps and automated attack vehicles at the cops to keep them out of his house. You can see the movie in the description.<br /><br />As someone in computers, I enjoyed the cleverness of the technical details - they are all plausible today. Scary! It dips pretty deeply into the gamer sub-culture, and advances the story through a lot of gaming.<br /><br />The only disappointment was the ending. Having been continuously cranking up the action and the violence and the cleverness of Daemon, the ending sequences went beyond what seemed believable and seemed like pure fantasy. And the very final sequence falls flat, like Suarez didn't know how to end it. Or, perhaps he's signaling \\"To be continued....\\"<br /><br />Would have been a strong 5 except for the ending.
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Growing old certainly seems to agree with Clint Eastwood.  For popular as he was at the box office, Eastwood, in the early stages of his career at least, never seemed entirely comfortable in an actor's skin - his performances often coming across as stiff and wooden as he mumbled his way through perpetually clenched teeth and the barest minimum of dialogue (it wasn't for no reason that critics always seemed to describe his early characters as \\"laconic\\").  Yet, now that he's encased in an old man's body, that stiffness couldn't be more organic to the characters he's playing - or more effortlessly natural.  In \\"Gran Turino,\\" Eastwood returns for one last time to the role of the lone gunslinger - whether it be on  the western frontier as the Man With No Name or on the meanest of urban mean streets as Dirty Harry - that made him an icon for a generation of moviegoers who grew up on his films.  Yet, it is a return tempered by the kind of wisdom and restraint that only age and a lifetime's worth of experience can bring.<br /><br />Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a septuagenarian who is practically the walking definition of a grumpy old man.  A Korean War vet still haunted by the memories of what he saw and did there, Walt is a prickly, snarling, irreligious cynic who doesn't much cotton to the informality and lax standards of the modern world.  He also happens to be the most \\"lovable\\" bigot to come our way since Archie Bunker, a thoroughgoing racist who doesn't hesitate to spit out every politically incorrect epithet he can lay his hands on when the situation calls for it (although, in all fairness, he doesn`t hesitate to refer to himself as a \\"Pollack\\" from time to time as well).  The key thing to understand about Walt, however, is that while he may be filled with venomous hatred for much of his fellow Man, he knows how to cut through a line of BS when he hears it (much to the consternation of the neighborhood priest who keeps offering Walt salvation through confession).  Distraught at the loss of his beloved wife, Walt wages a one-man war against the army of immigrants that has \\"invaded\\" his formerly all-white, lower middle class neighborhood in recent years.  Walt is particularly irked by the Asian family who's moved in next door, until he's befriended by the teenage daughter, who slowly and cautiously brings him into their world.  Walt, in turn, takes her younger brother under his wing, helping him stand up to the gang members who taunt and threaten him on almost a daily basis.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is fraught with any number of potential pitfalls, all of which are deftly sidestepped by Nick Schenk's screenplay, Eastwood's direction and, most notably, Eastwood's performance in the starring role.  The image of an old man single-handedly staring down a bunch of hardcore gangbangers could easily have elicited laughs under other circumstances, but because Eastwood draws upon our cherished memories of his well established image as a tough guy, we are able to suspend our disbelief and accept it all at face value.  This is one time when the audience's previous familiarity with and affection for an actor truly pays off in a big way.  Moreover, even though we know where the story is going - that this unyielding curmudgeon will eventually be won over and softened by his experience with this alien culture and the people in it - the easygoing tone of the film keeps it from becoming preachy or mawkish.  In fact, what strikes one most is just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be, and this is due almost exclusively to Eastwood's sly, often playful performance.  With a disarming cynic's grin and a sardonic twinkle in his eye, Eastwood makes a potentially one-note character into a fully fleshed-out human being.<br /><br />For while the other performances in the film are uneven at best, \\"Gran Torino\\" contains the best work Eastwood has ever done on screen.  The movie serves as a valedictory of sorts for a man whose most recent movie triumphs have all taken place on the other side of the camera.  This role is like that last walk the hero takes down the middle of main street before heading off into the sunset.  It's a bittersweet image befitting one of the genuine cinematic icons of all time.hs have all taken place on the other side of the camera.

0684824906|5.0|This is an in-depth view into the political life of Abraham Lincoln, one of Barack Obama's role models. Lincoln was brilliant, with the rare ability to bring together diverse people (especially those who had been his strongest and most vocal opponents) to work together for a better, more compassionate and humane country. Barack Obama truly displays many of Lincoln's most outstanding features. Somehow it's only fitting that 2009, the year Barack was inaugurated President, is also the two hundreth anniversary of Lincoln's birth. This is a very timely book by a great historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin. Highly recommended but be prepared to spend a lot of time with this book---it's a big one!
B001PBG6ZG|5.0|\\"Between the Numbers\\" is a big surprise.  It would be a great book for anyone who has not read the series and would like to ease into it.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|This is a sparkling little gem of a movie; my concerns about an American playing such a quintessentially British heroine proved unfounded, and all the characters just glow. I've long been a fan of Austen, and this has all the charm and sly wit of her book, although of course seen through a different lens.    Great for a lazy afternoon, or for a rainy day; I can - and do - rewatch this every couple of months! Highly recommended, and loads of fun.    PS The soundtrack is just lovely too.
031606792X|3.0|Like all the other readers here, I became quickly addicted to the Twilight series after the movie and then the first book, and I couldn't put them down, literally.     The fourth book, well, I still couldn't put it down, but I have to say I was disappointed in the way things unfolded.    ***Warning - spoiler alert***    The first part of the book, narrated by Bella when still human, was a lot more interesting than the parts that followed, and Bella seemed to be at least more in her usual character. Her perspective ends as she becomes pregnant, moving into a third of the book being told by Jacob.    The Jacob segment...well, I found myself hoping it'd be over sooner than it was, it isn't that I don't mind Jacob but it seemed to drag on and on tediously going over Jacob's feelings, the feelings of his pack, his feelings about Bella, about the Cullens...not much happens in that whole segment except that it's a long, drawn out anticipation of Bella giving birth.    All this would have still been fine if not for the anti-climactic final segment of Bella after the birth and reborn as a vampire. Her character then becomes....bland and Mary Sue- it's as if the author has fallen so much in love with her creation that she strives to emphasize at every turn how beautiful Bella is, how she the newborn to end all newborns, such amazing control, no loss of control and snacking on humans, no mishaps, an amazing control over her powers which ends up saving the day...    I'm all for happy endings, but these happy endings seem a little on the contrived side. Everything ends *too* happily with no real struggle, no real fighting, nothing to make the heroes seem in any way heroic. I was hoping for a little bit more of an actual struggle with the Volturi...and as for Renesmee...    Renesmee (Bella's daughter) annoys me GREATLY. SO talented, SO perfect, so magically beautiful and of course the answer to all Jacob's problems as he imprints on her. She, of course, ends up saving the day aswell as Bella, which just seems so...unrealistic in relation to the plot in the rest of the books. I mean, the whole thing is a fantasy novel anyway but what happens in this last book seems inconsistent with the rest of the Twilight universe. The whole thing seemed rushed and towards the end, contrived.    So..I give it three stars because I still enjoyed the book...one star off for the way it was written which didn't seem quite the same as in the earlier three books, and another star off for turning Bella into an oh so perfect, wonderful, beautiful Mary Sue. No one likes a flawless heroine!

B001ILFUD2|3.0|This 1988 was the 27th animated feature to come from the Walt Disney Company. It is somewhat loosely based on the Charles Dickens Oliver Twist story. Set in New York City, this tale is about Oliver (voiced by teen star Joey Lawrence), a homeless kitten who is befriended by Dodger (Billy Joel), a loveable mutt who leads a gang of dogs that must scrounge the NYC streets to get by. The gang is owned by Fagin (Dom Deluise), a down-on-his-luck man who is in debt to a ruthless loan shark named Sykes (Robert Loggia).  During a bungled petty-theft attempt, Oliver is adopted by a rich young girl named Jenny (Natalie Gregory). Oliver is quite happy to be in a loving home, but the gang misses him and thinks they need to \\"rescue\\" him. Once they get him back, Oliver admits he was happy with Jenny; Fagin sees this as his opportunity to blackmail Jenny's family for the money to repay Sykes. However, even this gets bungled as Fagin's heart warms to Jenny's pleas to get Oliver back. Just as Fagin is about to \\"do the right thing,\\" the evil Sykes swoops in with his Dobermans and kidnaps Jenny for his own reward. You'll have to watch the film to see how it ends!<br /><br />Somehow, \\"Oliver and Company\\" just doesn't have the total hallmark of quality that you would expect from a Disney animated film. The characters and story are just fine, but the animation is inconsistent. This was the first Disney film to use computer animation to a higher degree, and the experimentation shows. The style of the movie attempts to mimic the look of [[ASIN:B000YERP2S 101 Dalmatians (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000XUOIQ4 The Aristocats (Special Edition)]], but ends up resembling a Saturday morning cartoon instead. As for the character animation, the emotion and depth that you would expect from Disney is definitely apparent. Oliver the cat is extremely loveable and expressive, and Tito bears all the fun and sass you would expect from a character being voiced by Cheech Marin. My overall opinion of the animation is that it would appear that it was a fresh young team not quite as experienced as the \\"old regime\\" of the \\"Nine Old Men\\" who created the classic DIsney library that we all know and love.<br /><br />There are plenty of fun characters here though; Bette Midler voices Georgette, a snooty and vain poodle owned by Jenny who is jealous of Oliver, the family's newcomer. Tito the Chihuahua is my favorite; Cheech Marin's voice and the animators combined their talents to create a very memorable character who has taken a liking to Georgette, although she initially wants nothing to do with a street dog. Dom DeLuise is characteristically a little over-the-top with Fagin, making it a little difficult to feel much sympathy for his situation. In previous live-action versions of this tale, Fagin is a scoundrel but the actors playing him also give him enough charm and heart that you definitely feel a connnection. Billy Joel does an amazing job as Dodger; Disney was unsure whether he had the chops to do a voice-over; his phone-in audition convinced them, and he is a masterstroke of casting.<br /><br />There is plenty of talent in this film; Huey Lewis sings the movie's first song played over the credits, \\"Once Upon a Time in New York City.\\" Georgette's big number, \\"Perfect Isn't Easy,\\" sung by Midler, was co-written by Barry Manilow. Ruth Pointer of the Pointer Sisters also lends her singing talents to the cast.<br /><br />The sub-par for Disney animation shouldn't disuade you from watching this film; it truly is a cute movie with a heartwarming tale and memorable characters. This 20th Anniversary Edition also has a handful of fun extras:<br /><br />Backstage Disney:<br /><br />* The Making of Oliver & Company (5:30): This vintage documentary (most likely made at the time of the film's release gives a short overview of what went into the creation of the film. Taking 2.5 years to make and over 120,000 cels, this featurette works hard to convince audiences that traditional Disney animation is alive and well, and that computers are just a new tool with which the animators can expand their craft. \\"Don't look for computers to replace human animators at Disney.\\" Roy Disney pops in to evoke his Uncle Walt, and explains how the animators pushed the computers to their limit by asking what they were capable of. Glen Keane, the supervising animator, explains the part CGI played in Bette Midler's big number, coming down a staircase. Keane breathlessly explains that without computers, the shot of Midler could never have been done in the past. I find this hard to believe when Iooking at the marvels created in the past by Disney's original animation team.<br /><br />* Disney's Animated Animals (1:27): Another vintage featurette that is more fluff than anything else.<br /><br />* Oliver & Company Scrapbook: 14 \\"pages\\" that show Concept Art, Story Development, Character Development, Behind-The-Scenes photos, and Publicity.

When the kitten falls down the well, Pluto is given the opportunity to redeem himself; which side will he choose?!?<br /><br />* \\"Puss Cafe,\\" a 1951 Pluto short that shows a less loveable Pluto than the previous short; this time around, he must defend his territory again from two cats who want to steal his food.<br /><br />The one new extra is a game, \\"Oliver's Big City Challenge.\\"<br /><br />Technical specs: Video is widescreen (1.66:1) and enhanced for 16x9 TVs; Audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, with Spanish & French language tracks.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|\\"Wall-E\\" was one of the most entertaining movies of any type in recent memory.  That it puts forth the message that we must take care of our world is very important, and supremely entertaining.  Amongst the myriad of \\"extras\\" is a full 90-minute story of Pixar -- equally as fascinating as the movie itself!  The storage case is marvelously compact and very well laid out as well, and makes you feel like you've really gotten your money's worth... Which you have!  There's a bit of something in here for everyone.<br />And if the movie itself didn't impress you, than perhaps we should leave it to that Master Magician and \\"Presto!\\"  More fun than a barrel of robots!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|package came in in new condition. watched DVD and it is great. I guess time it took to ship was the only downside, even thought i was told it could take up to 20 days to arrive, and I think right on the 20th day it did come in. Other than that, i have no complaints. made a great gift.
B001PP9ALY|2.0|Average frustrated chump, discovers is a super human, and learns all the skills of a professional assassin in a few days. The movie just does not take off, the director puts to much time on special effects and cg and did not trust his actors to carry the weight of the film.
B000068FUS|5.0|This album, and band, reminds me very much of Neil Young, back in the early days, with Crazy Horse. Great lyrics sung over various types of music, ranging from country to hard rock. They can sound sound pretty jagged at times, but that's fine with me. Nobody else out there is doing this now. Check this one out, along with \\"The Dirty South\\" and \\"Decoration Day\\". Their DVD \\"live at the 40 Watt Club\\" is excellent as well. The folks writing the bad reviews just don't get it.
1582701709|5.0|This is an easy-to-read book in the sense that it feels as if the author is right there conversing with you.  This book provides information about how important positive thinking is in your life, and the book provides real-life accounts that back up the author's information.  I found the book to make plenty of sense, and I am happy with the results that I find within myself.  It is a new age book that either transforms or confirms the way you think.  I highly recommend this book to people who are seeking self-happiness in their lives.
0345479092|1.0|If you are hoping to fail at breastfeeding and get some advice on how to fail then this is the book for you.      It is unrealistic to expect a young child to sleep through the night and not be cuddled and fed - it is not normal.  There are infant sleep studies from around the world to back this up. Even the American Academy of Pediatrics has warned AGAINST scheduled feedings and advocated demand feedings for breastfed babies. I have personally worked with mothers who have had infants that we not gaining with scheduled feedings and when they threw the schedule out the window the babies gained appropriately.  They were lucky to catch things early enough to turn things around, but scheduled feedings can lead to worse things including dehydration etc.
0930289234|5.0|This comic is by far one of the, if not the, greatest comics ever written.<br /><br />what I really love about this comic is that there is such an emphasis on character development, and very little development on action sequences. We get a good feel for all the characters, who are all very human, and very realistic. The only character in there with an actual superpower is Dr. Manhattan, but he isn't that prominent. The rest of the characters are all very understandable, and relatable, and touches down on all the characteristics of the human emotion.<br /><br />I definitely think this comic is worth [...] , and probably worth much, much more. I highly recommend this to anyone who liked the movie \\"Pulp Fiction\\"
0783235666|2.0|watching this movie 20 yrs after my first viewing i was still struck with the same impression:  dull.  I could only remember about 20 minutes of the movie b/c that was the only 20 minutes that was interesting.  the first hour can be scrapped.  dull, silly dialogue that sets up little in the story later on.  there is some tension with the birds, but that's the 20 minutes.  as for symbolism, you can create and invent all you want, but it's not compelling.  a very underwhelming movie, sorry.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" has become a sleeper hit. Made on a relatively modest budget, it has captured the hearts and minds of moviegoers and garnered a fistful of Academy Award nominations. Jamal Malik, played with soulful sweetness by Dev Patel, grows up in Mumbai under wretched conditions. When their mother is killed, he and his older brother, Salim, scramble to stay alive by sleeping wherever they can, stealing food, and even allowing themselves to be duped by a Fagin-like con man. Latika is a homeless girl who teams up with Jamal and Salim, and the trio struggle mightily to get through each day. After enduring unspeakable hardships, Jamal grows up and takes a job in a call center. In an unlikely turn of events, the eighteen-year-old somehow becomes a contestant on \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\\" To everyone's shock, this barely educated former street urchin comes up with some very unlikely answers and is on the verge of winning a fortune. Surely he must have cheated, but how?<br /><br />Directors Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan elicit touching performances from a fine cast. The lovely Freida Pinto plays Latika as a young woman who is badly treated by a thuggish gangster.  Jamal grows to worship her, but formidable obstacles stand in his way. The brothers soon veer off in different directions. Salim, played with menace and barely controlled rage by Madhur Mittal, turns on Jamal and the two become bitter enemies. Also worth mentioning is the wonderful Anil Kapoor, who brilliantly depicts the unctuous and phony host of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" With a frozen smile, he pretends to be supportive of the calm and collected Jamal, while inside, he is seething with resentment and incredulity that this nobody is succeeding beyond all reason.<br /><br />The intriguing script by Simon Beaufoy is a fairy tale with a twist. \\"Slumdog\\" combines comedy, tragedy, music, and romance with such energy and excitement that we are willing to accept the surreal plot on its own terms. Somehow, this film would have us believe that in a chaotic world torn apart by violent religious fanatics, sadistic mobsters, brutal policemen, and exploiters of women and children, love and redemption are still possible.<br /><br />\\"Slumdog\\" is helped immeasurably by its biting sardonic humor and pulsing and electrifying musical score. Boyle, along with his editor and cinematographer, deserve kudos for creating a world that is both repellent and seductive. Mumbai is a teeming city with many faces.  There are fetid slums filled with pitiful beggars, and brothels where young women are used and abused. On the other hand, businessmen in modern skyscrapers are attempting to transform India into a competitive global economic power. Although several appalling scenes make us want to avert our eyes, we cannot help but root for Jamal and Latika, two resilient and courageous youngsters who deserve the happiness and peace of mind that has been denied them by fate.his film would have us believe that in a chaotic world torn apart by violent religious fanatics, sadistic mobsters, brutal policemen, and exploiters of women and children, love and redemption are still possible.     \\"Slumdog\\" is helped immeasurably by its biting sardonic humor and pulsing and electrifying musical score.

0385483821|4.0|If you're going to write a critical review that claims that you only barely understood the core concept of the book, it helps make your case stronger if you can get the NAME of that core concept correct.     All other criticisms aside, Intel has been remarkably successful in executing throughout the past 3 decades, and a large part of that has been due to Intel's culture of paranoia and culture of indoctrination. All former employees of Intel, successful or not, will tell you that you can't work there and be a success without at least sipping the Company Kool-Aide. Almost all former employees take many of the internal processes and procedures used at Intel and apply them in their professional lives.     Andy Grove has two primary focuses in \\"Only the Strong Survive\\"- the Strategic Inflection Point and Core Competencies. These are universal facts of business, regardless of what you call them, and successful businesses universally recognize, understand and accomodate for these two realities.     Many people consider Intel a technology company. Intel does not, at least not foremost. Intel acknowledges that their core competency is as a *manufacturing* company. They chose to manufacture IT products because of the generally high margin there - but the unspoken understanding is that the core concepts applied within Intel focus on their core competency, and could be applied to virtually any line of business engaged in that core competency - that is, manufacturing.    When Intel has encountered strategic inflection points, it has responded by focusing on its core competency. Someone mentioned the Craigh B. years. Those were some of the most trying years in the company's history, and often it was because Craigh B. responded to the strategic inflection point he perceived by branching out in multiple different directions, many of which had nothing to do with the core competency of Intel.     If you're having trouble with the concept of a strategic inflection point, imagine a bullet hitting smooth water at an angle. It may penetrate the water and go down, or it may reflect off the water and go back up. The water is the point of interference with the path, it is the \\"strategic inflection point\\". Either way, the bullet will be affected by the water. In the same way, a strategic inflection point is a point of interference in the path of a company's progress. Handled correctly, it is always an opportunity. More often it is handled poorly, and becomes a liability.     The book is what it is - but listening to the advice of one of the most successful businessmen of the 20th century is probably not a *bad* idea.

0312360266|2.0|I have to agree with YUCK. Wow, I'd hate to have my teenager reading this. Foul language kept me from reading to the end. And people wonder why the Twilight series was a hit? Are all of the books in this series as R-rated or just Marked? Too bad it could have been more enjoyable.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Angelina is as coy, strong and sexy as ever, and she remains clothed the entire movie (darn it, except for one brief back shot with nice tattoos). The Lead Character was weak at first, but ended strong. And, Morgan Freeman can make anything he says believable, although I still wish I knew how/where the magic loom gets its list of \\"fateless\\" names (God?). The only way for a sequel with Angie is for a \\"Kill Bill\\" type of resurrection, so its possible I suppose. Sure hope there's a sequel with her in it. I loved comic books as a child - until mother tossed nearly $50K worth out the door (still makes this older man cry) - so this movie was perfect for my home theatre. Lots of guns, lots of action, lots of special effects, and even a great twist that changes everything. Thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. I would recommend buying it if you like this movie genre.
158270208X|3.0|This is a very nice high quality product, however I was hoping for more written in it by the author.  It has a few uplifting phrases on some pages but it is mostly a blank book for you to write in each day.

B000WTNCYA|5.0|I was in a random stationary & card store the very first time I heard this album. Within 30 seconds of walking through the doors, I knew I HAD to have this album. Luckily for me, the sales clerk knew exactly who was playing and what album it was.    \\"Worrisome Heart\\" is everything that you'd expect from a much more seasoned artist. Ms. Gardot's vocals are warm and sensual, reminiscent of the great jazz singers of the past, but could even be compared to the more folky stylings of Norah Jones. The depth of emotion conveyed by the lyrics would suggest they had been written by someone who had not only experienced true longing and heart ache, but by someone who was determined to let the world know exactly how she was feeling. The music is deliberate, yet enticing; smoldering, yet playful; deep and broad, but poignant. And most of all, this album is sexy, sexy, sexy!
0765356139|3.0|As can be expected the second book is somewhat more of the same but with other bad guys.  There are some expected twists in the plot, but on the whole it's a nice book - maybe since the charm and freshness of the idea is gone since it's the second book - it drops a mark for me...

B000FBJAOG|4.0|I must say this book had a lot more information than i thought. I am finally glad someone finally stated the where the line is drawn on Zombies. Both my cousin and I love to watch zombie movies but yet there was to much \\"hollywood\\" embedded in it if you understand me. I also like how it had a very scientific explantion for everything, especially a more realsitic virus that infects people. Another enjoyable thing were the \\"Historical Accounts\\" were another nice touch.      The one down side was that at times it felt redundant, but it gots it point across. Good book for zombie lovers
B001PPGAIK|4.0|I love Howard Hawks' films...Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday, Red River, and Rio Bravo are amazing pieces of entertainment.  As I was watching Australia, the new Baz Luhrmann movie with Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, I kept thinking...man, Baz must really love Hawks' movies, too.<br /><br />As evidenced by the films above, the mismatched couple who fight and fight until they realize they're perfect for each other (see Much Ado About Nothing, Taming of the Shrew, and Moonlighting as other examples of the form) and the group of underestimated misfits who come together to fight evil are two big elements used again and again by Hawks.  Throw in a bit of John Ford's The Searchers and its hard look at racism leading to inhuman deeds and mix well and you have...Australia.<br /><br />The problem modern audiences may have with Luhrmann's new movie is it's very, very earnest.  This is straight ahead epic storytelling with its heart on its sleeve and hat and boots with never a wink to the crowd in the theater to say \\"ain't these people quaint\\".  You either buy in or you don't.  If you do, like I did, you're in for a hell of a ride.<br /><br />This, I feel, is the flip-side to The Dark Knight.  Good and evil are trapped in something akin to a battle and an embrace in Nolan's Gotham City.  You root for Batman, but he does stuff that is on the wrong side of freedom and civil rights.  The Joker is pure crazy, but he's the most mesmerizing character in the film.  In Australia, there are good guys and bad guys and you are either really good or twirl your mustache evil.  The main villain actually may be a bit too two-dimensional in that aspect, but it didn't hurt my overall enjoyment.<br /><br />Why?  Well, epic melodrama is hard to pull off...I'm talking about the real stuff here.  The recent BBC production of Bleak House is a great example.  There are very good and very, very bad people in that story, but the acting is so fantastic you rarely if ever catch yourself rolling your eyes (like whenever I've watched Smallville...see: bad epic melodrama).  Kidman and Jackman sell their characters...the displaced Englishwoman and the rough-hewn \\"Drover\\".  They are thrown together just to, initially it seems, thwart a nasty cattle baron from monopolizing the beef industry in the country.  But the other big story, the main one in fact, centers around Australia's \\"lost generation\\".  These were Aboriginal children who were fathered by white men who didn't claim them.  They were taken by the government, the mothers had no rights,  and handed over to the church to be taught to \\"act white\\" and then work in the servant class.  Nullah, played by the fantastic child actor Brandon Walters, is one of these \\"creamies\\" who has been hidden on the ranch now owned by Lady Sarah Ashley (Kidman).  Lady Ashley discovers what is going on, is horrified by the law, and works to keep him hidden as well.  Why the Drover cares so much about Nullah becomes clear later in the film (no, it's not what you think...that would be too easy) and Jackman's experience with stage and musical work does him proud here.  He can do earnest better than almost any actor alive when he needs to and his later use of the f-word (the only curse I can remember from the entire film) hits so hard, in just the right emotional moment, that it kills.  Russell Crowe was originally cast as the Drover but backed out.  If Crowe had done the film, and I have liked him in other things...the Napoleon-era British navy film that I can't remember the name of right now, it would not have worked.  Crowe never loses that bit of edge and the Drover, at one point, really has to fully break down and become completely vulnerable.  Jackman shines at that point.<br /><br />Anyway...a warning, the movie is long 2 hours and 40something minutes, but I didn't realize that until I had left the theater.  I saw it alone...I was out of town at a pediatrics meeting...and that's a good thing.  I didn't have to hide from Holly thefew times the movie hit me a bit too hard and do that cough-throat clearing thing we dudes do to cover up a stray tear.it too hard and do that cough-throat clearing thing we dudes do to cover up a stray tear.

0525951113|5.0|No that title isn't an exaggeration. If you're content in knowing the information provided in the title and would like to skip the praise I'm about to bestow, just buy the book.    So, another book about computers taking over the world. Ho hum, blah blah, yes? Actually no. While I was reading Daemon the thought that this could really happen kept going through my head. Without giving away some of the plot points, I'll just say this. Read some of the recent news about the Storm botnet. Think about peoples addictions to WoW. Then read the book. Then think about those subjects again.    A few words to the techies: SQL injection attack, botnet, and rootkit.  All those words/phrases can be found in this book. No no, my friends, this is not the book equivalent of Hackers (you know where code magically floats across the screen and other cheap tricks), this is a book written by a systems consultant (read: normally the guy that gets called in with the regular schmoes can't figure things out) for Fortune 100 companies. To use a common cliche, he \\"gets it.\\" Actually he gets it, gets into its inner workings, and turns it inside out. Vague, I know, but I'm trying very hard not to spoil the fun of this book.    There is no reason for you not to read Daemon, no matter your level of technical understanding. Everyone from the CEO who has only the vaguest understanding of his IT infrastructure to the mail room guy who goes home to play WoW for 8 hours to the advertising exec who only knows how to check his email.
1416562605|5.0|A great book...deserving of its Man Booker Prize.<br /><br />As much as I liked Edward Luce's [[ASIN:1400079772 In Spite of the Gods: The Rise of Modern India]], this fictional work is the most vivid and revealing book about India that I've read to date.  Author Aravind Adiga comes out of the gate with both guns blazing and never lets up.  The book is constructed as a series of dictated reveries addressed to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.  Adiga's tale speaks of an Indian/Chinese future with the US as a bit player.<br /><br />As early as Page 2, Adiga bares his teeth:<br /><br />\\"Apparently, sir, you Chinese are far ahead of us in every respect, except you don't have entrepreneurs.  And our nation, though it has no drinking water, electricity, sewage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy or punctuality, _does_ have entrepreneurs.\\"<br /><br />From there on in, the author wades in and fires haymakers like that on every page.  His pace and urgency never flag.<br /><br />The tone is captured by a single line of English his driver/protagonist quotes early and often: \\"What a f---ing joke.\\"  It's a phrase that is throw out with such aplomb and bitterness by his master's ex-wife that it catches the driver's ear despite his unfamiliarity with the language.<br /><br />I found it very enjoyable to pair this book with a viewing of Danny Boyle's [[ASIN:B001KVZ6BG Slumdog Millionaire [Theatrical Release]]].  Both are rooted in what Adiga calls the Darkness. In Adiga's tale, cynicism wins out and produces a deeply flawed survivor and winner.  Boyle's film, by contrast, gives us the triumph of the good and pure in the form of humble chaiwallah, Jamal Malik.

B001H5X7I4|1.0|I watched a documentary about comics this week and it made me realize there are people and shows that are genuinely funny.  This movie is not one of them.  It is just a lot of bathroom humor--nothing really funny.  If you liked Ben Stiller in Dodgeball or some of his other movies, then you might like this--but I thought Dodgeball was a lot better than this.  But, if you're looking for something genuinely funny--the way Jim Carrey is funny, then keep looking for something else to watch.

This book is dry, but not boring. Philosophical, but not elitist. I give it a gold (but not the shiny gold, the kind of gold that's been handed down from generation to generation and is all tarnished...) star.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I didn't know what to think honestly when I went to see this movie with friends a few months ago--I mean, I saw the previews and all of that and they made it seem, well, quite boring--but I knew that, after seeing Angelina Jolie in 2 prior films with a similar tone to this ('A Mighty Heart' and 'The Good Shepherd' respectivitely), my views were destine to change.  'Changeling' is the story of a single mother whose son is kidnapped by a ruthless child predator, and her fight to see his return despite the LAPD's attempts to deem her insane when she denies the young boy they push upon her is hers.<br /><br />The story is very interesting, and while the film starts out slow, it quickly gains momentum once she discovers her son is missing.  From the police investigation to her caring for the son that is not hers, to her being confined to an asylum for refusing to cooperate with the police department and the secrets revealed about the inmates' incarcerations, to the hunt for the man responsible and everything about him...it was just, at best I can describe it, a thrill ride.  I wasn't expecting it, but it put me in the mind of 'Silence of the Lambs' during some parts of the movie, in particular the search for the kidnapper.<br /><br />The movie is long I should warn.  Almost 3 hours if not, but once you invest your time into it, you won't notice as I didn't.  The ending was a bit surprising to me, but I was thankful that it wasn't predicatable or conventional, and just as thankful that I didn't do any research on the actual events.  I thought the cinematography was awesome, and this was by far some of the best acting I've seen from Angelina Jolie since 'A Mighty Heart.'  Clint Eastwood once again delivers and shows that there is nothing that he can't do.  If you're into period films, as well as mystery and suspense, then I totally recommend this film.
B000VI70WM|4.0|This album was a really pleasant surprise for me.  I basically love it, against my will.  because i would have preferred a live rocking sound like a live version of wild boys....but no matter, this is a great all around, danceable album thats loaded with hooks, beats and melodies...in fact its their first great, fully fleshed out album since notorious, which in itself is not what youd call classic duran duran.  Its too bad this album wasnt more of a smash, it deserves to be....ironically, for me, the justin timberlake track may be my least favorite..and that was one of 2 primary singles.   I just hope this sells enough to entice a record company to fund the next record, because this album has regenerated my enthusiasm for duran, and got me excited about what they might create next time around...duran duran has been reborn!
192076920X|5.0|First of all, the simple fact that this novel is very loosely based on the authors life is just amazing to me.  It easily could have been about 4 completely separate books about 4 different characters but is instead one story about one man.  It mainly follows through 5 stages of the main character, Lin's life (arrival at Bombay & living in a slum there,  working for the Bombay mafia, fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, his time in an Indian prison, and his return to serious drug addiction) with \\"flashbacks\\" to when he escaped from an Australian prison.  There's also the main plotline: his search for love from a woman and a father figure.<br /><br />And yet, this is not just an entertainment filled novel, though its plot could easily have been enough to make it a good book.  It is chock-full of serious, ironic, cynical, hopeful, romantic, and philosophical quotes to keep and memorize; enough it seems to last a lifetime. :<br /><br />\\"And I looked at the men, the brave and beautiful men beside me, running into the guns and God help me for thinking it, and God forgive me for saying it, but it was glorious, it was glorious, if glory is a magnificient and raptured exaltation. It was what love would be like, if love were a sin. It was what music would be, if music could kill you. And I climbed a prison wall with every running step.\\"<br /><br />The result is an astounding uplifting novel which provides not only an escape but also an inner journey for the soul.  I will be re-reading Shantaram for many years to come!

0307394549|5.0|This is a wonderful \\"go to\\" cookie book.  If you must have only one book that has only cookie recipes, then this is it. I have dozens of baking books and this is the only one that is divided into recipes based on the texture of the cookies - (Chewy, crisp, crumbly, cakey etc.).  This book contains very basic recipes (chocolate chip, sugar cookies) as well as fancier recipes - sometimes with some really different and exotic flavor combinations, but nothing too funky.  I'm not a huge fan of Martha Stewarts but even if you don't care much for her, this is still an awesome recipe book to own.  It would make a wonderful gift as well.  I've made at least a dozen recipes from this book so far and every single one of them has been delicious.  And of course the fact that there is a photo of each cookie is just delightful.  You don't see that too often in cook books.  I like to know how the end result should look. I highly recommend this book.
0060578793|5.0|This book provides great information that can be applied to any situation not just a survival situation.  The book is broken into sections that cover specific topics with sub topics such as (not a complete listing, just a sample of what is in this book):  Essentials (be prepared, research, planning, equipment, knives, etc), Strategy (car accident survival, air disaster), Climate & Terrain (covers all types &  covers vehicles too), Food (section has excellent drawings of plants, hunting, fishing, etc), Camp Craft (has a great section on ropes & lines, knots, cooking, etc), Reading the Signs (maps, direction finding, Weather, etc), On the Move (planning a route, upland travel , jungle, waterways, etc), Health (first aid, diseases, warm & cold climate, natural medicine, etc), Survival at Sea, Rescue, and Disasters.  I have had my copy since the mid 1980s and the binding has held up to lots of use.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|This black and white film needs that black and white artistic elaboration to find its complete value. We are entering a progressive descent into some kind of hell but we go down one step at a time without knowing there will be more steps after this one. This descent is represented in the film by the steps going up to the house behind the motel, then the steps going up and down from one level of the cabins to the next, then the staircase inside the house going up to the rooms but also going down to the fruit cellar. This image, which is a metaphor of the mind when it is swallowed up by insanity, is essential and cannot be in color because an insane mind is a whole set of hues and shades of grey. But Hitchcock in this case constructs the plot itself that way. Sexual temptation for the boy friend, then mutual and reciprocal financial temptation for the money and the girl, then the run, the escape. And then one step at a time the trail is getting hotter and hotter. The boss seeing her driving out of town. The cop finding her asleep in her car on the shoulder of a road. The cop following her and observing her swapping her car for another. The motel to escape the rain and get some rest. The sandwich and the milk, the discussion and the mental trap for her, the poor thief, and for him the poor surviving son. And you can go on and on and that will lead you to the end, but with only one question in your mind. How is it possible that such doom can fall upon someone? But who is that someone? The son, Norman Bates, a killer of his own mother and her lover who was left free to survive in society? The poor thief Marion Crane who was trusted with the un-trustable, so much money that her jaws fell down? There is in this film, maybe more than in most Hitchcock's films, the sense of some kind of doom or fate or destiny governed and controlled by some kind of insane authority. Hitchcock was showing then the God he never alluded to in this film that was governing this world must have gone not AWOL as some may say but insane, frankly schizophrenic. For this sinister world to make sense, you need to state that the master mind of our cosmos is a double personality, good old god on one side and good old satan on the other side and the fight between the two are not even close to the beginning of an end and our lot will be like that tossed from the benevolent hand of god into the malevolent hand of satan and/or vice versa as many times as these two will find some pleasure in doing so, as long as we will not cut the branches and the roots of this divine and devilish schizophrenia that is finding its source in our very flesh and mind and that is outsourced by our spirit or brain into some autonomous though totally virtual, an absolute simulacrum, of reality, an outsourcing movement that gives us the illusion of sanity paid for by that mental and spiritual alienation that the invention of these two supernatural beings represents for us. Better be alienated in spirituality than divided in reality. That explains so well the fact that such lines of thinking and representing our own experiential life can lead to all kinds of possible bigotry and fundamentalism, as soon as we decide we are standing on the only side worth it, that is to say the side of good, the side of god, the side of light, without understanding that there are so many shades of light and so many hues of shade that if we all stand one-sided and one-spirited and one-minded for what each one of us consider as pure light we are absolutely doomed to commit our daily genocide every day between our morning shower and our breakfast, just as an appetizer for our day of labor. And Hitchcock builds that fate upside down for the poor Marion Crane: the genocide of Norman Bates' mother happens between Marion Crane's evening snack and her before-going-to-bed shower, a shower she will never finish taking and that will be turned into a long bath in some muddy pond. The final and concluding image of the car containing the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life. He even imposes onto us a five minutes psychological ranting discourse from the local psychiatrist to convince us that all is normal since everything is upside down, but is it? Is it not the reverse: everything is upside down since all is normal, or is it everything is normal because all is upside down, or whatever? Add a touch of color to that film and you will produce a big meaningless mess. Black, white and grey become death so well, just like mourning becomes Elektra.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesontaining the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life.

Like many others have said here, I thought I would do the 1st level one time and then move to the 2nd and 3rd easily. There is no way. This is a serious workout and probably one of the best. How Jilllian crammed a complete workout in 20 minutes that has more of an impact than 45 min with weights, I'll never understand. But I highly recommend this workout!

B00004TDVV|3.0|this is the best album by Nickelback in my opinion. They have gone down hill since.... way down hill!
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|The first Bee Gees reissues came out in late 2006, did we really need to wait this long for \\"Odessa?\\"  Oh well, this thing is so friggin' gorgeous, WHO'S COMPLAINING?!  I'm happy as a clam!  Not only is the remastered sound quality top notch (just as the first three reissues were), the packaging should win an award.  When fans are hoping a \\"deluxe\\" reissue of a classic meets their expectations, this one is a prime example of how to appease, (I was SO hoping the label would go so far as to recreate the original red velvet jacket and BY GOLLY THEY DID!).  Not only that but I get a sticker and a poster in the package as well, are you kidding me?!      First off, this reissue sounds amazing!  Details previously lurking in the background of the original vinyl release now come to life like never before!  And this remastered version has provided a major breakthrough for me as a fan of this album, my ears have FINALLY opened to the three orchestral instrumental pieces featured.  I bought my first used vinyl copy of this album in 1997 and almost always skipped over the instrumentals.  To these ears, not one of them \\"delivered\\" to me at all, but that's not the case anymore!  All three are strikingly beautiful. There's no need to go into how great The Bee Gees' songs are on this album, it's the early Bee Gees for pete's sake.  Their vocal and songwriting greatness was already a given by the time of this album.     The mono versions of these albums have been such a treat on all of these reissues.  Unlike the mono version of an album such as The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" there are no real differences between the mono and the stereo mix like a different guitar track or vocal here and there.  The difference lies within the perception of the ear that's hearing it.  I've always found the mono versions to sound much more cohesive and more like a live performance of the material.  The mono version of \\"Odessa\\" seems to actually bring the entire album together better than the stereo version does.  It's probably because mono mixes remain steady throughout while stereo mixes can rock you back and forth with each track.  I actually prefer to listen to the mono versions on headphones to get the full impact of the mix.  Highly recommended!    The \\"Sketches For Odessa\\" disc is great, with some of the demos actually rivaling the finished songs on the album.  Now how a song titled \\"Barbara Came To Stay\\" turns into a song about Thomas Edison I have no idea, but somehow it did.  Both the demo and early take of \\"Melody Fair\\" are equally strong in their melodic appeal.  The Part Two section of \\"Whisper Whisper,\\" cast in a waltz time, doesn't work and it's a good thing they decided to pump it up with some soul for the released version.  After all, it's one of the best sections of the entire record.  The demo of \\"Lamplight\\" is especially intimate and charming, proving the song's ability to tug at heartstrings without so much heavy echo and orchestration.  The early take that follows showcases the song on it's way to becoming the finished product but isn't nearly as charming as the demo.  The song is great being on one extreme side of the map or the other, but not in the middle.  The early take of \\"Give Your Best\\" sounds great just being a straightforward country tune without being dressed up in the novelty touches that the released version has.  The \\"Seven Seas Symphony\\" demo is very eloquent with Maurice's piano playing.  The alternate version of \\"Never Say Never Again\\" ALMOST works, that is until the overbearing, distorted lead guitar overdub comes in and sinks the entire track like the ship Veronica itself!  The alternate \\"First Of May\\" features an even more heartbreaking lead vocal from Barry than the released version.  Closing out the disc are two previously unreleased tracks that could have been issued as an non-LP single, and why that wasn't considered is weird to say the least!  Both \\"Nobody's Someone\\" and \\"Pity\\" are so good it'd be hard to pick one for an A-side!  My bets would be on \\"Pity\\" simply because it's more upbeat and catchy.    Onto the packaging, I love how the inner sleeves look for the CDs!  The stereo/mono versions are housed in a gatefold cardboard jacket that looks like it could have succeeded as the album's original cover.  The \\"Sketches For Odessa\\" is in it's own separate sleeve looking like it could have been it's own album all together.  Heck, even the front picture on the inner booklet looks like it would've made a great cover!  BUT, a problem that plagued the original vinyl release plagues this CD reissue as well.  It seems that you just cannot have a flocked cover without little hairs getting all over the discs!  Fortunately with a CD, you don't have to worry about the fine hairs being grounded into any grooves when you play it (the hairs on my vinyl records are etched into them for life).     If the mono version of this album hadn't been included I would've rated it at four stars for being \\"VERY GOOD.\\"  The packaging alone warrants five but it's the music contained within that always comes first.  \\"Odessa\\" is a great double album, a must for any Bee Gees fan, but still remains a tad bit overblown.  The album has always suffered, in my opinion, from lack of a better track sequencing.  Closing the album's third side with TWO orchestral instrumentals is just absurd no matter how you look at it.  However, it works itself out much better presented in CD format (you can now pretend that \\"With All Nations\\" opens side four).    In conclusion, thanks to anyone and everyone who was involved in the deluxe reissue of this classic album.  It looks stunning, it sounds stunning, and features a great selection of bonus tracks.  Unless I'm able to buy a mint, sealed original from the '60s (or a new 180g pressing if they indeed decide to issue one), I WILL NOT NEED MY WORN VINYL COPY OF THIS ALBUM ANYMORE!
B000X5KSWM|3.0|Her stuff was better when she was with nightwish but her voice is still amazing. All in all it is a good album due to her serenely beautiful voice.
B000PFT1ZU|4.0|The remastered Berlin sounds much better than the previous version. The \\"over the top\\" production sheen has been toned down to proper dimensions and the songs are a lot more musically powerful and more pleasant on the ears to listen to, if anything about Berlin can be called pleasant. If you like Berlin enough to buy Lou's new live version, you should replace your old CD with this one.<br /><br />As for Berlin itself, it is a powerful set of songs. My theory is that the ending of \\"The Kids\\" was/is so disturbing that it leads to an instant desire to not hear the album again. I am fascinated by Berlin, I don't think art should always be easy and fun, and I will be listening to a lot more now that I have the remastered version. There is another fan of it too. \\"Though never exactly one to blow her own trumpet she [Suzanne Vega] has nevertheless found it necessary to announce, via her website, that her aim with Beauty & Crime was to create a modern classic, something comparable to Lou Reed's Berlin, which she adores.\\" -article on independent.co.uk
B000005YZM|3.0|3 1/2    Undoubtedly good, and insanely influential, the album nevertheless begins to loose steam after an amazing early streak. Although these harmony-driven, intelligently catchy songs do not hold up to the pop brilliance found in a very small minority, O&O is still well worth it for any fans of late 60's pop-rock.

B00005J7I5|5.0|What's the meaning behind Tool's songs?  I couldn't tell you.  Nearly every meaning could be debated until the end of time since Tool refuses to comment.  That being said, I think the central theme of this album is that of Plato's theory of Dualism, that the mind and body are separate entities.  Specifically, in the songs Parabol/Parabola and Lateralus.<br /><br />  Tool has never ceased to amaze and Lateralus is no exception.  Tool's timing syncopation, driving bass, and intellectual lyrics bring this album to the top of Tool's work (actually, I love all of their albums equally, if you're not counting Opiate).<br /><br />  A Tool fan has no excuses for not having Lateralus in their collection and, for that matter, no one should be able to get away without having experienced this provocative assembly of musical genius.  Well, at least Schism...

B001GCUNVW|5.0|While many praise this as Mickey's BIG comeback, maybe they didn't see Sin City back in 2005. That role put him back on the map for all those who saw it, but I have to admit that what he does in The Wrestler even towers head and shoulders above the character Marv that he brought to life so brilliantly. He deserves to win the Best Actor Oscar in my book. While Mickey Rourke is getting all the attention (he does deserve it), Marisa Tomei is on top of her game as well and deserves her nomination. Rounding out the main cast is Evan Rachel Wood as the daughter of Mickey's character. She doesn't have much screen time, but she pulls off the part very well.<br /><br />I was briefly a fan of professional wrestling when I was in middle school, but quickly lost interest. You don't have to like that aspect of the film to enjoy the overall experience. The wrestling scenes don't make up that much of the movie anyway, but be warned, they are extremely brutal.<br /><br />When the credits start to roll, with Bruce Springsteen singing his great original song for the movie, The Wrestler leaves you battered and bruised, but the story will have a lasting tug on your heart and soul.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
0440237688|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  The story line was never boring and it moved at a good pace.  The unique ending leaves the reader curious about the boys fate.  This is a great read for adults, teens, and children over the age of nine.<br /><br />Jonas grows up in a society where there is no crime, pain, or inequality. This \\"ideal\\" world is created because controls have been established that promote sameness.  For example, climate controls have been devised that prevent different seasons, medication is taken to suppress sexual impulses, colors have been eradicated, jobs are assigned by community elders, and spouses and children are designated based on compatibility.<br /><br />Jonas' life changes when he turns twelve and is assigned his role as the receiver. He begins his training with the \\"Giver.\\"  The giver is the only person that holds all the memories of life's true pleasures and pain. The giver's job is to transfer these memories to Jonas, and train him to become the next giver. When these memories are passed on to Jonas, and he experiences pleasure, pain, and the freedom of choice, he becomes torn between his presently controlled existence and a possible uncontrolled existence that includes pain, war, pleasure and love. He must decide between the two worlds for himself and everyone living in the community.<br /><br />This is a wonderful read for anyone that enjoys science fiction and adventure.
B00002E23E|3.0|This is a mediocre movie, but Led Zeppelin was a great band if you liked their headbanger heavy metal sound. When I saw that this live concert at Madison Square Garden took place in 1973, the year I graduated from high school, I thought a blast from the past would be interesting. But concert movies are tricky. In a sense you get the worst of both worlds -- you are not, in fact, present at a live concert, but watching it second hand, and the quality of the music doesn't compare to the studio recordings we're used to from CDs. There's no narration in this film, and really no narrative. By today's standards the technology is forty years old. We learn nothing from or about the band. But for those of that generation like me, it was still fun to watch a band that defined a generation (and sold 300 million albums) with songs like \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" -- Jimmy Page on what the film hails as \\"the electric guitar,\\" Robert Plant (vocals), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards) and John Bonham (drums).
B000IFS0HM|5.0|This book is the memoir of a young boy who was born in the US during the Great Depression who moved back to Limerick with his parents and brothers at the age of 4. It's a story about starvation and death and loss. But, it's also a story full of humor and strong family ties and hope.    I admit it. I frequently eschew books that I perceive as being sad or brutal. This book was both, but I am sooo thankful I've finally read it. This book could easily have been emotionally exhausting to the point that people would have trouble finishing it. However, the author very skillfully gives the reader a bit of a cushion from the raw emotion of life in Limerick in the 30's and 40's by making the narrative voice a tough, laconic kid (his younger self.) Frankie talks about these terrible life events in a very matter-of-fact way. He just accepts these sorts of things as part of his life. He recounts it to us so firmly, it gives the reader the license to be sad without being overwhelmed by the horror of it. Being a champion book blubberer, I appreciated that.     This memoir was a Pullitzer Prize winner and it shows.
B000FUTQ8C|5.0|For those who feel the need to use words like \\"desultory\\", this may not be the right book series to be reading. People like me who like to be immersed in a story and read just for the enjoyment and escape that it brings (and who have kept up with the Dune epic) will probably love it. If I wanted to analyze the thing to death I could also write a scathing review but I would rather spend my time reading. I'm glad that I paid no heed to the naysayers.

B001ILHY1I|3.0|Jason Statham, awesome. If you liked him in The Transporter, Crank, his driving movies, you'll enjoy him in this film. The problem with this film overall is that it tries to be almost a video game, super mario gets power ups, people get shot at constantly but don't die, cars are almost superheros, our hero lead character sets his car to \\"no damage, easy play level.\\" It's actaully kind of annoying.<br /><br />The Mad Max homage is huge, he drove a Jensen Interceptor. Jason Statham's name is Jensen. Coach (Ian MacShane, Lovejoy) remembers driving several, like trucks. The racing action is so Mad Max.<br /><br />The action is wild. It's furious. There are blood and guts everywhere. There are several moments where the director has gone \\"too far\\" with killing somebody. And the whole back story is a bit hard to really believe. The plot is predictable.<br /><br />However, the sound is really well done, those explosions are great. The cast has a ton of potential, Frederick Koehler as Lines, and Natalie Martinez as Elizabeth Case. And they frequently work well together. Visually the film was done well, especially the opening 15 minutes.<br /><br />Deathrace is mindless, gore ridden, foul language riddled movie.<br /><br />Most definately R rated for violence and language. There is no nudity (the slo-mo women exiting the bus is a bit too far over the top). And should be watched on a big screen with a good sound system.<br /><br />The DVD includes some special features, theatrical and unrated releases, and some making of featurettes.
0061122416|1.0|Follow your heart.  Don't abandon your dreams.  Life is a journey.  True love is just around the corner.  All that glitters is not gold. Every life has a purpose.  You must find your true destiny.  All things are connected.  The wind, the sun, the moon - all is ONE. We are all ONE. When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are, when you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.     That about sums up the content of this shallow, woefully uninspiring, childishly written tale passing itself off as some profound spiritual allegory teeming with hidden depths and wisdom.  A stroke of marketing genius to be sure, reminiscent of The Celestine Prophecy.    This book literally reeks of unoriginality -- formulaic story-line, time-worn themes, stunted dialogue, hokey symbolism (a shepherd boy, the Philosopher's Stone, Egyptian Pyramids, etc.), cartoon-like characters, flat, insipid writing, and a little dime-store Christianity thrown in for good measure.  Like a shoddy pre-fab house put up in a day, this sorry piece of New Age drivel was probably cranked out in one drunken weekend.  I picked it up from the library to find out what all the hype and fuss was surrounding this \\"classic\\" now supposedly celebrating its 20th anniversary. Good grief!   Grimm's Fairy Tales is a far finer work of literature than this example of sheer mediocrity. What a shame that books like this become international bestsellers, while many a fine manuscript languishes on a shelf somewhere with no hope of ever being published.  But I guess with the increasing illiteracy and dumbing down of our pop culture, we can expect more of the same.  Pity.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|Ah - film noir - ah - high school drama - a twist on an old classic made modern by muttering teens - and who better to flick an eyebrow - faces twisted in angst - dialogue so dilaberately convoluted that it becomes very clear that each character is just spouting their lines - but no one is actually listening or waiting for what the other has to say - because not even they understand it - how tongue in cheek.  How dull.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|During my Junior High into early High School years,the end of my Horror education was coming to an end.  I had already taken in the Universal,Hammer and various other essentials made from the 20s to the 70s.    Like many a Horror fan,I went through my gore and brutal phase,and John Carpenter was one of my idols.  Having seen The Thing(1982),Halloween(1978) and Escape From New York(1981),I had highly anticipated The Fog(1980).  It was a wonderful Horror film,playing like a classic Ghost Story,that unfortunately many in my seemingly,close-minded generation passed on.    Ten years later,I went back to re-discover many of the films of my teen years,and discovered Carpenter's The Fog in my DVD collection.    Far from a nostalgic remembrance,this film is a welcome relief from alot of the mindless and charcaterless gore films of that period and now.  Played as a Ghost Story in the style of Val Lewton,it also combined elements of Carpenter's Halloween and the typical Hawksian touches such as snappy dialouge and strong characters.    The gore is minimal,as the film wisely relies on atmosphere and build(the credit sequence in the beginning is among the scariest in the film and keeps the audience defensive ALL the way through!).  Carpenter gathers a good cast in this one including Tom Atkins,Jamie Lee Curtis,Janet Leigh,Adrienne Barbeau and Hal Holbrook,who all add an era of believability to there roles.    It's also a plus that the otherwordly denizens of the Fog are the work of Rob Bottin,who later creates the shape changing monstrosities on Carpenter's The Thing.    The story is simple:A ship of gold carrying lepers are killed years ago,there gold stolen.  100 years later they return to the coastal town where they wrecked and begin to murder for revenge...and the return of there gold!    It's handled surprisingly well.    The DVD is nice filled with two documentaries,a script to scene comparsion,awesome trailers(\\"What in the HELL is in that fog?!\\") and audio commentary withCarpenter and producer,Debra Hill.    I had picked this up for the cheap price of three bucks,but have to say it's worth the price Amazon charges for it.    Very reccomended for the Horror fan who is more interested in atmosphere and suspense than just buckets of blood.    A good one.....don't miss it!    Note(AVOID the remake!)
