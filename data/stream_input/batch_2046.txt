B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham know how to tell a story better than any writer I read.  The setting was so real that I really did believe that there was a correctionsl facility in Frostburg, MD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading the first chapter, I really didn't expect to like this book. However the plotline develops very quickly after the main characters are introduced with just enough mystery and intrigue to keep you guessing right up to the final chapters.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love, love, love Downton Abbey.  Interesting show showing the different social levels in the same house.  I am sure glad society has changed thought not as much as I'd like.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is very fun and new but the issue is it is very jumbled up it is always stopping every second and is really annoying!!
B005VPRG10|5.0|Received packed well and in perfect condition.  Nice size finished model, but not overly difficult to complete. A bit on the pricey side but all lego kits are in my opinion.  Good instructions.  Certainly glad I purchased it.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this book but in in tears at the ending Sam and grace have got to be one of my fave couples ever

B0011UJMK2|4.0|This story kept you glued to the page......Excelant read..  Will read more of this series.  Am loaning to friend and family.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I heard the movie was a lot better than the book.  I have yet to see the movie. Their are parts of the book that ate drawn out a bit. But I have to give the book high marks. I think you will get move about the characters from the book. The first half of the book is good. The second half of the book was really good. Mental illness Is sad. But you can function in life.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This sequel was amazing. I had trouble with the first book, but this one I could not put down. It leaves you in a place where you can't wait to read on in the next one. This is a must read.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|Difficult read to get started, but well worth the effort.  Read it before seeing the Musical or the new film that's out.  You'll have a better understanding and appreciation for the story.
B003D513TQ|5.0|I always loved the story of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. I got to watch this film on cable one day and was so impressed with it that I had to own it. The costumes are beautiful and the story is very close to life. It is now my favorite film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so much more addictive than temple run. its so much more challenging I recommend it definitely! no glitches! soooo fun!
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is one of Album's meatier offerings.  As you would expect, a thoughtful, thought-provoking, and spiritually uplfiting read from cover to cover.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Like always, this Fairy adventure delivers entertainment for all ages.  My girls absolutely love the Tinker Bell series of movies because they offer a great story but there is nothing &#34;scary&#34; lurking in the shadows.  Just fun and enjoyable.
B003U51HR2|1.0|When it aired millions chased the smoke monster and other devices left orphaned by the writers down the vortex.  Instead of buying these discs, consider watching replays of yesteryear stump speeches for free on the Tube.
B003DT19F0|5.0|This movie provided the same +enjoyment to my girls like all the other Tinker Bell movies have; it is fun, witty, and engaging.  Especially like how the Tinker Bell movies do not have a true villain, so my young girls don't get scared,
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The author has crafted an imaginative and original story, and included wondrous details that bring the setting and characters to life.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Movie came in excellent condition and I really enjoyed watching it with my dad. The movie was the extended edition, I was a little worried it wouldn't actually be the extended edition, but it was right! Good movie- good quality purchase.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I purchased on kindle.<br />Similar in writing style to Potter series, lots of characters and locations to wrap your head around (a mini town map would have been awesome) Much of the book is getting to know how everyone comes into the storyline & there unfolds the complexity that a sudden death can have on a community. If you're just looking for a book to read with no expectations you'll probably like it.
B007SZ0E1K|3.0|It works fine, good speed. At $220 it was expensive but that is Intel. Similar AMDs are near $100 less.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great Clancy story. A little too technical but always time well spent following the exploits of the Ryan family.
B008469DGY|5.0|I am an avid golfer, and find this hole in one challenge to be just difficult enough to keep playing when I have a few spare minutes.
1401322786|4.0|The story begins six thousand years ago when Dor places two stones on the ground to measure (though he doesn't call it that) a shadow.  Later on, he realized the shadow no longer is the same length.  The next day he sees the shadow return in the same dimension.  He has discovered time and soon develops the world's first clock, measuring the passage of time through the speed of water drops.<br /> In THE TIME KEEPER Mitch Albom calls time \\"God's greatest gift.\\"  It is something for which everyone asks for more.  For some people, it moves too quickly; for others, too slowly.<br /> As a punishment for measuring time-in future generations it can control people's lives- he is banished to a cave where he must hear every request for more time.  He cannot leave until he can teach two people the real meaning of time.<br /> He returns in the present time to complete his task with an eighty-five year old man who wants to live forever and a seventeen-year-old girl who has given up on her life.  It ends a few hundred years from now when the world is a very different place.<br /> The book is written in very short chapters, following the three main characters as the reader learns how they arrive at their current situations and how Dor shows them the role time should play in their lives.  As he states, \\"When you are measuring time, you are not living it.\\"<br /> I gave the book four stars because he raises an interesting concept but the book lacks serious depth (which is probably fine for his audience which isn't looking for deep philosophy).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super cool app! The images and background pictures are much clearer than the original version of temple run. (In fact now that i have this version the original bores me!!! :)
B005D63ICI|5.0|Great Season....Even though he doesn't realize it he does have feelings and is discovering them more and more.  With the right person he could overcome his &#34;dark passenger&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is one of the best game ever. I can't put it down I will play it day and night. SO AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!
1250027624|5.0|I have loved the series when it first started. Have to plan the day around the show.<br />When I saw the book, I had to have it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am enjoying the freedom of not having to carry a Bible to church, etc.  I have many translations at my fingertips!<br />I recently signed up for a couple of Bible Reading Plans, including 'Teach Me to Pray' & 'Joyce Meyer: Promises for Your Everyday Life&#34; - I love them!  No more carrying devotional books around. I see there are accountability plans too, there is so much to offer & I've just begun to explore the Bible YouVersion Ap, so am sure there will be more features that I'll enjoy.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Do not like it. heard so much about angry birds I had to try it. Probably won't play it again
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Great to watch after reading the book. Some loading problems encountered on amazon website though<br />Kids loved the movie regardless<br />Moving on to the second book and movie!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Always wanted to play the piano like a pro, now I can. My grandson thought he was pretty good too
B0084U0IEG|5.0|A great description of Britain in the early '70's - decaying infrastructure and the Cold War. A compelling story of life as a lowly female Civil Servant and the love she stumbles into because of that job. I am always amazed at how well Mcewan writes from a female perspective. I couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A co-worker told me about pinterest, I didn't know there was so much on there. I am hooked on this site.
1451620829|4.0|This is the second KISS book I have read. Ace's was the first, bought his at a Days of the Dead Convention in Indy 12', got to meet him and get his John Hancock,($75) for both. Been a fan since my teens, I'm 38, and like most fans we want to know what goes on behind the scenes. Ace's book was good, 3 stars, he shard a lot of his personal and family life and some funny KISS stories, but he didn't really bare too much of his dark side, maybe he didn't remember or maybe he was embarrassed. Ex.,like how he would dress in Nazi gear and make home movies.<br />In Peter's book, its starts out much like Ace's and he talks about his family and early life and how he got into music. He gives credit to the guys who shaped and molded KISS's image, Bill Aucoin and Sean Delany. It's very in-depth and you can feel his roller coaster ride through life. Of course he bashes Paul and Gene for trying to erase him from Kisstory and even Ace for his betrayal. A lot of good pics in the book, but only one of him with the \\"guys,\\" reafirmming his resent for his brothers in Rock n Roll. A great read for any fan, and Peter comes off as a down to earth guy I'd like to meet. I'm currently reading Gene's first book, \\"Kiss and Make-up\\". I'm hoping Paul will put out a book soon.<br /><br />My advice is to read all of their books and try to find the truth for yourself.<br /><br />MoPop
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Don't like it really boring game. probably won't play ever again. buy you sure ask for a lot of words for a review.

0385738781|4.0|With the sudden uprise in Dystopian fiction amongst Teen Fiction, I decided that it was time to give The Maze Runner series a read and I am glad I decided too as I have been enjoying it and now with only one book to go , I am interested in seeing the way it will go. The Maze Runner series is firstly though, a Dystopian novel that Boys in particular will enjoy and if you are wanting to get boys into reading- this series is the way to go.<br />In The Death Cure , we have read as the teams have survived The Maze and The Scorch Trials and now after learning that they have the Flare or at least can contract it , they must find their way to getting the cure. Also as many of us who have read the prior books know that each of the Maze participants had their memories wiped and now those remaining few have been given the opportunity to bring back their memories - will Thomas and his friends take the chance to bring back their memories or will Thomas, Newt and Minho stand against it? In The Death Cure , we read as the two groups and remaining survivors rise up against WICKD and escape into a world of Munies - those immune against the Flare and Cranks - those who have disintergrated from having the Flare , Blissers - those who have taken the drug of being in pure ignorance of their surroundings. Personally, this was a great read but I did feel a little let-down as normally with a  conclusion of a trilogy you expect answers to past questions and I felt that this book left me hanging a bit. You will however see past characters from The first book \\"The Maze Runners\\" appear in \\"The Death Cure\\".<br />I do say to readers though, that if you haven't read the first two books then do not attempt to read The Death Cure as you will be like \\"Huh, what is happening here\\" ???<br /><br />#This was a Library Book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just crazy! The graphics are amazing! There is nothing like this! FYI: they have unicorns and zebras too! It is totally worth getting!!! :)
B00AJRKR3Y|5.0|Steve Lukather, a founding member of Toto, has done several solo albums and this latest is as terrific as his other ones.  In interviews Luke shared that this album is about his reflections on a time of transition in his life and the music is crafted to show that same sentiment.  Some tunes start with one sound (soft or hard) and then move into the opposite direction, sometimes resolving where the tune started, sometimes continuing to build in that opposite direction.<br /><br />For instance hard and edgy intro gives way to softer center pieces before bridging back to the more gut-level tough guitar bits in the title cut Transition.  On the other hand Judgment Day starts almost ethereal, as if coming out of a fog and then builds to rock guitar crescendo that recalls great guitar work of the 80s.  Similarly Right the Wrong, a contemplative piece about the state of the world, starts softly and builds into a guitar solo (a Lukather signature in his songs) evocative of his deep emotions, crying out for change, restoration, a kind of sad desperation but with an energy that simultaneously holds onto to hope and optimism.<br /><br />The Creep Motel has an echo of &#34;The High Price of Hate&#34; from Mindfields both in sound and lyrics (to my hearing) and spares nothing of the raw emotion of disgust and disdain that the lyrics indicate.<br /><br />Luke's gift as songwriter has always shone through in his love ballads and this remains true for both Once Again and Rest of the World, albeit in two different tones... one in grief over love lost and the other in lazy afterglow of love found.  The faster paced Do I Stand Alone sounds a rallying cry against growing trends in society to disregard the voice of the people and seems a contemporary shout against those who manipulate media, elections, and laws to limit the power of the people.  Luke's Last Man Standing seems to take his previous instrumental piece &#34;The Truth&#34; (Ever Changing Times) and expands it with lyrics andinvigorated guitar parts that blend Luke's musings about where his life has taken him over the years with a resolve to not let the bumps and potholes prevent him from continuing on the journey... it is a song of resolve and determination to keep on going.<br /><br />Throughout the album, the sounds vary from plaintiff guitar to briskly moving challenge and each song showcases Luke's guitar expertise as well as his emotional honesty and vulnerability.  Take a listen for yourself... you won't be disappointed!
1451648537|5.0|This book change my viewpoint on many things. After you read this book you realize that life is really short and that you have to at least try to contribute to the Change. The book tells you that no matter who you are - you can succeed. Idea of Steve's life is: Listen, think, create and live. Enjoy the fruits of life. Be persistent and unique.<br /><br />Think Different
B002MVS18S|5.0|Awsome album, these guys continue to rock. Will always get these guys music and play them load and proud. Saxon &#34;ROCK's&#34;.  :D
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Songs were so great...Saw this last summer and it has stayed with me. I loved it as much as the original
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Like many others I bought this after reading the excellent \\"Gone Girl\\". This book was not quite that good. It dragged in spots and the creepiness of the characters and situations got to be too much for me at times. The book is narrated in the first person, and I found myself really rooting for the plucky protagonist, who is dealing with a lot of emotional baggage we learn about as the story unfolds. The mystery is good, and I couldn't put the book down for the last 10%, a section that raised my rating from three to four stars. I'm going on to Flynn's other published book now, and really hope she keeps writing.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I loved this app but now everytime I click on it to play it sends me to my home screen again. I tried it over and over and I uninstalled it but now it wont let me reinstall it for some reason... Fix this please!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great writing by Suzanne Collins.  Mom enjoyed reading them as much as the kids did.  Easy to share on the kindle.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|As all reviews about this book say that the book really inspires hope and belief in a silver lining for each bad situation. I will not say that but I will say that the book surprises you and when you think that nothing good can come from something ,everything turns out to be alright in the end. This book truly did inspire me to be the better person and not blame others for my own faults . A must read for people struggling with depression
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great writing by Suzanne Collins.  Mom enjoyed the books as much as the kids.  On the kindle it easy to share.

B009WO7NQO|2.0|It's stupid that these angry bird games don't give you the rules on how to play them. It gets very tiring to have to learn them out of the frustration of losing and on a trial and error basis. I most especially hate bad piggies beacuse of the lack of help
B0090SI4HO|4.0|\\"The Last Stand\\" (2013 release; 107 min.) brings the return of Arnold as a movie headliner (after a couple of teasers as a minor role in \\"The Expendables\\" movies), and the plot, as it is, is fairly straight-forward and easy to digest. The leader of a Mexican drug cartel is sprung from jail in Las Vegas, and is speeding down towards the Mexican border in a souped-up Corvette ZR1 (the other co-star of the movie). The last thing standing between him and freedom in Mexico is a small border town in Arizona, where Arnold is the Sheriff and his staff is small.<br /><br />Several comments: the plot is totally secondary to the action, and at that level, the movie delivers, period. There is hardly any lull in the movie. The highlight for me personnaly was the car chase between Arnold and the Mexican drig lord in the Arizona cornfield, which is staged beautifully, almost like a ballet of cars. Kudos to Korean director Jee-woon Kim who knows a thing or two about action movies but makes his Hollywood debut with this one. Well done. As to Arnold, he has definitely aged since his last major starring role in 2003 (Terminator 3), but he hasn't lost his sense of humor. When the Mexican drug lord at the very end tries to bribe Arnold with multi-millions, Arnold responds (in full Arnold-accent): \\"You make us immigrants look bad!\\" I just had to laugh out loud at that (I'm a first generation immigrant from Europe myself).<br /><br />This movie outright bombed at the box office last weekend. I almost didn't go see it but then several things changed my mind: both Entertainment Weekly and the Financial Times (whose movie reviewers I respect a great amount) gave it strong reviews, and my 26 yr. old son gave it 2 thumbs up after he saw it with his friends last weekend. I decided to check it out. So glad I did. There is nothing \\"revolutionary\\" about this movie, but it's mindless entertainment and a quality action movie, period. Now all we need is for Arnold to make another \\"Terminator\\" movie (keeping fingers crossed).keeping fingers crossed).
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|the matching is too simple and the matched tiles drop off too easy to follow what strategy you are doing
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have searched &#34;high and low&#34; for these headphones and was ecstatic when I found them here on Amazon.  I spend a lot of time at the local gym and these headphones are perfect for when I am on the treadmill.  When my last pair finally bit the dust after several years of abuse I went in search of another pair; when I could not find any in the local stores I tried ear buds (which always fell out) and full sized headphones which were much too hot.  I gave them five stars because the do exactly what I want them to do.  The sound quality is good, and it works well in the gym.  I bought three pair.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Great game real fun. I would recommend getting this game. The first one was good but this one is better and more challenging.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I joined out of curiosity. However so far I have not found why it should replace facebook. It is still very new to me and I will continue to explore it.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|The dark knight trilogy for how much? I haven't tried the ultraviolet but the discs are great and I don't know of anywhere you can beat this price. No complaints here and one of the few trilogies let alone movies I can watch over and over.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my opinion is dealt exceptable to you guys opinion its just that I give the opinion a 20000 because I love temple run me and my brothers are adected<br />-
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it okay but sometimes the screen just goes black and will not start up. The game is dealt fun though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love Temple Run so knew Id love this as well.  this game has all kinds of new power ups and I love that you can run in more than just a straight direction. love the zip lines and coal tunnels. does crash a lot when using he save life feature.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie. A very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.<br />Would have given it 5 stars but the quality of the stream was very so-so.<br />I was watching in HD the entire time. Colors were iffy, black levels off... compressed too much.<br />Network throughput on my end was excellent before during and after. No buffering issues, just<br />too much of a compromise to get the stream.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was an amazing book and I encourage everyone to read it. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|I was worried that this would be a pretentious and or condescending work but  was wrong, It is accessible and very interesting.  each chapter goes over a couple of myths concerning the subject and then he explains the reality of the subject.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Movie no brainer: Nothing that hasn't already been done; actors made lots of money regardless of what it made at the box office...blah blah blah.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It suits the Kindle Fire HD perfectly. Weather news is displayed instantly and accurately. A very good addition for anyone.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Great Series. I am really enjoying this story line set in middle earth. The characters are very well played. Bravo!
B000IDGDPA|5.0|Helen Hunt is perfectly believable in her role but then I am an ardent fan of hers.  The writing is wonderful and beautifully spoken.  I would recommend this movie as one to enjoy for the locale, the fashion, and the acting.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching A Good Woman.
0670026603|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. It's a great story that looks into several types of relationships and deals with some very emotional issues.

B0000025T6|4.0|Nebraska is an acoustic and harmonica-based album significantly quieter than the previous 5 Springsteen albums.<br /><br />\\"My Father's House\\" has lyrics that remind me of my childhood and the walks I'd take with my father through the woods.  However, I haven't experienced an outcome quite like the ending to this story.  This songs feels rather simplistic the way the vocal melody is written and the harmonica is too straight forward and almost boring compared to say, the work of Bob Dylan but... BUT! (in case it sounds like I'm criticizing it) the lyrics alone are enough to elevate the song to absolute greatness.  \\"Highway Patrolman\\" is based around the same downbeat mellow tone as \\"My Father's House\\" so it's important to focus on the lyrics above all else.  These lyrics are about the love you share for your brother, and that you'd do anything you possibly can to support him.  \\"Blood is thicker than water\\" so to speak (something I do *not* believe in, but hey, I can sense a great song when I hear it which this one most certainly is).  Yeah, I'm probably not a friend of Bruce.  Though to be fair, if I had my own wife and kids I'd support *them* no matter what.  Still no friend of Bruce though. :)<br /><br />The title song opens with a nice harmonica melody and lyrics about exploring the upper midwest of the USA with a girl all as a means to have some fun until... they get into trouble and have to face the dreaded judge.  I don't even need to mention the melody itself is really basic and why that's the case... because you *should* be listening to the lyrics!  \\"Atlantic City\\" has lyrics that are up for interpretation.  To me it sounds like Bruce is revealing how difficult and unfair life can be sometimes, regardless where you live or who you are but despite the troubling times, be optimistic anyway.  Yeah... I'm probably wrong.  \\"Mansion On the Hill\\" is about the memories of visiting a special place that you've always held close to your heart.  Or in this case, a special mansion that Bruce holds dear.  This place can be anywhere- the lyrics work great in this regard.  Whether on top of a hill, beside a stream, a restaurant, on the front porch, *anywhere*.  The memories shall remain.  \\"Reason To Believe\\" seems to be lyrically different than simply \\"finding a reason to believe\\" (and no, this is not a Rod Stewart cover in case you're wondering).  I sense these lyrics are about working hard and making enough money to support a family.<br /><br />\\"Johnny 99\\" focuses on a short-tempered man struggling to keep himself out of trouble with the law.  A more upbeat style compared to the rest of the material on Nebraska.  \\"State Trooper\\" has a \\"Pink Cadillac\\" type vibe in the chugging verse melody with lyrics really hard to comprehend due to the mellow singing approach from Bruce.  Still, it's obviously about the state troopers of New Jersey.  Probably one of the weaker songs here . Alright, *easily* the weakest song here.  Speaking of \\"Pink Cadillac\\", \\"Open All Night\\" bares an even stronger resemblance.  With that said, these two songs are still pretty decent which goes to show how memorable Nebraska is as an album.  \\"Used Cars\\" is remarkably sad on all counts.  The line about the salesman unable to make a deal is really amazing.  The melody is depressingly gorgeous.  This is Bruce Springsteen at his very best in my opinion- when writing these type of songs.<br /><br />Overall, best album by Bruce Springsteen?  Well, probably his best 80's album (though the River is probably his second best).  An album that focuses on short and sweet arrangements, honest storyteller lyrics, and a nonstop haunting atmosphere.  That's what makes Nebraska so great.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I sleep with a fan on anyway, but the added pink or brown noise has been great. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone has had trouble sleeping.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great read. Another super book by Morton  really got into characters and the place of time. Loved it ending was a twist!!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|i installed it and had fun for an hour and then closed out and when i tried to get back in it didnt work. i restarted my kindle and tried uninstalling it but when i tried to reinstall it it just said open. so it was ok.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|just wasn't right without Stallone. It was a pretty good story line, not the best and Stallone made the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a fun game to let time fly I have been on it for quite. a while and if u like farming this is a gd game shows u kinds ho2o take care of a horse
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the surprise twists in this sequel, usually can predict what's happening next. The reason why I'm not giving five stars, I hate the fact she can't decide who she should be with
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This book was a happy read.  It was just fun.  I loved it.  Very entertaining and lighthearted.  Very true to the confusing time that was high school.
B00008QSA5|5.0|a friend lent me his copy of this , i had never in my 41 years heard it before and i'm a pretty avid music lover. i was stunned by how good it is , buy it , you won't regret it .
B009E3EXMU|5.0|wonderful sound quality and everything i had imagined and wanted in this set. just as good as when they were young
B000JMKQX0|4.0|If you have read the book 'Warday' by Whitely Strieber and James Kunetka then you will love this book (and if you haven't read Warday, published back in the mid 80s, but still available, then you should). It uses a very similar narrative device and is just as engrossing. Think 'reports from the frontline' rather than 'just stories'. As in Warday a person about whom we know very little interviews survivors and participants in a huge global event and that's fine, it isn't the narrator we are interested in but the stories his interviewees tell us. And this one spans the beginning to the 'end' of WWZ (I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that)so we can see the timeline of events, albeit through multiple viewpoints. I really liked that the interviews were from both 'prominent individuals' as well as 'ordinary joes' - although I would have also liked to have seen more 'government info' but I understand that wasn't the direction the author wanted to take (and maybe I'm just greedy! lol) For some people the 'reporting style' of the narrative might put them off, but they're missing out in my opinon. A great read.<br />NB.I got this book as an airport read, which is why it isn't my usual Amazon purchase.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love this cover.  The aged look completely complements the modern Kindle Fire.  It holds the Kindle perfectly and securely. I've never worried about it falling out.  The cover flips around to the back and you can hold it that way.  There's a little &#34;flap&#34; on the inside of the front cover and I am able to slip my fingers in to hold the Kindle when reading. Great accessory.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great series!  Can't wait for Season 2.  Hope it's as good.  Great acting and great story line if they can keep it going.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I bought this as my first Kindle book and I'm delighted. It's a fitting introduction to the digital revolution of the 70s and 80s. I definitely related to the period and Isaacson's treatment of the subject was masterful.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you are a sucker for movies about animals, this is a real tear jerker.  A lovely, true story about a most devoted dog.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|First, I like all of tom clancy's novel.  Its fast moving and his characters are great.  His novel give you some great insight to how the CIA, PENTAGON AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WORK.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I just love this show.  I've been hooked on it ever since finding it on Amazon.  The scripts are very good at keeping you on edge.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this aas a Christmas gift.  It was well liked and I would highly reccomend it.  Was a fun read as well.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I LOVE this app; the different notebooks you can create, the fonts, the themes... they're all great. After discovering Notebooks, I bought a keyboard for my Kindle Fire HD and now I can use my device as somewhat of a laptop... I even began taking it to class and taking notes instead of having to kill my hand with writing. Oh, and did I mention the organization of this app? For a FREE app, this is by far the BEST!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is way cool. I just got it and I already love my horse Beauty.This game is for horse lover's everywhere or someone who wants a virtual pet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is an innovative, and fun interactive game that I would seriously recommend for anyone who likes to play solitaire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is really good Its the best though its just like temple run the monkeys bigger there's a rope and there's new diseane so peace out<br />(
859037985X|5.0|This book is considered THE primary resource for learning to program in Lua, as long as you are not new to programming in general! The additional material in this new edition makes it even more effective and useful for those with a somewhat limited programming background, although still not a book for complete beginners to programming in general. I would suggest for newcomers to programming wanting to use Lua to get both this book and &#34;Beginning Programming with Lua.&#34; In fact, I feel this is a good combo for many, myself included. Be aware that this 3rd edition of PiL, as this book is known in the Lua community, targets Lua 5.2, and the other book recommended targets Lua 5.1. The versions are quite similar but you need to be aware of the differences. This book is careful in pointing out to the reader these differences, as version 5.1 is still widely used.
B000YDG5X4|5.0|Good quality, good price. Nice boot I look forward to keeping for  along time!<br />. . . . . .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Words can not describe the emotions I feel for this book. It is as if a piece of my soul belongs to this book. The writing is so vivid it's as if you are sky living this amazing, heart wrenching journey. I smiled, I fell in \\"live\\", I laughed, I cried, I was scared and I fell in love right along with Sky. This is so much more then a quick fun read, this book is a MUST read ASAP for your life. Wonderful job Colleen, you never cease to amaze me with your incredible gift.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|pretty deceent game. my 6 year old loves it. wish it was easier to get gems and didn't want u to spend real money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its very entertaining but I sometimes have trouble loading it on my kindle fire. I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game a couple times. but it does let you continue your game..
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is easy to learn, yet next thing you know, you're on level forty something, trying to figure out the physics of these little boxes! Great brain teaser. Kudos!
B008BM0IUG|3.0|I'm not too dumb, but still failed to follow the author, especially after chapter 8 when he introduced some of the more complicated theories.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|We saw this in the theater, and I bought it for my husband for Christmas. Looks great, sounds great on the blu-ray. The only way to watch The Dark Knight.
B004I2K4DY|3.0|I ordered this DVD as a birthday present for my friend, and paid additional fee for wrap. But it's NOT in gift wrap and didn't have any message card as well. I don't know if it's due to the Saturday delivery that leave it not time for wrap. Any way, I will never try gift wrapping again.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Just incredible...but it's so sad that he's gone.  Michael will be remembered as one of the masters of music in this generation.  I feel so sorry for all of the others that supported the show.
142311339X|5.0|Since reading this series, I'll be getting other works by Riordan. The books flow into each other very well and I found myself losing track of time. Thouroughly enjoyed it!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I really loved playing it for the first five minutes but as soon as i closed it on my kindle fire it didnt open back up!!!! fun game but i dont recommend it for kindle.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Best game for my kindle fire hd so far. Great grapics and cool characters to play. My only complaint is simply that on my kindle fire the back key is right next to the skill buttons. If not careful I back out of game while playing. Would highly suggest to anyone!
1439153663|5.0|I think my understanding of the days of U.S. slavery, indentured servants, the random threats and pain from those in &#34;power&#34; has been raised with the reading of this book.  I enjoyed it alot. The creative writing through the voices of different characters was interesting, too.
B00432QAKK|5.0|Laughs and good times with this tv series. Every single episode is in it,  extras,  commentaries and interviews with all the cast.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|If you're a working professional, you need this app because it's finally useful when you're mobile with great features like &#34;learn about the person you're about to meet!&#34;.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is easy to use and learn.  It is very enjoyable and provides hours of pleasure playing.<br />Everyone in the household enjoys the game.
1932735410|4.0|Rita's book is very useful -- well organized with good visual aids and clear markers of what you need to know on the exam. Here's my caution for buyers -- you do NOT need to buy TWO of these books like I did. When I was reading reviews, I interpreted that this book was different from Andy Crowe's &#34;PMP Exam Prep&#34; -- the books are very similar -- narrative followed by questions SO DON'T BUY BOTH BOOKS. Pick one (I personally like Rita's a bit more) and the put the rest of your money in online prep tools -- there are some great apps that replace traditional print flash cards, or online tools and tests that you use in a browser. Rita's book includes a CD with her online offering, Andy's book includes one free week of his online courses and tests. Good luck on the exam!
075669812X|5.0|I got this book for my son as a gift from santa this past X-mas, he loves it. For any boy that is a Lego Ninjago fan will love it too!
0399215980|2.0|I was planning on sharing this book with a class of students, but the size of the book is so small I do not believe I will be able to share it with a class.  I was disappointed when I opened the package and saw the small size.  I had only seen the bigger of the size of this book and that was what I was expecting.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|This is a Hollywood classic and must see for any film lover!  It was a nostalgic walk through old film making techniques.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like everything except for you don't see or know if you went under things. So I love how you go into a mining cave, 'cause that's awesome.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Although this isn't a very well made mic, it does have good sound quality and it's inexpensive compared to other lavaliers. I don't get why they made the spring so large in the battery compartment, it's almost impossible to get a battery in there. I had to clip off some of the spring after many minutes of frustration. The windscreen pops off almost when you open the box, and the clip is made with plastic so it will break easily. Replacing a clip is almost as expensive as buying a new mic. The sound quality and price make up for these problems however since at the time I wrote this review the next mic I would consider costs over twice as much as this one.
B009KHCT94|5.0|A great really funny parody of so much.  America, black people, nazis, Sarah Palin, Star Trek, etc.  a cell phone powers a world destroying nazi spaceship and UFO's are used for special missions to Earth in order to procure more cell phone computers for their world dominating machine.  Sarah Palin in an attempt to get re-elected as president sends a black model to the moon as a presidential publicity stunt.  So much good humor.  This is a movie you don't want to pass up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the plots, twists n turns of downtown abbey, its entriging, magnetic and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B001BRAUYM|5.0|I find this request funny as all get out because I only ordered it the other day and haven't received it yet.<br />  I have always liked Vin Diesel, so that's why I gave it 5 stars without having watched it yet..<br />  Today is Sunday and I figure that by Tuesday I'll have it so I watch it.
B00846REIS|5.0|The Crossfire Series is awesome! I am looking forward to the third book. I'm not sure I'll have the patience to wait until May. The books just draw you in, you NEED to read them.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone that has or is thinking of starting a business.  A lot of the examples and lessons provided in the book can apply to a persons personal life as well.  I especially liked how Jim utilized the lessons of others in creating a great book as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|These s is a really good game! I would recommend it to any horse lovers. I play it every day. It is never blurry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story, where the survival and definition of who we really are takes place at a deadly arena! Ready to start reading the second!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Wanted to check this game out but it turns out it's not compatible with my phone. I'm still rockin' a very old, and yes I know, VERY outdated HTC Mytouch 3g (but whatever, I'm poor. Food/bills & petrol for my hoopty are more important right now that a newer smartphone...lol)<br />Anyways, I wanted to check this game out. So here on the Amazon website it said that it was fine to download and use on my phone (and it was free = perfect for me). So when it didn't show up on my phone, I went directly to the Android Play Store and right away they state that it isn't compatible with my phone.<br />So this review isn't about the game itself of course 'cause I could never play it on my phone, but more about what I see as a lil false advertising. There's a box to the far right of the page and in it it says &#34;compatibility with your devices&#34; and right underneath there is a nice GREEN check mark right next to my device. So I'm thinking I'm good to go right? Nope. Not the case at all. Thanks Amazon! I like you for a lot of reasons, but I guess for apps I'll just stick with going to the source.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app and I haven't ran into into any. pocket probs so it is a great app so I reccamend it for amy horse lover great little app use it for my kids all the time I love it and so will u most likely. very easy to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|warning:this game is extremly addicting. I have been playing this game a lot. it is worth the 6.99. everyone should get this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people of all ages and is really fun. My friend got the game before I did so I thought I would try it. I've. fallen in love with it. I highly recommend it. :)
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|I would give it five stars, but the iPad app crashes. It's fine on my Android and Kindle. When I use the iPad app, after viewing three or four pictures, the app just shuts down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game and its so fun when you don't have anything to do!!!! I love it. its the best!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the first two books so i had to read the last one! it was a great series and id read any other book she publishes in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best horse app ever!!! its super easy to play and almost never force-quits. the graphics are great too. I love this app!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Helpful of course. Found words that I didn't know exists and helped me majority with projects and such ... Yeah
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|So, you love angry birds and this MUST be awesome because it comes from Rovio...<br /><br />wrong.<br /><br />this is an interesting game, but it is not going to blow your mind.  my kids really like it, but not for it's challenge.  they just like breaking the vehicles that you build.  it seems to get boring fairly quickly.<br /><br />I will still pick up angry birds in a waiting room on my phone after all the hours I've already played it, but this one doesn't attract my interest any longer.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend that you pay money for it, try the free version first.
B00687PWQG|5.0|Awesome more then entertaining, educational life, like puts the revolution in perspective, gives a candid view of the founding of our country !!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I know some people love Angry Birds beyond all reason.  I'm not one of those.  I really enjoy Angry Birds, and I love star wars, so this one is a slam dunk, right?<br /><br />not really....<br /><br />This really didn't break any new ground.  yes, the birds function a bit differently, as they did with the Space version.  But, I feel like this one you are paying for the Star Wars look, but not really for new content other than a Millennium Falcon bombing run.<br /><br />I like it!  but it's not a &#34;must have&#34; unless you don't have any AB apps beyond the original.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Not suitable at all for a 4 year old. Poor story and too much rap style music. Very disappointed as this was an Xmas present to my youngest grandson.<br />Would not recommend to anyone.<br /> Suzanne Sanders
1442359315|5.0|I loved the book!!! I was in a state of goosebumps nearly the entire time of listening to it. (It was an audiobook.) It was even more powerful listening to the Doctor's own voice.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.  Even if you are already sure about heaven and not looking for proof, it is a vivid description of what we have to look forward to.  I loved it and would like to know even more of Dr. Alexander's work.
030758836X|5.0|My husband literally had to go out and get a second copy because he couldn't wait for me to finish the book.  He had to get his own copy.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen  It's wonderful!  I watched this program, including, Wagner's Dream on PBS; and from watching Wagner's Dream, I stayed up late to watch the Opera on PBS.  It was my first experience with Wagner, and I couldn't believe I was still awake after midnight watching it.  I decided to buy it, and since it's exactly the same version I saw on PBS, with the same actor/singers, I love it!  Wagner's Dream is very good too. Love it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love this show!  This season was great and I can't wait for the next one.  It's a great buy.
630460288X|5.0|works perfectly and the movie is great as well. If you enjoy action packed and funny action this is for you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|if you want. to use lots of brain cells this is the game for you.  it is imaginitive and exhilirating to solve ever more complex puzzles
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is awesome I love the new obstacles and the mine cart was the bomb this was way better then subway surfers
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I THINK THIS IS THE GAME IN APPSTORE!!!!!!!! It's amazing how much detail and hard work they've put into this to make it this fun!!!XD
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game worked great at first and my girls really liked it a lot.  However, just like others have said, it crashed and wont even load now.  My kids really like this game.  I hope they get it fixed!  I'm certainly glad it was free!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Movie itself came in great condition and right on time, especially considering it was a surprise gift. My boyfriend really needed a lift and this Disney classic hit home. Everything and more with \\" The Lion King\\" thanks Amazon for the expedient and secure package!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was great to see after I had recently wasted money on an inferior game that I immediately deleted. This game is superior quality,  with good graphics,  and a dark Alice in the Looking -glass meets horror film storyline.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|This book was recommended to Me . It was Wonderful and Very Believable!!  I Give it an A++. I also Recommend this Great Book.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Very badly written novel. I felt as though I was reading a mills and boons novel on steroids. Would never recommend !
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was a great combination of both action and romance in a futuristic world. City of bones was a very enjoyable read
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Was so excited to find Bingo Blitz for Kindle. Not only was I able to login to Facebook and play with friends, I am able to play 4 cards unlike the phone app version. Bravo!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game to play to pass some time.  I like the realistic movements, sound effects, the challenge.  All in all I give this game five stars.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Usually spend the least amount possible for a gaming headset; had the extra , yes, I realize $124.00 is a lot over the the usual $25.00 I usually spend, but as stated this is the absolute best headset you will find. Intuitive controls, 11hrs of wireless time per recharge, great mic, no noise moving it around, can be used while recharging, Fantastic sound and you really do hear everything if you want to set it up this way. Footsteps in a FPS sniper or attack game, and can hear them creeping up on you. Voice changer if needed, Just the best. And there's a 2year warranty! Never expected over 90 days, but it true. Loving this as hopefully is my last headset ever needed!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|In my opinion, this is a great pinball game.  Action is fast, smooth, can be very exciting to watch those points rack up.
B0030B624E|5.0|Tough to find on Netflix Wait, impossible, it's not viewable. But for this small cost of $5.00 bucks I now can see it anytime!!
B0012GN0Z8|4.0|For Springsteen fans, this is a nice addition to a collection of his albums. The title track is very moving.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think my horse is a game that many children will love playing it will teach them how to take care of a horse of course only in the game.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Have used Tripadvisor for a long time.it's my goto site for information about any place in the world I want to go.it's real reviews by real people.
1423136802|5.0|What a fantastic gift for my 10 yo daughter.  She absolutely will not put them down!  An incredible bargain that will stay with our family for years.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I pruchased this to help with presentations with my iPad. It behaves a lot like a dry-erase marker. Now I have my own personal white-board!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very entertaining.  Good story.  Lots of twists and turns.  Very well written  Excellent Grisham book.  Different than other Grisham works
030796664X|5.0|This book covered many different aspects of both the formation and continuation of habits and what can be done to change them. It's really not until you understand how a habit works that you will be able to alter that habit.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Playing Spider Solitare daily is a 'must have' for me. The difficult level keeps me playing util I win daily.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|This movie felt disconnected and confusing.  My husband and I found ourselves looking at each other with perplexed expressions more than once.  Where and when are they now? This guy is supposed to be Bruce Willis as a young man? Really? There is NO resemblance whatsoever!  Had a potentially good story but very bad directing left the viewer feeling like numerous important scenes must have been cut. Don't waste your money.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I found that this app is unnecessary. There are more direct ways to get to were you want to go on the web.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I was really expecting to be wowed with this movie. It didn't exactly wow me... but I liked it anyway.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app but it has a bug sometimes when you click on it to play the game it will turn a black screen and I hope they get thar fixed
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie and it did not disappoint. Most of the songs were really well done and the acting was good too. I could have done without some of the raunchy comments and gestures... and the gas station scene was too ridiculous for my tastes...but that's just me. Overall, it was a good flick and I watched it again.
B004SDEP38|4.0|it's just gets really boring and you have to have a account and everything so I just deleted but if your a business person you would very much like this app
0316182060|5.0|After reading the books, I discovered these graphic novel (manga) adaptations. At first I was a little leery, but after reading the first book, I quickly ordered the second and haven't regretted it. They do leave a few things out, but that's to be expected with these adaptations. I felt they kept in the important aspects of plot and characters, and am eagerly awaiting the 3rd volume.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book was great I had to enter a writing contest about a  book and I chose Wonder because just wow I can't even describe it
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its fun and all but it is a total copy of temple run. people make so much fuss but its just your average everyday game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best free game you can find! It's good for kids to learn how to take of a horse!
1449417051|1.0|I'm sure it's a great calendar.  I'll let you all know how it if I ever get it.  It's been over three weeks and it isn't even shipped.  According to my order status it's been out of stock since before the new year.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app. I can play a really long time and get a lot of enjoyment out of it! I definitely recommend Spider - a bit addictive and relaxing at the same time!
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Great acting, great packaging. Maggie Smith is always terrific, Michelle Dockery is understatedly hot. Having Seasons 1 & 2 in the same box brings good continuity.<br /><br />Oh, a Bill Maher joke: &#34;Stop telling me to watch Downton Abbey!&#34;  Heh.
1907523588|5.0|The marvel of this extraordinary novel is the power it derives from its simplicity.<br />Uneventful plot. Ordinary people. Characters observed and observed observing. Plain, spare language. Yet Woolf captures the absolute reality of life. The coursing dynamism of the mind. The hairpin turns and whiplash stings of emotion. It's all here. Joy, sadness, regret, hope, resentment, love.<br /><br />From most descriptions, you'd think this book was awfully esoteric, difficult and challenging. But it's not. It is open and fresh and very easy to read.<br /><br />There is something beautiful, truthful and memorable on every page of To The Lighthouse. Here is an example:<br /><br />What is the meaning of life? That was all--a simple question; one that tended to close on on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.<br /><br />To The Lighthouse is one.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Sherlock can fend off blows and escape death by knife and gun by visualizing assaults in advance. If I could visualize an anvil dropping on my head before it happened to me, I could avoid catastrophe too. This film is stupid, not to mention being overburdened by Hollywood screenwriting cliches - most excitement and turning points in life happen in bars, on trains, etc.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use app. Happy to find it!  The buttons are good-size and seem to function well. I have done only simple math so far, and it is already useful.
B0096PAA6E|2.0|This is tiresome album, very hard to get to grips with what it is trying to say. Switches from blues to canned pop music to funk then to blues again. Repeated listening only makes it more confusing. Glad I got it at a reduced price. The Hendrix legacy has nothing to fear from Jr.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The graphics are better. The hills, valleys, and curves give a exciting sense of motion that was missing in TR 1 with it's straight runs and right angle turns. As another reviewer mentioned there is only one ape chasing you but he very large and if the adventurer trips the ape is right behind your adventurer and is so big that he can block your your view of the next obstacles. Overall, fun and challenging. Recommended.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|My first thought was this would be one of those slow / nap time 'chick-flicks' movies that I'll not like. I was wrong! I can't count the times I laugh, felt sad, and reminisce on the area where I grew up. I highly recommend this movie.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|This was my favorite as I grew up, now it is a favorite of all my kids , family friends, and multiple family members
B000001EYO|5.0|good service, excellent product, fast and reliable! good service, excellent product, fast and reliable! good service, excellent product, fast and reliable!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The grandkids are thrilled with this game.  Even the adults seems to like it a lot.  Now I don't see my Kindle very much, but everyone is having so much fun, it is worth it..
B002P4JKFA|3.0|This is only for the ASIN above, a Canadian release, with titles both in French and English. I have no idea about the other releases.<br />This BD has the video quality of a mediocre DVD. Audio in English and French 5.1 and no subtitles. The movie - fantastic. The special features are great. Interviews after interviews.<br />So 5 stars for contents, 1 for the quality of the print.
0671502484|5.0|This is one of the best non-fiction books I've read. Clearly you need to be ready to devote the time to do justice to a near-800 page book of fairly dense text. However if you are interested in certain aspects of the story of oil then you could just read the sections of greatest appeal - for me it was Part 3, War and Strategy, focusing on the vital importance of oil supplies in WW2. Some sections on the various oil companies could probably be skimmed without great loss too, if you are short of time. And if you just want the stories of the colorful Texas oil barons then Bryan Burrough's The Big Rich is the best option. But I both enjoyed and learned much from this epic tale very well told. Yergin writes clearly and doesn't waste words - the book is long simply because oil's story is so wide-ranging and important. NB: I read the hard copy which is obviously like a brick but the many photos and maps probably still make it a better option than the Kindle version.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read!! I would recommend this book to anyone. I had a very hard time putting it down. Loved it!!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Interesting book about self discovery and redemption.  Harold is Everyman.  Thought provoking and most enjoyable read. The end is satisfying.
B000FCK9CW|5.0|This is definitely one of the best Poirot mysteries I have read.  The plot was great, and it was an enjoyable read.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Just wish it had a pocket for the stylus, otherwise it performs as stated.Keeps screen protected, is thin and lightweight.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great but it needs to make it easier yo get gems hence the four star. wee. thanks............ngreat but..lalalalalalalla teeheee. lololololol. tatatata
B0002F6BRE|4.0|This movie is light-hearted and silly, which makes it a good addition to our &#34;must watch&#34; Christmas movies library.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is goofy as Buddy, who is raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole.  He &#34;discovers&#34; he isn't actually an elf, and sets out to find his roots.  He ends up in the big city, where the cultural differences between the North Pole and Gotham are fodder for much of the film's fill-in humor.<br /><br />Zooey Deschannel is her &#34;indie it-girl&#34; self as Jovie, who becomes Buddy's love interest.  She works as an &#34;elf&#34; at Gimbel's, where Buddy finds work.  He gets on her nerves at first, but eventually they figure it out.  Oh, and Zooey sings a couple times, so that is worth the prices of the movie!<br /><br />Ed Asner as Santa Claus and Bob Newhart as Papa Elf are, in my opinion, the real show stealers.  Their parts are small, but important to the plot.  Both performed with the skill one can expect from these two thespians.<br /><br />I bought the Infinifilm Edition for the Letterbox format - and because it was cheaper than the other editions at the time.  I haven't spent the time to explore the extras provided by this edition yet.<br /><br />Enjoy, and always - ALWAYS - watch out for the Central Park Rangers!!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|How could I NOT have given this to a friend to finish off her collection. The end of the Harry Potter video collection.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I read this series a million times since it was first out and so have my bro and my mom. I recently got the books on my new kindle and after 're-reading the books I decided to write a review on the this book. I HIGHLY recommend this book and the series and the hero's of Olympus and the Kane chronicles for a amazing read to all ages from 0-1000! I fell in love with the characters and riordan`s style writing. His series was inspiring to me becuz I do want to write something like this when I'm older.  So give them a read and discover a world that Isn't as far away as it seems...
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Given as a gift as part of the Harry Potter Collection. A must have and as exciting and well told as all the previous ones.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter ordered this for her birthday and the movie was brand new and in perfect condition. Shipping was quick and she watches this movie almost every day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|O.M.G I love Subway Surfers it is so so so awesome my friend was the one who told me to download it because it was this awesome but it is super addicting because if u lose u want to win so u keep doing it and I got so far
B000BRBVO6|1.0|Amazon or its contracted provider should have pop - ups to point out that this movie only works in Region 2 part of the world which most people do not know means it only works on audio/visual televisions and/or movie systems in SOUTH AMERICA.  Since I have a buyer profile with amazon . com and my billing, shipping addresses ARE NOT in S. America but rather North America... i feel it would have been helpful if a &#34;pop up&#34; window would have come up stating &#34; are you sure you want to purchase this movie as I see you reside in USA Region and this movie will only work in Region 2 S. America???&#34;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  It does take some thinking.  The easy ones are easy and the hard ones can be really tough.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app and I think that it is a improvement over the 1st temple run. the new obstacles are great and I think it is overall a great app
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I saw this book mentioned on Fox8 news.  I HAD to have it, esp. as Charlie is from MY home town.  He writes of names and places I am quite familar with.  If my parents were still alive they would have remembered Charlies flight in Weston. Even I knew about the fire at the mental hosp. in Weston!  Thanks for a great story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a easy User friendly game. very animated and it is very realistic a game in 3D de colors pop
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The MASTER writer.  Can't go wrong with any of his books. Love the way it ended too.  He always keeps me interested with his plots.
B001C1066E|5.0|I bought two, one for my little brother and one for me. I give it a 4 star while my little brother gives it a 5 star (so lets say it's 4.5). My little brother uses it often with his and I use it to put my coins in.<br />The reason I give it a 4 star is because I think it could be a bit bigger on the inside and maybe the material better. It's still great though! There have been no accidents with it and I'm glad I bought it.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|writing style was somewhat different back in those days but still easy to understand. Also interesting to see the difference between the original book and the movie version
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I was very impressed by how fast it got here!!! Never have to wait long!! Comes when they say it does or even sooner!!!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The plastic on the front of the case has a permanent bubble near the bottom- cannot completely flatten it.  Makes it very difficult to text.  Also, the buttons on the side do  not allow one to turn the ringer off or to increase/decrease volume.  It may protect the inner workings of the phone, but it also does not allow the ease of using the iphone that other cases do.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app, I use it every night. My favorites are the rain on deck, brown noise and cape hatteras.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|This was a recommended book to read by a friend who thinks my ideals of child rearing were similar to the Tiger Mother in the book.  While there are many cultural truths that I could identify in reading this book, I also had to chuckle and smile as it seems its a good book to see the control that some parents feel the need to execute to ensure the success of the next generation.<br /><br />To set the record straight: Yes I am a Tiger mom...and I too am open to change and better ways to parent.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|The setting for this book is during a dark period in the Soviet Union when Stalin rules with an iron fist. Gives you an idea how lucky the West was. There is a broad cast of characters, but easy to follow. Tom Rob Smith is a very talented author with a style I really like and appreciate. I really could not put this book down. I am very happy that this is just the first of the trilogy. A  lot to look forward to.<br />Jay Gatlin
B007ATNHLI|4.0|The first one will always be the best, no matter what series. A beautiful blu-ray copy that adds missed detail to the film. Was like seeing it again for the first time on a big screen.
B000FC10WU|1.0|this book has a slow start and i am bored.  there has been nothing exciting happen in the first 75 pages so I quit
B00AE2J93I|3.0|it is cute with  little moral lessons and funny in parts. Grandkids loved it and I enjoyed it. eas not bored like some kids movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game very much and will recommend if you like solitaire games.  Play this game when I am on travel at the airport and in the plane.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|What can I say. LA gets pretty much wasted.  YAY!!  A good action movie with heart. Makes me hopeful that we do have men in our services that rise above it all and do what must be done...
B00APUQRPC|5.0|From beginning to end  a very good movie.  Eastwood is perfect in this role.  If you love a down to earth movie that is well worth it's price.  I downloaded it as in  renting it.  The movie was so good I want to watch it over and over so I plan to buy it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to use fun game to have on my kindle when I don't want to read.  Can't beat the price
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|After seeing the movie, I wanted to read a book.  I liked it.  A good read.  More character development than movie, which you would expect.  Jack is an unwitting participant in the situation he gets involved with, kicks a**, solves the crime, has a romance.<br />Learned something about counterfeiting, which was nice.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a fun game, you don't need to purchase things to progress but it certainly would help. The graphics are nice and most of the items don't have insane build times.
B00170MYIS|4.0|I needed an extra battery for my camera and this is it.The battery life holds up very good. In fact, I was a little surprised by it..
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My 3 year old gran daughter loves playing for hours with these cute dress up removeable  stickers,what a cute concept,this will always be a favorite I'm sure,great product!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Eastwood plays similar rolls in many of his later movies.  Gruff at first but mellow out when the movie gets going.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a great app for kids and adults. There are lots of games to keep you from getting bord and a great why to pass time.
0060254920|2.0|This book is awesome reminds me of when I was a kid growing up. I was so excited to get this book and give it to my friend as a gift but when I opened it from the packaging there were some pages that were bent and ripped.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Saw this show on PBS and had to get the DVD!  Glad I did because it is really beautiful, especially at the end when the original cast members join the rest of the cast for some of the songs.  If you are a Les Miserables fan, this DVD is for you!
1423140605|5.0|Superb series.  A must read for teen and adults alike.  If you like an easy read with a great plot, this you will enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app. it teaches you how to take care of a horse and train it to compete in competitions. The pixels are never blurry and the game rarely ever freezes. I highly recommend this game!
1423113454|5.0|Superb series.  Easy and quick read for teens through adults. For those that like series like Harry Potter and the Heroes of Olympus series this is another enjoyable, easy to get hooked series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't like when it says save me u have to have a gem it should give u at least 5 in the beginning other than that I highly recommend it
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This was a classic novel with multiple layers and aspects that keep you interested, involved with the characters, and eager to see how it develops.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a very fun game. But the only setback is it's almost exactly the same as Temple Run. Other than that I LUV IT!
B007EDYN36|5.0|A must read for any kiss fan I laughed out loud I cried I felt like I was in the same room as Peter listening to him tell his story  this book proves the cat can still lay it down
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book was hard to follow.  Every time I thought I understood it something would happen that was peculiar again. I didn't like the format either. It is laid out as the main character writing letters to someone and he doesn't even know the person
B00493E1GI|5.0|All the negative reviews confused me- as I adore this movie! But then I thought about it... and our society isn't famous for being in touch with love, light & truth. So it makes perfect sense that there are so many negative reviews.<br /><br />Liz is not selfish- she is the opposite of selfish, she is brave and true to herself.<br /><br />The imagery in this film is beautiful, and will inspire you.<br /><br />If your heart is capable of being opened, and your mind can be wise enough to follow your heart, you will love this movie. And it might just inspire you to open up your world and live fearlessly.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I thought the beginning was tough to follow and I almost lost interest. But once you get into it, it's great.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|this was such a great and interresting read as a  novel. even more interresting to see as a animated movie. still as a dark as the novel itself, but any fan of this batman story will be worth having in your collection.
B00000FC5H|5.0|A plus service all the way we played the cd brought back some old time's thank you so much Eric E.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an amazing book.  It is not a happy story but poignant and beautifully and poetically written.  After reading this book, by a relatively young author I had to read up on Markus Zusak.  I was so curious to know his inspiration and to find other books he had written.  I would highly recommend this book!  A memorable book for sure!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A perfect sequel to a great game. You won't be disappointed. So fun! New features and a little more challenging!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The action packed edge of the seat type of movies are my favorite that's why this movie is 5*. Bain is awesome little different from the comic but works lol enjoy.
B004AKCME8|4.0|The graphics in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. The owls look so real and the world they soar through is truly a fine example of digital art. The movie itself, had my kids pretty much glued to the TV throughout. The sound was the only problem we found, no matter how we set out TV up, the voices in the movie were so quiet we could barely understand them. Not sure if that was a problem with my particular DVD or not. Otherwise, excellent movie and highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game it was a lot of fun... I didn't think I would like it but it turned out to be pretty entertaining
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because  you can take care of the horse and it feels like you have a real horse that you are taking care of.
0547884591|5.0|The best thing about Tim's 3 books is that once you've gone through them, later on you can go back and reference because you will have moments where you go &#34;I think i remember tim saying something about ______. &#34; I refer to the 4hbody much more, since I'm on a mission to get lean, but this book has made my slowcarb meals much more tolerable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great sequel to a classic game and just as addictive as the first one! I love the railroad car challenge!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has written another winner! As usual, he caught my attention in the first pages of the novel, & I didn't want to put it down until I reached the end! Great book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down, once I started reading it!!! Holder and sky's relationship keeps you turning the pages!!! A must read!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining app. Easy to use but still keeps you occupied for a time. It's completely free, you can buy &quot;gems&quot; but you don't need then to play the game.
0962477060|5.0|This book is very well thought out, and speaks directly to the guitar player rather than to every type of musician. No prior knowledge is required. Edwards moves fast though, so if you know nothing about music at all, you may need other books or a class, but in my case, it's all good. Recommended.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I read most of these when I was in Jr High eons ago and enjoyed re-reading them. Finished the book in one night.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|As another reviewer mentioned, this reads a lot like a Studs Terkel history, or other collections of first-person narratives.  It reads like a realistic account of how such a thing might unfold.  If you are looking for horny high school kids doing stupid things in the remote woods or lone action heroes saving the day, you might be disappointed, but I loved it.  I have no idea how they are going to translate this into the movie, but my money is on *very* loosely.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The convenience of downloading this book and being able to share it with my husband is awesome. I will be buying many more books this year!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very interesting game. At first when I just played I did NOT get any of the controls. That would make sense since I have never played the original Temple run. I noticed some kids on my bus that they were playing this game. It made me wonder if I should even consider getting the game or not. After I actually got to SEE someone play and die, It caught me like a mouse in it's trap. Once I got it I was playing it for hours on my Kindle. After a while my dad got interested and got the game!<br /><br />All in all, I was hooked. It was a very fun game and I couldn't put it down. Especially since it is so good of a game, It would be hard to believe it would be free!<br /><br />I hope that you guys can outrun the monkey, because I know I can't!  My favorite part is when I hit the tree and it makes a splat sound!<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, all of you people who think this game sucks, are just people who think that almost everything has to be perfect. It is a pretty new game on the Kindle, so it makes sense that it would lag out. The only problem I really had was<br />that sometimes when I use a gem for a life, it crashes out and gives me negative gems. But I use it as a life lesson. It keeps me up to my game and saves gems.<br /><br />And can you PLEASE stop spelling words wrong?! I hate reviews where it goes like this: &quot;Oh I htr thrs gm. It id so stpif. If itr ws free I wiurd Buy ir.&quot; Don't you guys use spell check? I do, and it is very useful so that people don't make that stupid mistake on almost every review. Can you just please spell right? I mean, like, really. Does anyone know how to do anything anymore? Please enjoy the game and I hate all those who abuse the weak!<br /><br />  Love,<br />  The Assassin
0765325950|4.0|Finally it's finished.<br />It brought everything together<br />Nice job to Brandon Sanderson for pulling things together after Mr Jordans passing
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I think it is a great game. Anyone that likes fantasy and action should get this game. I think it is really awesome.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Beautiful scenery, people and great writing and acting.  This series is a compelling glimpse into class relationships in a very different time and culture!
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this action-packed movie. Always seems like the US government are the bad guys in this world...truth or dare? Mark Wahlberg really impressed me with this role and has become one of my favorite actors in this genre. Danny Glover makes a very convincing villain. I must have watched this movie a hundred times already. And as for Kate Mara...she is very easy on the eyes, especially in that blond wig!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|If you like Evanesance then you will love Halestorm. They are rock at it's best!!! I am a huge fan and love every single song on both of their albums!!!! That is so hard to accomplish on an album, but they have done it twice!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was one of the best movies my family and I have seen in some time. Though simplistic in storyline and, somewhat predictable as the end results of the competition was, the singing was very catchy and pleasurable. It brought back memories of the TV show with the same acapella competition. The charisma of the participants is almost as important (but not quite) as their talent. Completely unobjectionable movie and I just may purchase it for my home library.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a awesome game and I think that everyone should play it.I am not kidding.It is amazingly amazing.It is crazy good.It is not boring.
B0030B624E|5.0|I am a self-confessed Zombieholic! Since getting addicted to The Walking Dead, I just can't get enough of those disgusting creatures. Of course, that made me want to add to my arsenal right when they decide to push for gun control. Still looking for a crossbow, though. This movie was hilarious and I loved every minute of it. Too bad Bill Murray had to bite the dust, so to speak.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton is fast paced intriguing period drama that has the power to draw you in and leave you wanting more. Downton has already won several accolades, truly deserved in my opinion, for its authentic look into the early 1900's style of aristocratic living in an English mansion. Downton demonstrates the ability to have several story lines, some of them intertwined, with the formalities expected of the type of family, such as the Grantham and Crawley's with a contrasting view of the many different often willing servants of the Abbey.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|When I brought the program up I was advised that if I continued my computer cound be subject to naughty folks useing my information to attact other programs in my computer. No thanks. Not going to risk it. I deleated the program fom my machine!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Cannot wait to watch the movie.  The book kept my interest 100 percent of the time.  Highly recommended for adults.
B003JBI4F0|4.0|Picked this up in an effort to learn how to save time and dip my toe into Excel proramming. While I'm only about 30% this book has proved to be both entertaining and useful. Would definitely recommend for those new to VBA.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Keeping me busy for hours playing this game I start the game and hard to put down have to keep paying until I end it
B00003CXE7|5.0|An outstanding epic from director Ridley Scott following the fall and rise of a general who ends up a gladiator after the murder of the emperor. Russell Crowe is ideally cast as the lead, seeking revenge not only for the death of the emperor, but the murder of his wife and son. His Maximus is a man of determination, depth, and courage. Joaquin Phoenix is memorable as the vicious, cowardly new emperor, a sadistic sociopath. The rest of the cast are all well suited to their roles, and the world of Rome and beyond is well captured both by location shooting and special effects. A triumph for Ridley Scott, and a bloody and rousing film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game its like takeing care of a real horse and I love the game the graphics r great
0062073931|3.0|I completely and utterly enjoyed this Christie book. It was good in every way.<br /><br />There weren't a huge number of characters to keep track of like the other Christie books I have read. The characters were an interesting bunch as well, even though they did fall into the categories of A) Rich and snobby or B) Poor and meddling.<br /><br />This has been the first Christie book in which I didn't either already know or correctly guess the ending. So I was very pleased by this.<br /><br />I was glad that the man who helps Poirot solve the mystery wasn't annoying, but kind of likeable. In the last Christie book I read (Death on the Nile) the partner was just the most aggravating twit.<br /><br />Something I thought interesting is that Poirot seemed calm during the investigation. Usually, in the books I have read, Poirot seems a little anxious but not in this one. Maybe it was the beach setting? lol.<br /><br />Go ahead and read this one. Very fun and enjoyable.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Filmed in Boston, Massachusetts, you get to see how politics work in this East Coast City. This film will know your socks off.  There are twists and turns all over the place.  How can you go wrong with Ed Norton and Morgan Freeman in the same film together.  They even get the Boston accent right.  I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good dramatic thriller.  It has a lot of character depth throughout the movie and it definitely will keep you guessing scene by scene.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, you don't...  Enjoy...
0062073559|2.0|In 'Death on the Nile' I was thoroughly disappointed in that half-way through the book I guessed correctly on who was the murderer (but of course did not find out that my assumption was correct until the end). It thought it was rather predictable actually.<br /><br />I thought the characters had the same personality and seemed interchangeable. They were either A) Rich and snobby or B) poor and meddling. But there's like 20 characters that fit either of these categories, all whose personalities are one dimensional, so it's pretty annoying. With this substitutable cast of characters, and Poirot constantly changing his mind on how the crime happened, even after he declares that he has solved the crime, it's almost impossible to figure out who is who, where who was when the crime happened, why who would want the victim killed, etc. You need a flow chart or some other sort of visual aid to understand it all. If Christie had cut the cast down in half it would have been a lot better.<br /><br />I'd say still give this Christie novel a try though. It was enjoyable to a point.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I just love this film.  The characters are spectacular right down to the birds and animals.  Your story line is heartwarming and surprising at the same time.  If you enjoy a good story, played out with unique characters and a message line for both adults and children, you'l surely LOVE UP.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It's easy to use. Makes know how long I have doing tasks before needing a charge. Would highly recommend to friends or anyone.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had seen one of the Homeland shows on my TV during a free showtime weekend.  It was riviting.  I ordered Season<br />one as I was highly impressed with the storyline, acting, writing and character development.  The plot line is impeccable.  There are no areas where this series leaves you wondering what happened.  Its all delivered right in front of your eyes.  Did you ever watch a show or a movie where you just couldn't get enought.  You wanted more the moment the show ended.  And you wanted it right away.  Homeland is it.  I highly recommend this series, along with series two.  Its intense, riveting, jaw dropping and I guarantee you, you will be waiting for series three as soon as this season begins.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I was at my high scoore at 8 million and i press the &quot;save me&quot; option fr the second time and it just crashed. Nothing was saved =/. This has happened 7 or 8 times. 2 times, i was on my high scoore. This game would be amazing and i was looking forward to going to tem million but the crashes kill =( . Anyways the other 4 stars represent how awsome this game looks and how fun it is. Imgagi studios, plz fix the crashes plz.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|Thanks for putting up with the storm conditions and the frigid cold of the mountain while filming this movie.  It is appreciated.  You've put together a film that I saw in the theater, and had to buy for my own DVD collection.  I especially liked the &#34;how we made this film&#34; outakes.  Nice job.  If you like thrllers, you will enjoy this film.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|why does this game keep crashing.It is fun and all but I rarely can play because.it crashes a lot.other than that it is pretty good. :)
B0017ANAZO|5.0|I had read some reviews about this film from the Festival.  They all gave &#34;The Women&#34; quite good reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie.  Its very interesting, light hearted about some serious female issues without taking away the importance of the issue.  I have shared this DVD with friends and all of them have come back with raving reviews.  If you are interested in a chick-flick for the evening.  I highly recommend this movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the best app for any platform. I use it for all of my projects home and work. I can't say enough good things.
B00003CY5J|5.0|DeNiro and Norton have great carma together.  Ed Norton delivers a stellar performance in this film.  His acting range is uncovered from the first scene he appears to the very last.  I was greatly impressed.  DeNiro is remarkably sexy int his movie.  He exudes a grounded, secure gentleman who inevitably leades a double life.  (that of an art thief).  Whomever designed the sets in this film, did so around the characters lives and the dramatic deferance that they wanted you to believe.  Marlon Brando surprisingly stays sober long enough during the filming to give a pretty good performance.  Bravo Marlon!  The Director took a huge risk with that choice.  All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  I purchased it for my own DVD collection and have shown it to guests over and over again.  You won't be disappointed.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Okay, I'm a dude. And I like dude shows--like Dexter and Mad Men. I didn't think I'd like a British show about nobility and manners and romance...but I watched one episode and I was hooked. The characters are great and believable, and the setting (historically and geographically) is fascinating. I could go on and on, but then I'd have to turn in my man card. So, I'll just say that dudes can enjoy this show without shame.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this with my family over the holidays. Now we're all addicted! Season 3 can't come soon enough!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Great singing, wonderful story and lots of laughter.  Rebel Wilson made the movie so much fun with her improvisational acting
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it's great because I like sharing it with other sexy ladies out there waiting to kiss my a** spoken by Justin Bieber
B009MF5BXK|4.0|The old guys still have it. Playing off each others movie quotes was fun.  But Jason Stathem was great as this generation's tough guy.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Temple two is more detailed but gets boring after a while but overall fair.wish there were more characters than just four
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Kids 7-13 all enjoyed this movie (and mom too).  It was entertaining and generally wholesome.  I would recommend this movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love FB because it allows me to find new and old friends.  I can keep in close contact with friends all over the world, some of whom I originally met here on FB.  Thank you!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this Ap on my Xoom and the Evernote Chrome Ap and Firefox Ap on my Ubuntu Desktop. Any notes I take or clip from the web on one device is immediately available on the other. Information entered on the Xoom when WiFi is off or unavailable is saved locally on the Xoom until WiFi is available.
1579128955|5.0|This book is phenomenal. All of its content about the elements in the world is clear, very understandable, however; complex and challenging, you see, when I was in 5th grade. We took a reality check. And it was a questionnaire of the hobbies and activities I like associating with the occupations of: Health and medicine, science, math, and engineering, law, and many more. When I was finished. I rated the highest score 15 on science. So I looked into the careers in science. Their was biologist, botanist, and lots more. But suddenly I noticed a career I never heard of which was chemist. So I clicked the career of chemist to see what they do. OMG! It looked so fun and interesting! Working with chemicals, compositions of acids and bases, and mixing stuff up in labs to create wonderful things. Even my friend Viridiana picked chemist. Ever since then this is my #1 dream to be when I grow up! And I'm study chemistry step by step by myself; because I live in Vegas (NV) and schools here are rated 50th in the country. So I decided that since they can't pursued dream in the fields of chemistry. I will. So yes I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B00A6I87UQ|3.0|On my Xoom I cannot expand, zoom or magnify the charts. If I could do so, this would be a 5.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|This app is a must-have!  It makes drawing fun and easy with innovative tools.  I love being able to import and work on my personal pictures and artwork.  Even my kids have fun playing with this app.  A+++
B009VB97EY|4.0|If you're  looking for something mindless to watch, than this is Worth renting.  Channing tatum and Matthew Mcconaughey are enchanting....
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elk is a sweet movie that is &#34;family friendly.&#34; Kids of all ages can watch it, be entertained, and not have to worry about the content. Watch it with your kids and grandkids and have &#34;quality time&#34; talking about how important family is and what it means to love others even whe they don't deserve it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Now this was a surprise sleeper hit for me.  I don't like glee as much but since it was produced by the same people from Bridesmaids I thought I'd give it a shot.  Wow was I surprised how hilarious this movie was.<br /><br />I think the girls were hilarious and fun to watch.  It's a light-hearted movie with great singing and at times gross girl humor.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Just a wonderful  feel good movie.  There is life after 70!  The cast is magnificent, but then anything with Judy Dench has got to be great
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love anything that Grisham writes and this does allow me to keep the faith.  His insider facts and weaving in the fictional characters is without a doubt one of the best.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Absolutely love this game! Very addictive and makes you use your mind! Love the hint feature. After I complete the puzzle on my own I like to use the hints to find out how to get it perfect. Helps me think better on the next ones.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought this game might be a little a young for me but after I got to playing it I decided other wise. It is a fun busy game to play
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it's like the movie but the ship comes and ruined it but still play it. you just don't have a lot of room.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|I've meant to write this review for a while now.  The first book Maze Runner I really liked and although I had some issues with it I still wanted to stick with it.  I couldn't get a couple of my other reliable readers to get into the book but to each their own right?  The second book was pretty good, there were aspects that were really intriguing.  I was scared and wanted answered and felt for the characters.  The final book the Death Cure was pretty bad.  I felt myself saying \\"really come on\\" a bunch of times. Not all questions were answered and the way some were killed off and others got together just didn't seem nature.  The whole story line of the trilogy is intriguing I will agree to that but I feel The Death Cure was a horrible execution of that.  I was really disappointed because I had wanted the series to come full circle and satisfy me.  But it  just wasn't.  I don't want to give spoilers away so I won't say specifics on what I didn't like.  If you've read the first two book I'd usually say go ahead and finish but I'm not even sure I'm happy I did.  I wish I hadn't started the series now because I expected so much more.  I'd love to have this book rewritten.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was an EXCELLENT read. I have read 100's of books over the past year or two, and this one was spot on. IF this is not a movie, someone is missing a 100%<br />sure bet.<br /><br />Ernest, please add me to you fan club / chatroom :)  and FYI, this book is not just for youngsters..... I am 64.<br /><br /> All the best to you Ernest.  Brian
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much fun and I love my horse beauty shes so pretty and good at jumping and doing obstacles
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really enjoy this game it reminds me so much of Mario.  I never get tired playing this game it has so many levels that the game never ends
B00B19DMUE|1.0|I'm still wondering what the fuss was about...the trailer was much more intriguing than the movie.  I do not wish to rehash  the plot or give away any spoilers, but I do feel that it's my civic duty to warn all prospective viewers to save your $4.  I'm a horror movie veteran with a fondness for supernatural stories and this one bored me.  The acting was very good, and the Judaic theme was a nice variation from the overdone Catholic theme, but otherwise not worth the time or money.  I disliked every character, even though they worked so hard to make the viewer sympathize with the family's issues.  I could forgive the children for being self-centered-which is to be expected from tweens-but the adults were grating to say the least.  I couldn't wait to see some heads roll but even that never happened.  Oh well. You've been warned.
B005COO1X6|4.0|1st kindle book purchase. Not knowing exacting what I was puchasing, I found it short. Once I started it was difficult to put down.  Held my interest. Love short stories. I'll read Stephen King again.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was pretty good, and funny. I liked the comedy, and the way they poked fun at singing groups, and college. However, the main girl was supposed to be this expert at mixing songs together, and it was not believable in that she wasn't very good at it. Her rendition of I would walk 500 miles by the Proclaimers, with Titanium by David Guetta was just not that good. I would walk 500 miles was just as tired and played out as the songs the bella's were playing to death such as I saw the sings by Ace of Base. I wish there were better music by the Bellas. The movie also reminded me of the Sing Off. I enjoyed watching it, it was almost in perfect tune.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I play this constantly. I am on puzzle 224 already. My mind gets a work out with this game.  I like being able to solve the puzzle as fast as I can. I am still in classic puzzle mode so I am hoping the next level will time you on how fast you solve the puzzle
B0053O89WY|5.0|I honestly think this was the best season so far!!!  We laughed and laughed over this season!!!  Sheldon is awesome!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|After reading (and enjoying) Gone Girl, I ordered Gillian Flynn's other works.  I just finished reading Sharp Objects and considered this as good a read as Gone Girl.  I really like this author's writing style.  Yes, this was certainly a dark book with some really \\"unlikeable\\" characters. For me, the story/plot worked and I had a hard time putting it down.  Fans of Gone Girl should also like this one.<br /><br />Based on 2 books, I'm adding Gillian Flynn to my \\"must read\\" list of authors.  Of course, one bad future book gets her deleted from this list just as easily.....
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a very up to the minute storyline. I just wish we really did have these characters in D.C.<br />Great book!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I tried to play, but there were way to many adds to play. I deleted it! I won't try it again.
B001NLKT60|2.0|This is one of the most pointless and boring novels I have ever read. Seriously this is the best Stieg Larsson could do? The book is simply daily routines followed by political jargon that really takes you out of the experience. The first book had me enthralled beginning to end. This one made me think &#34;just get this over with already.&#34;
B003G4W49C|5.0|This novel truly shows that a true classic will always be compelling. Science fiction is truly one of the most interesting novels you can read. Ender's Game is quite the page turner. I found myself blown away by the story, I was cheering for the hero the entire time and every emotion he went through, I felt like a piece of me was too.
B004SBULWE|5.0|works great, set it on my home page on my new galaxy siii. just press the icon, it does everything it's supposed to do.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I love that this game was upgraded to hd.  It is a fine game that is so simple and complex.  This game is almost art.  I haven't played ico yet but shadow of the colossus is still as soothing and nerve wracking as ever.  If you didn't catch this on ps2 try it now.  It is a beautiful game.
B002APU580|5.0|Perfect casting, great acting, amazing screenplay, realistic setting. Keira Knightley at her best. I highly recommend checking out this version of a classic story.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I download the app, opened it, then powered down my Kindle to save battery. Now it won't open. What a waste and such a disappointment.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Scientifically accurate, and yet written so the layperson can understand and enjoy.  I was blown away at the depth of the lead character, and how attached you become to him.  Weir's descriptions of Mars took me there like no other novel since KSR's trilogy.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|One of my new favorite bands. This album did not disappoint. I cannot wait to check out some more of their older albums.
B003LXSY60|5.0|Black Keys are one of those bands that have slipped under my radar for years, just to find out that they have something like 11 albums. I cannot wait to listen to some of their older stuff.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great acting, lots of excitement,  just a down right good movie.  I would recommend it to everyone who likes action movies.
1400069289|5.0|very interesting and this comes from a person who doesn't read- I actually finished the whole book! it is worth the time
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|My two boys got me into Halo and I think I like it as much as them now.<br />This would make a awesome movie if it had the support.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought  that August told us all that you don't have to be smart to get an award. You just have to be you. And I think that is an awesome thing. I will never be an author because I do not have proper punctuation.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|im trying to download the app on my kindle fire because i LOVE horses, but its not loading? i tried twice and it wont install.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|My wife and I thought this movie was great. We think every couple should warch this movie and get a reality check. This movie pertains to alot of married people that have been married 25+ years.......
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Love this app!  Great for writing with a stylus /finger and illustrating.  It has pencils in all colors, markers, crayons, paint etc.  many colors and types of papers to use.......has ruled tablet type paper which k-1 grade writers need for sentence and story writing.  I am so excited to have this app on my Kindle Fires for small group literacy or math.<br />Kids can save work to finish later and I can delete things if it slows the app down.  Kudos to this app developer for creating an extremely useful EDUCATIONAL app for my kindergarten classroom.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|BOOK STARTED WELL AND HELD MY INTEREST ALL THE WAY. THE WARTIME THEME CREATED A SUSPENSE,AS TO WHAT THE SECRET WAS ABOUT.WAS IT A SPYING OR ESPIONAGE TWIST OR WAS IT SOMETHING ELSE?DID IT INVOLVE GERMANS OR SOMETHING PERSONAL?THE ENDING WAS SOMETHING I DID NOT SUSPECT.GREAT READ
B00005V3Z4|5.0|If you are a fan of movies that require alot of thinking and paying attention to the entire story, I highly recommend this film. I've watched it at least 5 or 6 times now and still enjoy it everytime.<br /><br />Acting: 4 star (I found Drew Barrymore's performance a tad weak)<br />Plot: 5 star (pay close attention to everything, strong story)<br />Production: 5 star (very well made, many cool shots strung together)<br />Overall: 5 star (very put together movie)
B004EPYZU8|4.0|I think many people who give this movie poor reviews didn't give it a fair chance BECAUSE of their refusal to look past the hot women with guns. I actually enjoyed the layered story and if you pay attention to every aspect of the story I think you will too. Just PLEASE take my advice and give this movie a chance. Though diaglog is a tad weak, the effects, story, and production value make this a worthwhile movie.<br /><br />Acting: 3 1/2 star (though the actors do not have many weak spots, the dialog is fairly basic and unimaginative)<br />Plot: 4 star (a few minor holes, but definetly a good story with occassional shocks and surprises)<br />Production: 5 star (fantastic. awe inspiring locations, the scenery combined with the music is a match made in heaven)<br />Overall: 4 star (plenty of action and a good story that requires your full attention, again, much more than hot chicks with guns)
0761163808|4.0|I enjoyed this book --It is a conversation piece on my coffee table.  I went to africa 20 years ago so it is especially interesting to me
B009EEFTMC|5.0|love love love it.  If you like tile games try this one.  It is a blast just make sure your battery is full you wont be able to put it down.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|At first I was afraid it would not be a good product since it offers better specifications for a lower price. However, the Mouse is really good, I have nothing to complain about! The customization software is really easy to use, I had no problems at all with it!
B002J2PB10|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is insane. I mean that in the most respectful way. The dialogue in his movies is genius. Just awesome. I love everything this guy puts out. The soundtracks are perfect too.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|This is the worst of the MiB series. But I guess when you get to the third of any series that's probably going to happen. The villain in this one is ridiculous. Just bad. I do love Will Smith but even he can't save this one. I would only watch it again if it was free and I was really high, and there was absolutely nothing else.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoyed it, and the horses are very real!  Only downside is it doesn't load fast and sometimes I need to reload it.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I wanted to wait until this movie was available on DVD and when I watched it, I was very impressed.  Have watched it more than once and get more about the story line and its metaphoric meanings each time.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game for any good puzzle-lover. It doesn't baby you through every step, but does have a good hint system for if you need it. Keeps you interested with a unique storyline that is engaging. I love it!
B007NZDES0|5.0|As I have previously stated, this is one of my favorite artist and anything she's involved with I will DEFINITELY support and purchase!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|An imaginative young love story that kept me attentive from start to finish. I will watch again, and likely again.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical John Crisham novel, reads fast and keeps the interest.  Very hard to guess the the ending.  very good book
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like Angry Bird it's entertaining and easy for play, each game level gets more chalenging.  almost anyone can play uit.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Awesome and a very good app. The number of contraptions you can make are endless! You make cool cars and planes to get to the end of a track. You should try it! It is free. I rated it 4 stars because it does get pretty hard and frustrating the further into it you get.I think that is just to get money, because you can buy cheats with real money (That is something else, it contains in app purchasing).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great series of books. Very entertaining, if there was more, I'd read them, too. I actually laughed out loud more than once.
B004TIKXCE|5.0|This is a very straight forward, inetersting book to read. I would definatly recomend this to anyone who loves reading ancient historical works
B003WUYRGI|4.0|You should look at the words and how they are made.funny words you should see some are so crazy .
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have appreciated this app and the detailed info it gives.  Helps me manage my Kindle's power muchvbetter than guessing from the icon.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|After 30 years of marriage, we are finally speaking what we both need.  It's never been better thanks to this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a good app, even though it took me awhile to relise there was a t.r.2 the winding paths add some difficulties, and there are new hazards, but if I didn't hats those monkeys enough, this just causes all new feelings for them. And they're not good feelings.
0525953728|4.0|Like most Americans I had an insatiable curiosity about the men who took down Osama bin Laden. Unlike most Americans I didn't actively seek the information because I knew how dangerous it would be for the men who put their lives on the line, day in and day out, to keep America safe. No Easy Day: The Autobriography of a Navy SEAL is the autobiography of Navy SEAL Team Six team (DEVGRU) team leader, Mark Owens (which is not his real name by the way). It is also a firsthand account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden told by someone who was a team leader.<br /><br />Written by Kevin Maurer, the story of Owens' life is detailed and interesting. The recounting of the mission that finally killed America's #1 enemy is excruciatingly detailed. Everything you ever wanted to know about how SEALs think, work, and survive is in this book. I found it quite fascinating because I felt confident Owens wouldn't reveal anything that would harm anyone, so I just settled in and dived into the book.<br /><br />Of Osama bin Laden, Owen said, \\"He hadn't even prepared a defense. He had no intention of fighting. He asked his followers for decades to wear suicide vests or fly planes into buildings, but didn't even pick up his weapon. In all my deployments, we routinely saw this phenomenon. The higher up the food chain the targeted individual was, the bigger a pu##@ he was. The leaders were less willing to fight. It was always the young and impressionable who strap on the explosives and blow themselves up.\\"<br /><br />Of Barack Obama, Owen said, \\"None of us were huge fans of Obama. We respected him as the commander in chief of the military and for giving the green light on the mission.\\"<br /><br />Of Joe Biden, Owen said, \\"After the speech, we posed for a few pictures. Biden kept cracking lame jokes that no one got. He seemed like a nice guy, but he reminded me of someone's drunken uncle at Christmas dinner.\\"<br /><br />Of his job as a Navy SEAL, Owen said, \\"I'd spent over a decade ofmy life sacrificing for this job and country. I gave up everything to live this dream. Long periods spent away from friends and family, missed holidays, and a physical beating on my body that will last the rest of my life. I served with America's best and made lifelong friends with a group of guys I call my brothers. Since my deployment as a SEAL and the attacks on September 11, I'd dreamed of being involved in the mission that would kill or capture Osama bin Laden. I was lucky enough to play a role. Now it is time for some else to take a turn.\\"<br /><br />Well written, No Easy Day is an easy must read for those who truly want to understand the sacrifices others make on our behalf. Navy SEALs are among the most elite forces in our military and they live by a strict code of honor and secrecy.<br /><br />Maurer did jump around a lot, from past to present and back, and that was not the wisest course of action as the writer of this story. It presented a somewhat jumbled picture of Mark Owens history and his missions. However, that is trivial compared to the powerful story told within the pages of No Easy Day, which I give a solid 4 out of 5 stars. In other words, the story overcomes the structural problem.<br /><br />To Mark Owens and every other Navy SEAL who has served or is currently serving our country, I can only express my heartfelt gratitude for the great sacrifices you make day in and day out so that we can sleep at night.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|So glad i went with these after nearly being dead-set on getting some Beats by Dre. These were much cheaper and had much better reviews and now I know why. They are definitely worth the money for the quality of sound you get. I've listened to songs a thousand times and when I listened to them through my new headphones it was like hearing them for the first time again.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Probably geared towards and older audience but entertaining. Acting was good. Filming was good. Story is very creative. Better if it's on sale or if you wait i'm sure it will be on tv tbs 3 x /week
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I enjoy the easy banter of the characters, their caring and skills. I have always been a fan of Mark Harman, even though as Gibbs, he hasn't much to say....but actions and expressions (body and facial) speak louder than words. A good show.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett produces credible persons and fiction combined with facts. Just what I've needed to understand the whys of last century.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game it is pretty cool! I reccomend it to anyone that like horses. buy it for because it is free and fun.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fabulous book. Almost put it down, but friends kept saying 'stay with it' and they were right. What a unique story and so well put together. A lot of 'cliff hangers' and a great ending!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful game for horse lovers. Glad I downloaded it. :) It's very realistic and quite fun. :) Hope you enjoy it too!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I want to start off by saying that I enjoyed this book and finished it in a day. I would recommend it for the price. I can understand why so many people gave it five stars. The book dives deep into the issue of sexual child abuse which is very interesting and relatable to a lot of people. With this being said there were flaws with the book that made me roll my eyes a lot and feel the book was a little off.<br /><br />1st - The 17/18yo characters talk way above their actual age. This always bothers me about books, TV shows, and movies. For me to be completely captivated by a book I have to really believe what I am reading. I have to fell the characters are real. Especially if the book doesn't have wizards, vampires, or time machines.<br /><br />2nd - The second half of the book is like a psychology lesson. During the first half the characters were witty and interesting. During the second half two of the supporting characters (Breckin & Six) were non existent and I think it needed that balance.<br /><br />3rd - Holder (Dean) was completely implausible to me. He was kind of a jerk in the beginning which later is explained but not well. Not to where I believe it. And again he spoke like he was 30 not 18...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun, it is really easy to get the coins and gems and there are many activities to do. The only thing I dislike is that there are only western saddles even though you are jumping.
1451673442|5.0|Simply wonderful.  Thought it was going to be something I already knew and practised i.e. giving thanks.  But this book takes gratitude to a new level - and thus changes your daily life.  Am on Day 23 and can't wait to finish and do it all again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|What a great sequel to the first temple run! The controls take some getting used to but once you have them down, you're set.  I love that it takes to through different scenery.  All &amp; all, really fun!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Had a problem with the case contacted Amazon where I was given the option to return it. I contacted LifeProof because I liked the case and really wanted it. What I found out was this case from JANET'S CLOSET was a counterfeit and I probably wouldn't get it back,  although they would try. LifeProof also suggested that I check out the LifeProof website and look for authorized retailers, and if ordering from Amazon make sure in the seller line it says sold by AMAZON or LIFEPROOF, so you don't end up with a counterfeit.  I was able to order the authentic LifeProof case from Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Here is a copy of the email from LifeProof.<br /><br />Date: Wed, 20 Feb 2013 22:47:42 -0800<br />From: support@lifeproof.com<br />To: laidbackaz@msn.com<br />Subject: Case # 102534214 Created: Counterfeit Case<br /><br />Thank you for contacting LifeProof Customer Support.<br />Your request for assistance has been received.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|A laugh out loud personal history lesson combined with wisdom and compassion and a  look at bogus attitudes on aging.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is really cool. I'm not usually into anything that looks spooky but this one is pretty neat. All the G5 games are worth the money.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book had me going through many emotions...anger, sadness, the story of this innocent little girl taken and forced to live in such awful conditions, it's more than I can comprehend. A good read that will make you thankful for all that you take for granted.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|True love at it's best. At first I liked the book because I  felt I could relate to Sky and the cosmic connection/lust she felt for Holder instantly but as the story went on and the truths of their pasts came out, I was entranced but their love for each other.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this app all the time with its new features zipline.cave.mountains and charecters is all I can say is that this is a great app
B00136Q342|5.0|I love the song choices.  The recording quality is great.  I especially enjoyed hearing him sing with June Carter.  My favorite songs in this album is Jackson & Cocaine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very engrossing frm the beginning to the end. Just couldn't put the book down. I totally loved it. The title too so apt.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My kids love this game!! They would play it for hours if they were allowed.  It is a cute game with cute graphics.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I had seen the movies but never read the book.  It was good and showed how some of the movies took liberties. Excellent read.
B001LXIDVS|4.0|Reminiscent in spirit, if not particulars, of the popular Western comedies that Bob Hope was making a generation before this film (to mention only one group from among the numerous predecessors).<br />Possibly for this reason, I found it to be more enjoyable than the second entry in the series and quite watchable- whether or not you have seen the other two. Another  significant change from the others lies in the opportunity given to Christopher Lloyd to show, for a few minutes, that The Nutty Professor is only one of the many roles which this cultivated actor is capable of playing. For the most part, Michael Fox remains appealing in the lead; however, it seems to me, he is less credible as a high school adolescent than in the previous two pictures in the series (close in time though they were in their production). To the extent this is an accurate perception, it makes little difference in our accepting him as what he is supposed to be. The supporting players ham it up as they are supposed to do, with the exception of the attractive Mary Steenburgen, who gives the School Marm a suitably luscious presence, if not quite the flavor of Mae West in either of her Western outings.<br />All-in-all, this is an enjoyable Western comedy, and, certainly a family movie (if such still exist).
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't like the way entries are not in order chronilogically - I can adjust to that but it really does not always work!<br />Used to enjoy Facebook but now most of it seems like a waste of time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very useful and up to date information, easy to use and I highly reccomend this app to anyone who wants to keep up on the weather.
1594487154|5.0|This was an excellent book.  One that is helpful, and you cannot put down.  It is a refashioning of the view of sales in this society.  People think selling is a dirty business, but as the world changes, we are all salesmen.  We might be trying to sell our kids the need to work hard, or our congregation on a vision, or our loves on healthy eating.  But we are all in this business together.  There might have been some negative elements, and there is still some of this, but this is changing.  If you want to sell, it is more about attunement, and providing service to people.  This is probably one of the best books I read this year.  It was practical, always had real life assignments at the end of each chapter.  It is a book that you need to read over and over again.  As a minister, this was a must book.  Not so that I can con people, rather so I can help listen to what they are saying, and help them develop as Christians.  It even provides the right thinking for a preacher.  This learned optimism.  We all suffer failure in congregations in various areas, but some learn how to more forward.  This is probably the best preacher book that is not about preachers.  It might seem strange for me to say that, but if you read it, you will understand.  It is not about hard sales, rather about aligning yourself with people who are seeking Christ.  Partnering with them on the journey.  Helping people to gain as much maturity as possible.  You do not sell snake oil, rather you are trying to help people realize the blessing of being in Christ.  I highly recommend this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Sky is a girl who has been somewhat sheltered by her adopted single mother for her whole life. No technology is allowed in their home (and I wondered repeatedly how that would actually be possible in this day and age) and she's been homeschooled. She convinces her mom to let her attend public school for her senior year with her best friend, Six. Unfortunately, Six has been accepted into a study abroad program and won't be there. The situation gets more unfortunate as Sky's friendship with Six has given her an undeserved reputation. She then meets the gorgeous mysterious Dean Holder, who also has a bad reputation. Much of the book centers on their relationship but there is a lot more to the story than just the romance.<br /><br />Sky was an interesting character. For the most part, she's likable and funny though her stubbornness can be annoying. You know there is more to her back story which is hinted at but not fully divulged until the end of the book. Holder was slightly more predictable. He seemed to be the typical romantic hero but I was okay with that. He's everything women want in this role sexy, strong, brooding, etc. I think the characters that needed to be developed more were Karen (mom), Six and Breckin. I can't fathom how Sky decides she isn't going to talk to her lifelong best friend as her life unravels. And the story line with Breckin seemed too contrived and convenient. Who walks up to a total stranger and announces, We're going to be best friends because people pick on us - and then that's the way it is immediately.<br /><br />I read this book in just a few days, which is an indicator of how engaging it was. It was well written and not completely predictable. It had some humor and some extremely emotional moments. I don't think it was an amazing book but I couldn't put it down and would recommend it for an entertaining, quick read.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|* MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *<br /><br />Liesel Meminger was not used to having much. She lost her mother brother home and much much more. Maybe you aren't a big fan of sad books i wasn't. But I promise this book will find a wsy to inspire you. Another promise. In the end you WILL cry for Liesel Meminger.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really love this app....very easy to use and lets me know how much like I have left.  its def one of the top 5 apps I use!
B00AHSINKO|4.0|The movie is funny because it does have an element of truth to it. Although the couple in the movie are a bit extreme, they depict how some middle-aged couples react to not having a bustling house full of kids any more, complete with the noise, fights and rushing off to appointments. The silence is deafening and there's only the parents left going through the motions every day. Watch the movie and see what they went through to add life to their existence!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This is a great case.  Protects the kindle and makes it easier to hold.  Haven't used the stand too much, but I would definitely recommend.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|This movies is funny and also shows real life situations that can befall any marriage. Hilarious and the cast has really grown up.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Liked it:) kinda dragged out a bit. But other than this rtf I really loved the characters I. It very much.
B000071ZZI|5.0|What needs to be said? This movie makes the series. Could not find it anywhere in stores that was reasonable. Love this movie
B008LY9AWG|1.0|Very disapointed. After reading all 3, my first thought was I could have written these stories.  They were too simple, too bland and too predictable.  Not Michael Connelly at all.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Deftones have not failed to impress me with any of their albums yet. I can't say that Koi No Yokan is my favorite album of theirs, but it is very very good nonetheless. 5 Stars.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Read all of the &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34;  series. This one was excellent. If you like the &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; series, by Lee Child, Vince Flynn's books will blow you away.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|at first I thought that this was going to be a really boring app but it kept me on the edge of my seat the hole time.
030758836X|2.0|After reading several of the \\"rave\\" reviews of this book and noticing that it was on different best seller's lists for a long time, I decided I needed to read it.  I like mysteries and have read several recently.  I had read and enjoyed, \\"Defending Jacob\\".  I had seen that \\"Gone Girl\\" had been compared to \\"Defending Jacob\\" so that solidified my decision to read it.  Once I got into it, I realized that I didn't like any of the characters and didn't really care what happened to them.  I'm not a prude, but I didn't care for the fact that the \\"f\\" word was used in nearly every sentence.  Amazing since the author's vocabulary included words that I didn't find in my little paperback dictionary, but yet didn't seem to find a word or words that could be used in place of profanity.  Even though I felt that I was wasting my time reading this book when I could have been reading something more entertaining or redeeming, I needed to finish it to find out what happens and how it ends.  The ending was more disappointing that the events throughout the book.  I can't believe it took over 400 pages to get there.  I usually pass on my books to friends or family to read, but this one will be going into the book fair box, or in the trash can.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS GREAT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS IN SOME TIME. ALL SONGS HAVE MEANING. EVERYONE NEEDS THIS ALBUM IN THEIR COLLECTION!!

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Needed an ethernet solution for my Macbook Air.  USB solutions seem to be better than Thunderbolt as they enable more flexibility.  Anker's product is better than Apple's own adapter for several reasons:<br /><br />1) It's USB3.0/Gigabit which beats Apple hands down (USB 2.0/100Mb).<br />2) Indicator LEDs let you know whats going on immediately (Apple's has none)<br />3) It's less expensive than the Apple adapter<br /><br />Build quality and design seem very good.  Installation was pretty easy after managing to get the driver off the mini CD with another laptop.<br /><br />One thing that would have helped would be enclosing instructions for where to download the driver if your laptop doesn't have  a CD ROM drive (like the Macbook Air which I suspect is a major target market segment for these adapters)<br /><br />All in all, a great product, very satisfied.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Works well on a tablet. Thoroughly enjoy playing. Hard to know what else to say - it's fun and easy to play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Simply stated, this is by far an excellent series - wonderful acting and story lines.  The historical nature of the setting is interesting, too.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|GREAT MOVIE !! CAN'T MISS WITH THE ACTORS IN IT. LOVE MOVIES &#34;BASED&#34; ON A TRUE STORY !! THE END !
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I always love the stories about near death experiences and as a Christian, they just make my faith that much stronger.  From a personal standpoint, there was too much technical jargon, but I realize that his target audience was scientists, doctors, etc.  Dr. Alexander is truly a miracle story and I would imagine he is a wonderful husband and father, especially now.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me captivated early on and i didn't see some of the twists coming. The characters were loveable but realistic. I was crying, laughing and shocked reading this. But i loved it!!

B001X0ZKM4|5.0|I love this movie, Micheal Keaton is my Batman and the chemistry between him and Catwoman makes the screen sizzle. Christopher Walken and Danny Devito round out the cast in all their scene chewing glory. If you haven't seen it yet they what are you waiting for rent it now!
B002A9VJ40|5.0|If you like jets, you need to buy this movie. it's not the best quality video/sound but the move is like 30 years old.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Recommended for readership that enjoyed Fifty Shades of Gray.<br />Sylvia Day does a wonderful job of creating the same passion and intense provocation that E.L.

B00408AN5A|5.0|This is a must read product. Great gift for anybody. And I do mean ANYBODY! Simple and straight forward just like the author. There is supplemental material that you can get for FREE even if you've bought the digital copy like I did. (Love my Kindle btw).<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Can't say anything bad about this movie because I liked it. Watched it with my wife thought it was cute.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|now  my mom cant say i cant be responsible and take care of animals caus  now i can take care of a horse
B00000IQV7|5.0|This movie is hilarious to watch. This movie as a person who checked himself into a mental asylum. While he is in there, he discovers that he likes to help people with their problems after helping another mental patient. He then goes to college to become a doctor. While in college, he faces many problems, but he overcomes the challenges and then creates a brand new hospital.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a laugh or any Robin Williams fans.
1400069289|5.0|after the kindle edition, i decided to get the book as well.  it is a very insightful look at how our lives are ruled by habits.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is great, you actually have stuff to do. for me it's better than minecraft, the blocks are a little weird than minecraft but there are no problems on my kindle fire.if you have minecraft, consider getting this game.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I couldn't stop listening. It's really a holiday listen and no one can do it like Whitney. Yes, it's a must buy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fun game for everyone with a love of horses! there is a lot of choices to chose from and always something new! overall Fun!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I liked the first temple run, but this one is awesome! I recommend it for everyone who liked the first game! You won't be disappointed!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoyed the original, and this one is even better!  With upgraded graphics and gameplay, this is sure to be a hit.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book!!! Extremely suspenseful, kept you on the edge, and constantly kept me wanting to read more and more after each chapter!!!
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|Not really much of a story. Nice movie for killing time I guess, but not a real gripping story. Found myself wondering how much time was left a few times throughout the movie.
1572816295|4.0|Paulina Cassidy's Tarot is a beautiful set of glossy dream-like, filigree and faiy-tale images, drawn with great detail and artistry. Pastel colours, with splashes of brighter hues give an ethereal magic feeling to the deck.<br /><br />Some of the cards show variations (or perhaps deviations or reinterpretations) from the traditional Tarot deck, and I would dare to say that there is a female sort of predominance and characters in Paulina's Tarot.<br /><br />The deck comes with a small booklet with basic meanings and several spreads, but the drawings are so inspiriting that sometimes I prefer read them directly.<br /><br />This deck is perfect for intuitive readings. You have a quick question, you want a short answer, or an oracle sort of answer, shuffle and pick up one card. The images, being as detailed and intricate they are, will give you lots of elements to answer your question, and the image as a whole will speak directly to you.<br /><br />I would have liked the cards to be a big bigger so the magnificent drawings can be appreciated in its full splendour.<br /><br />The cards are not so-so regarding shuffling easiness. Not bad, but not good either.<br /><br />I find that this tarot is beautiful and very useful if you are not into proper tarot readings, but into intuitive readings and magic worlds.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander's experience with leaving his body and seeing the Universe in a different way was the most convincing Near Death experiences I've heard.  I applaud this man for his courage to face all the abuse that he will surely encounter.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I thought I'd try this out as a &#34;holiday&#34; specialty item and found it to be fun and really a pretty good app.  Unfortunately, it is not something I would typically use outside the holidays.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|At first I thought this book was slow but as you keep reading you realize that the first is for story and reference but as soon as you pass that the story really picks up and you won't want to put the book down. If you are interested in or love or like comics then this is the greatest book you can read
159420411X|4.0|Everything seems to be fine with the book.  The content for me was not as &#34;revolutionary&#34; as I thought it might be.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Very nice, smooth and exacting re-commissioning for this album. The sound is full; resounding and complete. The instruments are clear and Tony Kay's keyboards are spectacular. He set them on their way. It's very sad he didn't remain. They would have become superstars higher than Zeppelin.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I'm a classics fan.  I remember having seen the movie with Lon Chaney as a kid.  Having read the book brought the movie to life.
B00466HN6S|5.0|My Grand Daughter (6) doesn't sit still for DVD's. This was an Easter gift, only place I could find it was Amazon. She sat thru the whole movie, just loved it. Was a perfect purchase and I do recommend.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I was reading the book when we saw the movie.  The movie did not explain a lot of things. Having read the book, I now understand what the mysterious island was all about and which of the two stories was the real story. The only down side was all the narrative about religions at the beginning of the book. It is an important part of Pi's life and helps explain how and what he thought about life. But there was way too much written about his religious beliefs. I started skipping through the religious stuff so I could get to the meat of what the book with all about. The other thing that confused me was the italic chapters. Having seen the movie while reading the book, I now understand it was the authoring interviewing Pi and had nothing to do with Pi's adventure.
B004EPZ034|5.0|I recommed this movie,the kids loved it. My Grand Daughter borrowed it last year, and won't give it back! She loves it. A great review from a 5 year old. When everyone alse is busy, she watches her favorite movie, she has many.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the book and it kept me engaged throughout.  The only problem is nothing bad ever happened to the main characters. Everything they attempted went off without a hitch. I can't believe such a complicated project would happen without something going wrong.  Especially when you are dealing with a foreign government.
1451695195|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; and have given coipies of the book to family and friends.  It is inspiring and easy to read with provocative thoughts to maintain reader's interest..  Great little book.
B005K15XR4|5.0|This is one of my FAVORITE albums of all time. No exaggeration, I mean that.<br />I love the soundtrack/score genre and this album does not disappoint!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|wish things weren't so expensive but great grafics and addictive. I love careing for many horses and competing for prizes
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I found it to be a little comedic but enjoyed the harmonic sounds of a capella singing to today's music styles.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book was very descriptive and an action packed story of a horse and how he survives WW1, touching the lives of everybody he meets. I recommend this book for all ages, though there are a few choice words.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This set might have a lot of pieces, but its small.  I am a grown up nerd, I like minecraft, I like legos, so this is perfect on my desk.  My kids keep taking stealing it though.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I have always loved the movie, however I have not opened it up yet. I am waiting for my daughter to get here next week.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is one of the best out there. I needed a calculator and didn't have one on me so I decided to download this app on a whim and up until now it hasn't failed me. Sometimes the simplest things work the best and this app seems to uphold that notion.  Love this app so if you're in need of a calculator for sure download this one.
B004RZGUBM|4.0|Having all Dickens's works available, some to read for the first time, others to re-read is indeed a luxury especially for such a tiny outlay. Having just finished &#34;Edwin Drood&#34; with its interesting ending I have been reminded of the scope of the author's imagination and the dedication of others to his work. Perhaps it is mean of me to mention that most of the illustrations were placed laterally on the pages which requires turning the Kindle to view them.  A small inconvenience.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it really enjoy it. like the different obstacles and the new scenes. my son got to a mine cart and really thought that was cool
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for kids of all ages. It makes you feel like you are really taking care of a loving horse! I love spreading time playing this game.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy as usual, one of his cliff hangers. Kept me up way too many nights reading just that next page.

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|one of the most inspiring movies i've ever seen. It really pulls out all kinds of emotions... a tear jerker ;) loved how it shows that braking barriers can be done in ways one probably never thought possible. A priceless and powerful reconciliation between a family who one thought would never happen.
B007PFD90G|1.0|I struggled with this ~700 page tome for weeks so I could discuss it at book club.  On about page 100 I gave up.  The use of third person when Rushdie is talking about himself seem very prententious and distracting.  Do we really need to know the history of buildings he lived in?  Of every person he mentions?  Every instition he passed through?  I know what this book is supposed to be about.  Other than a few pages at the beginning, it has been a meander down every side bar and remote connection.  A few of these digressions would be fine.  There seems to be more digression than subject here.  If he does pull it together eventually, I won't remember the details of these early chapters by the time he gets there.  Reading this at night definitely prevents me from staying up too late reading...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book so much! It made me cry, laugh and look at dogs with another perspective. It is a beautiful story about a dog and his experiences during life, he learned so much about humans and the gestures was all he had. Enzo is a very special dog, he is smart he is like a human inside a dog's body, he is looking forward his end to become a human in another life. I enjoyed while reading this book, I totally recommend it!
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|I love David Cronenberg movies but this was a failure. Its a guy in a limo on his way to get a haircut and just has crappy conversations with with people on the way. I couldn't even make it past 30 minutes i'm really glad I only rented it.

B004M8S3Y6|4.0|I've lost quite a substantual amount of weight following some of the extracts from this book. It is an easy book to follow instructions from and is very informative.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run is a fun awesome game! It's better than the first temple run. I love the silliness and mine carts!
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It wasn't as good as the first book. I was surprised by the way the characters changed.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was a lot more excited for this book then what it carried out to be. It only started getting good towards the end and I had trouble getting through  beginning. However Christians character is easily brought to life and beautifully displayed so I am currently treading  2 and already like that one so much more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome I would reccomend it for a time passing game.The first time I played this game I thought that it was going to by a rip off but it wasn't .
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think that the game is a good idea. Whoever is the maker of this game is really smart I love this game
B008M721MS|5.0|I would recommend  setting up skype account on your PC first then just login and use on tablet.  Entire concept of using on<br />tablets needs improved.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I am enjoying this little game,  it's an easy game to learn and not very time consuming. I recommend this game to all who enjoy building!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I honestly loved this book until the last 10 pages! I love the twits and turns and the character development. The ending ruined the whole thing. There was SO much potential! I knew some friends liked the ending and some didn't, so I was very anxious to see which category I'd fall into, definitely the latter!  I like unusual endings, but there is a big difference between \\"unusual\\" and just plain \\"BAD.\\" It was great till the end, so I would say read it and decide for yourself how the ending is.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Bought a book on amazon and can't read.it in cloud nor send it to kindle app. This app is on my android Samsung phone
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|To take a classic 80-90's movie and ruin it like this is a shame unless you want to watch a guy run for two hours...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|lots of different activities to do.easy to play and has great graphics. the horses look real. easy to get rewards.
B007FXLZ9K|2.0|Sigh. Why do so many \\"art house\\" movies take such an interesting premise and make it so grindingly sterile, one dimensional, and ridiculous? The idea of this movie was obvious immediately, and then we have another hour or so watching a sad, DAMAGED in 30-point font man and a manic pixie dreamgirl (look up the phrase) gone stereotypically wrong. I knew when I saw the scene where Sissy, as tremulous and fragile as a moth wing, sang \\"New York, New York\\" that critics would fall all over themselves in praise, but I could only roll my eyes at the silliness of it--the CLICHE of it and think \\"of course she sang THAT song. And of COURSE that way.\\". This movie reminded me not of American Psycho, as some have said--mainly because Christian Bale kept a small wink of joy in the role--but more like \\"In The Company of Men\\", where miserable people just were relentlessly miserable, letting nothing breathe. I mean, come ON. Even traumatized (oooo possibly incestuous--another cliche alert!!) siblings can let a little air into their dialog. I found more life and realism in the subway flirtation scene than I did the whole movie; it underscored little victories we get from reading signs that someone is physically interested and seemed (to me) why sex addiction is a real addiction and not just something to numb pain. That scene was the difference between an alcholic being shown having \\"just a little more\\" versus a ham-fisted performance of the actor looking tormented, up-ending a whole bottle of scotch. Too bad the whole movie couldn't have been that nuanced.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a good game and I love it you can jump slide silliness minecarting and its fun and you guys should get it its super fun
B002BI6SMI|4.0|The movie has a reasonable story, full of action and fun.  It is entertaining and well worth one's time and attention.  Is it Schindler's List? No, but Liam Neeson elevates it above what it would have been in any other actor's hands.  Not flawless by any means, but as I said, entertaining and action packed.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone, including my 11 year old granddaughter who loves to read and loves life. It was very inspiring and funny. I don't know where she comes up with it but, as her talk show does, it makes me smile and want to be the best person I can be.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|I love this movie.  Great acting With great views.  Hopkins rocks his role as well as Big Bart. &#34;TheBear&#34;!<br />Amazon delivered like always you are my favorite Internet shopping site, bar none!

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a book about the hardships of two Afghanistan women's lives, Mariam and Laila, through their countries troubled years. Mariam was a harami, a child born before marriage, and was scarred with this her entire life. Her father, Jalil, forced her into an arranged marriage with Rasheed after Nana, Mariam's mother, killed herself. All these unfortunate events made Mariam feel she was destined for an afflicted life. Moreover, her misery increased when she and Rasheed found out she couldn't have children because he began to beat her. Laila had a better childhood than Mariam because her father loved her, she had friends, and her love, Tariq, was her best friend. However, Laila's mother didn't consume Laila with love as she did with her two older brothers. When Laila was about to leave Kabul to marry Tariq, their house was bombed and it killed her parents. After Rasheed found Laila in the rubble, he took her in and Mariam nursed her, but Rasheed didn't want her to leave. To ensure she would stay, he sent a fake messenger to Laila saying Tariq had died. This forced Laila into marrying Rasheed because she was holding Tariq's child and needed Rasheed to believe it was his for her to be able to raise the baby. Mariam and Laila were both conflicted because they were beaten and forced to give up all their freedoms.<br /> I loved everything about this book. I loved how realistic it was; moreover, how they didn't have a fairytale ending for everyone's story. For example, when Laila's house was bombed, Laila wasn't left magically unscarred; it left her permanently deafened in one ear. Also, how Mariam didn't try to escape because she knew they would capture her and try her for her crime. I would definitely recommend this book to others because it showed that life isn't a fairytale like how it's portrayed in the movies. Laila wasn't at full peace with life until she went through terrible hardships because life is rough, and I'm glad that Hosseini didn't allow you to believe life is easy, especially during war.
0439023491|4.0|The second book in `The Hunger Games' trilogy, as most sequels do, raises the stakes and ratchets up the tension. In this instance, it means transcending the semi-possible or probable future dystopian world of the first novel and venturing into uncharted fantastical territory. Even though there are a couple of scientific types who pose theories and jerry-rig devices that manipulate natural forces, there is nothing scientific or remotely possible about the surreal environment that provides a new arena for a new hunger game.<br /><br />Katniss realizes that her desperate measures at saving both herself and Peeta inadvertently triggered discord and unrest from the scattered populace as well as the ire of the president himself who issues barely veiled threats unless Katniss toes the public line and maintains a fiction designed to pacify a gullible audience. Gradually, it dawns on her that this rebellion has grown beyond mere lip service and also that there might be remnants of a District 13, generally believed to have been exterminated.<br /><br />The ground shifts beneath her feet; nothing can be predicted and the ruthlessness of the administration cannot be underestimated. Therefore, Katniss and Peeta find themselves as tributes in another hunger game in which 24 previous winners have to compete yet again to demonstrate to the population that even the strongest are not exempt from the mighty power of the Capitol.<br /><br />This time around questions occurred to me. For one, why is Katniss's best friend Gale, accepted as her `cousin' in a widely believed fiction, as well as his younger siblings not subject to being selected as a tribute? And why did it never occur to him to offer himself as a substitute as Katniss did originally in order to save her little sister Prim? Another question occurred when the new game involved drafting previous winners back into the arena. These previous winners include Katniss and Peeta's mentor Haymitch Abernathy. Initially, as one of three winners from District 12 he will also compete in the arena. Suddenly he is serving the purpose of mentoring again and, after a few scenes in which he attempts some half-hearted training, nothing is ever said about him competing. Did I miss something?<br /><br />The attrition of tributes is accelerated from the last time and the arena is now a surrealistic jungle. This arena is basically an island shaped like a clock or Trivial Pursuit piece with new, unimaginable horrors emerging `on the hour'--a fog that blisters and eats away at skin and organs, a torrential downpour of blood, vicious mutated monkeys--all within an invisible force field-enclosed dome. The `clock' actually becomes a spinning roulette wheel in which the gambling not only involves the next casualty but the victims' own perception of reality. When laws of physics can be so easily disregarded how can anyone be certain where anything is or even if they can determine what is real?<br /><br />Despite nagging plot holes, the zeal of the storytelling propels a reader to keep turning the page, a skill which Suzanne Collins, whatever other weaknesses she may have as a novelist, possesses and uses in abundance. This next installment fulfills the expectation of many dystopian story arcs, unless they fall in the fatalistic 1984 lineage, which means that suppression and totalitarianism must be followed by rebellion or escape. Although in this sense Catching Fire is a predictable second act, Collins throws in enough surprises and fantastical devices to render this story fresh and relatively free from clich&eacute;. She has done almost everything right with this series. For one thing, it is a finite story, a trilogy, not an endless multi-volume saga that will eventually resolve itself after losing even many of its most enthusiastic followers. For another, she has guaranteed that this reader, like millions of others, will continue to read it through to its conclusion.ee winners from District 12 he will also compete in the arena.

B0017O1MIM|5.0|David Lean never made a bad movie in his life. The director's casting was superb. It's a spectacular firm that may just be the best film ever made. It's nothing short of extraordinary, and it surely belongs in every collection!
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Episode 1: non- hi def.  froze between 20-25 times during play. Watched next three episodes in in hi def with no problems.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Good for an evening of mindless distraction. If you are into intelligent dialogue or clever story, find something else. It is sad that older actors are willing to accept such roles.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Cannot stop listening to this CD - my daughter and I loved the movie and this CD makes us happy. The songs are great and really like the combination of voices and tones. Buy it and keep it in the car - wil make you smile!
B000ICXQOM|3.0|Kinda stupid movie, but needed to watch it to get the references my friends make from the movie. Mostly one liners.
B0071T5PN0|1.0|I am a diehard VH fan and I don't take sides when it comes down to Van Hagar or Van Roth but I can tell you this album got played about two times and it went off the playlist in favor of Diver Down and 5150.  Roth has lost his ability to sing and it is obvious.  The lyrics are laughable and cheesy (more than usual for VH).  Eddie does sound good though!
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Just a advertising ploy.my router is hard to get to see my routers password so I tried an easy way didn't work. But the adds came in fast

B004HW7JMO|3.0|Good scripsts, good visual effects although they were reaching on more than one occaision with the scripts and what was being shown.  Very sexy, great eye candy.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|There was an extra story about a couple who find an alien weapon in the aftermath of the battle, but this dick is missing it. Makes me wonder what else i am missing!
B0037YOMWS|5.0|Excellent price for a RPN calculator. It replaced an earlier version that I had dropped and meets ALL my needs. I would highly recommend his calculator. Quick shipping!

B00448SE4S|1.0|Made it through 45 minutes of the movie. Did not like it whatsoever. Not my type of film. Thought it was pretty ridicuolous.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Despite its enormity, I devoured this book in four days.  Also, despite its length, there isn't a wasted word in the book.  King gets the reader into the &#34;meat&#34; of the story relatively quickly, too.  Fascinating stuff.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book has been my favorite since the first time I read it.  I try to read it once a year and dream of someday having my own Mr Darcy!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story had good twists, and the ending was a good surprise.  Could not tell whether the hero was a good guy or a bad guy.
B0013GH99K|5.0|it's 2013 and I'm still listening to it. I was 14 when this CD came out. Never gets old or annoying. Avril is the best.
B008YI91HS|4.0|We dimmed the lights, cranked up the volume, and watched this as a family on our 63 inch Samsung with surround sound. Fortunately a bathroom was nearby since after some scares I felt as if we had to do a pants-check.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I thought this book was funny and shows how kind Ellen is. The downside was that it was just a bunch f unrelated chapters thrown together. I thought it would be more cohesive
B00AYE8C70|1.0|Was in the Dominican sand could not get it to make a call although 2others that we were with worked fine
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Some of his books are on TV and have really enjoyed them and this one is just as good as all the rest.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is kind and sweet and sad. It's the best book I've ever read. You have to read this book
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game was alot offun.  However it was not worth theprice.  I finished the game in an afternoon.  It was not especially difficult.  The graphics were great.  I gave it a four due to the price and ease.  It would have been a five otherwise.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|If you ever wanted to watch a prime time soap opera about<br />public domain fairy-tale characters then well this is the show<br />for you.<br />It was created by some &#34;Lost&#34; writers and though it has Hugo<br />playing a giant and has some purple smoke and flashbacks<br />it's no Lost.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this show. Love it. Having it on DVD is even better. I would highly recommend the DVD set to all Downton Abbey fans! Even better when Amazon makes it the &#34;Deal of the Day&#34; (I bought 3 as gifts!)
B0063IH60K|2.0|I know you have this for the ads.  I found them annoying.  There is another Solitaire game by Branium for .49 which is much better.
B005HSL626|5.0|Everyone in my family loves this GAME!! from 2 to 37 we all play it!! Great family fun, entertaining for all
0345803485|4.0|I have read so many bad reviews because of the repetitiveness, \\"britishisms\\", and bad sex. I can agree with it being slightly repetitive, however, people are not leaving the good part about this story. I am almost done with the last book, and as you read on, there is a beautiful, deep and dark story about Christian. The underlying story about human development and what makes people the way they are is fascinating, and in this story sad but beautiful. The fact that this story shows how these two people have grown and continue to grow and change I find to be truly awe inspiring. I love the books! (P.S., totally not written by a man, just using my hubby's account!)
B00792EGES|5.0|I am a very big Alter Bridge fan, and this concert is the ultimate display of the band's talent and music. A must for any AB fan. The HD visual and audio quality is brilliant and best experienced in full surround sound.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Somebody told me that this is for &#34;older&#34; people. If it is, I still think it's fun when used appropriately. The best part is that you can make it anything you want it to be; from adversements to a family network to share sentiments. People you like can/will join, too. Watch out for those who don't; fhor those folks, there are security options!
B0098VXMNE|4.0|Of course it isnt the same as the first season but you cant expect it to be unfortunately because of events out of anyones control. But the guy cast for spatacus is good none the less.. but what about Naevia? To me she doesnt look similar at all save for her skin color. Other than that still a good show.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|If you are sickened by the average media reports of how ugly the human race has become, try the flip side. This is the best of humanity working together to make the world a better place. Join in and feel the awesomeness !
0425263916|4.0|If you Like 'Fifty Shades Of Gray'... You will find this book even better!  My friends and I enjoyed it immensely!
B005COO1X6|4.0|You won't be disappointed. This novella reads like some of his older short stories. It sparks your curiosity and places you, once again, in the minds of the innocent and trustworthy,
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Another great album from Bruno Mars. I am glad that I purchased this product. If you are fan you will like this alot.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Me, I have some difficulty, but it's because I've come to these types of games for the first time at 55. But that's what I also love about it; there's a learning curve. And the sound effects crack me up!

B006LS7DQE|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much.  Like puzzle fighter but with a story.  Loot to collect, weapons to buy sell upgrade, stats to level up.  The best of two genres melded into a sweet package.
1401322786|4.0|Dor is the first time keeper, but he doesn't know it yet. He is a simple caveman who is obsessed with time.

He becomes Father Time.<br /><br />Dor is freed from the cave along with an hourglass which can slow down time. Dor must master a task he's been given but he doesn't know how that will happen .<br /><br />Soon the author introduces us to Sarah and Victor both out of time and wanting more.

B004DM0UII|3.0|I got this app when it was free so I figured why not. I found it a little tough to navigate at first but I like this app. It reminds me of satellite radio but with a lot less ads. One or two every now and then. Less ads then Pandora! I like that you have a lot more control over what you listen too then with Pandora. There are a lot of stations for specific artists like KAOS radio for all things Floyd. I'm a little worried about all this mailicous intent I see in other reviews but I don't intend to uninstall for that. Might hesitate at the $4 but considering what you get that's not too bad a price
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|I had this movie on DVD but my friend borrowed it and I never got it back so once I saw it on Blu-Ray for 9 bucks I couldn't pass it up.. I love this movie and it looks very good on Blu-Ray the price was great too,

B001ANSS5K|3.0|This work had many of the same themes that John Green readers have come to expect, but its execution is less developed and less memorable than some of his other books. Especially, &#34;The Fault in our Stars&#34; and &#34;An Abundance of Katherines&#34; shine bright in comparison to this - a still good, but lesser - work of John Green. Fans of his will still enjoy it, but if you are just getting into him, start elsewhere.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|I finally caught up with \\"Australia\\" on DVD, after deliberately not making much of an effort to see it in theaters a few years back.<br /><br />It's not all that bad, actually, especially when you watch it at home and can take breaks (to get another glass of wine) several times during the 2 hour and 45 minute (!) running time.  Baz Luhrmann's manic directing style, which worked pretty well for \\"Moulin Rouge!\\", is pretty distracting during the first half hour, but he eventually settles down and applies his crazy cuts and camera work more sparingly so we can get into the story.<br /><br />Anyway, it's all big sweeping stuff about cattle and romance and endless vistas and (finally) World War II, and there are actually three or four moments when your emotions will swell when it all comes together.  And the rest of the movie is tolerably watchable, if you take those breaks I mentioned.<br /><br />It's funny, though.  There's some solemn verbiage at the beginning of the movie about the issue of Aboriginal relocation (sort of Australia's version of how we treated our American Indian population, I think) and a little more verbiage about it at the end, as if the movie wants to convince us that it's really about this dark issue from Australia's past.  It's funny because the very long movie that appears between those two moments of onscreen verbiage is 95% concerned with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman and whether they'll get together, with maybe six minutes (tops!) of the running time devoted to the Aboriginal relocation issue.  I had to laugh.<br /><br />I will say that the standard DVD I watched had spectacular picture and sound, so this sucker must look and sound really great on Blu-Ray.  Hey, good presentation always helps with those types of long movies (like this one) that never quite make you forget you're watching a long movie.<br /><br />In the end, let's just call \\"Australia\\" a tolerable, pretty good movie, no more and no less.  Of course, that assessment might be a tad generous, because if someone told me I was never permitted to see this movie ever again, I have to honestly say that I wouldn't lose any sleep.tad generous, because if someone told me I was never permitted to see this movie ever again, I have to honestly say that I wouldn't lose any sleep.
B006ZE66P8|4.0|Won day a family  sang a Carol<br />I liked this book<br />I dedicate this book to my family and me
0446580848|1.0|I bought \\"The Panther\\" at Costco a few months ago and it's sat on my table til this morning, when I decided to devote my Sunday to begin reading it. I'd enjoyed most of his other books, and while the John Corey figure was getting a little \\"boring\\", I figured, well, it's Sunday...I'll start to read this book. (I finished the same night by flipping through the last third of the book).<br /><br />Okay, this book is not good and it's not worth buying and reading. And I want to know \\"why\\"? Nelson DeMille has written a book of 640 pages. The book could have been, say, 600 pages if they deleted Corey's increasingly unfunny side remarks. They could have knocked another hundred or so pages by deleting the Yemen travelog. A bunch more pages - gone by the wayside - if they'd deleted the caravan trip from Saana to Aden. And on and on. The publisher could have had a tighter written book at 300 pages that they could have charged Demille fans the same price as his previous books.<br /><br />Again, why? Why would Nelson DeMille spend months and months writing a book so bloated with fat and gas when he could have spared the effort and come up with something readable? And why didn't the publishers edit this book, deleting the bloat? No one - author, publishers, or readers - \\"won\\" on this book's publication. All I know is that my review is the 100th one star review, so that's at least 100 readers DeMille has lost.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the bloat and part of the problem are the two lead characters, John Corey and Kate Mayfield Corey. There's no suspense when these characters are in the book because DeMille has always taken the \\"safe\\" way out of his stories. One of the books - one of the \\"Lion\\" books - lost any credibility when the Kate Mayfield character wasn't killed by the Lion. Like, the Lion had killed literally airplanes full of people and he couldn't manage to kill Kate-in-a-parachute?  Kate's death would have made the book far more believable, but DeMille \\"chickened out\\".<br /><br />My advise - not asked for and probably not wanted - to Nelson DeMille, is to find another character to build a series around. The smart-mouth John Corey and the other guy, also a smart-aleck called John, in some of his earlier books, are wearing thin. You're a good writer, Nelson, but it's time to grow out of your FBI/CIA/NYPD rivalry and give your fans something new. A book not bloated with fat and gas. I think you can do it.out\\".<br /><br />My advise - not asked for and probably not wanted - to Nelson DeMille, is to find another character to build a series around.

B0018RC7QE|5.0|To put it in a nutshell, it is Moonstruck and Out of Africa put together. I can't get enough of this movie. Even though it is classically set in the 1980s -- especially with their outfits -- the notion of finding \\"true love\\" or \\"true happiness\\" is captivated in this film, despite it's taboo topic of affairs (and affairs with children involved). The movie also conveys their guilt and second thoughts -- and their rationale for why they keep seeing each other over and over in the city. Fantastic movie for any romantic movie aficionado.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|So, why did I get these books? Because I'm cheap and I'll read almost anything. So imagine my surprise when I wasn't just reading, but actually enjoying! This doesn't happen all the time as you e-book readers out there know. A cheap book can be nothing but cheap, but wool is a good read with a excellent handle on what true post apocalypse life would mostly be like. A decade after a nuke war and above ground life would not be livable, nor at a century for that matter! Hugh Howey shows us a world where the life of a country is bottled up, and stored away, and all that happens inside the bottle. Good read at a good price. Thank you Hugh Howdy, now where's my next installment of Wool already!!!

0446581356|4.0|Note: Since I am a bit late to the game on this book (it came out a few years ago), I am tempering my review by other reviews here...<br /><br />I think BB sets out to accomplish her mission with this book, including general makeup application. There are critics about her skin care take, but BB knows that good skin care, especially hydration keeps you and your makeup looking best. Ms. Brown has a signature style, and broke trends in her career, so I greatly respect that. This must be kept in mind. I personally have several MUA's (makeup artist) books in my library, with more soon to be added. This way I can develop my own style, 'cherry picking' through the offerings. Realistically most will not desire or have the time to devote so much to this topic, but you will be left less rounded if you only read from one or even two MUAs. (Respectfully, IMHO.)<br /><br />Ms. Brown wrote this book to be for budding MUAs. So keep that in mind. If something about the MUA industry does not appeal to you, skip over it. BB systematically covers makeup from skin care to finishing with powder, etc. What I especailly found wanting was her eye makeup application. To me, this topic is what most people (all ages) need help with. Her eye lining section is abysmal. (Sorry, Bobbi...) The photos show little discernable detail, atleast what you can make out of the heavy black liner on an eye that does not provide enough lid space to showcase what she attempts to teach. (Basically, wrong lighting, wrong eye shape/model, not a generally used eye lining look for most, and extremely dark liner.) (Again, respectfully--IMHO.)<br /><br />In general, this is a great addition to a MUA's library, there is information to be gleaned. Just don't expect any MUA author's book to contain all you need to know, as we all have vastly different takes on what works for us. The more MUA's books, the more I find they have their very own takes on makeup artistry, and this book is BB's.<br /><br />Bottom line: great book, as long as you balance it out by informing yourself with other MUAs. Glean what works for you.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Gangster Squad was excessively entertaining. The best gangster movie in years. It's simplistic, retro and full tilt. Sean Penn is ruthlessly exciting. It's a plot we've all heard before, it's a movie we've all basically seen before but so much better. It's over the top in style and action. Josh Brolin is a role model and top notch in his performance. . The only downside is some way too cheesy lines, a couple fight scenes are zoomed in too closely and Ryan Gosling's voice work sounded like a prepubescent teenager besides those three things it's a nearly perfect film reminiscent of Dick Tracy-esque villains. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.
B004XWLN20|1.0|The box set was not in the best condition.  The booklet with the season breakdown fell apart soon as I opened it the first time.  The disc slots scratches each disc every time you remove or put the discs back.  A lot of the discs had dried-on glue globs on them which totally compromised disc 57 and it would not play.  Horrible design for storing discs.  Overall just a shoddy product.  Only reason it got 1 star is because I loved the series.<br /><br />PS:  The DVD quality is washed out compared to even the web versions you can see on Hulu etc are richer in color and 720 hd.  This is NOT hd DVD for the most part.  The latter seasons look better bust still not as good as hd.

0316224588|5.0|I've been reading Ian Rankin's John Rebus novels for close to a decade and have always had a love-hate relationship with this Edinburgh detective. I'm not alone. Rebus's cynical, impulsive, abrasive, self-destructive ways can play like fingernails on a chalkboard, making it hard for all but a few of the other characters to tolerate, much less \\"like\\" John - (poor DS Siobhan Clarke, how does she put up with him?). But despite Rebus' expertly drawn flaws, the curmudgeon gets his hooks in you. And it becomes obvious, anyone who tries as hard as Rebus to prove he doesn't care about anyone or anything has to be hiding something ... like how much he cares.<br /><br />When Rankin retired Rebus in [[ASIN:0316099279 Exit Music (Inspector Rebus Mysteries)]] - the 17th Rebus novel - and introduced a new Edinburgh character (Malcolm Fox) in (and of) [[ASIN:B008GMQ3KA The complaints / Ian Rankin]] (think Internal Affairs in U.S. police terms) - it felt like a huge loss to me. Rebus hadn't run his course - and of course, Big Ger Cafferty, king of the Edinburgh underworld, was out of jail and needed someone to keep a careful - and obsessive - eye on him. There are lead characters that grow more and more weary with each passing novel - but Rebus was worn out and washed up when we first met him. If the chain smoking hadn't killed him yet, why put him out to pasture? Maybe Rankin planned for retirement to do to Rebus what Cafferty considered doing countless times but never did. (Grudging respect? A sense of kinship?)<br /><br />I also knew I'd miss the old school rock and roll or blues music suggestions. It's always been a bonus to read through what's on Rebus' playlist in each novel, though he still favors his LPs with the comfortable hiss and pops between tracks over CDs or digital music (horrors!) for his late night melancholy as he looks out the window of his flat, a quickly disappearing bottle of Lagavulin at his side.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008ASGP3U Standing in Another Man's Grave (Detective Inspector Rebus)]]was a fabulous vehicle to bring Rebus back where he belongs, in the middle of a bloody crime scene. Interesting, I thought Rankin drew a bit much from a theme and process found in my least favorite Rebus novel, Flesh Market Alley [[ASIN:0316095656 Fleshmarket Alley]]-  (Rebus took a clear political stance, which I thought was a out of character - he normally couldn't be bothered with what the bloody politicians were up to unless it was murder). But having him work as a civilian investigator on cold case files - including a missing person case that may have multiple and current connections - was a great return.<br /><br />I would note that Rankin has done as good or better of a job keeping Rebus true to form as any series novelist. That's why reviewing an individual book doesn't seem as important to me here as asking if Rebus is really back.<br /><br />He's still loathed and feared by colleagues and criminals alike. He still won't give you the time of day unless you have something he needs. He's still the character I hate to love or love to hate most in my commercial crime reading. But even if he has one foot in the grave - or both in another man's grave - he's back, and that's what matters.(Detective Inspector Rebus)]]was a fabulous vehicle to bring Rebus back where he belongs, in the middle of a bloody crime scene.

B0040UEI86|5.0|In anticipation of the new Tannhauser recording coming out in January 2013, I decided to add to my collection. I will echo the best comments made by other reviewers about the Sinopoli recording. Domingo's performance of the title role provides the most satisfying traversal on record simply because his voice is both beautiful and powerful as it runs the role's range of introspection, renunciation, torture, and regression. However, I am not a German speaker and I have been told and I have read that Domingo's command of the language is distracting.  Yet many make allowances given the beauty, power, and commitment in the voice, especially at that point in his long career. Cheryl Studer's purity of tone and range capture Elizabeth perfectly and Agnes Baltsa brings the requisite dynamics and seductivness to her passages with Tannhauser. Therefore to a non-native German, this digital recording is probably the best-sounding all around. As much as I like Windgassen, he simply does not sound his best in the Sawallisch recording--which is too bad. Of course, he never was a Heldentenor but for the most part Windgassen always sang within his limits, bringing intelligence, musicality,and beauty to passages other Wagner singers gloss over or bark through. In his prime, he really did have the ability to remind us that Wagner wanted his music sung beautifully. Just listen to his Act 3 of Tristan under Bohm (and it's a live recording). The same cannot be said for Rene Kollo in the Solti(or in any Wagner role I've heard him in), although that recording rivals the Sinopoli with the added advantage of having a German speaker in the title role. Initially, Rene Kollo was one of my favorites, but as I have listened to more Wagner tenors, my appreciation of his rather thin voice has diminished quite a bit. He too never was a Heldentenor, but he often employed a kind of frenetic abandon or feverish intensity that could work at times.  Fortunately, that Solti recording captures him early enough in his career so that many of the role's huge challenges are still within his capability--something that would not be true within the next 10 years. Now for the Haitink. First of all, this recording is the Dresden version, not the Paris which was getting more play on stage and on record for a while. For some crazy reason--coupled with the paucity of reviews--I was skeptical. However, I gave in precisely because of the conductor and the appearance of Waltraud Meier and Lucia Popp in major roles. I also mistakenly thought Siegfried Jerusalem was singing the title role (it's actually sung by the often-maligned Klaus Konig). Since downloading it two nights ago, I have listened to it all the way through once and to large passages repeatedly. It's simply outstanding. All the principles are in their prime. Meier and Konig make sparks fly in all their duets leading up to Tannhauser's expulsion from Venusberg. All of the score's intense demands are served perfectly here. Nevertheless, it is Meier who  makes the biggest impression through her signature verbal detail, dynamics, and declamation. Listening to her here reminded me why she dominated Wagner performances and recordings for so long in the 90s and beyond. However, the opera is not called Venus and I don't want to give the impression that Konig falls short. In fact, the breadth and core of his voice are up to all of the score's extreme challenges--and he's a native speaker. Listen to his Hymn \\"Dir Tone Lob\\" and all the ensuing passages with Venus or his Rome Narration \\"Als ich erwacht.\\" He's just as engaging as the best Tannhauser's on record and his voice matches his commands, something a lot Wagner singers end up unable to do. His voice may not be as appealing as Domingo's but it's still really good and as appealing as that of the other Tannhausers on record. After all, I initially thought I was hearing a young(ish) Siegfried Jerusalem. Then of course there is Lucia Popp, incapable of ever singing badly. As usualher voice's intense pearliness is on display. While Wagner is not the composer for this lighter voice known to illuminate Mozart and Strauss, in this studio recording her Act 3 prayer \\"Allmacht'ge Jungfrau\\" presents the otherwordly, ethereal effect often attributed to this amazing singer. Weikl is excellent as  Wolfram; and Moll and Jerusalem also contribute handsomely to this alternate version of opera. The Paris version continues getting the distinction of sounding like Tristan after Wagner's multiple revisions of the 1845 original. Indeed, it's hard NOT to hear Tristan in it given the numerous Tristan allusions/impositions but Haitink's recording makes a srong case for the older version of this marvelous score. With the kind of conducting, chorus, and principals he marshaled here, the Paris version is simply a different work--one I really enjoy too--but the Dresden version as represented by this recording is its equal.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Both of my kids love this game. Great game for kids to have some fun with! I also very much enjoy playing this when I get a few minutes of down time. :)
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was disappointed in this book!  Most of the main characters have been killed off or wounded so badly that they probably not going to survive.  It seemed like he had to maintain a schedule and lost sight of the previous four books.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|If you enjoy using your drawing skills then this ap is pretty great! Other than people actually writing their words in the draw space, I have enjoyed drawing and guessing words!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fabulous book (and movie)!  It was a real page turner!  After this book I was hooked!  I could hardly wait for the next one!
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|I am only giving it a two star for I do not seem to able to make him fly?!  I am sure it is me not the game : )
B0063IH60K|3.0|I feel that this game (like it is with a deck of cards) is entirely dependent upon the cards that turn up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever I like it more then temple run way more realistic you should get it best game ever!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  At the time, I could hardly wait for the next book to come out, but it did not meet my expectations.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Is a fun game but distractions whenn you have her homework why is there a minimum for a r,review that's stupid
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|It's a great series!  I'm not sure why it's discontinued.  I'm wondering now if the second season will be offered.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|If you need sounds to help you fall asleep or relax then this is the app for you. Best out there.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's a lot of fun!  I have no idea how one can master any more than two suits!  I certainly don't have that ability.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Loved the original. 2 beats it by far however... The game has issues loading. On my kindle fire the first screen pops up then closes itself out. I cant even get to the menu screen anymore. As far as gameplay its awesome. Just need to fix a few things.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Since most of the main characters have been killed off or wounded so badly that they probably won't survive long.  It almost seems that the author is on a schedule and lacks the skill he showed in the prior books.
1452110581|5.0|This book contains a lot of clever, funny poems that exactly capture the nature of cats.  I am buying one of these for all my cat-loving friends.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Loved the wizards first rule, now im loving the second book so far, and planning reading the rest of the collection
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It is a weepy book but for good reasons.  Funny and heartwarming also.  And, it gives a good lessson on the end of life.
0553378384|5.0|This one was one of Spiller's best so far that I have read.  I do like her moon book but this one made me think
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun....you can play it any where for a little or a long time....very addictive...as a matter of fact...just reviewing the product makes me want to play...lol
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addictive and you always die, just like the original.  The graphics,  well, you know that feeling you get when you are standing at the edge of a cliff.  I got that same feeling in my knees the first couple of times while using the zip line.  The graphics ARE that good and that is on a Kindle Fire.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Having grown up with Led Zeppelin, but never able to see them live, this recording was the next best thing.  The audio CD is wonderful and is now my my most popular playlist on my iPOD.  When I ordered the DVD my old player died.  I recently upgraded to BlueRay and reordered the BlueRay disc.  Both versions are fantastic, with great camera angles, and terrific sound. You won't be disappointed.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|this app helps me with the fractions I struggle with in math at school and helps me with my homework!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0035G0U2O|3.0|I have seen so many disaster movies that even if the special effects are magnificent or outstanding, there is still nothing new under the sun. If you absolutely this kind of movie...go for it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|When I open it, it shows me everything I need to see.  So far, it has worked perfectly and is very accurate.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I saw all the high reviews, so I was intrigued to check it out.  I'm a big fan of multi-volume series of novels, because I go through books too fast to keep finding new ones, wait for new ones from authors I like, and find new authors so often.  My standards aren't high:  just good grammar/spelling, memorable engaging characters, and a lively plot.  The further from my experience, the better.  I love escapist fiction.<br /><br />So Wool.  The first part is a short-story with a Twilight Zone-type ending.  Short and not very satisfying to me.  The second part is also fairly short, and at this point, I was starting to get tired of the rip off of so many previous sci-fi stories -- folks stuck in a fall-out shelter afraid to leave.  The usual conceit is that it was all a hoax, or the danger is long passed, and this omnibus has a mild variation on that.<br /><br />By the third part, I finally started to care about the characters.  Honestly, it took a third of the way into the book for me.  Not everybody gives a book that long to catch on, I know, so be warned.  You may get a third of the way into this before you stop finishing reading and shaking your head.  Somewhere in the third part, I finally got engaged enough that I wasn't dragging myself to read it.<br /><br />It seems like the author started with a short story.  Fans said they wanted more, so he wrote a second short story.  They still wanted more, so he started making it into a novel.<br /><br />By the fourth part of five, I was having trouble putting it down, and I really empathized with the characters.<br /><br />So the author is a great world builder.  The technology is not very advanced, but the world is well thought out.<br /><br />Over the course of the five parts, I could see the author's style improving to the point that I would have bought the fourth and fifth parts alone without complaint.  But that the author only discovered the novel as he was writing makes me too wary to read more.  That, and I like more space travel and tech in my sci-fi.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is a great look at courage, hard work, and patriotism.  Interesting insight into the life of a Navy Seal Sniper.
B00A1EOBJQ|1.0|While I am a long-time country music fan and enjoy the television program, I think the songs are greatly over-rated.<br />With the exception of Hayden Panetiere, I would strongly recommend that the rest of the \\"singers,\\" particularly Connie Britton and Clare Bowen, stick to acting.  Their voices aren't that good.<br />The other problem is that the songs selected for the show leave a lot to be desired.  With all of the songwriters out there, surely the tv program staff could have found better choices with more interesting lyrics.  You would never find any of these lackluster songs on a real country singer's CD.
B009X01ELC|5.0|My wife had the Marware Revole Portrait + and I decided to give it a try!  Great item, it's simple to use and looks great.  The revolving option makes charging and standing for viewing effortless and practical.  Perhaps pricey but an outstanding value considering the features.<br /><br />I highly recommemd it!
B00957T6X6|5.0|Game of Thrones is wonderful in any venue, but large books are far more manageable for me on my Kindle Fire...don't lose my book or my place in it. :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am a new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 owner and have never utilized APPS before.  TWC was an experiment that has proven to be helpful on rapid updates on weather.  It's amazing how weather affects your daily routine, hate to admit it, but when one suffers mobility issues weather plays a huge role in determining what you can or cannot do.  TWC, on my Kindle Fire HD is something that I rely on in deciding whether I can use my Scooter, which I load on the back of my car, so I have the independence of shopping, going to a movie or many things some simply take for granted.  Local weather, which includes maps, hour by hour and extended weather has made my life easier.<br /><br />Great App, I highly recommend it for anyone that is affected by the weather.  This surely includes everyone!
B008ROZAQU|4.0|This is a very enjoyable film about the dangers and love lives of trappers who capture wild African animals in the early 1960s.  The film has good comedy scenes as well as action sequences.  The score includes Baby Elephant Walk by Henry Mancini.  Not the best John Wayne movie, but a good and entertaining one.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|this holds my son's attention for a long time because there are lots of pages for him to flip through.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This is a comedy-one of the best western comedies ever.  John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara give excellant performances as an estranged couple who are really in love.  How they finally realize this and get together makes one of the best and most entertaining movies ever made.  There is no other movie I know of that the viewer will enjoy as much as this one.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|This is a great backpack, capable of holding a ton of stuff. I routinely carry two laptops, work and personal. My 15-inch MacBook Pro fits with no issues, plenty of room for cables, iPads, etc. Straps are comfy.<br /><br />Pros - bag stands up on its own, roomy, comfy, looks good.<br /><br />Cons - zippers seem a bit cheap, I have already had them tear open twice, luckily with no permanent damage but I wish they were a bit more heavy duty. Anything capable of carrying this much stuff should have STRONG zippers.
B0035JRUZQ|3.0|This is the tipical John Wayne western.  John Wayne and Robert Mitichum give good performances, there is a lot of action, and we all know the good guys are going to win from the start of the movie.  Fun to watch, a good time filler.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I loved the new song \\"Suddenly\\". It was amazing it was recorded live and once you see the movie the recording brings back all the remarkable scenes.
0802130208|5.0|What a character Ignatius Reilly is! This book lets the reader see both sides of the spectrum,that of,intelligence and stupidity!
B00AW0KGYI|1.0|Oh wait this is Hollywood! duh! If they were not greedy I would think something were wrong with the world.
B00846REIS|3.0|Was a good read but too similar to 50 shades of grey. Hoping for more of a love story in the next book.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I had installed the original version of Lep's World a while back and really enjoyed it, so was excited to see this part 2. This game is beyond awesome! The graphics are crisp &amp; clear, controls are easy enough to use, and I really like the various worlds/levels. Reminds me of the good old days of Nintendo.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The book was great and a good read.  I got into the story and it had a little comedy and suspense.

B005LAIHZE|5.0|i enjoy wacthing movies and seen this one in the theathre and wanted to add it to my movie collection of movies.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Thomas Haden Church, and Juno Temple kill it in this movie and Juno Temple is going to be a big star.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got this app because I recently went back to school and needed something to help with household distractions during study time.  It works as discribed and is simple to use. The volume is easy to control and balance.  I have not used it for alarms, so I can' t comment on that.  I personally like the ocean sounds.
B009DA74ES|5.0|The show is so awesome and the women in it make me salivate. Another fine season and look forward to more.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Loved the movie. The plot was great. The motorcycle chase was a bit to long,but overall the movie had a great story line. Will watch again when it comes on HBO.
B00936A0RU|5.0|A great movie in a great setting and Jessica Chastain seems like she cannot do wrong. This is a must see.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I have read all of the books adn have seen all of the movies, I enjoy them all! Breaking Dawn part II is the best of all though!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|As I have gotten older it has gotten more difficult to fall asleep. My daughter suggested I try a white noise generator app to help . I figured what did I have to lose. It has been wonderful. And the free White Noise Android app is all I needed. Basic functionality that works perfect for free.
B009IAN56E|5.0|It took a long time but it was worth the wait. Love the this CD! i would get more of thier music.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a fantastic, heart breaking ending. This was even better on the second reading. I can't wait fir the second movie
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Not sure what happened here, but it seems like this movie wasn't done being edited. It had a very slow pace for the first two hours, developing a very in-depth storyline, but in the end rushed it to a close, without explaining a lot. And why? I saw much in the first two hours that could have been cut, to make room for much more fulfilling ending. But instead, in the end felt let down. Also, why introduce a new character to become Robin, when there are already three existing character choices from the comics? Also, why introduce him at all in this film?
B00992CF6W|2.0|this game is only fun with people playing with u but there is no wolf's signs and not like xbox AT ALL and my fav part about xbox is creating it on creative and then switching it back to survival but there's no achevemets!
B007BFSYMS|1.0|No matter how many times I try to set as alarm it will never go off. If this is fixed or I realize that it was user error all along, I'll humbly change my review to positive
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm having a lot of fun getting new ideas, recipies, and art and sharing them with friends all over the world.
B002WQ7XO6|4.0|This is an easy-go-to movie that I continue to watch every once and a while. Goldie Hawn is playfully-dillusional and Steve Martin, though initially hesitant (sane), eventually joins her brand of make-believe insanity. Funny moments, and some emotionally tangable moments. Overall, the characters are loveable, bright, clever and charming.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|You go Sherlock and John.<br />The product was great and the season was fantastic.<br /><br />and six more words are required... (this probably won't be a helpful rating)
0765325950|3.0|Many of my friends like Sanderson, and I don't know if I'm just a purist or if he's just not to my liking, but I really don't like his style.<br /><br />I can tell when Jordan wrote parts, and where Sanderson did.<br /><br />The entire book is rushed and feels choppy.  I think Sanderson just pieced together whole sections of Jordan's notes without filling in and giving the vibrant background details I have become used to in each scene.<br /><br />This easily could have been three times the length, and all in all I suppose I'd rather read a chopped up abridged version, which is what this feels like, than what it should have/could have been complete in 3,000 pages.
B004132HZS|5.0|You go Sherlock and John<br /><br />Out of all the episodes the first is my favorite<br />and out of all of the seasons the first still might be my favorite,<br />I actually watched this seasons so much I dont remember the second... oh wait... yes I do... yeah the first of this season is still my favorite<br />(then in the second season the second episode)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best I can not believe how fun it is sorry about my spelling this is great it is the best game in the history of games
B007BFSYMS|3.0|The noise machine works well. The sounds are as good if not better than the ones on my stand alone noise machine. The alarm clock is the best feature. There are a lot of voices for the alarm, and they can be set to start at a low volume and gradually get louder. The thing that I don't like about it is that it is pushy about getting you to write a review. Overall, not a bad app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids (12 and 10) love this game. They are always playing it and they said it is really challenging.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Since the movie was nominated for an academy award I felt I should read the book before seeing the movie.  Loved the characters.  Can't imagine how the movie can live up to the book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great plot,n graphics. After a certain point you have to pay for it to get the rest of the game-__- but because I like it I went mind buy-in it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The author had me by the first chapter.  So interesting how the story unfolds.  A page turner. Can't wait to read some of her other books.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The beginning took a little too long to get going, but once it did I could not pit it down. I was anxious to see if she would make him truely fall in love with her and he did.
0805079831|5.0|Klein has done a superb job of looking at our history from a different perspective.  Although everything is documented and factual, her writing style keeps you in a state of awe and outrage to the very end.  I feel I have a better understanding and interpretation of currant events.  It's an eyeopener for what's going on right now.  Very easy to read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game rocks! I ACCIDENTALLY PRESSED FOR A WHILE TO GET THE BELL PEPPERS AND FEED FOR COMMENTS ON BLOGS RELATED CONTENT OF EXTERNAL INTERNET EXPLORER TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE FREELANCE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES<br />MY FIRST

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Well, I like keeping up with the news feed and pictures but don't find the app actually offers much more than that.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Got it wasn't what I hoped for, you can't even start reading the bible until you run thru the junk that's on it. not what I expected, still can't even get to my reading.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and all of its features. From the verse of the day to being able to tailor your experience is just awesome.
B0011ZW8MG|3.0|This album must have been the one that got lost, the group had to be very bored at the time they wrote it, it's definitely not one of their best.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I love films about history, especially those that are well done and accurate.  Great acting, great insights, great passion.  This is a wonderful film about real people caught up in the challenges of royal life during a time of war.  I highly recommend.
0399159029|4.0|Philip Kerr has created a real dilemma for himself. He writes best sellers about a good cop working in Nazi Germany, one of the most morally compromised societies in modern history whose very existence is tied to crimes of horrifying proportions.  These crimes were orchestrated by real people who also populate his novels.  In Prague Fatale, Bernie Gunther gets summoned by Reinhard Heydrich, the architect of the Final Solution, to serve as his private detective.  You don't get much closer to raw evil than Heydrich.  Yet he was simultaneously a connoisseur of the arts, sportsman, father and husband. Somehow Kerr has to balance the contradictions and allow Heydrich to be himself.  No easy task this and the result is not altogether convincing. There is some interesting history here about Czech resistance and for that alone the book is worth reading, but some fundamental questions remain. Would Heydrich have opened himself up in the way he does and would he have tolerated Gunther's cheek and heavy handed treatment of senior SS staff?  At some point we must enquire what Kerr's ultimate purpose in all this is - is it to brutalize Gunther totally or is redemption on the way? With at least one more book to come in the series, we can only hope this battered old friend finds his humanity restored in some way.
0385535147|5.0|I was skeptical at 1st because at the beginning the book seemed to drag as Malcolm Bannister was telling a story with no dialog, but as soon as the book got going I was absolutely hooked.  Grisham spins this yarn in a way where u are at a loss for what the heck Bannister aka Baldwin is up to.  Once you figure out what exactly he is up to you find out how much of a genius Grisham is for coming up with a truly remarkable scheme for Bannister/Baldwin and company.  This is a must read for all Grisham fans.<br /><br />Note....Grisham does admit in an authors note at the end of the book that everything may not be correct pertaining to the justice system and that it didn't need to be and I agree with Grisham.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found this book to be darker than the 1st two. Most of the time there seemed to be less hope. Reading the first two is a necessity for sympathetic character involvement.  Great twist in the ending!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Loved the first Temple Run but this is so much better.  Graphics, challenges, and increased levels of skill.  Have had no problems or glitches in the first dozen or so hours I've played. Lots more surprises than the first one - from the first zip line to the miner's car. Have to stay ever alert for the subtle changes.  Just when you think you have memorized when to expect the next obstacle it changes.  Love it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Compared to the film, the book is deeper and its allegorical presentation much clearer, but the film translation is decidedly faithful and effective (I discuss my initial impressions of the movie here). In this article I'll focus on two main points: my perception of the meaning of the book, and the process of film adaption relative to the book. I will not go into the plot, as that's been covered before.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />As Pi himself comments, you have two alternate versions of the same story presented. In both, a ship sinks, everyone but Pi dies, and most of a year later he washes up in Mexico. Neither version makes any effective difference for anyone else in the world. When Pi asks the Japanese investigators to whom he tells these tales which is the better story, they chose the one with the tiger. Pi observes, \\"so it goes with God.\\"<br /><br />This is the crux of the book's double allegory. The Richard Parker (or animal) story can be seen as an interpretation for the unacceptably horrific \\"more realistic\\" story. I'll discuss that in a second, but more fundamentally, the whole double tale can be seen as an allegory for faith, for the very act of seeing the universe as God(s)' work (true be there one, three, or infinite gods). When faced with the hard cruel story, Pi chooses the miraculous interpretation - and so do most people.<br /><br />This central thesis is the weakest part of the film, which generally does a wonderful job with both the introduction and the harrowing animal allegory itself. In the novel, the parallels between the animal and human tales are more numerous and clear. Both tales are more horrifying, the human one doubly so. This subtle tonal shift is absolutely crucial when we come to the choice and juxtaposition between tales. Each reader/viewer choose for himself what to believe (\\"and so it goes with God\\"). The film leans this choice more heavily toward Richard Parker as its compressed telling of the human tale does not do justice to Martel's careful construction of the internal allegory.<br /><br />Still, I can not emphasize too much, given the limitations of both mediums, how terrific an adaptation of this wonderful novel the film is. The book is more personal, internal, philosophical, realistic even. Martel did some serious research and every bit of Pi's life, particularly the time on the boat feels very real. He sells this story as effectively as one possibly could. And despite musings, philosophy, asides, and copious detail does it in an immersive and gripping way. I stayed up to 4am to read the final 2/3 of the novel in one go.<br /><br />The film, for its part, is more visually arresting, more luminous and surreal. The writer, director, and actors have constructed scenes where only narrative existed, and brought them to life with great color. Even the fairly elaborate build up is transmuted essentially intact. There are nips and tucks. We lose a minor characters as their dialog folds into more important ones. Richard Parker is introduced earlier, picking up a crucial scene from another tiger. For the most part, these tie the story tighter to the central narrative. A process crucial to  which films adaption. A few changes are more mysterious: 1) a brief love interest is introduced in the film and 2) Pi's father becomes a less competent zookeeper. They don't detract in a serious way, but I didn't see the point.<br /><br />In the central portion, the bookish Pi's musings on what it takes to survive the ordeal, and his detailed walk through of many details (including turtle butchery, hunger, and dining on excrement, etc.) is effectively replaced by specific moments and young Pi's wry narration and gifted facial expressions. But this weakens what Richard Parker represents in the interior allegorical interpretation. He servers as Pi's animal nature, his will to survive, and the film doesn't dare show that as graphically as the novel does. Likewise the odd \\"two blind men\\" sequence in thenovel is deleted. This had to be done, as it has no real place in a film, and was the dullest section of the book. Still, it serves to bind the two versions of the crossing together, completing the allegory.<br /><br />The novel's POV trick in the third section, where it switches to the Japanese investigator's report, also helps provide the proper balance for evaluating the allegorical positions. In the film, we remain more tightly with Pi, and hence with the Richard Parker version. But POV is the novel format's biggest gun. It enables voice and interior monologue. Proper POV in a novel is as crucial as casting in a film, as both must shoulder the emotional burdens.<br /><br />Any which way, read the book, see the movie, or both.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dreamnovel is deleted.

Gladwell does a wonderful job of intertwining side stories with the major plot of the novel.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't smiled so wide or been moved to tears from a book in a long time. The characters, Hazel and Augustus matter. And their love story is quirky and wonderful. I am sad it was all over so soon...I could have  kept on reading for much longer.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I don't play this too often.  I really downloaded it for a friend to play, since it was their favorite game from years gone by.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|This album is awesome every song on this album is totally amazing well worth the money I spent on it. I love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so fun and great if your trying to learn how to take care of a horse so get this app
B002RVEIAI|5.0|I'm not even sure what I'm writing a review for.  If you've watched the other terminators and had a hard time deciding if you want to see what happens then I'm not sure we can be friends.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really loved the first one, so I was excited for this. My mine issue is that it is EXTREMELY laggy. Aside from that, I love the new additions.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is an excellent product that I loaded on my PCs, Android and Apple phones. The connection time is fast, and it has been working flawlessly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You can beat free and this app works as expected. I like that it fills the screen making it really large and easy to read.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I was a huge fan of the novel. It was touching, and with a very specfic feel, and well-placed imagery, character, tone and voice. Initially, I worried that these would be lost when it translated to the big screen. However, instead, it took all the things I loved best about the book and brought them to life really strongly for me.<br />The music was thrown into play better that I could ever have imagined, with great timing and mking the soundtrack a must-have. The feel of Cherlie's letters were not lost, but also used sparingly enough to make the film interesting to watch still.<br />The actors blew me away, too. I was highly skeptical of Logan Lerman going in, but not only did he portray Charlie as a living, breathing, infinite character, he did all aspects seemlessly. &#34;I really wanna milkshake,&#34; was just as believable as &#34;I Feel infinite,&#34; &#34;I was getting really tired of touching her boobs,&#34; And his &#34;Stop crying&#34; breakdown. I felt like I was Charlie's 'dear friend' in the film just as I had in the book.<br />Emma Watson slipped into her accent on a few words here and there, but I still praise her portrayal of Sam. Watson was the perfect Sam, with ger pretty eyes, sweet attitude and free love of music and her emotional smallness, and her strong opinions. Her Janet sequence was priceless as well, and I could see with no problem how Charlie fell for her.<br />Ezra Miller really blew me away, too. I laughed so often at Patrick's antics, and couldn't help but feel the desire to have him as my own friend, and I loved how Miller kept it fresh. Like Patrick, his surprises, nuances, jokes and stunts never got stale. But what really tugged at my heart was his scene in the park and the kiss with Charlie. He seemed so perfectly real it took my breath away, and broke my heart at the same time.<br />In the theater, I was choking back my noise of sadness. Once purchased at home, I was sobbing into my grape juice.<br />I give this a five star ratingforthose wonderful reasons, and shall watch this film many times over.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I hadn't read a Lee Childs Book before and had a look at his first, so that I would better understand the Tom Cruise Movie-he's no Jack Reacher, where is Willis when you need him?  A good read, and I have picked up 3 or 4 to add to my Connell, Richard North Patterson, Baldacci, Nesbo Collection.  I hope they remain as interesting as the first of my Jack Reachers.<br />Stephen
B0002DRDBE|5.0|I love this movie so hardcore. I couldnt have completed my collection without this movie. every disc has something new for a Kvein Smith fan to love from the commentary to the deleted scenes. This is a must have to complete the Jersey Trilogy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game because its really realistic I'm 14 and I love it. I think more people should buy it because its a great learning expirience

B00B2V66VS|2.0|It was a lot of fun the first couple of times i played it, but then i tried to get back to it on the carousel on the home screen and it wont work!!! All it does is go to the screen that has imangi studios and the cool looking &quot;s&quot; but thn it goes right back to the home screen!!! The game is a lot of fun but i hate how it wont even open. If somehow they can fix that then i would have rated it five stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first one is so fun and the second one is very fun. I go back and forth between the two temple run s

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Way addictive! I like it alot better than the first temple run. LOVE the addition of the ropes and mine!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|it is ok for the younger age's but as for the older age group it is not for them is is more of a kids game so im not that big of a fan of it
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I thought it was the best ending you could have for any series! Stephanie has composed this book very well and I hope everyone else will love this book.
B001D0DQUC|4.0|This is a classic that I grew up with as a child.  Be warned that language standards (cursing) is higher than I remember it being.  Also, I did not watch this in HD, so the quality of the video was lacking...
B005K17RU0|5.0|The Accuweather for Android app gives me everything I need to stay up to date on the weather and does it in a neat and workman-like manner.  It works well on all 3 Android devices I own.
0802473156|5.0|Everything in this book makes common sense which to me means it's got the right answers. Me & most other people seem to brush aside common sense communication practices, but this book will bring them to light. It's easy to read; I read in about 2 days. Great read if you're single & looking or married.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I can view my kindle fire in landscape or portrait and i can turn it so the charging plug is usable while I am still using the kindle fire. I just wish it was a bit cheaper in price.
1449410243|5.0|I only recently became a fan of The Oatmeal website, and when I saw they had this book for sale I knew I wanted it. It was money well spent.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|The author brags about stealing personal clothing from the homes of suspected insurgents, objects to directives from command that alters terms of engagement designed to protect civilian lives, and shows a wanton disrespect for our commander-in-chief. His arrogance shows through in this narrative. There are other far better descriptions of the hunt for Bin Laden.
B000YMMN04|4.0|A very sweet and entertaining movie.  It is nice to see Reese Witherspoon and Toby Maguire at the beginning of their careers. There is adult nudity, in pictures and artwork however, that unfortunately make it unsuitable for younger children. But it may not appeal to that age group anyway.As someone who grew up with &#34;Father Knows Best&#34;, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|You get what you pay.. It´s good, it´s reliable but it ain´t the best out there, i have a few months with it and i haven´t had any problem at all
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love, love the show.  Session 1 and 2 have been super and I can hardly wait to receive Session 3.  This is a show one can see over and over again and pick up parts that were missed the first time around.  A wonderful collection to have and watch.  Downton Abbey is the best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the ending, I struggled with it at first but admire how Collins ended it. I wish there was another book!!
B005HP2JAM|5.0|Beautiful photography and very interesting narration literally illuminating the lifestyles of 30,000 years ago.<br /><br />I found it very touching and uncanny that the people enjoyed art and music as we do today. The idea of creating art and music while struggling with survival is truly an amazing human trait,
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so much. This book touched my heart. It gives you the thoughts and feelings of a real teenage boy with mental health. Being a mental health provider, I loved it. I read the book in a day because I could not put it down. The book is better than the movie. I must read!

B009PMEEY2|1.0|this is not compatible with the fire.  do not buy if you plan to use it with a fire.  it will run until you press play.  at that point it shows you the play options and immediately shuts the game down.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I may have cried at one  other book but this one tops it! I loved it and the slam poetry added so much to it. Through the entire you silently hope ok are they getting together now but then something else happens and you can't help but keep reading because it draws you in and you aren't able to put it down.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game and great for android! Fits my screen well and I am so happy I can play it on my phone.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Nice little app for taking notes and having them on all my devices, makes it easy to keep track of things. Does exactly what I was looking for.
B0086700CM|2.0|Even though it says it is compatible, it doesn't work. Good thing I don't have to buy it, it's only free.
B004PR71JC|5.0|My daughter loved the move so I bought the Soundtrac. She loves the entire CD. This is a great purchase for us.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been asked to review this game even though I haven't had much time to evaluate it, having only purchased it yesterday.<br />What I have seen thus far makes it a stand-out above the original game.  Better graphics, more ways to get around, etc.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|First off this Is a landmark television series. This is one of my favorite television series of all time. I would highly recommend this to anybody was not seen it before. However I was hoping to get an enhanced edition in the sense that I would be receiving a 1080p copy instead of a 1080i. It defeats the point of having a Blu-ray if it is going to have the same resolution as the television format. Save yourself some money and buy the DVD set
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I found this book a surprise to me, I felt it was impactful and it had so many lessons to learn.  Loved it!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Amazing movie, with amazing effects! I can't wait to see the sequel, because just like everyone else who has seen this movie, we all know that it deserves a sequel!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great Service, Great packaging, Quick Delivery.  Very happy Customer. Thank you!<br />I cannot wait to see this movie.  I am in a deployed location, so I will pass it around when I am done!!  Thank you again. :-)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I like the complexity of the characters. They are  intriguing and makes you want to know more about them and their relationship between each other.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|A wonderful boxed set of Doctor Who dvds for the avid fan. This has the entire 6th series & is well worth the money. No disappointments here.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is very addictive.  once I start playing its like you can not put it down. Just one more game. the only dislike is the monster, I do not like him, do not know why, but wish they would change him
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, and I am so happy because I can watch all the behind the scenes footage and extended versions now!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I honestly skimmed parts of book. Too many new people. Not as good as books before. Of course I read it and will read last book...but parts of this got a little drawn out...just saying.
0895260131|3.0|Another insite in the Crusades.and the war with Islam.  I did not understand about it being politically incorrect, if the author was accurate in his writings.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This is a great season to start a great show.  There's commentary on every episode.  I recommend it to everyone that loves comedies.
B007USWD0U|5.0|We love Kurismaki films, and this is probably at the top of the list.  Droll slice of life, with suspense.  The cinematography plays like a series of paintings.  The colors and lighting are incredible.  The use of flowers throughout, particularly the cherry tree in blossom at the end smacks of Japanese cinema, particularly the director Ozu.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book! I read it in 3 days - couldn't put it down.Great Character development and plot. Recommend it to all my friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abby is without doubt the best series ever shown on TV...and I have never enjoyed any movie as much as I do this show.  It is a beautiful production.  The sets, costumes and characters are spot on.  The acting is superb, and the actors make the characters come to life.  If you haven't seen this series, you have really missed out!
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Wow! It's been twenty years?! The music these guys made always make me pumped up. What a classic album! Love it!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this; it will revitalize your romance. The duet with Lady Gaga is a true classic.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is GREAT! I can't wait till May for the third book! The first two were excellent so I'm sure the third is going be as well!
0761169253|4.0|If you are a novice writer, the book will be of great benefit to you. Not every suggestion hits the mark, but a nice read regardless.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is actually very fun.  Its very realistic and very User friendly. I'm sure a small child would love this game and I would definitely recommend.
B00574P964|5.0|My wife read the books when they were released.  She would always laugh as she read them.  This was a perfect way to enjoy it together!!  This movie exceeded my expectation.  It was great!
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|I loved Haywire, it was a refreshing old school action movie with a simple primal and clean plot (revenge) that relied on awesome fighting scenes and great action rather than the much over used special effects that we see way too much nowadays.<br /><br />I was REALLY impressed with Gina Carano in this movie not only was this her first real movie, and not only was she in there with a top notch all-star who's who of Hollywood cast where poor acting would have REALLY stood out but she was the star of the movie, who the movie was focused on, and she did an amazing job of carrying this movie.  Gina's fight scenes were just awesome!!!!!, her portrayal of a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire was totally believable..............I also found myself both liking and rooting for Mallory Kane (Gina's character) and the fighting scenes were so brutally real i found myself cringing and wincing at some of the impacts................Like I said it was hard to believe this was Carano's first real movie, if she doesnt become a \\"bigtime\\" action star like the Rock I will be very surprised and very disappointed!!!!<br /><br />I'm REALLY hoping for a sequel to Haywire it kinda reminded me of the Bourne series movies..........All I can say to anyone who  didnt like Haywire, I think either you dont really care for action movies or you saw the big time all star cast and figured there would be a much more complex plot with more dramatic character development and acting  rather than the simple very clean plot that I feel worked very well, with the main focus on the amazing fight and action scenes..........on a similar note to anyone who didnt like Gina Carano as Mallory Kane, you have to ask yourself was she believable as a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire, did you find yourself liking and/or rooting for Mallory Kane, did you find yourself cringing or wincing during any of the brutally realistic fighting scenes.........if you answered yes to any of these then Gina did a great job............Good actors or actresses inspire strong feelings, they pull you into the movie and make you feel what they are feeling, like or hate or root for them........Poor actors are either miscast and/or not believable in their roles or say or do something annoying or distracting that takes our focus away from the story and character they are trying to portray. The acting and casting in Haywire was top notch.<br /><br />Right now the Rock is the ONLY real \\"bigtime\\" action star we have Stalone, Arnold, VanDam, Seagal,  etc......have pretty much passed the baton and are pretty much retired action movie stars, and we've NEVER really had a woman action star............I think just like The Rock, Gina Carano has the charm, charisma, beauty and skills to become a bigtime action star.........I think thats what Soderberg saw in her as well, and I think thats why she was so popular in MMA...........she has that \\"something special\\" that will allow her to fill a key niche and make lots of amazing badass movies, she's a total package with amazing fighting skills that translate to the big screen very well, great charisma and charm, and a rare combination of beauty, while still being totally believable as a badass..............I cant think of another action star who was as good in their first movie........she was MUCH better than Arnold, VanDam, Seagall,  Rampage Jackson...........and worlds better than Triple H, John Cena etc.........under MUCH more difficult circumstances ( being the STAR of her first movie with an all star who's who of Hollywood cast to measure up to)<br /><br />Like the Rock I also think Carano could be versatile enough to play other roles than action and be good.  she has a lot of charm and charisma and a genuine down to earth sweetness and I think she would be could in romantic comedy type movies and of course super hero movies and dramas...........Not sure if she could be mean enough to play a villain or not though........but I do think shewould make an AMAZING  Wonder Woman........since Lynda Carter played that role I NEVER thought another actress could match up to her but I take that back today Carano has the beauty, charm, sweetness and amazing smile to play the role plus she brings the badass amazonian comic book presence to the role as well that I cant see ANYONE but her bringing.<br /><br />In closing I'm hoping to see more Haywire sequels!!!!...........and ALOT more Gina Carano!!!!!would make an AMAZING  Wonder Woman........since Lynda Carter played that role I NEVER thought another actress could match up to her but I take that back today Carano has the beauty, charm, sweetness and amazing smile to play the role plus she brings the badass amazonian comic book presence to the role as well that I cant see ANYONE but her bringing.<br /><br />In closing I'm hoping to see more Haywire sequels!!!!...........and ALOT more Gina Carano!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Had me hooked from beginning to end. Get ready to laugh and cry...and cry...can't wait to see the movie as I am sure one will be made!
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I loved this game. It's one of the longest HO games I've played. Upon beginning the bonus chapter, I ran into issues. When I try getting past the first bonus puzzle it freezes. I've even tried skipping it but as soon as I either solve it or push the skip button it freezes and I have to force close it. Playing on Fire HD 7&quot;
B00AOOHIJS|4.0|When I saw the first Frankenweenie from the bonus DVD within the special edition of Nightmare before Christmas, I thought it was cute.  But, when this stop-action complete extended version came out, I knew I wanted it for my collection.  The story is more complete and more action packed with such feeling, I just loved it!  I strongly recommend seeing this movie.  It IS one of Tim Burton's best.  Thank you TIM!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I Could not put it down. Even when I wanted to look away I could not.  Great book. Well written.
1419705849|5.0|my 3rd grade son enjoys reading this book. He loves graphic novels so this fit right in. He likes the humor a lot.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|These guys are like a Thom Yorke side project.  If you're into Radiohead, you definately need to check this out!  Really good stuff.
0345404475|5.0|You must be a Dick's fan to like all his books. Some of them, as this one, present hidden social messages not easy to decipher.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved his book! Absolutely amazing!  I laughed and tears rolled down my face! It felt so real,  so true and very heartfelt. These charecters are real to me and I will miss Augustus!  My life has been touched.
B00012QM8G|5.0|\\"In the beginning of WWII, Oskar Schindler's only objective was figuring out a way to make more money. He never intended on saving the lives over a thousand Jews. \\"Schindler's List\\", tells the extraordinary way in which Oskar Schindler put his life on the line to save the innocent. The movie takes place in Germany and Poland. Oskar Schindler loved three thing's, women, alcohol, and money. He was a member of the Nazi party, but he was not sadistic and arrogant like many of his fellow Nazi members. In many Concentration camps, Jews were forced to perform hard labor in order to help the war effort. As a result of this Schindler was able to create a contract with the Nazi's, that allowed him to gain workers for his factory. By doing so Schindler prevented over a thousand individuals from facing a fate that so many were sent to. These peoples names were kept on a list so that Schindler could keep track of his workers. This list saved the people from being sent on transports that would have probably taken them to their death.\\"<br /><br />\\"The movie Schindler's List relates to world religions because it tells the story of a Christian man, who went out of his way to save over a thousand Jewish individuals. It is a prime example of how just because a person does not share the same religious beliefs as another person, it does not mean that a person lacks compassion and respect for the other. World Religions is a course that is meant to open a students eyes to different beliefs and cultures, that ways there can be a better understanding and respect for individuals who do not share the same religious background. Reguardless of what religion a person practices, that individual is still a human being. Oskar Schindler was himself a member of the Nazi party, but he did not share his party members hatred of Jews. He recognized that Jews were human being's just like him and they too deserved to live their lives free of persecution.\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I only wished there were more to enjoy. You will love it!!!!!
B002AT8KCY|5.0|i've watched this movie dozens of times on VHS.  I like everything about it with the fast paced action, the story line and the characters.  This was the second time I'd seen Travola play a badass role and is really good at it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|is so fun and addictive and cool characters to buy at the store just awesome and they have very cool characters you just cant take your eyes of the game and its good and downloaded amazingly on the kindle fire
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It meets some needs but I prefer e-mail.  I don't have (or take) time to read comments that are written with little thought about unnecessary or very private information.  I am VERY careful what I write.  I prefer not to post intimate or family information.
B00AFEY354|2.0|Well,i read the book and then saw this movie and obviously i know you cannot cram 224 pages in an hour and a half but a John Hughes film comparison???? This is not even close,I felt a disconnect with the characters in the movie that almost bordered on boring,nothing genuine about it,candice is supposed hate charlie,what about candice's abortion??? A 1 minute reference to his penn state brother and everything else just didnt't gel with me,the bill/charlie relationship just looked very forced at best.What about the emotional \\"i cry all the time\\" charlie in the book? This is the lamest book to screen rendition yet,but there will be people saying it's a great coming of age movie,you can say all you want,this is a forgettable movie and to mention this movie in the same sentence as any of John Hughes classic movies is straight on suicidal.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|After seeing the movie recently, I downloaded the book on my Kindle and am enjoying reading a couple chapters each day.  victor Hugo is a marvelous author; I'm appreciating the movie more since reading the book with extensive background on the Bishop...I'm only on page 35 so have a long way to go.  I'll enjoy this spiritual trip.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|This Kindle edition of Northanger Abbey was easy to read and free from any oddities of spacing or abridgment. Highly recommended - though without the considerable following of others such as Pride and Prejudice, it remains my favorite of Austen's works.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Druckerman calls out American moms (herself included) on our counter-productive parenting practices. Though written much like a memoir, this book spoke to me on an instructional level. Don't use it as a how-to manual, though...that would be SO American!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games series is a great read.  It's literally the fasted I've blown through three books in my life!  Now, you definitely need to have read Catching Fire somewhat around the same time as when you start Mockingjay, because there are a few times when you might be like, &#34;who is he again?&#34; There are a LOT of characters, and you might need to go back and look up who they are.  The beginning is a little slow and it took me a few chapters to get into it.  However, don't give up on it!  The last 3/4 of the book is action packed and full of excited twists and turns, you'll be left breathless at the end.  I had heard prior to reading that some didn't like the ending.  Don't worry I won't spoil it for you, but I thought the ending was as perfect as it could be.  It was not easily predictable and left you satisfied, but somewhat sad because you've just finished the last chapter of the amazing story of Katniss Everdeen.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The main character is very likeable. There was a lot of science throughout but it didn't detract from the story which was interesting from start to finish. For me personally, it was brilliant.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|This would be my first time writing a movie review. I have to say I truly enjoyed this movie. It had all the things I like in a movie for it to be sci-fi. It starts off with the story of a Marine (Jake) being offered a chance to take his murdered brother's place on a mission. In return for his service he is offered a chance to get the surgery he needs to correct a spinal injury. He arrives to meet with the Colonel and finds out his mission. He is to go to a distant moon of Pandora by using an \\"Avatar,\\" and aid in the search for \\"Unobatainium.\\" I found the name to be kind of cheesy.<br />Once he arrives to Pandora he meet a native Na'vi girl named Neytiri. As she teaches him her way of life, a love story blossoms. With many references to our politics in our society it made it all more relatable. The Na'vi tribe show a lot of strength as they are put to the test by the Colonel's orders in to take over. There are even a few references to the cooperate world, too.<br />This relates a lot to the affects that the modern world has had on indigenous people.<br />[[ASIN:B003EVWDR0 Avatar]]
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this almost as much as The Thirteenth Tale.  So sad, so poignant and vibrant.  I loved it and will read more of Morton's books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was SO excited when I saw this game, it's even better than the original one! The only downside is that sometimes when I try to use a save me, it'll just freeze and exit the game by itself. But other than that, I love the new content!
B0097EWK3A|3.0|You get into the game and start figuring everything out and just when all that happens they make you buy the app to continue. 3 stars for the graphics only.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Simply spectacular. I could not put the book down. Loved every chapter. I am going to suggest this book to all of my friends
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game, the graphics are great and the arcade part it so much fun. I just want to play every day.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I would recommend this book to any woman who enjoys reading!!  I couldn't put the book away. It is the first book  I have ever read in 24 hours! Very passionate story...yet the killing of the Jewish people was so heart breaking...so glad the author gave Sarah a way to escape her death and return to unlock the secret door even though it was a sad finding of her little brother. I will read more of Tatiana de Rosnay's books! However, I don't know how they can be as good as &#34;Sarah's Key&#34;.
030746363X|3.0|I really should have got the cliff notes version! but looking forward to getting through it. Love the kindle version!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love playing it,but there are a lot of issues (using my kindle,that is). It crashes after using the &quot;save me&quot; button twice. U can't change the sensitivity.It is really slow,because of this. It glitches a lot while playing. It &quot;forced close&quot; a lot &amp; now it won't open at all. I Had to delete it &amp; reinstall. I hope it works now. Like I said, I LOVE playing it.
B0070066DI|2.0|I bought it to replace my stock CPU cooler coming with the i3 CPU. It turned out to be a waste of time and money.<br /><br />The fan is really loud, much worse than the stock CPU cooler. And what made it worse is that you have to remove the motherboard to install the cooler, so it is a lot of hassle, a very frustrating experience to spend a lot of time just to find out it gave you worse result.
B007TK77QE|5.0|A beautifully written story. This book contains a gripping tale of a tangled web of intrigue. Hard to put this book down from beginning to end.
B008KE3960|4.0|first saw this game on a cnet review. they liked it so i thought i would give it a try and i found it addictive.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I put in my ear buds while reading in a noisy location.  I put on white noise and it blocks it all out
B006LSZECO|5.0|My boyfriend actually got mad at me as I was reading this because he could not pry me away, I was too absorbed to think about anything else.  There are three parts... the first part I thought was a great reflection on how two people see their own marriage differently... but after that, I was blown away by the twists and turns the plot took.  The main character, Amy; is the protagonist of a series of children´s books that her parents wrote about her; her husband, Nick, had to move home from NYC when his mother was sick.  Amy goes missing in the first chapter of the book, and we watch the police hunt unfold from Nick´s point of view as we read Amy´s past diary entries.  Believeably written and gripping from the first page!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its really fun and it keeps me busy I really like it and on the kindle there are no glitches only sometimes it might freeze your screen but other than that its fine the cart and everything is fun
B004INNRFK|5.0|This is the encore to the original hit man, lots of tunes you remember from over the years, and a whole lot better that the junk people shout today (don't confuse rap and most rock with actual singing).
B0058EBNAO|4.0|If it had just a few bigger widget sizes (Tablet)  to fit all TEXT 'visibly' at larger size for tired eyes;  if it used a seperate line for 2nd & 3rd day info;  the option of No Icon (space 4 more text);  I would give this a 10!<br /><br />On a 7\\" Tab in portrait - it could cover the width of the screen for at a glance / on the run info ...  Perhaps in the program the extended forcast could be on a 4th pg w/o  the current info for larger text.<br />Yes, I know - get a 10\\" Tab.  But that defeats the portability of keeping it w/ to have a book along \\"in case\\" I'm waiting for ____.<br /><br />Love the little car in fog!  Very nice program - Thank You!<br />I love flittin' thru the pages side to side or up & down for family member locations!<br /><br />UPDATE: 20/20 hindsight- I should have paid full price thr Gplay for auto updates!<br />Had to edit this a day later bcs an update had something I mentioned it needed.<br />COME ON AMAZON, you should have that feature if you are goingto play!
030758836X|5.0|From start to finish, this novel held my attention.  I found the creative blend of storytelling from multiple perspectives abosultely engrossing.
0399213015|3.0|The book is way smaller than I had anticipated and had to get the bigger version for a baby shower gift.
1427210276|4.0|I bought this book-on-CD so that I could transfer it to my iTunes.  Product arrived in good condition and I have had no problems.

B003L7861E|3.0|Gripping story , very well written , but too much description of the food and I particularly disliked the butchery details and descriptions. But I would recommend this book to friends.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Jason Mraz is Amazing,i have all his cds but this is the first one i bought and have played it so much i am shocked it does not skip or have scratches yet, I Wont give up is what hooked me on his songs and well now i wont give up on listening to his music and buying his cds,this is a one of a kind you should put in your collection if you havent already
B00006G8HX|5.0|We love Star Trek and needed this movie to complete our collection. The DVD plays just fine and we got it for a great price.
0553801473|5.0|George Martin's books are great!  He gives all his characters such detail.  I Hope HBO continues to do them justice.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It feels like you own a real horse.But the thing about it is that it is hard to get the diamond D's.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|My family usually watches this Thanksgiving evening. Nothing starts the Christmas season off quite like it. This and Muppet Treasure Island are my two favorite Muppet movies. Wish they could come out with more that are this strong.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|When i found out that the U.S. pilot was from a town in West Virginia very close to where I grew up, I had to read it! Amazong story of war, honor and friendship.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|After watching for the 1st time, speed on my computer went dimmed.  But I like the fact I dont have to miss a show I like again
B005PK553C|5.0|Love this story, weird but can't stop watching..... Love that I can watch it on my iPad!!!! The story is intriguing, different, and draws you back to see next episode.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|more for younger readers but had some depth and was a quick, easy read without an<br />undue amound of sexual conduct
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This temple run is way better that the first one . My favorite part when you get in the mine car
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is very well written, and the story is great. It somewhat peters out at the end, which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars, but it was very entertaining and interesting. I'm looking for other books by Flynn  to read next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of fun and a good challenge. I like the way the games test your mind, and are exceptionally challenging.
075669812X|5.0|Bought as  Christmas present.  Of all his presents, I think this may have been my seven-year old grandson's favorite.  He fell asleep reading it for a week straight.  Worth every penny!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Don't get started if you have anything to do that day.  I keep doing &#34;just one more&#34; until forced to stop, usually by my dog.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|This game( angry birds) is not something I enjoy. Appreciate the free games but this type are not for me.<br />I like hidden object  type games.
B002WJI63A|5.0|I bought this Princess Peach in order to complete a set and she was well received and loved immediately.  Thanks a lot!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book<br /><br /> The ending was crazy it is kind of sad though but overall I loved it<br />Totally unpredictable
B007FG9LIE|2.0|LONG AND BORING.  A poor attempt at MYSTERY and suspense.  Yes it took me a while to figure out why than AND others were held captive, but by the time I did, I no longer cared.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works well with my Kindle Fire HD, is a hardy stout cable.  I purchased another usb cable for my Kindle Fire, cuz sometimes you just need a longer usb cable :)
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I like that the director didn't just make a sequel. This story takes place, around the same time as the last bourne move. It shows potential for another character to pick up where Jason Bourne left off. Plus since the actor the picked to play the role, is getting more work, from a fan prospective he's easy to fallow. As well as being a likable character, he plays an important role to the progressive story arc. I was very pleased with the film.
B008D30K7E|3.0|Well written story told tongue in cheek of a 100 year old man with a very devil-may-care approach to life with a propensity for falling into bizarre situations. Mostly very entertaining but it gets a bit wearing towards the end.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|We all wish we had more time in our lives! This book shows us how much time we waste and how little we regard it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wow this is amazing good graphics and just amaxing<br /><br />beautiful horses and great game play overall i recomend this to allall
B008ALA6DW|5.0|The connector works just fine. The speed is very fast. However, the connector is easy to fall off. Other than that, it looks good, and does its job.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I have recently staarted reading Brandon Sanderson books and find them really engaging.  Different plots, usual heroes<br />makes for a good story.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Such a great classic, just had to see it in 3D! It's a bonus to get the non-3D version in this pack as well.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I loved all three Batman movies and this game is no different . Just like the last movie with a little story change but still a great game to play and the graphics are smooth . Awesome Game !
B0056BMK6K|1.0|Early in the book Mr. Locke says he almost didn't write this book b/c he didn't want to share his secretes with the competion.  I guess he finally decided half way through to not do that.  There is nothing in here about how or where to market an eBook or what to do to start getting the word out.  There is a lot about how he made millions before he ever wrote his first book and there is quite about about how his Donovan Creed character is some kind of stud, but someone looking to get guidance on how to market thier book won't find it here.  But I guess since he already got my $2.99 he doesn't care.<br /><br />I'll give him credit for that one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well,first off its addicting. Yes, this game should NOT be free. Not grieving the company ideas, just get it while it's free. Yeah it takes SOOOOOOOOO long to load on the iPod, but on the kindle fire it takes an instant and I never got a virus with is. It is SUPER good
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun the horse is like it is actually really!!!!!!!!!! if you always wanted a horse this game is for you
B004HD61KE|5.0|This book held my attention from beginning to end. The true historical perspectives mentioned in the story were fascinating. I could not put the book down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun. some are to hard to beat tho or they dont move  fast enough. but otherwise its ok
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Hard but I loved it.It's awsome .people who are reading this review  and Don't have this game or should I say games you should get it it's free
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is fantastic.  Well....maybe calling it a &#34;game&#34; is a bit of a stretch.  It's more like a choose-your-path novel with some brief puzzle-solving intermissions thrown in.  The plot starts painfully slowly but gains speed fast, and there are more plot twists than I can even count.  The true ending, should you go through the steps to find it, ties the whole game together in such a fantastic way that I can't even talk about it too much without spoiling it.  If you enjoy mysteries or stories with a sci-fi twist and you enjoy puzzles, this is THE GAME for you.  Order it now and play the [Nonary Game]!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I highly recommend buying this app it is fun great and easy to play!!  Very fast when it comes to loading! Never!! Crashes! It is totally worth 6.99 it's great for MINECRAFT fans and can play anywhere! You can also join your friends! (As long as there is WiFi) playing single player does not require WiFi! Which is great! I'm so happy that they now have MINECRAFT . On the kindle buy this product now!!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Awesome noises something for everyone to relax too. I used to have a hard time relaxing and falling asleep, but not anymore. A big thanks to whoever made this app.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Great quality, good story line, both my wife and I enjoy watching it.  Only wish I had been able to buy it in both Bluray and DVD so I could use it both upstairs and downstairs.
B009X01C64|5.0|It's great the way it swivels and stands. I definitely recommend this product! Looks great also, although I wish it came in Red...
B0042K4ZZK|5.0|\\"Nikita\\" is a very enjoyable series that has kept us engaged with clever plots, decent acting, and great action. We tend to watch series after they have been out for a season or two (mostly to be sure we don't get drawn into something the is going to be cancelled mid-plot) and started on Nikita after the second season.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story follows Nikita (Maggie Q), a very skilled assassin trained by a secret government agency called \\"Division\\". Unfortunately for Division, Nikita has gone rouge and is working hard to bring the agency down. There is more to this series than fighting, blowing things up, and assassinations, since the personal relationships between the various agents become key to understanding the past (which is slowly relieved) and developing plot lines.<br /><br />This is one of the best in this genre!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get it get it it's AWESOME! it's cool. lots of games.  lots of fun. you will be glad you got it.
B008476HBM|4.0|This book is a classic, and it is not by accident. Austen's way of writing is fine and poetic, and each characters are very realistic. The famous love story has a precious lesson behind it, and it makes you reflect about yourself and your relations with others.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This is the new dictionary that replaces the old dictionaries and I rate this dictionary a 5 star technological  book
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Found it a good family movie that kept both the 11 year old and the 8 year old boy interested. At those ages it is getting more difficult to find a single movie they agree on.  The parents (that would include me) liked it as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend this it is soooooooo cute love it sooooooo realalistic you will love it if you get it thanks
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I always find  it interesting to read about that era in our history.  Hard to believe that way of life. I found the characters mostly believable although sometimes difficult to follow.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I liked hearing all the songs done but beyond that, it's one of those formulaic &#34;dumb fun&#34; kind of movies. Go in not expecting much and you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Oh, and for bonus fun, enjoy all the stereotypes and political incorrectness.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game just takes a while to open and it has good graphics! Th  horses are so cute only thin  I would improve is it cost gems to b  horses!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|One of the most addicting shows I have ever seen! So excited for the next season. Highly recommended DVD purchase.
B004GYY714|3.0|The Pittsburgh sports stations I wanted were not streaming. I went to Iheart and got the stations I wanted. I also found Iheart easier to use. The facebook sign in was no problem. you can elect not to have usage posted.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|What a great show! My only complaint would be is that this season is way too short. Definitely leaves you wanting more.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Great show! Plant, Page, Jones, and Jason Bonham play a wonderful tribute those great old Zep tunes. Everyone tries to do Zep material, but no one can do it like the masters. Thanks to Led Zeppelin and crew for some great memories.<br /><br />Robert Plant's voice still sounds fantastic. He does not quite hit all of the high notes that he did in the 60's, but considering that he is still belting them out 40+ years later, he could not sound any better. Thank you once again Robert.<br /><br />Jimmy Page can still play a 12 string like no other. Listening to his solo's is like stepping into a time machine, and it is 1969 all over again. There will never be another equal to Jimmy Page.<br /><br />Until recently, I had not appreciated John Paul Jones for all of his talents. In addition to writing and composing much of Zep's music, he brings the bass and the keyboard to life like no other.<br /><br />Jason Bonham is a classic example of the acorn not falling far from the tree. Jason, on his own accord, has more than earned his place with this band. No doubt John Bonham is looking down and is very proud of his son.<br /><br />There have been many talented bands through the years, however when this group of people come together, it is nothing short of magical.<br /><br />The boxed set is well made and the bonus disc in the delux set are a nice addition for any diehard Zep fan. The two CD's were loaded into my car's CD player, and have not been taken out since. The sound quality of the CD's are outstanding. The sound and picture quality of the DVD's are very good. No complaints.<br /><br />I hope that they will get together again and do more shows.<br /><br />My only regret is not seeing the show in person...
B00742GBDM|2.0|The screenplay in this movie was written to advance a commentary which was not part of the book.  I don't require some screenwriter's social commentary in a Jane Austen story, thank you.  The value of Austen's insights lay in the observations made in small circles of society and their easy translation to the wider world.  In and of themselves, Jane Austen's insights are worthwhile.  The screenwriter's foray into sensationalized slavery was ridiculous.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think you shouldn't have a surtent amount of health coins to he able to play in a competition but otherwise that this game is amazing!!!!!
0399160450|5.0|I have read all of Clancy's works.Enjoyed the interaction between the characters. Great suspense.Recommend this to anyone wanting to enjoy threading multiple personalities that are weaved into an intriging novel.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once I started it was very hard to stop reading this story.  Tugs at the heart strings.  It felt like you were sitting right there with them and could just reach out an feel what they were feeling.  Great writing and great story
B001NLKXK2|3.0|I thought it could have been a little deeper with the content.  Also, thought it would have been nice to have a short epilogue at the end so you get a better sense on how the characters solved their crisis.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game. Fun. Just like the real fair/arcade game ! Great for all ages :)  Also try the game &quot; coin dozer seasons &quot;
B00B2V66VS|1.0|force closes on the kindle fire. tried uninstalling but my device states that the program is not found even though the icon stays on my list of installed apps and on the app tray. if I could give it half a star I would.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is an addiction so if u get it be right than get this app it is fun and awesome
0061537969|5.0|Great read for a guy or a girl and you don't have to be a racing fan or a dog lover to enjoy it. I watched a grown man cry trying to finish this book and i have to put it down many times to stop crying long enough to be able to see. Total tear jerker but one of the best books I have read in my life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game everyone should play it. I didn't play the first one but this one is awesome.  I might have to go back and play the first one
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I tried to use it to &#34;organize&#34; my life like a lot of folks do, but it doesn't work for me, that way.  I do, however, use it to store and organize a lot of information, especially web pages that I turn in to Evernote pages for quick reference (mostly technical stuff&#34;.
B0017YDPI2|4.0|Not bad but not as good as season 1 & 2. Cant wait to get 4, 5, 6, 7 and  8
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's solitaire, what more can you say?  One of the few that is supposed to work on the Kindle Fire. And this version is free.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Brilliant...it reminds me of a saying \\"No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted\\". I can only wish that there were real people in this world like Ed Kennedy.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This games is fun and very challenging you have to be quick and you have to pay attention to detail or you will find yourself starting out all over. nice challenge.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer. Safe Haven is an amazing story of a woman that is a true survivor and that had started over with nothing. Katie's struggle with starting over and learning to trust others again is just the beginning. Buying this book was one of the best choices I've made and I'm glad I did. I encourage others to purchase this book, because you won't be disappointed.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The first 2 are the best movies, the second is the best of all.  The others are just okay, not great.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book and I think someone like my friend Hailey would like this book and she would probably be shocked by the time it takes to finish it and the more fascinating it becomes I can't wait to see what the next book is going to be like!!!!!!!!!!!
B0047WJ12K|4.0|It was a great story, well thought out, well directed, and well acted.  Moved along very nicely and was never boring.
1936608898|5.0|What an amazing, life changing book.  I've been eating clean and following Paleo for a while now.  Weight has dropped off, I sleep through the night, my cholesterol and blood pressure are perfect.  I feel amazing and people around me notice too.  I really love how It Starts With Food explains how to eat clean, why our health will be better, and lots of good ideas and recipes too!
B000I186FW|4.0|Started out Slow, but in the end nit turned out to be one of the best ive seen in a long time
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a man of science and learning, I found this book inspiring. It confirms my long-held suspicion that there are limits to human cognition and that much more potential exists beyond our physical ability to comprehend. I would have given this only four and a half stars if that were an option as I felt it ends rather abruptly. Outside of that, it was a compelling and enjoyable read.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Couldn't put this down. This book proves the strength a woman can hold amidst all the evil in the world. Especially with unconditional love on your side.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|One of her wittiest! Nice read on devices that accept the kindle ap. That is all that comes to mind for minimum words required for a comment.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Such an inspiring book! It brought hope and joy to my heart.  As a Gardner I was entranced by the magic of the seasons.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Way too glitchy my upgrades are glitched up and i cant level up. When this is fixed i will rate 5 stars
030014332X|5.0|I never thought history could be written in so interesting way. After reading the first few pages of the book,<br />I had the feeling of being brought back to the ancient time witnessing all the historical events.<br />After finished reading it, I am planning to read through it again. And this explains how amazing this book is!<br />I would recommend it to anyone who loves history and also those who hates history!
B009GEDP26|5.0|Fox adds commercials when you buy Bones episodes, so I've come to appreciate Castle's episode-only instant video.  A lot of people thought the show would falter now that Kate and Castle are together, but the writers are doing a good job.  Just wish there were more poker parties with Connelly and Patterson...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What could topple temple run for best app?  Temple Run 2!  They really outdid themselves this time!  I love it!  Hppe there will be a third!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Loved the movie, able to access it quickly.  The quality was good, however it did freeze up just before it ended so we just backed it up some and there was no problem.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|All of the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; films are excellent.  The special and visual effects are magical and brings the story to life.  The most fantastic aspect of the films is to see the actors mature on screen and become truly good friends off screen.  These films will always be a treasure and remembered by multiple generations.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the most addicting shows ever! I can't wait to watch the rest if the season! Great way to watch it online through the streaming service too!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This entire series is fantastic.  Well written, great characters...keep the episodes coming! One of many reasons to support your local PBS station!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a really good trilogy that made me get one right after the other....having said that, when I finished it I was very sad...So I guess I have to say mixed emotions.
0307352145|5.0|Even an extrovert like me can learn a lot from introverts.<br /><br />Susan Cain explores the strengths and weaknesses of introverts who find themselves in an extrovert dominant culture.  I am can identify with many of these issues.  I am married to an introvert who, like many examples in this book, has adopted some extroverted attributes in order to find success in his work.  I understand him better and can enjoy his introverted tendencies.  I now have an appreciation for introverts and how they can contribute to society in ways that extroverts cannot.<br /><br />What I like about this book is that it was not about introverts being better than extroverts or vice versa.  It was a balanced approach to a balanced issue.  I also like how the author explained the data.  It was not dry or boring like some scientific research can be.  It was fascinating and interesting.<br /><br />My disclaimer for this review is that even though this book is from a Christian publisher, this book was written from a psychologist's perspective.  There are some things that may not be in agreement with a Biblical worldview.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
1603429999|5.0|Easy to follow.  I'm using it as a workbook to learn new knitting techniques (new for me).  Lots of ideas on how to design your own patterns.  I checked this book out at our local library before ordering and thought it would be helpful to me.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Graphics are very cool,my only problem is that I don't have any more kids living in my house to show me how to play this game.Younger people will have a blast,also older people with kids to help them along.I was killed very quickly so I never really had a chance to fully appreciate the entire game,but when I got as far as I could go it was very enjoyable.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The audio and video quality is very good, the restoration went well. The new special effects are not &#34;movie&#34; quality but still very good. If you do not want the new special effects you can watch it without the enhancements.
1849464014|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1M2NNQZJIDOVK]]<br />HOW A LIVERPOOL GIRL MADE IT TO THE BAR AND BECAME ENGLAND'S FIRST WOMAN QC AND JUDGE<br /><br />Whether you're a member of the legal profession or not, you'll enjoy this recent biography from Hart Publishing, of Rose Heilbron!  You may or may not remember the name offhand, until you're reminded that Rose was appointed England's first woman Queen's Counsel in 1949 and in 1956, England's first female judge. Rose's story -- related in affectionate detail by her daughter Hilary, also a QC -- is one of a life well lived; full of incident, insight and achievement, as well as family life and fun - and yes, the more than occasional setback and disappointment.<br /><br />Don't, however, read this lively and compelling book as the story of an outstanding woman.  Read it instead as the story of an outstanding lawyer - someone who possessed the two attributes that the Victorian author William Thackery prized above all others: brains and heart.  Rose's career path, as Hilary puts it, coincided with the slow progression of women in the professions in the twentieth century.  Set against the backdrop of turbulent times, this biography is a testament to her remarkable life.<br /><br />Rose Heilbron was born in Liverpool on 19th August 1914, two weeks after the start of World War I. Her family prized education and accomplishment and she was given every opportunity to reveal her academic ability, earning a string of prizes and other scholastic achievements.  Her family also provided piano lessons, which led to Rose becoming an accomplished pianist.  She even tried her hand at acting before her eventual decision to read law at Liverpool University.<br /><br />Interestingly, it was later on in her career that Rose unknowingly provided the inspiration for another Liverpool girl to become a barrister. This was none other than Cherie Blair, who writes the Foreword of this biography. `Rose Heilbron became a role model for me,' Cherie explains, `and an example of what a Liverpool girl could achieve in the law... it was no surprise that I reckoned the law was a good place for a girl from Liverpool.'<br /><br />As fiercely as Rose supported equal opportunities for women, she was not a feminist as such and didn't consciously regard herself as a pioneer.  Her outstanding qualities, besides a sharp intellect and a compassionate viewpoint, were her love of the law and a fierce determination to learn as much as she could and do the best job she could for those she represented.<br /><br />Unafraid to stand up to judges - she was a good tactician and a fighter for her clients.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think the game is great. If you guys make another one, instead of being on a mine cart, put us on a river.
B00980IA3M|5.0|2013 marks the Bicentennial of Wagner and Verdi and what a great year to celebrate these two immortal OPERA champions. They are as different as one would wish yet both are worthy of close listening. Fortunately, the folks at EMI Decca and DG are on the ball with bargain sets of both famous darlings. This DG set blows my mind. At around TWO BUCKS per disk, we are treated to all of Wagner's operas in great performances. The key to Wagner is to simply let the marvelous sound wash over you until it works its way into your psyche like no other music can ... and what sumptuous sound and unbelievable singing are stored in these 43 CD's.<br />First of all, the production and packaging are outstanding. There are DG, Decca and EMI recordings here and I have listed these so you can read the reviews already on Amazon for these recordings. The big box is a gem with FOUR pictures of R W at various stages of his life. WOW. Great pics DG!!!  The booklet is just fine and you have access to the German-English librettos on the DG website. They download as PDF files are are eminently useful. Thanks for the great packaging!<br /><br />Here are the operas with the recording year and conductor. (You can use these to read all the reviews already written for these recordings.)<br /><br />Die Freen (DG)  rec 1972  Sir Edward Downes<br /><br />Das Liebesverbot  (DG) rec 1975  Sir Edward Downes<br /><br />Rienzi  rec 1976  (EMI)  Heinrich Hollreiser<br /><br />Der Fliegende Hollander (DG) rec 1981  Giuseppe Sinopoli<br /><br />Tannhauser  (DG)  rec 1988  Giuseppe Sinopoli<br /><br />Lohengrin  (Decca)  rec  1985-6  Sir Georg Solti<br /><br />Der Ring Des Nibelungen (DG) rec 1987-88 Metropolitan Opera  James Levine<br /><br />Tristan und Isolde  (DG)  rec 1980-82  Carlos Kleiber<br /><br />Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg (DG)  rec 1976  Eugen Jochum<br /><br />Parsifal  (Decca)  1972  Sir Georg Solti<br /><br />These are all at least FOUR star performances and many are FIVE star. The Ring cycle is the earlier one with James Morris as Wotan. (Morris is a wonderful Wotan ... far better than Terfel in my opinion.) The playing of the Metropolitan orchestra is simply beautiful and does indeed wash over you with terrific beauty. The Isolde of Margaret Price is also very special and the Carlos Kleiber recording is worth the price of the set if it were the only recording.<br />I have not had the time to listen to all these recordings but so far, all these performances are more than one could ask for. I'll try and upgrade my reviews as I savor the recordings but in the meantime, I strongly recommend the purchase of this big WAGNER box. There may be a few recordings out there which are better but these deserve repeated hearings and I have yet to be disappointed.is the earlier one with James Morris as Wotan.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is addictive I cant stop what's amazing is that usually you like the originals better but not with templerun2. I would toats recommend this to a friend.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|I have the Kindle Version of this book and am anxiously awaiting the paperback version.  In the Kindle version there are no page numbers.  So when the author refers to a page number it is not helpful.<br /><br />Fiction books are wonderful on Kindle.  This is not a book you read and then move on.  This is a book you will be referencing in different sections depending on what exercises you are working on for the day. You will not necessarily be reading left to right, hence it is best to have a physical copy.<br /><br />I plan on using old fashioned paper tabs for easy reference.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really enjoyed this book I found myself losing track of time while reading this. Always found myself saying I will just read one chapter but that never happend
B003NTSBTC|5.0|The movie is shot in an artistic fashion, and the acting is great. It's a lot easier to review movies that don't have plots without ruining them, but this isn't one of those movies.
1455504157|5.0|I  read as if Ellen and I were sitting down and Ellen was talking to me.  She looks at everyday life in whole different, realistic way.  I found the book insightful, funny, thought provoking, and even catching myself saying, &#34;you're right!&#34; or &#34;why didn't I think of that!&#34;.<br /><br />The book is very easy to read and I love how she has it laid out in chapters. Every chapter is a different topic and each chapter is a different length. Like I said, It is truly Ellen, No one could do a book like this but Ellen and do it this well.  I am so glad I bought this book.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Saw this on TV and decided to buy it for Valentine's Day gift for my husband. Very sweet and unusual movie.
081297381X|5.0|Every adult who wants to understand how our society works, how our economy works, how the entertainment industry works, how investments work, should read this book.<br /><br />A few chapters of the book require knowledge of math, but the author points this out and the book is written so you can skip them.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|Typical Sparks love story.  Knowing that the movie comes out with Josh Duhamel who even on the cover is not gray and the character clearly is described this way already threw me off.  It was a quick read, not bad but not spectacular.
0307704610|5.0|I read through the negative reviews out of curiosity.  I noticed that the negative reviews (at least the ones I found and read) were from people that did not try the methods in the book, or at least made no claim to have tried the methods.<br />There are some seeming contradictions on the surface when he is trying to keep things simple and than later goes into greater detail, but he explains the differences.<br /><br />I have tried multiple things in the book and had phenomenal results although I did not expect to.  My wife even did the diet with me and had great success with that as well.<br /><br />I followed his muscle building techniques as well and had such good results that I was accused multiple times of using roids, but it probably helped that I have the genetics for muscle building already.<br /><br />If you have self discipline and want to follow his methods it is a good buy.  (He does seem very egotistical though)
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Bravo!!! I believe that this is a great movie and that Disney did a very good job in making it!
034580404X|4.0|Let me preface this by saying Romance novels are not typically my style nor am I very fond of Rom-Coms of any sort.  With that being said, the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy kept me intrigued, and I found myself being caught up in the storyline every time I opened the book.  Don't base your judgement of this series by book 1. At first I thought it was the lamest thing I could have possibly picked up.  The writer is definitely repetitious, and I thought I might vomit if Ana \\"looked up through her lashes\\" or said \\"Oh jeez\\" one more time.  I barely made it through the first book but once I got to the end, I was drawn into the second book.  Yes there are plenty of steamy hot and sometimes cringe-worthy scenes and a whole lot of cheese.  However, pushing that aside, the book was inspirational and moral.  It's a sweet story about unconditional love and overcoming your past, and it's very easy to get swept away in the image you hold of Christian.  Everything I felt about the characters in the first book changed as I contined reading the other two.  It's definitely worth your time to see what the hype is all about, and I really think if you are looking for something to occupy and entertain you, you will enjoy this series.  It would be interesting to read the same books from Christian's point-of-view.  Perhaps and new project for E.L. James?
B005CM1ILQ|2.0|Unfortunately this film does not hold up after 25 years.<br /><br />I just could never get into the 'killer doll' genre and take it seriously.  Diff'rent strokes for different folks i guess.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS Season 10 as all the other seasons is full of surprises, fun and intrigue. Each cast member has thier own little niche that adds to the show. AWESOME!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's a little like &#34;Home Alone&#34; - totally impossible but entertaining.  I guess I expected something more real that could actually occur in today's society.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I keep this DVD on hand for when I want to squeeze a workout in but I don't have time to get to the gym. It's definitely a fast-paced workout. I haven't made it past the first level yet, and I still can feel my muscles burning afterward.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is so annoying because that fat ugly inspector dude has gotten on my last nerve. When you run and tumbel over he blows his stupid whistle and gets so close to you that you can hardly see your self and you sometimes die.
0307951529|4.0|Haven't finished reading it yet, but good so far. When I finish it, I'll come back and give a further, more comprehensive review.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I love Moon Phase Pro.  It is easy to use, has lots of info, and the beautiful graphics.  I'm very interested in the moon, and this app is very complete and enjoyable to use.

B008FRFN7A|1.0|I could never get this app to work. It sounded like a great app. in the description. I ended up deleting it.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|This movie was fun, entertaining, and suspenseful. It is definitly worth watching as it keeps you guessing the whole time.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|Please add an eraser choice where you can select the eraser and erase things without deleting the whole word like what the backspace button does. But over all I love the app keep up the good work!
B00170GXQ2|1.0|After reading the book &#34;Dracula&#34; by Braum Stoker, I thought it would be a lot of fun to watch a movie depiction of the book. After reading various reviews of the numerous Dracula movies, it seemed that this version was supposudly the &#34;most accurate&#34; to the book. If that is in fact true, than I can't imagine how terrible the other dracula movies are. There are certain parts of the movie that do seem to try and follow the book, but then there are bizzare additions that hardly make sense other than to sensualize and sexualize the story as it was originally written. I might have been a slightly better watching if I wasn't expecting it to roughly follow the book. Then again, maybe not.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson's films. Rushmore is one of my all-time favorites. I also really liked Life Aquatic, though I think it is considered by many to be his least interesting effort. Moonrise Kingdom was nice, and charming, and mostly true to his vision, but I found it to be a little too self-conscious and perhaps a tiny bit overwrought.<br /><br />Also, Amazon's streaming service seemed a bit wonky on the day I watched it. Perhaps it was my Roku. Hard to say exactly. (No stars were deducted for this aspect)
