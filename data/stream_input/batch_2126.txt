B0083SBJXS|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said...<br /><br />great character chemistry, Joss Whedon did a great job of highlighting each hero and not making one out shine the other. Good story. Good golly Ms. Johansson. Just all around fun movie.<br /><br />You definitely want to watch the commentary if you are a commentary and/or Joss Whedon Fan.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next installment.
B007SGM084|4.0|I had to read what all the hype was about, but no-one had told me how it ended.  I was pleasantly surprised.

1451627289|5.0|I loved King for his bone chilling horror stories from the beginning. Now I admire his diversity with 11/22/63 ! So different and hopeful from his previous books. To tell you the truth, I was getting sick of all his horror. This book still has the TWISTS, AT THE END ! You have to read it ,I was shocked and I will never tell !

B005HSG3TC|3.0|What can I say, it does the job and is OK. It covers and protects the Kindle Fire from damage
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Another interesting read by Jodi Picoult. It took me back to my own teen years and the thought process of a young adult. Jodi did a great job of explaining how intertwined these 2 teens' lives were, to the extent they felt each others physical & emotional pain. However, despite the self-centered nature of this age, I wasn't convinced that with their level of intelligence, at least one of them wouldn't have been able to reason out that Emily could have received counselling and possibly medication to help her overcome her depression and suicidal feelings, instead of drawing the conclusion that suicide was Emily's only option to end her pain (particularly since Chris had received some counselling of his own and had benefitted, even though he was skeptical and resistant at first). In addition, even though I don't need every book to tie everything together in a neat package at the end of the story, being a parent myself, I would like to have felt some closure with this story. I'm sure it was intentional on Jodi's part, but I couldn't decide why Emily felt so hopeless that she couldn't go on. Was it because she'd been molested at age 9, suppressed that memory and then had it come to light when she became sexually active with Chris? Was it because she loved Chris so much, she felt as though she was half of his whole and couldn't live without him, but she often felt their relationship seemed incest-like, since they'd basically been raised together and yet, when she got pregnant, couldn't endure the thought of a \\"forever\\" with him, for that very reason? This story brings the characters to life so well, I felt emotionally invested enough to want an answer to the question,\\"why?\\" Since Emily could not seem to verbally articulate her reasons to Chris while she was alive, perhaps she was able to explain it in her diary, leaving me to wonder if Emily's mother got answers when she found the diary. As a parent, I can only imagine the grief felt by the parents and their need to havea reason for this tragedy, with someone to blame. Saying that, they knew Chris since the day he was born, lived next door to his family and helped raise him as their own child. Emily's mother, Melanie, found some answers (possibly all?) in Emily's diary (the full contents were not shared with us) How could Melanie then burn the diary & let Chris take the blame for murdering Emily?

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put this one down! Wonderfully written story told from the point of view of two strong but very different women in the South. It evokes strong emotions about slavery and gender roles during this time period. Definitely a tear jerker!

1609611543|2.0|Let me say this right off the bat.  This is a fascinating topic and one that deserves much consideration.  I haven't purchased the book yet but am thinking seriously about it.  I mean why not?  I could stand to lose a few pounds.....well more than a few, but who's counting??  LOL  Keep the rubber side down and the shiny side up, and as always.....I'll see YOU at Sturgis.  What do yinz think of Weight Watchers?  My wife's on it, however she still needs to lose a good 40 pounds or so.  She's a heck of a lady, but a little on the chubbette side.  I still love her, don't get me wrong but let's face it....40 lbs is 40 lbs.  Am I right or am I right??  So, Happy Valentines day to you all. I'm off to Brueggars for a bite to eat.

1400067936|2.0|Wow, it's not that good a book.  Kind of like what you and I, with a science background and with the help of Google, could write.  Mostly personal aggrandizement.  Tries to be like John Allen Paulos but without his IQ.  Two stars.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I keep looking for games like this one, now that it's finished.  Good story, great play,  and loads of hints if you only play causally.  And the creepy doll twist is perfect!!!  Loved this game!
B001KZG99A|5.0|I honestly never saw or read anything about Ironman before this movie. On the other hand, my hubby has been a comic fan for many years. We both loved this movie. Robert Downey Jr puts in a cheeky performance as Tony Stark; great story, great cast, and the production, cinematography, music score, etc. are all superb.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book and cant wait to c the movie. I will willrecamed this book to all my friends and family
B00913DPW2|4.0|I chose a 5 star because the game is just so great. We're talking graphics, sound effects, the concept, everything.<br /><br />I very much like the idea of moths providing hints (is there something about moths? Mothman prophecies?) I don't know, but that's neat.<br />Collecting the puzzle pieces along the way is also something incredible.<br /><br />If there's one or two things I do not like, they would be in trying to crack the safe - the one on the wall - I see tiny little numbers written on the frame around it, but if there are numbers on the dial, they're too small to see and I have a feeling there may be something to this. I've done everything either intuitively or via the hints to crack it with no luck.<br /><br />There's a couple of other areas where the game seems to grind, and I wonder if the detail is just so specific and small that it's difficult to see. I started playing this on my Smartphone, but then switched to my tablet to play it.<br /><br />Highly recommend this, and can't wait to play the sequel, once I get this figured out! Lots of fun!<br />-------------<br />Well, I've edited this as of a week or so later. I moved it down for the moment from 5 to 4 stars and here's why. I had to end up using the cheat/walkthrough for a few reasons. One, I thought I was doing the wolfpack thing correctly, but couldn't crack it, but I was definitely doing the safe thing correctly, and despite that it would NOT open! I had to put on skip puzzle mode to bypass it. That's a definite flaw in the game! There was another item, too, like this, where I was doing it correctly, but it would not work.<br /><br />But here's some other flaws, and I really don't understand them, especially after reading the walkthrough. According to it, there's no particular order in which to get the potion items.<br />I've completed 94 or 95 of the 99 puzzle pieces, and the two items for which there are still pieces the game WILL NOT let me get! I can't get these two items. The walkthrough says what and where they are and since the beginning of the game, even before consulting the walkthrough, I tried to get these two items (mushroom, tea bag). The game simply will not let me. That's disappointing, otherwise I'm almost finished with it.<br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />I've got the necessary last receptacle with 8 of the 10 items in it. But can't get these last two.<br />Now, also, I was NOT able to get the antler UNTIL I got the final puzzle piece for it. Surely that is not what's holding it up here is it? As I've gotten other items for which I don't have all the pieces yet.<br />Please advise.<br />Thanks,<br />B P
B006KSAPV0|5.0|The Skin I Live In is a really interesting departure from Almodovar's usual emotional, human-interest story films, of which my favorite is Talk To Her.  It's not quite a horror movie, but it's close.  As other reviewers have noted, knowing any more than the very barest bones of the story will spoil it for you, so I'm not saying much more than it's about a doctor whose wife was badly burned in a car accident and who is working on a new type of skin.  His laboratory is in his home, and in addition to his skin project, he has a young female patient under observation.  Who she is and why she's there is a mystery for a while.  I found it a little slow and confusing at the beginning, but once it got going, I was hooked and it kept my interest throughout.  I'd compare this movie to Frankenstein, Freaks, and the Human Centipede, with a little David Lynch thrown in. It's well-acted, especially by Antonio Banderas and Marisa Paredes.  Almodovar's films are always thought-provoking; this one goes a little farther.  See it with other people - I guarantee you'll be talking about it all night.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|This movie has a little bit of everything and should appeal to all ages. The tent scene is a classic.
B005LAII08|5.0|I absolutely love Brave and pretty much all Pixar movies. I saw it in the theater and did not hesitate to get the blu-ray. But one of the reasons I got the Ultimate Collector's Edition was for the digital copy so I can watch it when I travel, but my box did not come with the code to redeem my digital copy. Where the Disney code should have been was just blank. I called Disney customer support and was just blown away by how helpful they were. Didn't have to wait, the lady who answered spoke in an uber friendly Disney voice and just went out of her way to help me. I'm still in awe.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Very good book. Nicholas Sparks always has a way of keeping you interested and wanting to read more.<br />Not the ending I expected.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|As with the notebook, I had no trouble getting sucked into this book and putting  myself into Katie's shoes. Excited for the movie but bummed already to see some major changes from the book to the film. No doubt the book is hands down better than the movie without even seeing it.

015670160X|2.0|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? This Guy. I'm probably going to have to turn in my English Lit Major membership card over this, but man. I slogged through this, and didn't enjoy it at all. I'm not sure when I was last so bored by a book whose core concept intrigued me so much. Orlando is virtually immortal, changes gender mid-book, has a group of core household personnel who also seem to be immortal. The story starts in Elizabethan times and moves to the early 1900's. So much of that is fodder for great storytelling, not to mention the ability to comment on societal norms, gender reversals, etc. I won't deny that Woolf manages to pack a lot of social commentary into the book. I won't deny that she experiments with form in a way that makes most students and professors of English literature salivate. But in a book that is over 300 pages long ... nothing happens! Sure, there's the sudden deep freeze and equally sudden thaw of England that provides a momentary rush, but other than that, the protagonist spends pretty much the entire book sitting around depressed over the slights he receives from a woman, a fellow poet, and other varied personalities. I'll say it again: I was bored. And based on my reaction to this, which is supposed to be the most accessible of Woolf's works ... I can honestly say I don't think I'll be trying to read anything else by her.<br /><br />Also, It is interesting to me that when I looked on Amazon, BN and Goodreads, none of the product descriptions I read attempt to describe the plot of ORLANDO. These are product descriptions now, not reader reviews. They all talk about how original and influential the book is and what a great movie Tilda Swinton was in a few years back. But none of them even attempt to describe the plot beyond what's quoted in the premise above. Maybe I just looked in the wrong place, or maybe it's just become accepted that ORLANDO is one of those things you read because \\"it's a classic.\\"

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is a wonderful book that anybody can relate to. Young or old. I highly recommended it for someone who wants to get lost in a book.

1401937519|5.0|Dying to Be Me by Anita Moorjani, Hay House, 2012, 206 ff.<br /><br />Here is an inspiration life story of, as the subtitle tells, a journey from cancer to near death to true healing. As I read it I was reminded of similar OBE or NDE experiences recounted by Nanci Danison and Eben Alexander. It is a fact that, for reasons conventional medicine cannot explain, some people do occasionally experience spontaneous remission from even the most terrible diseases, like cancer. Such cases are rare and when they do occur they often involve some communion with the spirit world, either through formal religion or through the mystical spirituality of meditative trances.<br /><br />The author was brought up as an orthodox Hindu, with all the restrictions as western minds would see it for her fulfilment as an independent woman. Her culture forbade a single unmarried woman from moving away from home and the less well educated a woman was, the more desirable and accommodating she would be as a potential wife. This emotional anguish of fighting against the conventions of her parents and her religion were probably the provocative factors in inducing cancer in Anita's body. She had conventional treatment for four years but then, just as her body was shutting down from the onslaught, she had a near-death experience which transformed her life and which she describes here.<br /><br />The author is clearly very humble in her description and, as a former corporate employee, is not in a position to describe events in any sort of medical jargon. If anyone still doubts the reality of this spiritual realm after working through this experience with the author - and reading other books of NDE experiences - then I fear you will have to wait until you experience the spiritual domain for yourself.<br /><br />Consciousness Beyond Life: The Science of the Near-Death Experience<br />Backwards: Returning to Our Source for Answers<br />Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think it`s a well created game for all people who loves horses :)i`ll give it 5 stars :D<br /><br />a very good game XD
B004CLYKLI|3.0|Overrated, over the top. Tries to make her insanity a joke. Look forward to reading The Memoirs of the Tiger Cubs.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have plade this game for hours! love it simple scroll game but still lots of fun! its also free! the reason it is free is because if you wish to unlock everything you need to pay for coins or you can collect them by playing the game :)
B004HD61KE|4.0|From the beginning of the story I was definitely intrigued.  As the story progressed, I became &#34;hooked&#34; with the possible connection between the Colony and the History of the United States.  This novel moved along nicely and certainly kept my interest.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great suspense, romance and thrills! This is a quality show that most of the family can enjoy! I can't wait for more!
B008D30K7E|5.0|One of the best written books I've read for some time.Story a bit far fetched but full of information .Reminded me of past world figures and events. Excellent!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game!! Would recommend this game to others, it's a upgrade to the conventional solitaire!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very different thriller. It was a mind game all the way through and definately kept you guessing:) I kept having to put the book down in order to calm down. It was one of those books you wanted to keep going on with but I had to take breaks.<br />I really enjoyed it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is your conventional solitaire game, but still is a lot of fun to play.  Would like to be able to bypass the pop-up ad's, actually not having them would be nice, instead of a new one popping up everytime I start a new game! The feature is annoying!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Kept watching until there was nothing left to watch.  Couldn't wait until I got the next one!  It was the best
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I really thought this movie was almost great, and it was definitely one of the best comic book/super hero movies to come along in a long time.  To me, it worked on every level, but it was just too much anecdote and montage - it could have used more story development.  Overall, one I've already seen multiple times and plan on watching more.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Truly not the kind of movie I expected!! That was a good thing!! Loved it!!! I think it was a role I had never seen Denzel do before, so it was a good change and showed how versatile he us as an actor.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Well made and beautifully done, very educational as well as trippy. Good for hi def tv sets. A good buy!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Good movie, but nothing to brag about. It's a fun spin with history involved. I bought it for those moods where you want to be entertained with action and a little bit of fantasy/fact involved.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I got it to help fill in some of the gaps I had after hearing other references to the short stories contained within. It helped fill in some of the gaps, and provides a great way to have a quick read. Unfortunately, there weren't enough short stories in the book. But that's probably biased since I'm a voracious reader.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|...but in the same way that the Beatles were pop. Indeed, the song \\"Bluish\\" is a pretty clearly deliberate reference (\\"you don't look bluish\\")... Think of the Beatles at their most experimental... then imagine giving them even *more* acid, & letting them just run wild for 20 years. Something like this album would probably result.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is my favorite Daniel Craig - Bond movie by far, and one of my favorite Bond movies period. It's a perfect callback to previous Bond films through nostalgic canon references, but also stabilizing and establishing the future of the franchise through brilliant storytelling.<br /><br />The cinematography is absolutely stunning and it's a beautiful film. Hopefully Roger Deakins finally wins his long deserved Oscar for this great movie.<br /><br />The digital transfer is fantastic and the colors look great on Blu-ray. The special features are great for some behind the scenes exploration of the making of the film.<br /><br />Bond fans can enjoy the fact that this installment of the franchise is one of the best in it's 50 year run.
0307341577|3.0|Readers familiar with Flynn will recognize the formula from her other books: unlikeable characters put into terrible situations.  Unlike Sharp Objects, the plot is a little predictable.  But the alternating points of view will keep readers anxiously turning pages in an attempt to get to the satisfying conclusion.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|An excellent movie in all formats. Low price and and high value! Blu-ray its awesome with extras and durable anti scratch.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Great for FAOTD.  Running well on Galaxy tab, like the option of no timer, nice that there's a hint available on the scenes, like the story so far.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is just OK.  I think it was totally over rated.  Not exactly a literary work of art.  People wanted to read it for the sex and not the story
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I have already a similar case for another kindle however, this was priced much better and does the trick. I would recommend the product.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm a pretty avid gamer and have used both Razor and Logitech mice. After my last one broke, I started browsing for a replacement expecting to pay around $80 for a mouse before stumbling onto this one. After using it for a bit, I can say that I am very happy I picked this over the other available choices. I did purchase it on sale for $39.99, but would have dropped the $59.99 it normally is without hesitation.<br /><br />Buttons: Button resistance is about average; not too sensitive and not too resistant. Thumb buttons are very easy to distinguish by touch since the middle one has a different surface than the other two.<br /><br />Scroll: A bit more resistant than my last mouse (G9X) and those that like to scroll effortlessly may find this not to their liking. Once I'm use to it, I probably won't even give it a second thought.<br /><br />Design: Overall a great design. I like the shape of it as my hand naturally rests like this when using a mouse, and the aesthetics are solid as well.<br /><br />Software: You need to download this from their site which is not a big deal and something you should always do anyway to get the latest version. Software has all the normal adjustments with some added bonuses like being able to change the color of the palm light.<br /><br />Price: You really can't beat this price for all the features this mouse has. Even at the normal price of $59.99, this is a better buy than many of the other gaming mice out there with even less features.<br /><br />Weight: Worth mentioning, but it is on the lighter side as gaming mice go. It does have weights to offset this, but I don't find this a big deal for my preferences.<br /><br />Cord: You can tell the cord was made with quality. It's not super stiff but still has enough give and shape expected from a high-end gaming mouse.

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I will never look at a snowman the same way after reading this terrific, suspenseful mystery/thriller. Oslo detective Harry Hole is on the hunt for a serial killer that, chillingly, leaves a snowman in the yard of their victims. The book starts with a deliciously creepy opening scene and the tension increases from there with several misdirections and red herrings, and builds into an almost unbearably intense climax. It is flawlessly written,and Harry Hole is a fascinating character. Nesbo delivers the goods and honestly, you cannot ask for more out of a thriller than what The Snowman provides.<br /><br />  I have been reading the Harry Hole series of mysteries in order. Redbreast and Nemesis were very solid, the Devil's Star was great, and the Redeemer was very good. The Snowman is the best yet.

B004UG7RQ0|1.0|I know this unit doesn't work for VW cars, but I tried it on my 2006 Acura RL with a USA Spec iPhone/iPod add on unit, the iPhone works great, with the new lightning adapter (39.99 model) but when I tried to use an Android phone with this adapter it just didn't work, no sound. I am not sure if the output is analog or digital, and that might be the problem, maybe this unit only works with analog sound, but it still did not work.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Bought it to fill me in on the series. Classic. Well written, easy to read, short action packed chapters. Never a boring moment. If you haven't read this yet, I urge you to do so immediately.<br /><br />Compared to reading Lord of the Rings, I'd say this is prime fantasy storytelling without the tediousness of long self-indulgent whimsical narratives.<br /><br />Of course, there is none of the Poetry of Tolkein's language, but ultimately this is a book written to the exacting modern standards of contemporary fiction in the 21st century.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game, I am addicted! Can't stop playing. My 5 year old and I fight for the tablet to play this game.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|On their last night in Rome, Alba (Elena Anaya) and Natasha (Natasha Yarovenko) meet at a bar; talk of Russia and Spain and walk the cobblestone streets until they end up at Alba's hotel. Natasha openly states that she has never come back to a woman's hotel room before. Unsure at first, she eventually comes under the spell of Alba's charms. From that point on, the women rarely don any clothes at all; an occasional robe or sheet is all that separates them for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />The women initially hide their real identities weaving false tales of love, life and their past. As they become closer physically, making love over and over again, the stories gradually become closer to the truth and their inhibitions are stripped bare. Natasha is meeting her fiancé and is to be married within a week; Alba on the other hand has run away from a troubled relationship with her partner and the grief that has separated them. As the women navigate the terrain of truth and lies, they discover what hides beneath the surface and in doing so change their lives forever. Over breakfast on the terrace surrounded by the beauty of Rome, they talk of what they would do if they could be together.  After this intense night of passion, can Alba and Natasha really part?<br /><br />Set almost entirely in a hotel room full of old world charm, the sensuously real love making scenes are depicted in lush hues as deep as the artwork that hangs on the walls. Writer-director Julio Medem (Sex & Lucia) has brought to the screen a stunning, if unconventional film.  There is so much to relish - the beautiful women, gorgeous views of Rome or the voyeuristic pleasure in watching these two women make love all night long.<br /><br />Chris Alderson<br />Author of the 2012 & 2013 Lesbian Film Guide

B004BJMEO6|4.0|Do you believe it is possible to find your soulmate? At an adoption information session out lesbian writer, Peyton (Tracy Dinwiddle) meets Pastor's wife and photographer Elena (Necar Zadegan) and they exchange business cards. When Peyton asks Elena to collaborate on a project with her, their friendship begins. As they share information about their lives and experiences, the attraction begins to grow. During a photo shoot for Peyton's new author image, the tension mounts to nearly the breaking point. Although Elena doesn't believe that she is a lesbian, she does find herself irresistibly attracted to Peyton. When Elena shows up at Peyton's front door, she has one thing on her mind and the viewer is treated to a gloriously long make out session, including the longest screen kiss (3.5 minutes) in cinema history. After one taste of lesbian love, Elena is smitten and what started as a \\"crush\\" now advances quickly into a full-blown affair with exquisitely sensual love making scenes. Their love however, becomes so intense that Elena is unable to contain it any longer and she must choose between her husband and the woman she has fallen in love with.<br /><br />Writer/director Nicole Conn creates a wonderfully moving portrait of a woman caught in a loveless marriage who falls deeply in love with another woman. The film is well paced, capturing the early days of the women's attraction and all the excitement, nervousness and longing that goes along with it. The chemistry between Peyton and Elena is superb; the sexual tension virtually crackles on the screen.<br /><br />Chris Alderson<br />Author of the 2012 & 2013 Lesbian Film Guide
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Picked this out for a road trip, I could not stop reading once I started. I like how things will tie together in the the next few chapters so you feel the flow of the story and how it is all conected.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Bought this CD a couple of days ago and have listened to it everyday since!  There is only one other singer that moves me as much as Josh Groban, but sad to say he is gone.  This album is superb!  ALL the songs make me want to roll up my windows and sing along!( I do this for the benefit of other people as I sing way off key). BUY this CD. You will not regret it. If you're not a fan (Gorbanite) you will become one. The man has a voice like no other. He is amazing!
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Good game, but for me, it got hard quick. Would suggest to anyone but people who can't take a challenge.

B005ETA5K2|5.0|Buy this.  Range is what is expected and cost is right on.  Price is one month of isp service and range is great.  Wifi will become universal because of advertising profit.  ISP industry has to hate this product.
B0039PPW60|2.0|Seems that I didn't get lucky when I bought this mixer.  Perhaps I got what I paid for.  When I hooked this up to my PAs I was at first impressed, then I started playing around and trying different inputs.  The 2-track inputs sounded great when I played it off my computer.  Plugging into 7/8, it sounded completely different with the EQ normalized.  I had to try a bunch of times to make sure what I was hearing was true, and it was, sounded like a wet rag on 7/8, and very clean on 2-track.  I also found that 5/6 had a dirty fader and if I touched the fader one of the channels cut out completely, 5/6 still was muffled also.  The VU level was completely non-operational on any input except the 2-track, no matter what I put into the inputs.  This was a brand new mixer from Amazon.<br /><br />I did like that rack mount came with the box instead of costing an additional $40.<br /><br />So I will join the ranks of returns for this product and buy a Yamaha instead.  My thoughts are if a brand new mixer has these problems (and I seem like not the only one) how will it be holding up to being traveled with over the next couple years.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|In the light style of Riordan, which mixes very appropriately our contemporary teenagers' culture and Greek/Roman mythology, the quest goes through increased hardships and comes a real 'cliffhanger' final scene, that lets us waiting impatiently for the next book in the series.<br /><br />If pre-orders for the next book where already being accepted I surely would be giving my money to Amazon right now...

B004NOH9LC|2.0|I did not get very far in this movie before there was profanity. I try my best to watch movies that are family and value friendly. Like I stated above...I don't think I got more than five or ten minutes before it started, so I stopped it and will not watch it again.

B0056TYT66|5.0|I was a bit concerned that this wouldn't work on my old gigabyte mother board - I wanted to use an SSD as a boot disk and all my SATA connections were taken. This works great in a PCIe 2.0 Slot - gives SATA III speed and the bios saw it as a boot drive (I did have to disable the other hard drives in my Bios temporarily-And change the drive letters using Acronis Disk Director so that &#34;C:&#34; was unused, to get it to be recognized as C drive.) Really very simple to install

B0098460O4|5.0|I just finished listening to this wonderful CD.  You will not be disappointed.  They may not have won on Britan's Got Talent, however, thanks to someone (not sure if it was Simon) we have their great voices and talent to listen too.  Their choice of songs is fantasic and the clarity of their voices supurb!  Well worth purchasing and giving as a gift.

B009FZFONO|4.0|For a Premier I would expect more, but as this was mid-season, it is understandable not to out-do the finale or the next season premier......<br /><br />This episode started off big and then became very anti-climactic.... also, the reactions everyone had when Rick started hallucinating about Lori and flipping out were too mellow and out of character as compared to everything else this group has been to
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Love Stephen King novels. He is such a great author. Novels are spellbinding. Has proved that he's not just a thriller/horror author. Recommend to all Stephen King fans.

B009RI4FRU|4.0|I like those &#34;off the beaten path&#34;type movies. and Moonrise Kingdom fits that bill. I takes place in the early 1960s on a small island that is known for being a summer resort. A 13 year old boy scout and  a 13 year old girl come up missing. it does not take long to figure these two kids have run away together. being on a island they do not have too many places they can hide. both kids are misunderstood, a bit on the eccentric side. neither the boy or girl have other friends. they actually meet a year earlier when the boy was on the island with his boy scout troup{actually they are called by a different name but a lot like boy scouts}and they make arrangements to meet the next summer. a lot of the other character have their own &#34;quirks&#34; this comes together well with fine child and adult actors. a fun movie to watch.
B003X897D2|5.0|You can't have a jazz collection and not have this album. Some people don't like Coltrane because they complain he plays too many notes. To them I say, every note on this album is worth hearing.
B001G8JUN8|5.0|Brothers in Arms is arguably Dire Straits' best album. It saw a great departure from their earlier albums, with a more poppy rhythm, where this album focused much more on ambient tone and slow, but rich riffs by Mark Knopler. It is a must own for any Dire Straits fans out there.<br />The vinyl edition has clearly better sound quality than cd and mp3. It is a collector's item for those of who enjoy the possession and value of this masterpiece.

B00005LR40|5.0|Bad oversaw the prominence of Michael Jackson into the 1990s, with its innovative, and catchy beats that define much of the musical aspect of this album. Bad is also one of the more approachable album to a general audience with versatile vocal by MJ and rich electronic beats.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is the best package of The Dark Knight Rises you can find out there. The combo pack includes everything a Batman fan can ever think of owning.

B0016492BW|5.0|Great movie. I could seriously watch it everyday. If you do not buy this movie I will be forced to say... &#34;Ni !!!!!&#34;
B00821OX98|1.0|After watching great shows like, the new BattleStar Gallactica and Lost, I thought that TV had somehow turned a corner and that the bar had been set to higher standards.  Unfortunately, Fallen Skies is yet another obnoxious insult served up by team Cheezburg.  The acting is utterly atrocious and the dialogue like a grade F soap opera.  Every other scene contains a sappy, melodramatic, over played, emotional meltdown.  Hey folks, how about those perfect post apocalyptic hairdos!  The art direction looks like they just copied District 9 and there's so many ridiculous aspects to the scenes that this should most assuredly grate on your intelligence.  How about the scene where they run a generator in a small hospital room.  Ever hear of carbon monoxide?!  Or where an alien craft, flying far away and fast, is shot down from a shoulder-fired unguided rocket?  Really?!  This is science fiction as a background.  Wow, what an inventive idea for a series...  aliens invade and enslave earth but the humans fight back.  Meanwhile the real planet earth is under attack from all sorts of environmental atrocity.  Perhaps TV is the alien invader.
B0013O123Q|1.0|Disgusting scenes in this movie. If you have a weak stomach, I wouldn't purchase this film. It will disturb you.

0765325950|4.0|Good end to a long series. Brandon Sanderson did a great job finishing of Robert Jordans series.<br /><br />I was upset that it was not immediately available as an E-Book. It's not like the Kindle version is significantly cheaper.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It i sooo amazing. The first time I played it i played on hard and got 6 / 8 pages. PS your only tactic is do not turn around!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|this is cheap which is fine for only a few bucks figured it would be great to have but the problem is most everyone has a case on the iPhone and the design of this makes it fit tight to the phone with out the case. So sort of a pain.You have to peel off your case to use.
B00992CF6W|4.0|All they need to do is tell u how to upgrade it other then that by all means get it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Show, all seasons are worth watching. Much like the movie Gosford Park  directed by Robert Altman without the comedy.

B000FC2L1E|4.0|I am in the process of rereading the Outlander series. I  am finding things I missed the first time and am enjoying them more the second time.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the last in a phenomenal trilogy about a young women who had been used as,a pawn between a government organization and a sadistic psychiatrist to support illegal activities by a secret section of the Swedish government similar to our homeland security agency. The tension and suspense is riveting. The ending is surprising and will not let you put it down until you have read the last page.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Back in 2008, Bay Area Thrash legends Testament returned with there critically acclaimed comeback album \\"The Formation of Damnation\\", and I absolutely loved it, and I thought there were was no way that they were going to top it. Now we fast forward to 2012, Testament have once again returned with their newly highly anticipated album \\"Dark Roots of Earth\\", and there is no question that these guys are back, and they are definately better than ever. There is not one single word how much I really love this album. Ever since I first bought it last year, I have listened to it constantly almost everyday, practically resulting in becoming my favorite metal album of 2012. It is an absolute pure thrash metal masterpiece from beginning to end, with plenty of variety to keep the listener amazed and satisfied throughout from catchy, sonic thrashing cuts such as \\"True American Hate\\", \\"Rise Up\\", \\"Native Blood\\", and \\"Man Kills Mankind\\", to slower yet powerful cuts like the title track and the ballad \\"Cold Embrace\\", and the catchy, groovy \\"Throne of Thorns\\". The production courtesy of legendary metal producer Andy Sneap is just sharp, razor like, and flawless. The guy just never ceases to delight and amaze me with his production work.<br /><br />Another thing I would like to add if I may, is that \\"Dark Roots of Earth\\" also marks the return of drummer Gene Hoglan after making his debut with the band on their 1997 release \\"Demonic\\". His drumming on here is just dare I say flawless and intricate, as he grooves and thrashes with ease throughout with perfectly timed and intricate fills, and he even adds some twisted, pummeling blast beats to the mix on two of the album's most aggressive tracks such as \\"True American Hate\\" and \\"Native Blood\\". The bass tone of bassist Greg Christian is just excellent on here, and it's perhaps the best tone that he's ever had in a long time in my honest opinion, be sure to check out the opening bass riff in \\"A Day in the Death\\" for a good example. The guitars of Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson have always been a huge, major key to Testament's arsenal. These guys are no doubt one of thrash metal's most creative, talented, and powerful guitar duos, and they both have definately proven that for a long time, and they continue to do so, and this album is indeed proof. The riffs on here are just heavy, bruising, monstrous, and intense, almost the size of a wild, rampaging elephant, and the solos are just simply put ear shredding, face melting, and mindblowing. And of course topping all of that are the incredible vocal abilities of singer Chuck Billy as he utilizes his spectrum of vocal talents throughout here, going for the clean singing, and of course his recognizable throaty screams and shouts, and death metal like growls.<br /><br />The highlights:<br /><br />The band wastes absolutely no time bursting the doors wide open on the catchy, headbanging opening track \\"Rise Up\\" which boasts speaker shredding thrash riffs, straight up pounding drums, a catchy shout along chorus, and an awesome solo to boot. The following track \\"Native Blood\\" which is another one of my favorites on here is highlighted by more of Gene's awesome drumwork including some blast beasts during the chorus, as well as more massive, scorching riffs and blistering solos, meanwhile the title track slows things down a bit, yet it's still catchy and heavy with memorable vocals from Chuck, and some awesome melodic soloing. Next up, we head for the fourth track \\"True American Hate\\" which is not only the most aggressive and fastest song, but also the best song on the album hands down IMO. This song is a pure heart pounding thrash fest that features fast, relentless, hammering drums, savage fiery riffing, aggressive vocals, an awesomely catchy chorus with some blast beats backing it up, and of course of a series of wickedly epic, ear shredding, trail blazing, and face melting solos as well. According to an article that I read about the band in Decibel Magazine, the song is not about Americans hating, but actually about Americans' being hated. For instance, if you turn on the news and see a lot of young kids over in the Middle East with guns, rifles, and torches and their parents are cheering and rooting them on as they're burning the American Flag. When you see those people that are being raised to hate, it really makes you think about what kind of adults are those kids going to be like growing up in the future.<br /><br />The fifth track \\"A Day in the Death\\" is an awesome mid paced headbanger that features an awesome opening bass riff by Greg, as well as an awesome, vaguely Egyptian-themed guitar solo by Alex, and more great vocals from Chuck, meanwhile \\"Cold Embrace\\" is an excellent ballad and another highlight on the album that has an excellent blend of acoustic and electric guitars, some excellent clean singing vocals from Chuck, and some more great melodic soloing. Track seven \\"Man Kills Mankind\\" is another awesome headbanger, while the following track \\"Throne of Thorns\\" is a catchy, groovy, mid paced headbanger that features a great groovy drum beat, some catchy, memorable vocal work from Chuck, as well as catchy, groove driven guitar riffs, and another awesome solo section, and of course the closing track \\"Last Stand For Independence\\" shows the guys closing out the album in true Testament fashion with jagged, chugging riffs, some nice double bass chops, great melodic leadwork, and awesome vocals to boot.<br /><br />As an added bonus, for those who own the special edition version like I do myself, we're also treated with three bonus covers of Queen's \\"Dragon Attack\\", Scorpions \\"Animal Magnetism\\", and Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\", as well as an extended version of \\"Throne of Thorns\\", and of course we also have a bonus DVD that features a 29 minute documentary on the making of the album, along with a 9 minute \\"Gear Tour\\" with Alex and Eric, and a 20 minute live concert featuring four of the band's classic songs being performed live.<br /><br />All in all, this album is a true and pure thrash metal masterpiece that shows Testament at the height of their talents and powers, and it proves that they can still fly the flag for thrash metal along with Overkill, Exodus, Slayer, and Megadeth, and do it better and heavier than any new bands today can do it. If you thought that Testament couldn't top \\"The Formation of Damnation\\", then be seriously prepared to be blown away by \\"Dark Roots of Earth\\"...Buy this album now!!!<br /><br />HORNS UP!!!he song is not about Americans hating, but actually about Americans' being hated.

B0047WJ12K|4.0|Christopher Nolan's Inception is not a film that can be enjoyed by a moviegoer with anything short of a rock solid attention span. With a multitude of \\"real\\" and \\"fake\\" settings and relationships, getting out of your seat for just five minutes for a trip to the bathroom will probably result in the viewer being lost. However, this is what makes this movie so beautifully made and enjoyable to watch. If you can stay focused for two and a half hours on this film, the multitude of conflicts, riveting character development and beautiful cinematography will be sure to keep you entertained throughout.<br /> The cast of this story was magnificently done. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the aging leader of the group in Dom Cobb while Joseph Gordon Levitt plays his cunning and useful partner/sidekick, Arthur. Ellen Page brings her usual wit to the film as the crew's \\"architect,\\" Ariadne. The rest of the story centers around five other main characters (whose initials wittingly spell out DREAM) who are well rounded and skillfully put together.<br /> The movie is set in the either the present or near future in a world where the newest and most form of espionage is that of inception; the use of the person's own dreams to steal ideas and thoughts from them. The story begins with a failed attempt at inception by Dom and his partner which puts their lives in the hands of their former victim, Saito. Saito then demands they attempt a reverse sort of inception that is considered by his adversaries to be both dangerous for them and their victim. After building a new group to take his side, they embark upon this journey into the dreams of Saito's main business rival. The danger of this venture is not revealed to the rest of the group however until they are too deep in to get out. This then reveals the internal conflict Dom has with himself over the passing of his late wife and how this served as a selfish motivation to reconcile her death. As the stakes of their adventure rise the plot continuesto thicken and immerse the viewer even further until the movie comes to a satisfying yet cliff-hanger ending.<br /> What is equally impressive as the character development and plot throughout the movie is how it is visually portrayed. Not only is the viewer given details and filler information to tell you how the story is like a dream, the movie is also filled with beautiful, massive, dream-like settings and jaw dropping special effects (such as a gravity shift that sends Joseph Gordon Levitt flying sideways through a hotel hallway). These fantastical settings and details make the movie more realistic, but they also make the story a little more fun by giving it a level of relatability.<br /> With a run time of two hours and twenty eight minutes many people may feel that Christopher Nolan does what he commonly does by making the film too lengthy by overdetailing it. However with a film as complex and deep as Inception, for the most part, it was necessary and keeps the viewer engaged throughout the movie whether it be with action or important informational down periods.<br /> As a whole this movie sticks with you. It gets into the inner workings of your subconscious by appealing to those very areas of your mind. It is a highly intellectual movie that can still appeal to a wide audience. If a moviegoer wanted nothing more than some great special effects, beautiful landscapes and thrilling action they could have just that. However if a viewer needed a more engaging film they could connect to both cerebrally and emotionally they would definitely not be let down.

B00881VLCE|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been able to work a real jigsaw puzzle. My cats simply will not allow it. Since downloading Magic Puzzles I've worked at least one &quot;master&quot; level, 266 pieces, puzzle a day. There is a huge variety of difficulty. You can pick how many pieces to work with and the pictures vary from simple to complex. My grandmother was my puzzle partner, now this is the perfect way to puzzle on my own!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The sex scenes are so repetitious. Anastasia can orgasm ten times from one look from Christian. There are several parts that are just plain funny because they are so cheesy! There is some suspense in this one...more than the first...that's where the three stars come from.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|kids asked for it since they had learned to play it at a friend's house and loved it. we've watched them play it and its a fantastic game to teach kids many things about the economy and business.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Spend Too much time playing,but also very relaxing. Never any problems with<br />This game. Would recommend this to anyone ---- very nice
B0019IMVDG|1.0|More than what was expected as far as the seamier side of life and this shows those times.  A mistake for me.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love this CD. I play it constantly and don't skip songs like I do on some of my other CDs. Every song is catchy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Quality beyond description.  I anxiously await each episode.  Maggie Smith is the very best and brings her spirit to any project she engages in.  Bravo!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I don't often say that the video is better than the books;  now, I've read ALL the books and loved them deeply, but this series surpasses anything I could imagine - it's awesome, and brings the books to life in a way I could hardly imagine - it is so amazing!
B008EKOO46|4.0|I found a number of Mr. Diamond's comments and observations very helpful in my own life view;  however, this book is obviously not in the same league as his Guns, Germs and Steel.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|This documentary was a wonderful glimpse into the world of babies! It'll make you laugh at loud and touch your heart! A must see!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a really good read. I want to read more of colleen hoover!!! Hope they are as good as this one.
B00AG51V8E|5.0|This movie surprises on the upside. It held my full attention from start to finish with beautiful shots of the coast of Spain and Madrid along the action-filled way. Unexpected and unique twists add to this refreshing, fun portrayal of a young businessman thrown suddenly into an uncharted life-threatening race to save his family. I thought that it held up very well to the better movies of this genre.
0451532082|5.0|Reading level: Ages 18 and up<br />Mass Market Paperback: 528 pages<br />Publisher: Signet Classics; Reprint edition (May 1, 2012)<br />ISBN-10: 0451532082<br />ISBN-13: 978-0451532084<br />Product Dimensions: 6.8 x 4.3 x 1.2 inches<br /><br />Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" never fails to enthrall readers with its classic aura, wholesome humor, and contagious warmth. Stories of love, lines of laughter, and lessons of loyalty would peak interest to those who enjoy a good read by the fireplace sipping a cup of tea and nibbling on a freshly baked pastry item. This book depicts the gradual maturing of four girls--each with unique personalities.<br /><br />To my surprise, I found this book quite interesting, funny, and captivating. The characters are all so intruiging; forever a classic portrait of how a woman-run-household would be like. While reading this novel, I feel as though if I blinked twice, I would be right in Massachusetts, listening to sweet Beth playing the piano, while firey Jo is directing a play and bellowing at pragmatic Meg, with Amy painting lady-like in a chair.<br /><br />When I first saw the size of the book, I was, admititly, a little intimidated.  However, the verbiage of the novel carries itself in a way that makes for an affable read. I could not put the wonderful book down after I got into it. Each page seems like another intruiging story waiting to be told, and I enjoyed getting to know the characters as the story unfolded.<br /><br />Overall, this book was an excellent experience and reccomend it to everyone.
B008VBYN80|3.0|this game would be better if it was the same as it is on my other devices.  As it is, gifting between neighbors doesn't work, neither does requesting item to unlock skill upgrades.  This version also has no guilds.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child continues his tales of Jack Reacher with this second book.  He doesn't let you down. His plots and action are tight, scenes flow fast and furious and you just can't put these books down 'til you're done.  Reacher performs a simple act of chivalry that sucks him into a situation that escalates into a full-blown misadventure.  If he had suspected, would he have still acted the same way?  Hey, he's Jack Reacher, of course he would!
B00633W614|5.0|Archer is the ultimate story teller:  intrigue, twists, and mystery.  With each turn of the page, you wonder where he is taking you, but you must read first: &#34;Only Time Will Tell.&#34;A
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is were you need to start your reading of Lee Child's books.  This is the first time for meeting Jack Reacher and you won't forget that introduction.  Child is one of the best writers out there and he grabs your attention and doesn't let it go until you are finished with the story!  The character development is superb.  You form mental images of Child's characters that stay with you.  Reacher is one of the best hero characters I can think of.  He is all too human and has little quirks that sometimes cause him big problems, but maintains a consistent moral compass that makes you wish you had him for a friend.<br />Child doesn't just give you Reacher, however, but builds many great supporting characters in much detail.  He writes concisely and the story never lags.  You won't want to put it down.  When you are done with this book, you rapidly will be looking for more from Lee Child, count on it!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|When one is about fed up with politics and elections, this read is reassuring--that the U.S. system works:  the transition of presidents is reasonably smooth, conversations with predecessors does occur, and the service of former presidents has great value.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|What would you do if you were left for dead by your crew?  What if you were left for dead by your crew on Mars with no chance of rescue for several years? Astronaut Mark Watney comes to from a near fatal accident to find this is his reality.<br /><br />The Martian is a great read, a modern day Robinson Crusoe that will have you turning the page to see what happens.  Well worth the $.99. I've spent a lot more for a lot less.
076115678X|5.0|This book is a must-have for any woman who has anything from barely wavy to Afro curly hair. It is a welcome treat in a world that seems to value Brazilian blow-outs and ironed-straight hair on women. The book teaches you to embrace your waves and curls instead of fighting them, and offers up brief stories from women who've finally learned to love their curls. About 14 years ago, I began to cut and style my hair in ways that would enhance my waves/curls and have done so since. What this book did for me is help me improve them further by learning how to take care of them.<br /><br />This book teaches you the different curl types and how to care for each. You will learn how to cut, style, wash, condition, and maintain your wavy/curly hair. You'll get rid of your brush, your flat-iron, your harsh sulfate-filled shampoos, and your straightening agents. And you will have hair that makes you stand out from the crowd. The book has lots of good examples, pictures, and explanations, and even covers curly hair care for children and men.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B002ZG98J6|4.0|As usual, the books are way better, but I think they did justice to the book. (Not a crash like Eragon was.) Fun, and good special effects. Scary for younger children, though.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Interesting vivid heart warming page turner. You will be on the edge of your seat dying for the next page or book.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Classic , great story and for the time the scenery and color beautiful. Can't wait to watch on Blu-Ray!<br />Great too have in movie library.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|What can you say about a classic.  Ingrid Bergman is magnificent and Humphrey Bogart is heartbreaking but valiant in this romance.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was an amazing read. I quickly fell in love with Katie and Alex, and knew they would be a Great couple. After reading his book I am looking forward to seeing the movie!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is another great addition to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. The story is great, but in the end...well I won't spoil it.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A real tribute to the franchise.<br />A little over the top with the exploding everything.<br />But a great story, and lots of twists and turns.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0068FZ1C8|5.0|Very Good movie.  I would tear at the end of this movie each time.<br />Also, I can share this to my friend by a DVD!<br />Good product!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was a very entertaining read.  I don't know if I really believed it and thought of it as more of a fairy tale.  But, I really enjoyed the way he described heaven.  All of us hope it's like that.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not much to not like...great story line, great characters, and wonderful descriptions of this new world.  Wished we had a little more backstory on the world that they live in, but overall great story!!
B00B80ZG6O|5.0|Kaufmann's singing on this album is lyrical and elegant.  The voice, which has grown more baritonal but still shines on the high notes, is thrilling and beautifully controlled.  More than that, Kaufmann is a great interpreter.  The musical choices are excellent; it is very interesting to hear a male voice in the Wesendonck Lieder.<br />I was blown over.<br />This is highly recommended.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This was a good product, a little jumpy in the beginning, but it smoothed out. Fair quality, again it was a bit jumpy, but over all a good show and good product
B00B10DZQE|4.0|I took my whole family to see this movie when it was at the theaters and we all really liked it.  It was not at the theaters very long and I cannot understand why.  I have surfed in the past and have always had a fascination with Mavericks.  We liked the story and really liked the surf scenes.  Good wholesome movie--maybe that is why it was not a theaters long.
B008Y73940|5.0|This movie was funny, fast paced, serious and highly satisfying. Wish there were more movies made like this that are enjoyed by both  husbands and wives.

B003U4UNR8|3.0|Season 6 was disappointing, but not just because of the final episode. Overall, I felt that the pacing was off. The writers were too concerned with keeping the sense of mystery up to the last minute and not concerned enough with providing a story that makes sense.<br /><br />During the earlier episodes of this season, it seemed that Lost was struggling to maintain suspense. It was clear that the show refused to reveal any answers until the final few episodes. As such, the remaining episodes really don't have a point. The characters just run around on small missions, but viewers don't understand the larger picture. Moreover, the characters seem to change their minds every episode about fundamental decisions, such as whether to trust the Man in Black.<br /><br />The resolution for many of the characters also proved unsatisfactory. Several of the main characters fall by the wayside. Important character moments - such as Jin and Sun reuniting - are fleetingly brief. By contrast, we get entire episodes dedicated to new characters like Richard Alpert and Jacob, characters whom frankly I just didn't care about. The last few episodes of season 6 are just way too late for these types of episodes. It's far more important to give the characters a worthwhile farewell.<br /><br />A major character problem was how the show deals with Locke. Locke's body is now essentially possessed. The character we all knew and loved as Locke is no more. Frankly of all of the characters, Locke was the heart of this show. Making him a cold villain just does him a disservice.<br /><br />That said, I thought the\\"flashsideways\\" sections worked well. The flashsideways sections showed what would have happened to the characters had Oceanic Flight 815 not crashed. It was interesting to see how their fates crossed even so. I applaud the writers for not taking the easy way out and just portraying everybody's lives as worse had they not crashed. The outcomes are varied and escape easy judgment.<br /><br />Now, as for that ending... Well, it certainly doesn't tie up many of the loose ends. A good mystery creates an unsolvable puzzle. A great mystery creates a puzzle that is difficult to solve, but leaves tiny breadcrumbs along the way that the audience can spot the second time around. I just wish the writers had spent more time creating an integrated story rather than focusing on dangling the audience.<br /><br />Overall, Lost is a decent show, at times great, at times burdened by its own ambitions. I'd definitely recommend watching the first two seasons. I just wish we'd gotten more of that level of quality.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I had heard about this show and I finally sat down to see it. The characters are all well written and performed. There is humor and depth in each of the characters and I enjoyed the story lines. The adult content was a surprise and made this more interesting. Not a kid show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is an excellent writer. This is just a fact. He creates a world so similar to our own, it makes sense, and the characters are believable. They are characters we can relate to and understand.<br /><br />Wool is simply incredible. The slowly developing story of a post-apocolyptic world seen through many sets of eyes. The different points of view in the Silo Saga bring the reader into the world he has created (or have we created it?) and doesn't let go!<br /><br />From the first installment, where we see the sheriff deciding to go out for cleaning, to the end where we see the first inklings of the reality behind this saga, Howey brings the reader along this roller coaster of a story.<br /><br />Well worth the read for anyone who enjoys post apocolyptic and science fiction! I also strongly recommend the follow-on works!<br /><br />Hope that helps.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|I recommend this book because it is one of the best books I have ever read. The book is funny, surprising,& a liittle gross. I definitely recommend this book
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Having been a huge fan of George A. Romero since I was a kid I love finding all the little hidden tributes to his work in The Walking Dead, and there are many. Fit instance, Duane Jones was the name of the actor who played Ben in Night of the Living Dead and Morgan was the name of the main character in The Last Man On Earth, the inspiration for Romero's story. The baby's name is Judith which was the name of the actress who played the original Barbara. The writers also have a sense of humor- I could be wrong, but I think the redneck brothers were named Dixon for the Mason Dixon line which separated the northern from the southern states. I love that it has all these little surprises for the fan to discover like little gifts left hidden all throughout the episodes.This series is amazing-great writing and acting-wonderful casting. The writers take you on a rollercoaster ride-a silly or funny moment turns tragic or sad or exciting in a heartbeat and every episode leaves you wanting the next and the next and, unlike other shows, it has no problem killing off it's main and beloved characters which leaves the fans more than worried and excited and a little fearful. I am very picky about what I watch and worse about what I like and this incredible show has me hooked like marlin. I can't stop watching this unique and wonderful series which I hope will be around for many seasons to come. I couldn't recommend a show more than this little gem.
B009XTF8KQ|1.0|Spoiler alert ***<br /><br />It seems that every horror film (especially those with demons in them) needs to differentiates itself from their predecessors by having at least one thing that's original or that you haven't seen before. In \\"The Possession\\", one scene is letting us see demonic fingers trying to climb the throat of the poor possessed girl! And one MRI from the hospital shows the demon's face roaming inside the girl's heart! There you go. Demons can physically live inside one's body. Not spiritually. Physically. Haven't seen that before, have you? I call it the \\"Fright Night\\" effect, in honor of the 1985 vampire flick in which you learned that crosses were only working if you had true faith.<br /><br />That is the only thing to remember from this film. For a serious student of screenplay writing, I mean. If you want to write a good horror film (especially those with demons in them), try to come up with a scene or a story device that we've never seen before. The danger, though, is that by trying too hard, you might end up making your audience laugh more than anything else.<br /><br />The rest of the film is just a series of clichés, one after the other. You can also learn from that. Learn what-not-to-do when writing such a film. The spanish maid (or nurse) who knows stuff?  The chilly whispers? The bugs (or moths)as a metaphor for the devil? The possessed girl with long hair and a white gown? That same girl speaking in a scary voice? The white eyes? The exorcism scene where the demon yells? The bones breaking? The distorsioned body? The elders who knows the secret? Don't do those anymore. We've seen them a zillion times.<br /><br />And those are just your usual ghost-like clichés. What about your basic Hollywood clichés? The dad who promises he will be at his daughter's practice but you know he won't be there? That same dad who will be accused of being a bad dad only for every character to find at the end that he isn't? The mother and the father who areseparated but will get back together at the end? I mean, one should come up with a list of what-not-to-do-that's-been-done-before prior to writing any film.<br /><br />By the way, if the parents are getting back together at the end, does this mean that the possession of their daughter was the... best thing (!) that could have happen to their couple?  Because you also have your illogic story devices that always come along such demonic films. Why would the Spanish maid or nurse, in the beginning, let a little child buy the box? Didn't the attack of the possessed girl on her mother wake the entire house? What did the doctors thought of the MRI of the little possessed girl's body in which we clearly see the demon inside?  How can the family go back to a normal life after all this?<br /><br />Again, for want of anything better, at least you can use such a film as an academic tool for screenplay writing 101. When writing a film, make a list of everything we've seen a zillion times before and... don't do them again! Oh and don't forget the \\"Fright Night\\" effect. Crosses only work when you have faith. Now you go on and try to beat that one...
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Picked this up from Amazon when it was on sale.  Great price and great movie set.  If you are unsure about The Godfather Series, just read one of the in depth reviews of the actual film.  This set though is nice and worth it if you get a good deal like I did.<br /><br />I will say though, this is an older film and isn't laser sharp like new movies on Blu Ray.  Just be aware, it fits your screen perfectly, has been restored, has great sound, but it isn't like watching Toy Story 3 in Blu Ray...
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I hate these games that suck you in for free then make you pay to continue, I had to remove this from the kindle because my daughter loved it but now it won't work since I refuse to spend anymore money
B00499QUK2|4.0|Sherlock and Watson (the English version) were portrayed in a very interesting way.<br />Definitely, this episode will hold your attention, though the end is not as great as the beginning.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Enough said!! No fun for my three year old, I didn't even enjoy any of the games....I removed it from my kindle
B0063IH60K|5.0|I chose this rating because this game is easy to play and very enjoyable . The cards are easy to see as well
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and easy to play. The only part that can suck is waiting to do things but other than that it's pretty sweet.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome!!! Loved it!!! Wish there were more books!! Can't wait to read more by the author!!!was very intreging and enlightening!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is just a fantastic edition of such a wonderful movie. There's 4 discs, 2 for the movie itself and 2 for a staggering amount of bonus features. I highly recommend getting all 3 movies in the trilogy, especially in bluray. The extended edition adds a lot of run time, and makes the small extra cost well worth it.
B000LC4B3Y|2.0|This is the only John Eliot Gardiner recording that I have ever not enjoyed. The tempos are just too fast (even for the choir which at times struggles to keep up); the singing is very detached and marcato; and the period instruments (which I normally like) lack blend and sonority. I much prefer the old Marriner and ASMF recording.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|What a great movie. Russel Crowe is great as a vengeful gladiator, and Joaquin Phoenix plays the PERFECT villain. The extended edition brings the runtime to over 3 hours, and it's well worth watching.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|The playing is not only musically beautiful, but this may also be the most intellectually stimulating recording I have ever listened to.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|There's already dozens of reviews praising this movie, so I'll just keep it simple. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman work together beautifully, and really help immerse you in the amazing story. Everyone needs to see this movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is one of the best books I have ever read and I read a lot.  I wake up in the middle of the night and read a chapter or two. JFK was killed when I was in high school and it broke my heart.  I will never forget the feeling I had and I knew that the world would never be as good as it was from that moment on.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love playing Spider Solitaire although it seems to be much more difficult on my Kindle Fire HD than playing it on my computer.

B000HX4ZF6|5.0|This is an epic tale of an underdogs fight for freedom. A must see movie and perfect for any collection.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is the best FM transmitter I have ever bought. Signal is strong and rarely does it get any interference. Sound quality is good. The remote control is a great addition.<br /><br />SD Card + USB = awesome.<br /><br />Things that could be improved:  user interface, navigation and buttons.<br /><br />Additions: BLUETOOTH. (Newer version)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the book more on my second reading. Good story that kept my interest from start to end. Unfortunately, I see parallels in the road our country (USA) is taking. I hope the book is not an fortuitous of our future.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great story line and visual effects. Top notch acting with a message of personal responsibility.  Enjoyed the movie, would recommend to friends.
0920668372|5.0|Just one time - I'd like to get through this book without being reduced to a teary-eyed, sobbing mess. It's such a sweet, touching message that truly gets at the heart of any parent. At 18 months my son is still a little young to sit through the entire book. He has started singing the song along with me though when I read it to him. Ugh, I'm welling up even now!
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of movies that come out of Hollywood I like. Percentage-wise, though, I'd say I like maybe 5%. This movie is very entertaining and funny, and most of all it's quirky. It is mostly character driven so keep that in mind if you're used to watching movies like Bourne Identity. I guess the one word summary of the movie: Magical.<br />Recent movies this reminds me of: Midnight in Paris & Hugo.
B004S5C8WG|4.0|This is a great easy read which keeps you guessing the outcome right to the end. There is mystery, romance, drama and intrigue.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|My favorite all time movie.  Loved the ease of being able to download it right to my laptop and priced just right.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Love the HD download. You can watch anywhere with internet in SD and in HD on your Roku, PS3, and Ipad. The movie itself is great too. It's especially great for your daughters as it is a great change up from the typical Disney princess movie.
B002M9WW30|4.0|This is not a review of the movies themselves - each one has its own separate reviews elsewhere, I think this review should be for the boxed set and not the production.  Just a note though that I do enjoy each movie in their own right.<br /><br />That said I'm very happy that I own this boxed set and that it's Blu Ray instead of regular DVD.  The bonus features are nice as well, I watched most of them.<br /><br />The only thing I wish they could have done better is regarding the quality of the recordings - I was hoping that they worked some digital magic and increased the quality resolutions, etc - but they're not all that much better than a regular DVD in the long run.  I know they weren't filmed with HD cameras in the first place, but I've seen some great re-digitizing in the past and was hoping for the same here.<br /><br />I got this on a lightning deal and saved quite a bit, so overall I'm REALLY happy with it, I would have expected to pay more for this bundle.<br /><br />-D
B0028RXXE8|4.0|The production, the actors, the scenery are all so good, it's a pity that every few minutes you have to return to the main menu to turn off the English subtitles. I'm not exaggerating, it happens at least five or six times during a single episode. Except for that technical glitch, the series is fascinating.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to capture my attention!  This is an entertaining and fascinating portrayal of some of the history of aristocracy and the progressive changes throughout time.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some books that I read, I can not get into that we'll because the writing style seems as though it is below my level. The Fault in Our Stars, thankfully, is perfectly written. It seemed as though I was living in the world that John Green so beautifully created. This book gave me the gift of tears and intense feelings that most movies simply can not. These words do not do this book enough justice and most likely no one will read this review, but if you do I just hope you take the chance to read the book that inspired it. I am not a cancer survivor, currently battling with cancer, nor has anyone I am very close to had cancer, but I feel as though this book portrays this sad world not seen by many perfectly. Enjoy this book. It is a wonderful treat I am glad to have experienced.
0765325950|5.0|Look, I, like so many others started reading WoT in 1990. When it began, before the Inet became the source of quick and often inaccurate information, I thought this would be a trilogy as so many other stories of fantasy were at the time. Well, 23 years later, we have the ending. I was off the series for a while out of protest of not wanting to wait for all the books. Then the author passed away, Wow. In any case, I got bored with what other books were being released and decided to get back into this series. OK, so did I love MoL? Not exactly, but then it did wrap up the whole story. I became rather attached to many characters, some who lived, and some who died. Regardless, it has been a long and sometimes difficult road, much like real life. I will miss those I have read about and wonder what happened to many of those I have come to know, love, like, hate, etc... My mind boggles at so much potential for more story telling.  I am still feeling stunned by this last book.  I thank James Rigney/ Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, and Team Jordan (especially Harriet) for the vision, dedication, and determination to tell a great story that has become a significant part of how I see my place in the `Wheel of Time'.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you have been moved by the telling of this story thus far, you owe it to yourself to gain closure.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|my kids simply love the game. but you do not earn coins fast enough to buy expentions. so it gets expensive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show, love it.  I am all caught up and now will have to wait a whole other year to see the more!<br /><br />I will say that Amazon has some work to do on their streaming.  I had to restart shows several times, I didn't experience the same frequency of pauses with Netflix.
B0064Y5U24|4.0|I down loaded fast and I was alble to listen to the music right away. I like the song very much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, many twists and turns that you never see coming!  couldn't put it down and have already told several people to put it on their must read list.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love connecting with my sis. we play all the time. the game is fast. doesnt have all the options that a free version.
B00A3AY134|4.0|I have been a fan of this band for years now.  I was happy to see a greatest hits collection come out.  There is a nice selection of songs on here and the MP3 makes it easy to listen to at any time.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|the game is lots of fun. it connects fast. and it simple for my 4  year old and difficult for my 7 year old.
0525478817|5.0|The book came as fast as promised and in great shape. The price was fantastic-I didn't realize it was a hardback until I received it. Very pleased.
B007BZM3HK|3.0|I down loaded fast and I was alble to listen to the music right away. I like the song very much.
0062238868|5.0|Mr.Kyle was the type of man that many aspire to be but few can come close to, let alone be. He writes in a way that is modest and captivating in the way that he'll tell you as much about his time with family as when he was on deployment. Without giving away any secret information that is.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Suspenseful! Great great must read! Well read it over and over again! Could not put my kindle down. Felt like I was right there.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Hands down, the best show on televison! This show is not just for sci fi or horror junkies. Anyone that loves a good drama will appreciate the interesting, well developed characters and great acting.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really like this game! It is easy to play....love the little bell sound when I make a match. This game is a perfect way to pass the time!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|It was great, even my daughter (5 yrs old) liked it. The imagery was beautiful and the rest an exciting fairy tail.
B004X4RU9I|5.0|It says English subtitled which is true, but it is also dubbed in English. The fight seen between Donnie and Sammo Hung is fantastic, not to mention the other fight seen's. If you like Chinese style movies, and great Kung Fu action, then this is a must have movie. I also recommend Ip Man, and Flash Point. Two more great movies.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put it down and finished it in two days. Keeps you captured cover to cover. Definitely worth reading.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I bought this seasn for my Daughter and she loves it. I will probably be getting the next season as well.
B00991TCOG|4.0|Lindsey Stirling is a fantastic violinist! Being a violinist myself, I say that she has amazing technique and tone. Each note she plays is rich and beautiful! Lovely vibrato.<br /><br />The only thing that I wish was different was the dub step aspect. What's there is really good, but I feel like there could be MORE. I noticed that many rhythms and sounds were repeated a lot... I just wish there was a wider range. Just a suggestion!! :) Otherwise, the dub step mixed with her amazing violin playing is genius!!<br /><br />There is room for growth, and I am sure that she will not disappoint. :)I can't wait to hear more from her!
B0053O89RY|5.0|I bought this seasn for my Daughter and she loves it. I will probably be getting the next season as well.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I hope the up coming<br />movie will come close to the book. The walking dead from all sides beginning to end.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|A fantastic job of animation.  I watch this and wonder what Walt Disney would have thought.  Such a perfect balance of story and special effects.  My grandkids love it.  Every time I watch it I see things that were missed before.  It is really very very good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is so much fun to play and it certainly is a challenge. Just trying again and again to get it right!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg I love this game so much I play this tam before school during and after I play this game every time I get the chance and its extremely fun
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun high paced never ending game.I really liked it it.it's a good game for rainy days.If you don't have the game you need to get it!!!!!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As I already reviewed season one, I purchased together as a set. I know I will enjoy watching for years to come.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have so many comments on this cover and people ask me where I got it - it looks like a rich leather, looks like an old book, the look I wanted..
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|once in a while the game will stop for an ad but for the most part the free version is great. a lot of levels to play
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Right out of the gate, I believe that the screenwriter did an excellent job here.  The dialog is very believable, and funny, throughout appropriate parts of \\"Flight.\\"  There is a scene in a stairwell at a hospital -- after the crash -- that involves Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilley, and some guy (I don't know his name) who has cancer.  Now, the cancer part surely isn't funny, but the cancer patient's dialog is hilarious.  As a matter of fact, I was cackling for the majority of the film.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that this is Mr. Washington's finest performance to date.  He is a very flawed protagonist in this film, but he's simultaneously also very sympathetic.  I would imagine that this is a tricky role to pull off as an actor, as you most likely walk a very fine line trying to pull this off.  But he is excellent.  Throughout, I was really pulling for his character, and I believe that he and the director did a great job in this respect.<br /><br />Even Don Cheadle is really good.  I've been a little hit and miss with him, as I feel that many times, his characters come off as a little preachy to me.  It's not necessarily him per se; it's strictly the roles that he has chosen in his career.  Now, he's a little straight-laced once again in this role, but there is a comic scene in the third act (let's just say that Nancy Reagan would be rolling her eyes) where Mr. Cheadle lightens up a bit, and I had a really good laugh.<br /><br />But naturally, this is supposed to be a somewhat serious film as well dealing with serious subjects.  The film doesn't get too preachy; it allows the viewer to make up his or her own mind on some of these issues.  That is a big plus.  And for the film overall, this would be a pretty big recommendation by me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i have not noticed any ads in the way and this works perfect as i have not found a calculator anywhere in my kindle otherwise
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|This is fun...up to a few levels.  Then the bird/missiles are too feeble to do much and you are given the option to &#34;buy&#34; an eagle, a stronger bird.  It's misleading to tout it as a free game.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|i love another jetpack game so i chose to try this, it plays good but i did nto play it enough to judge ads, they did not seem to get in my way, i think preteens to early teens will like this.
B00280LYIC|5.0|After finishing up the Harry Potter series with my 6-year-old, we weren't very hopeful about finding anything that could equal it.  However, this book came pretty close.  It's pretty predictable (even for my kid) but that didn't really seem to make it any less engaging or fun.  I love hearing about the Greek mythology tidbits she's picking up and we're excited to move on to the next book in the series tomorrow.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|i can do most anything that my desktop will but it is on my kindle now, sweet! i just dont like that is asks the location question all the time since i answer no there, but there may be a setting that i can change somewhere, no more ads than i see on my desktop version
B0060CV7YK|5.0|I grew up and loved this movie so much and I'm glad I'll be able to keep watching it and share it with my children now.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never had a book captivate me quite like Hopeless. It is by far my new favorite book and I recommend everyone read it. The emotions are so heartfelt you can see the characters vividly.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a wonderfully written book where I especially enjoyed the perspectives it was written from.  I've always been a pros/cons guy so here's my list.<br /><br />Pros:<br />For about 88% of the book it is a true CANNOT put down (I finished in 3 days)<br />Flynn does a great a great building the characters I really felt a connection with each and there's so many twists that your emotions towards them change as you go (I think this really keeps you on your toes and what makes you want to never put it down)<br />The flip flop of perspectives from chapter to chapter keeps you wondering and wanting to read more<br /><br />Cons:<br />My only real gripe with the book was the ending (or the last 12% if you will).  Towards the end it starts to drag on a little and I knew EXACTLY how it was going to end a lot earlier than I thought I would.  I found myself saying, &#34;ugh moooore pages?  Alright power through I gotta finish&#34; which is sad because the rest of the book was a total page turner.<br /><br />All in all I would definitely recommend, I don't think most people would figure out the ending as quickly I just think Having crossed paths with someone like the character in the book before gave more of an insight.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|After I got into the flow of the book, it was difficult to put it down. Has elements of novelty in writing style. Great suspense thriller, and the characters are not everyday people one encounters!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game on my kindle fire. its fun to play and very addicting. the only flaw is it doesn't change once you've beaten it. wish stages would change up a bit.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a great game and I am enjoying it.  I like that when you have everything in order it asks if you would like to automatically pile the cards.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so incredibly emotional. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read her other novels. Her acknowledgements were too funny.
B0012C7ET0|5.0|I have enjoyed Stevie Nicks for a long time.  This album contains some great songs sung by the incomparable Stevie Nicks.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a 5 star book to me<br />I love how Jeff tells about all the problems Greg runs into
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Not the greatest Bond but very enjoyable.  I like the fact that they are letting 007 grow older and still be able to save the day.  You won't regret the time spent watching this.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I was level 27 and then it deleted my whole thing everything. it made me start over. it was great until then
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Very disappointed in the movie, it was so boring fell asleep during the middle, could have been edited to about 1/2 an hour.  Do not know what I expected, but it sure wasn't a movie about an alcoholic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|tr 2 is so much better than tr this app is so addictive if you like tr then you should get tr2
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|It's a collage fllick book, I had a hard time sticking to reading the first 60 percent of the book.  All the story told to that point was the college escapades of a first year 19 year old.  It wasn't a book I couldn't put down, and it took me forever to read it.  Her first books were awesome, I hope her next book is more interesting.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I love Coldplay.  I loved all their old albums. But this one takes the cake!  Melodic music and heart-stopping rifts, beautiful singing and amazing instrumentals, it has it all.  Superb album.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is amazing. You should totally get this amazingly awesome app. Peace out buddy. From me peps and get this game as soon as possible.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|i thought it was very  good but not as good as the original with matt damon.or mabye it is because matt damon is one of my favorites and him iam not familar with but the action was great the scenry was great and very scenic.and the acting  wasnt great but good.igave this movie four stars iwould watch it again the bourne legacy is a must see
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing. It has jumping,dogging,ducking and even prizes!<br />I think it is cool ,because there is coins ,and different characters.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|i loved ted it was a totaly different kind of movie.a wonderful fantasy about a youngester with no friends who was hungry for a companion and wished up on friend for life..they were insperable and loyal to one another there was no comparision to any friendship that you might aquire today it would be wonderful if people could show as much luv today to one another it would be a beautiful world i luv mark walberg in just about everything he does now that was entertaintment next time try a little less profanity
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|most of the jokes were drugs related and they were not funny at all.  A horrible script for such a great and handsome actor as Mark W.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Oh, Adele you just keep getting better and better. This is a wonderful album that is as enjoyable the 100th time as the first.
1455502758|5.0|Wow. Read it! It is well written & very moving. There are not many books written on the process of dying & this one is the best that I've ever read.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|The order shipped quickly and was the perfect gift for my son-in-law for Christmas. He is enjoying it still - months later.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Acting is superb, and story line sure grabs you right from the start!  The accent sometimes makes for hard understanding, but truly an enjoyable viewing.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|it shipped quickly and was exactly what my son-in-law wanted. The perfect gift for Christmas. That about sums it up.
B0015442YU|5.0|How do you beat this thriller? Hopkins is excellent strongly recommend watching this. I will watch this movie again, as well as the entire Clarissa Starling series
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Didn't enjoy this one quite as much as the others. A little farfetched even for Reacher. It was still a good read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like the game of Mahjong but I am not a fan of timed games. I play to relax my mind and the timer hinders that relaxation
B00ANW33CM|3.0|It has a lot of different games, but hard to turn around on the screen. I does keep your brain going though. I would recomend it because of the different scenarios.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Furthermore great hidden object game  played for hours finished  I d  do more games by that company  I love hidden object games
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've already watched this movie!  The last few minutes are some of the best in cinematic history!
B009439HEY|5.0|If you wanted to see Genesis in concert today (2013), you'd have a few problems: 1) They wouldn't play songs this good - they'd play tracks like \\"Invisible Touch\\", 2) They wouldn't sound this good, and 3) They wouldn't play live anymore anyway.  So this album is as good as you'd get.  In fact, it's better than you'd get from a live rendition.<br /><br />A lot of this material is better than the original.  For example, the beautiful track \\"Horizons\\" from Foxtrot was poorly recorded back in 1972 and had a lot of hiss on it.  That's all fixed here :-)  Also, rather than trying to imitate Peter's or Phil's vocals, there's often an intentionally unique slant here, which works well.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anybody who is/was a fan of the best era of Genesis (by which, of course, I mean up to and including Wind & Wuthering).
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought 2 of these dolls one for myself and one for my niece.  Loved the detail on her.  Very happy I purchased it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It's a lot of fun and there are numerous layouts so that you don't get bored.  In addition, the hardship levels are numerous, so you can make it as difficult as you wish.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really do not get why people made this such a huge deal other than the fact that they just want to read about sex.  Story is poor, characters are ridiculous stupid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game.  Thanks to my 7yr old granddaughter that I got hooked.  Everytime she is with me she always ask to play on my kindle.  She even changed my character.  Really a GREAT GAME.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I'm sorry I spent 30.00 on all 3 books.  Story is lame, characters are majorly stupid.  I'm an avid book reader and loved Twilight but I just don't get why so many people have made this a big deal other just because they get to read about the sex scenes.  Will never recommend this.
0385535147|1.0|Expected more from a Grisham book. Blah blah blah I am a black lawyer, blah blah blah I am in jail, jail sucks, 4 hours in, and protagonist is still complaining how jail sucks, everyone knows that already.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Don't know why I thought it might get better.  Lame story and lame childish characters.  Will not recommend books at all.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|This DVD collection is excellent. The only problem was that the Director's Commentary was automatically on for one of the episodes on last disc. Just muted TV & read subtitles.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|The movie came in earlier than what was expected and it came in in perfect condition. Brand new. The movie was awesome. Couldn't be any happier.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have not seen the movie and probably won't because I am not sure it will live up to the book being so good. I read it in two days and couldn't put it down. It's an honest look at life and how we try to navigate our way through our sometimes messed up brains.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Daniel Craig brings the classic James Bond back to the series.  Although the most exciting scene was right at the beginning the movie was well done all the way through....good job!
B003HFCUR6|5.0|I read this a year ago from my local library! Loved it so much that I bought it! The book I bought was used but you can't even tell. If you haven't read it I suggest you do! Christie is truly a master of crime stories
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book was wonderful! Mitch Albom does a great job developing the characters and keeping reader interest. I found this book to be inspirational.
B0015AARJI|2.0|I ordered this as a replacement remote for the one my dog ate when I first got her. When I ordered this product I picked this one out of many specifically because it says it is a SONY controller. When it came it had no marking of actually being a SONY product and is clearly not what was promised. I am disappointed in this and will think twice about ordering an electronic product from amazon again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Oh my goodness, you won't believe the twist in this - it took me completely by surprise!  Would definitely recommend it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Every track on this album is worth listening to.  They are also great live if you ever have the chance to see them.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|really enjoyed the books. Don't read all 3 after each other, even tho they are all really good it took a lol bit of enjoyment
1423140605|5.0|If you're a fan of the Percy Jackson series this third installment of his spinoff series is such an amazing read!  I can't wait for the fourth book!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Enjoying the game a lot. It is very much like virtual city.  Like the fact I haven't needed to have friends playing the game.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|We pre-ordered this for my daughter, who is the biggest Belieber ever! She can't stop listening to it. It was purchased new, so there were no hesitations or worries about the product.
030746363X|5.0|I didn't try all that he recommended but the diet itself and the basic exercises.  I lost 70 lbs. two months and felt great.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I saw this doctor on a couple of talk shows and had to read his book.  still reading it.  but its very interesting.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|This is probably like ENRON before the collapse. Great actors with a good script. Even if you mostly watch Mystery Thrillers, and I do, you'll still enjoy this....I did.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but figured it out before the end.  This just left me only wanting to know happens to all of them, which was  not what I hoped for.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed the book. The set-up is confusing, and I certainly enjoyed some characters narratives over others, but I liked the connection between all of them, even if some of the connections are murkier than others.
B007P3S1AQ|1.0|Awful movie! Goes nowhere fast, every opportunity to make this a good movie is squandered! A complete waste of my time!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Our book club picked it out, and it was a refreshing and exciting choice from some of the last few we read. I was caught up in the story immediately and loved the way she wove the different characters stories together instead of just focusing on the two main characters with others in the background.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Fiio E6 paired with audio technical ath-m50's.<br /><br />Before having this amp, I was already blown away by the sound quality of these cans. Pairing them with this amp, just wow. Its honestly like they're not even the same headphones. I couldn't recommend this amp more! Plus, let's be honest, the price can't be more right. I don't have a single complaint at all. Quit reading reviews and add this little piece of magic to your cart. What's the worst that'll happen? You'll be dissapointed (which you won't), so send it back. I love mine.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|There are almost 700 reviews for this movie. Some people practically restage the entire movie.<br />I just wanted to tell you the obvious:<br />STAR QUEST is actually a brilliant parody of<br />GALAXY TREK. I meant to say that the movie<br />GALAXY QUEST is a CGI SFX action-packed version of a<br />STAR TREK-like cast that have become \\"has-beens\\".<br /><br />This movie was great on DVD, and is even better on BLU-RAY! The climax to the film, especially,<br />gives your 5.1 suround sound system a work-out!<br /><br />NEAT!<br /><br />Two words:=======> BUY IT!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|This is a good remake.  It doesn't mirror the original and the changes are interesting. It was a good rental.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great novel for modern kiddos! I love young adult adventure reads, and this is exactly that! From pop culture references to the historical mythology, well blended!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|It's not just a baseball movie.  It deals with relationships, between a father and daughter, and the daughter and prospective boyfriend.  It's worth owning, in my opinion.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a great novel for modern kiddos! I love young adult adventure reads, and this is exactly that! From pop culture references to the historical mythology, well blended!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|It was OK, not great.  I suppose you can't do too much more than has been done in the other movies.  It was worth the rental.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is a great novel for modern kiddos! I love young adult adventure reads, and this is exactly that! From pop culture references to the historical mythology, well blended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Only the best  buy this game<br />Please buy , Creativity is the only way to survive.<br />Was  the  Best game ever,  creeper invasions, zombies , skeletons and spiders!!!!!
B005NJU8PA|1.0|yes there are recipes, but the theme is to get organized and do your prep work first, which is what every good cook does.
B00886XQO0|5.0|These are by far the best turtle beaches I have ever owned. Even better deal buying these refurbished. good deal
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My 20 year old daughter is the one that got me to read the 3 books of Fifty Shades of Grey.  At first I was shocked she would even read a book like that, but then it had me captured from the very start.  I am now reading book three and I simply cannot put the book down.  Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades of Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed is a trilogy of love and inspiration every woman can relate to!
B004W1GD4A|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters and the complexities of their lives<br />The storyline was intriguing<br />There was quite the suprising ending
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Peter Pan, as we all wish to never grow up.  Wendy, his love and Captain Hook, a classic villain.  There is nothing not to like about Peter Pan.  A Cartoon, a Play on Broadway and a Movie.<br />Kathryn Beaumont, the voice of Alice(in Wonderland) and Wendy(here) is perfect.<br />Bobby Driscoll, Song of the South(live), So Dear to My Heart(live), Treasure Island(live) and Peter Pan(voice), is one of the Top Child Actors of all time.<br />Hans Conried, as Captain Hook was Perfect Casting.<br />This is a Perfect Classic Children's Fantasy for all Time.  It is never dated.<br />Yes, the non talking Tinker Bell is Wonderful.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love solitare anytime but this is so easy and it moves really well when I've got just a few minutes.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Fell in love with this series.  Wanted to get them in a packaged deal at a reasonable price.  I can always count on finding super prices on Amazon.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|I am a huge Robert Pattinson fan, this movie is the worst thing I have ever seen him in, I am so disappointed in him for this movie, The only reason I gave it a two is because it is Robert Pattinson But this movie STINKS.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Liked this movie when I saw it.  Wanted to add it to my collection of movies.  I'm sure my husband would like it as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Do we really need to rate this?  Seems that it is known globally for the great production that it is.
B005LAII12|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with how funny this movie was. I would recommend. Would not be suitable for kids however.
0345540565|1.0|there was major damage to my order of game of thrones box set including tearing and bent cover and pages. and the box was completly destroyed as it was ripped in long tears in three different spots it was unsalvagable
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is a very well written book.I'm 13 years old and I enjoyed it very much...yes their are some parts that aren't appropriate for a 13 year old but it teaches a lesson that I think everyone should learn about finding the real you and not letting anyone change you.
B00B01XDTI|5.0|Excellent special effects and the story line was not to bad. It actually made sense from the first one. I would watch again
B00AFEY354|5.0|What does one say, when a theme hits home so well that you wished it never happened!  You have a story here that follows the maturing of a young man who is carrying a very large burden.  All the sadness, angst, anxiety, and love is shown in this movie.  I could give the plot and final outcome but this would ruin the entertainment factor completely.  This film is a must for your DVD collection.  SOMETIMES LIFE IMITATES ART AND THEN ART CAN IMITATE LIFE IN THIS COMPLEX AND COMBURSOME WORLD!  NJMJr.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I prefered the story line in this booked compared to the first one, it made me want to keep reading. I thought the first book was a bit corny
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|When I got it I just thought it was a alarm but then two days after it goes on an alarm<br />Clock I was like o Kay it's not that surprising but then I looked in the corner it told the temperature I was amazed this is the best
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Goog series continuation without damging the plot in order to maintain viewership. I await the release of each episode. I guess I should have watched it on its air date, I'd be waiting either way.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Haven't watched the Dr. for a long time, tom baker was the one I remember with Sarah Jane Smith. Rose is a great addition to the show,  as well as in season 2. Didn't know it was still around till I seen it on Prime. I was surprised to see that the Dalecks were still around, I think its time to move on and leave them in the past.
B007HO392S|5.0|Excellent CD!  Love Carie Underwood and this is another great one for her.  Would recommend it to everybody to try!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I didn't fact check this book, so I don't know how accurate the details are, but they certainly rang true.  Enjoyable and entertaining, and well worth the price of admission.  I look forward to reading more from this author.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|The Band Perry - Really like the Band Perry - the CD is great! Would definitely recommend it to everybody

B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is one of the first game apps I've ever played-  I found it to be engaging and relaxing.  Very enjoyable!
B005HEDI3K|1.0|Great show, but you really need to go on over to Hulu+ to watch it because AMAZON STILL REQUIRES FLASHPLAYER TO WATCH THEIR CONTENT!  Android devices like the Google Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 are not supported.<br /><br />Dumb.<br /><br />Get an app, Amazon.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I have this app on my kindle fire hd and iphone. On kindle, it doesn't capture the voice very well and has much less animations.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great characters....I don't think it will be long before you see this story in movie theaters.  I would like to read more by this author.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The Raceteer, by John Grisham<br />I never knew where this story was going.  And when it did get there it was not worth the wait.  It was certainly not his best.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I love anything with Meryl Streep but the whole premise of this movie is a little creepy to watch.  If you're under the age of 50, I would stay away!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I don't know why the bad scores. if you just wait a moment, those feeds will load. I guess everyone is too busy to wait! thank you for this app!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Suspend your disbelief and all known facts and this is brilliantly written and thoroughly enjoyable!  I highly recommend UNLESS you are unable to forget the facts you may already hold true, like, say, solar flares, flight, etc...
B00APJLEGA|5.0|This was the cutest movie we've watched in a while.  We first saw it in theaters in 3D and my granddaughter loved it so much we bought it so we could watch it again.  The characters are of the cheesy variety that my generation grew up watching and are a comedic treat for the younger crowd.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Enjoyed playing the game. It was a challenge to find many of the items in the time allowed but normally I could find everything within two tries.  I would recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|For the Downton Abbey addict, this is a must see season!  What could be more fun than curling up with your favorite dog and catching up on the comings and goings at Downton Abbey, all at your convenience!  No commercials, no waiting until next week, nothing to interrupt your viewing of this great series.  Just download and enjoy over and over again!
0807014273|5.0|i rate high because the book was exlent to read.<br />i like this book, and I will recomend the mean's searching for a menaing if you like the why of everything.<br />enjjoy reading and relax.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was an amazing thrill ride through the original Hunger Games. Much more different than the movie. I would  recommend this to everyone:)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is a absolute must if you enjoy socializing thru Facebook. Makes it easy and convenient!!! So happy it was free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really addicting and I think that this is a very good for you Thursday night at a time when you have to be a good thing about the future. This makes no sense but it was intentional because I used suggestions exclusively.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Love showing my friends and family this app. Just like me they all got a kick out of it. Especially when I came across buying a lifelike talking Tom through Avon, as an Avon rep.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was so good. It is very suspenseful. I bought it on my kindle, so I can't say anything about the condition of the book. I usually don't re-read my books, but this is one I will!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The fact that it was free does not take away from the fact that I use it all the time. Has replaced all the other calculators in my house.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the Percy Jackson series,  the author's first series,(mostly for Percy and the books humor) so of course I was going to read Rick Riordan's next one.<br /> I must admit I was a bit disappointed with the first book of the series, I mean No Percy? Really? I somewhat dislike Jason while reading the first book of Heroes of Olympus, but I found myself growing attached to Leo, and was much happier with the second book, but this third book took the cake.<br />I enjoyed how the story put my favorite characters together and let me know how all the characters would react towards each other, especially Percy and Jason. I mean two powerful demigods, something had to go down, right?<br /><br />I'm getting off track.<br /><br />Anyways, I was more than happy with this book, although most of the time I was wishing that Jason would get on his knees and declare that Percy was, in fact, superior. All opinions aside, the book was well written and filled with interesting characters who are determined to reach their goal, adding to the exciting plot. Five stars but it is 6 star worthy. (If your into the genre)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love having this free app. It just makes it so much easier to be a part  of the app all my friends are talking about!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was a great app to have on my Kindle.  It is easy to use and very easy to read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|so much fun...my kids got me hooked...I have been watching them play this on their kindles for a few months now...they told me I'd like it....and I do
B0055MBQOM|5.0|if you are creating any digital art or reproductions and you need screen calibration xrite is the one to get. period.<br />I read some other reviews and I am a computer tech and i didn't get why anyone would say this is hard to use. It is very very simple.<br />I calibrated 2 screens and a wacom cintiq tablet works perfectly. does what it says.<br />I also opted for this over other brands cause it calibrates projectors. I haven't tried it yet but will on the next movie night.<br />Only con i would say is that the calibration took longer then i am used to. at least 5 mins.  But for the price that is more an observation then a complaint.<br />At work we had a i1 color pro, and the pro is way faster - should be as it costs 10 times more.<br /><br />So if you need calibration this is the way to go. stop reading reviews and just buy this one.<br />fyi on a mac used on 10.6 and 10.7 with no problems.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game was great!When I got the game it was free,but forget about the price. No matter what, this game is a must-have!
B0000CDL93|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining movies ever made.  Oliver Stone has made a masterpiece here that delves into the conspiracy angle.  I think this provides a much more accurate narration of the events during that time than the fictional Warren Commission Report.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|My husband and I have all four seasons and plan on getting the fifth when it becomes available.  This is very different from any of the past Merlin's and King Arthur's that have been done.  This is when they are all very young men and how Merlin grows into becoming a great wizard.  I love the banter between Merlin and King Arthur.  The acting is great and the stories are very well written.  It is a clean program that children can watch. It is refreshing to see a program where you don't have to deal with foul language and sex.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys great acting, magic, and humor.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|To make this short this is a great bond movie, worth the price increase from amazon. I like Daniel Craig as bond, his action  scenes and demeanor best show the bond I imagine.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|The graphics are fabulous! I love the story line that goes along with it.  Very cleaver how they weaved the story in. This is by far the best three match game I have ever played!!!  I hope to see moreover this caliber! !!!
1401937519|5.0|I found this book very interesting and hard to put down. It is very easy to read and has valuable tips for living life.
B007REV4T8|2.0|The three best things: 1) outstanding photography and graphics 2) excellent music and use thereof 3) lots of the previous two. After that, it goes downhill fast.<br /><br />Is there an insanely brilliant archvillain hatching an ingenious complex plot, like Auric Goldfinger noodling out how to control the world's wealth without moving a bar of gold or sinister madman Hugo Drax who strategized how to take purification of the entire race to the ultimate level? Not even close. Instead, you have a Richard Simmons type who's still petulant about an old performance review.<br /><br />And what about the trademark Bond girl? Do we have a clever and powerful Octopussy to challenge the man in Turnbull & Asser threads? Or a lethal Fiona who was equally adept with a pocket automatic or a rocket launched from her motorcycle? No such luck. The selection here is the villain's docile hand puppet and the Bond colleague who resembles a counter girl at Starbucks.<br /><br />Surely, in this day and age they're leaps and bounds beyond the jets concealed in horse trailers, sports cars that convert into submersibles and other machinery that make for innovative chase scenes. Be prepared to fight back the yawn reflex.  There's a motorcycle chase through crowded streets. Have we seen this six or seven or maybe a hundred times? I do give points for the part that careens over rooftops. Then, there's the fight on the train that inevitably leads them to the roof and, brace yourself, having to flatten out when they approach tunnels. What is this, \\"Roy Rogers?\\"<br /><br />I half expected redemption on this at the showdown. Bond decides to lure his nemesis to his remote and deserted childhood home. He stops along the way to pick up his creaky old Aston Martin to fend off the private army of a guy who employs state-of-the-art weaponry, but doesn't even pick up so much as a rifle. And that makes sense to everyone, right?<br /><br />The villain shows up with his troops, an array of automatic weapons and ordnance and an attack helicopter. The door is wide open to bring in the new technogeek Q. Take the eggbeater down with drones piloted by your Xbox. But no, that would make sense.<br /><br />Instead, Bond affixes and lights a fuse to a couple household propane tanks, with the ensuing explosion not only reaching high into the sky and smiting the copter but wiping out the entire estate. You don't have to watch \\"Mythbusters\\" to understand that's about as likely as taking out an Abrams tank with a pack of Mentos and jug of Diet Coke.<br /><br />If you relish over two hours of scintillating eye candy and sound, go for it. But, if your expectations run to innovation, intricate plots, intelligent dialogue and other stimulants to your grey matter, keep moving.
B009439HEY|3.0|@bwstrauss...<br /><br />Yeah, i think you're spot on there. I'm a fan of both early (Gabriel) Genesis as well as Steve H for his amazing guitar work and interpretations. In this album, I don't really feel I got either. I.e., to your point, without Gabriel doing vocals (and clearly that would be pointless to lift his old performances), I really wish there had been way more emphasis on the instrumental side - especially SH's guitar work.<br /><br />In his other (live) work, he definitely takes way more artistic license when playing some of the old Genesis stuff. Some might consider that somewhat blasphemous, but in an album like this I believe that would have been the right approach. Here, this sounds too much like the original studio works instrumentally with a bunch of new vocals that vary in their quality. Really, really wish Steve had varied up his guitar work to compensate...<br /><br />Oh well.
B005LAJ212|5.0|As a huge fan of Revenge, I couldn't wait to watch Season 1 all over again.  The price was fair and I love that Amazon allows you to pre-order a product.  I will be ordering Season 2 when it is available.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|This little book expresses many of the thoughts this writer expresses on her blog.  It combines actual strategies for streamlining one's life and posessions with the thought behind doing such a thing.  The author puts forth some good arguments for removing clutter and living a simpler life.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|liked valentine's day a little bit better but still a good movie.  great price.  would recommend if you like v day or love actually.
B0080R7O7W|5.0|Just wish it would have been less expensive, saw other records just like it for very less than i purchased it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it, can't get enough Downton Abbey! If you haven't seen this series yet, check it out. You won't be disappointed.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I've seen the movie 5 times before I bought it. Hoping that science will bring that inhancement to the public in the near furture.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I don't know how this came up in my reviews twice for only buying one copy of the movie?<br /><br />It's a Blu-ray movie?  What can I review about it? It came new. Sealed and had fast shipping.<br /><br />Great in my book!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very well written. I read this after watching movie, which I enjoyed very much as well. Reading this book gives you more details to enjoy the movie yet again.
B005JE7XW0|4.0|I had no expectation for this movie, but was surprised...very funny.  Right length, If you have a little time to kill, go for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a extremely good game for children and teenagers and it isn't at all.like.temple run at all. This game overall is very good 5 out of 5 stars
B00846F1YW|4.0|Interesting combo of hidden objects and other puzzles. However when you tap screen to zoom in or out or to move to hidden corners you get a 20second penalty for random tapping...annoying.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Millenium trilogy was such a good read. There's the danger and action mixed in with the deep relationships the characters have with each other. It's unfortunate such a brilliant mind in Stieg is no longer here to write another adventure for us.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I payedthe original version for a while but the Second one is way better.  The graphics are better and there is a lot of new obsticals and items
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This is a Great book ....get it ..... Wish I had it five years ago ...so easy to follow and understand
B00881VLCE|4.0|pretty good - doesn't seem to save well _- so if you don't finish you start over - it let me continue one time but the next time I went back it was gone
B005HSL626|2.0|i didn't enjoy this free app and didn't use it for very long. i like a different type of game i guess.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Haven't taken this CD out of my car since I bought it. Well done. Imagine Dragons put music back on the map.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|First off, this is perhaps one of the best movies of 2003 if not the last decade. It's difficult to imagine why it received a luke-warm reception at the box office, but then again so many great movies often don't do as well as they should. Russel Crowe's other notable period piece, Gladiator, achieved phenomenal success with a fraction of the historical detail and depth of dialogue that this film has to offer. I can't think of another film that does this great of a job paying tribute to English naval commanders of that era.<br /><br />While I'm not intimately familiar with British naval history, I get the impression from this film that the warship commanders of the day were cunning tacticians, charismatic leaders, and fearless explorers in their own right. If that is true, then I believe that their story needs to be told in a theatrical format that is both visually stunning and intellectually captivating. This film did just that. Prior to watching this, my last recollection of a memorable film set in this context was \\"The Bounty\\" with Anthony Hopkins and Liam Neeson. It was a terrific film, but had more of a documentary-themed storyline as opposed to action-oriented fiction.<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects is the unique chemistry that plays out between the lead characters Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe, and Dr. Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bettany. Capt. Aubrey is the ship's commander, an officer of the British Royal Navy. Dr. Maturin has the official duty of being the ship's surgeon, but has a broader, more informal role as a naturalist / scientist. Throughout the film, we see occasional glimpses into their personalities as they interact with one another. They have very distinct, contrasting perspectives that at times can be a source of conflict between them. Aubrey, being the ship's commander, has the final say in all matters, but his rank does not preclude his respect and consideration for his good friend and occasional advisor, Dr.Maturin.<br /><br />To put it plainly, their character development is a twist on the relationship between Star Trek's Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock. As is obvious, Kirk is the Star Trek counterpart to Aubrey. The starship Enterprise's science officer, Spock, is a role similar to that of scientist/naturalist Dr. Maturin. However, the similarities end there. The persona portrayed by Bettany as Dr. Maturin contradicts the boring, unfeeling, calculating scientist stereotype -- a stereotype perpetuated by the almost satirically \\"logical\\" Mr. Spock. The scientific nature of Mr. Spock is in fact presented as a flaw of character that limits his \\"human-ness\\" to the point of his being socially inept.<br /><br />What we see from Dr. Maturin is a psychological 180. Not only is he human, but he is what some would call a \\"humanist.\\" He is opposed to disciplinary floggings, taking the side of the offending sailor in one scene. He makes allusions to his disdain for tyrannical establishments, accusing Aubrey of \\"abusing power\\" at one point. He is both compassionate and conscientious. Not only does he mentor the midshipman Mr. Blakely in the ways of science, but while exploring the Galapagos he has the sense of mind to release his coveted live specimens instead of leaving them needlessly imprisoned in cages. His passion for observing nature stems from his appreciation for nature itself, not just from a desire to achieve fame through new discoveries. He provides Aubrey with powerful insight into the intricacies of human nature. This happens when Aubrey expresses his befuddlement over the zealousness of the enemy captain, to which Maturin replies, \\"He fights like you, Jack.\\"<br /><br />His ability to tune out the daily militarized routine of the HMS Surprise by reinventing himself as a naturalist is an attribute that indirectly expands the breadth of their mission. But, as Aubrey put it, \\"We do not have time for your damned hobbies, sir!\\" It's clear that Maturin's approach to leadership isnot befitting an officer in his majesty's navy -- nor is he one. In fact his interpretaton of serving king and country runs counter to that creed on a fundamental level, and that is one more reason why he is an antithesis of the Mr. Spock stereotype.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was another good read that was hard to put down.  Initially I didn't care for the Crossfire series but  after re-reading the first and then this one I can't wait for the third book...but sadly we have to wait until late spring.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Reading this book gives one a good correlation between WWI and modern times. How they got there, how we got to where we are at politically and our unfortunate direction of this civilization.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I actually purchased this on recommendation from one of my sons.  I really enjoy the music and I am very pleased.
B007DIQB50|5.0|For the price that I had paid for this CD was a great deal. I would make the same choice again if I had to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Totally addictive. GREAT APP! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Can't say enough about this app!
B0091LS07E|5.0|For the price paid this was a GREAT BUY. I would make the same purchases again if I had to.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a thoughtful story of looking back and remembering, and going forward as we all must do.  It's an adventure story of a man's life, roads taken and not taken, and where to go when it's over.  We often don't get---nor realize it's possible---to right our missteps earlier in life with easy solutions if we can only see our world and the people in it through different eyes.  This book will give you a &#34;map&#34; of what's possible.  You can try your own &#34;trek&#34; in your own way, or just enjoy this man's voyage and courage to change.  Love conquers all, if we just look for it.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I first watched this movie when I was eighteen, been watching it ever since. I love that when the sequences end it covers everything that happened in the world that year.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Great Music...Another 5 stars for Adele, she has a wonderful sound and her music touches your heart. You won't regret getting this product.
B00BESM14U|3.0|This movie is not even close to the book. However, if you haven't read the book in a while ( it's been about 5 years for me) then it is still a good movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|True love overcomes all obstacles. What a strong and powerful message for those who truly believe in true happiness. Great book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I've always enjoyed Mr. Craig as a 007 Bond. I don't believe there's another movie with that kind of action that he can survive. He deserves a great vote of thanks. He also does great stunts.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|When this app would load it was a lot of fun to play, but it has stopped working. It's definitely the best free app I've used, but right now it's just an annoyance.Is anyone else having this problem?
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Milla Jovovich should have refused to do this picture. She's become way to old for the character and it shows. What's sad is ac tors often times fail to realize when it's time to stop.
B004LV2868|5.0|I was so glad to find this CD. I received it quickly and it was exactly what was represented. I'm so happy with this purchase!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Jeremy Renner was excellent!!!  The producers were correct to change the actor for that role, and what a great young actor they selected. Great movie, Great Cast and Great everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good. Finally finished it. Just not the ending I expected, but good still the same. Can't wait for the movie.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I hate to downrate the app to two stars.  Overall, the app is a nice player.  Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music.  The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone.  At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).<br /><br />If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|of course with any american pie franchise movie... there are some good one liners but the story is getting soooo tired and really has reached the end of the road. the stars are out of college, almost going through midlife crisis... (imagine stiffler getting an IROC and growing his hair long).<br /><br />i enjoyed some of the great one liners (hence 4 stars) but it isn't anything that gets me so pumped where i put it in the same class as American pie 1 or 2
B005LAII80|5.0|It's funny, I never got around to seeing this film when it was out in the theaters, now I realized I did myself a disservice.<br /><br />This movie fulfilled exactly what I was hoping for when I want to see a Judge Dredd movie. Keep in mind, Stallone's version is a guilty pleasure of mine. But Urban's is the definitive Dredd and it is my supreme hope that the franchise can recoup from DVD and BluRay sales.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|This is one of those albums that you hear and every time it moves to another song... you are like holy crap... this is on this album also??<br /><br />this is the type of album you put on when friends are over and you all reminisce about the times where you were in college, chilling out over a few beverages and wishing your finals were over.<br /><br />hard to go wrong with speed of sound or yellow... i mean he wrong it about gweneth.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|February 22 is National Dog Walking Day and if you like dogs or walking a dog, then step up and read this book. It captures your interest in the opening with a professional hit man digging a grave in Savannah's Juliette Low Park just before sunrise then waiting for the victim. It was a beautiful day, \\"...but for one individual that day would not last long.\\"<br /><br />That first chapter was a highlight along with Elliot's time spent in Argentina and his long conversations with the elderly Senor Kurtz, a revered story-teller at La Casa Verde, the restaurant run by Senor Cardasso.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those are the few highlights in Mr. Whitehead's novel. It seems that the author came up with an idea, then, used tortured coincidences to advance the story. The characters, while real, were unusually short tempered to the point of resorting to hit men.<br /><br />The author must feel the reader is stupid, too. He repeats the whole first chapter, word for word in the last few pages and manages to leave out the sacks of lime salts to be used in the burial.<br /><br />Kelly goes to Paris and calls home to her husband Tom. In the first call she reaches him at 11:00 pm her time and is told by Tom that it was 5:00 am in Savannah. The next time she calls him it's 8:00 am her time and guesses it was 2:00 pm in Savannah. Tom tells her it is 3:00 am. Actually Paris is six hours ahead of EDT. Either Kelly is a dim bulb or Tom is lying about the time, or the author doesn't know the correct times.<br /><br />Then there is this scene that makes no sense to me:<br /><br />\\"She had run to a window and marveled at the scene outside. She had never seen such tall buildings, and the man who never smiled told her that one day every city in the world would look like this. She laughed and told him not to be silly, that there were too many beautiful buildings in the world for them all to be knocked down. He had looked somber and he told her that what men had made, men would destroy.''<br /><br />I stayed with the book to the end to see how it would all work out, but too many times I rolled my eyes. The book is labeled a thriller. I would label it a comedy.<br /><br />(I was provided a free copy of this book, but that in no way influenced this review.)><br />I stayed with the book to the end to see how it would all work out, but too many times I rolled my eyes.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Born in LA, lived through the time periods and lived in Modesto for 18 yrs, this books travel through the central valley are right on
B008C401YG|5.0|The album exceeds expectations.  Not only is &#34;old shoes&#34; on it, it also has Thunderbird, and Going Home, which I like as much, or better.  The rest of the album is not what I would call &#34;fill-ins&#34; but are all good songs in their own right.  His lyrics are as deep as Leonard Cohen, (although his voice isn't), and many of them talk to me in a way I can't describe. Thanks Again!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is really run and the graphics are amazing! It's really cool that you can ride in a mine cart, be chased by the super monkey, and go across the zip line to get across large gaps! The scene is brand new and very nice. The only problem would be that when you tilt the device  you have to tilt it really far and its very hard not to fall off when the ledge gets small. Other than that, 5 stars!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|so far i have watched it twice. Glad i have it in my collection. righ now it is loaned out to a friend.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It was good but rather on going like it would never end. I expected it to be with more detail.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|fun, entertaining, violent and decent strategy I really enjoy playing for a couple hours a day<br />what more can I ask for.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|but I'm still not sold on downloading movies on Amazon. This is such a great movie- but it would continually freeze.
B005LAIHTA|4.0|If you can endure the schmaltz (or if you're like me and honestly _like_ schmaltz), this is a lovely romance (released on Valentine's Day 2013) about a young woman with a \\"deep dark secret\\" who finds herself seeking to rebuild her life in a sleepy little town who meets a young widower with two small kids who's trying to rebuild his life as well.  It's Hollywood, so it all has to end well.  But it's actually a pretty good ride evoking films ranging from Cape Fear, Sucker Punch to the tear-jerker Ghost ;-)
0385535147|1.0|I have all his books and most in hardcover. But this will be the last. Mr. Grisham has betrayed his avid readers with drivel that has been getting worse over the past few years. Racketeer is the last straw for me. This book is a contrived, convoluted yarn as told in first person. It is uninteresting and boring with few surprises. It is deceptive but in a simple way.  Mr. Grisham is obviously cashing in on his previous reputation.  Not since Bleachers have I seen such trash from a former master of the legal thriller. Don't waste your money. If you are curious, go to the library and check out a copy. You may finish it by the time it's due back if you are lucky enough to stay awake long enough to get through it.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Having spent 6 months in Afghanistan I was unsure if I wanted to read this book but I am so glad I did.  It was honest, hard hitting, tragic and moving.  Khaled Hosseini is one of the best authors I have read in a long long time.  I can picture everything he writes and feel as though I am watching it on the screen.  Simply brilliant.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|There were some good things and some really bad events. The author should stop killing off the people we like
B006LSZECO|4.0|A real page turner with many twists of plot.  Most improbable seems real.  I think it would make a good movie.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I haven't even look at app yet still waiting for it to download it has been about a half hour now what the hell
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|One of the best Bond films to date, interesting plot, action, introspective and a fun movie to watch on a cold snowy night!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I first heard this CD on PBS here in Las Vegas.  It was a special program with Paul, Diana Krall, Eric Clapton and I fell in love with the whole program.  I had never heard Paul sing some of the old time songs before and although I  have been a fan forever starting with the Beatles this CD, program really got to me.  For anyone who is a Paul McCartney fan I can't imagine them not loving this CD.  Do me a favor and listen to it.<br /><br />Mary Redwing<br />Las Vegas
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|The kids just did not get it and honestly neither did I.  We lost interest and never finished the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The novel started out like a typical high school  teenager coming-of-age story, with a lot of exploration of sexuality and insensitive behaviors.  I even considered not reading on after a few pages but then the story line grabbed my attention as there seemed to be an entirely other set of circumstances beneath the surface that was influencing the two main characters.  As their backgrounds were revealed, the read was gripping to a satisfying conclusion. Mature subjects like suicide, incest, kidnapping and a fear of intimacy drove the story line after the first few pages.
B005GIS1SY|5.0|During our 48 hour rental we watched the movie six times.  The is a good movie with fantastic music, bright colors, humor kids can understand, and a feel good ending that makes you feel warm when the credits start rolling.
B00992CF6W|4.0|So I bought it and got Addicted when I couldn't turn on my computer to play Minecraft, but there are no buckets. When are they going to add buckets?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|If you play the other one this is hard to get used too. ike all the new stuff its just getting used to the new controls.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love it but then on my Kindle Fire, when I click save me, it exits out and I lose all the coins I just earned.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I love this cd!  The quality is great and really it captures the musical and story just perfectly.  The leaflet is good too.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great series .WE started watching Downton after season 2 on Netflixs.Could not find Season 2 .Bought the set .REwatched season one and then season 2 .Alos bought 3rd season .The DVD's are now going around my work .People waiting to watch .
B0006HBZXS|5.0|This film was very underated, but really anything with Anthony Hopkins in it is still pretty good. Good story and beautiful scenery.  You learn some survival skill stuff too.
B003JTHETY|5.0|New material from IRON MAIDEN is always a good thing and this doesn't disappoint.  Kevin Shirley does an impressive job of making these tracks breathe.  Up the IRONS!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This movie is hilarious and has a good message in it.  The kids find it ridiculously funny and it's a good family movie.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|Even if you haven't listened to 5FDP before this is a great album to try them out. Great riffs, good metal and rock. Very reminiscent of Pantera. Good pace for the album. Blurs the line between Metal and Hard Rock and that is a good thing.
0679809015|5.0|This small board book is the perfect thing to keep in a diaper bag to entertain babies from 6 month and on. With bright animal images and lots of flaps we can talk about the animal names and sounds while waiting for dr appointments or at a restaurant table. We literally never leave home with out it.
1400069289|5.0|Surely you can create back your life to the life you wanted for when you understanding about the habit form in your life. This book have totally changed my view regarding myself and people around me.<br />This is a true scientific knowledge that need to be learned by everyone. The book contains vast information in scientific view and experience of people.<br /><br />Surely you can create back your life to the life you wanted for.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a really great game and I love that so far I didn't need to buy any thing, the only thing is that I think this might be one of those games where eventually you'll have to come on every day. Besides that its a really good game so I would totally recommend this game at 5 stars.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie was great!  It had the love story, the mystery, the suspense and the villian!  But - it also had the happy ending.  Very entertaining.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Very detailed with plenty of facts.  Sobering.  Helpful.  I would recommend this book to any serious minded individual.  It answers the admonition:  Get the facts!
B0051VH1EG|5.0|Thank You Ms Massey for writing this book and for your products!!! Love the book & DVD very informative and the products are awesome. You will find the products can be pricey unless you shop around here on Amazon, that being said if your a curly girl all the $$$ you've spent on products that don't work it evens out overall. I know this is supposed to be a review about the book (love it) but it really goes hand in hand with the products so that's why I've put it in here. So glad I'm not the only curly girl with nightmarish memories of my hair (mostly at others hands) growing up. And the old pictures so funny ahh memories! LoL!!!
B008645YXA|5.0|This is classic rock n roll. A 1975 album masterpiece produced by Bob Ezrin. You definetley got to listen to this record before you die. It is pretty intense. The song Steven is a nice horror experience. The other night I heard it with no lights, just a couple of candles and it gave me the chills when Alice started calling Steven. Musically it is divine and tracks such as The Black Widow and Department of Youth are exquisite rock tunes. Be a part of Alice nightmare it'll be fun. \\"Steeveeeen, Steeveeeen...\\"
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Was looking for an everyday watch. And so far this is just what I wanted. Read some info online that it might lose time. But so far hasn't missed a beat.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|There aren't enough relationship movies about children and parents. This has a blend with Eastwood and Timberlake sharing the male parts, Eastwood of course leading, Also relationship between the scout and the player worked well too. Underrated to me. Clint just gets better as he goes!
0670026603|5.0|Wow. This book grabbed me from the beginning and I found myself wanting to read more and more. I was only a few chapters in and I was already looking for more books by this author. She has a writing style about her that I really like. I found myself towards the end of the book wanting to read it because I was so wrapped up in the story between Will and Lou but then I didn't want to reach the end and have it be over. Totally recommend this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love downtown Abby . My daughter got me started with this and now I can't get enough of it
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I'm not a big fan of bad boys, though I know quite a few girls are, and I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about Travis Maddox. Though his jealousy tirades and anger issues I could have done without, there was also something about him that drew me in. I went from hating him, being charmed by him, hating him and then liking him again. I did enjoy the story and always appreciate a book that can keep me interested in the characters.<br />Well done Jamie McGuire. The whole time I was reading I was between 4 and 5 stars. Looking forward to #2.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It rules it has so many words in other languages and i loved the english part of it it rules
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />I was very eager to read this book. It really took me into a world that I knew nothing about. At times I thought maybe I was going to give it 4stars but it just never grabbed a hold of me as I hoped. I enjoyed all the times when the author talked about Augustus and Hazel. I like how their relationship developed. I liked how two young kids in a crappy situation found each other. I enjoyed their time in Amsterdam and their first kiss. Who gets to say they had their first kiss at Anne Franks place? And then it went further and they had sex. But it just all lacked for me. I guess I wanted Hazel to talk more about her feelings for him. She just shared a first kiss with the guy and had sex. His first time, not sure about for her. I don't remember it saying. And not that I wanted juicy details of that night, just a little more substance with these 2 kids.<br /><br />I read the below sentence on someone else's review and I would have to agree....<br /><br />\\"But ultimately, what pissed me off was the fact that the book gets so deep, and at the same time says absolutely nothing.\\"
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Book was pretty good. Sort of a weird character to draw upon but in the end it works and provides a good story
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the mysterious side of it. I really liked that I knew the 2 main characters that are going to be in the movie coming up so it really helped me paint the mental picture. What I didn't like was how wordy all the details were. I found myself at times jumping 3 words at a time to get to the point. I'm all for a good descripting author but at times I think it was a bit much. And I will agree with some other reviews that it did remind me of the movie Sleeping With The Enemy. Which is not all bad because I like that movie.<br />I will be seeing this movie when it comes out.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love it!! Fantastic show  Great show can't wait for the next season to begin.  Season ending leaves you wanting more
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|How sad it is to see how kiwi Hollywood has gone to make us laugh.To think grownups would find this funny is showing where society is heading.Let us not go there.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. I was having problems charging my kindlye &amp; this really let me track the problem. now that the issue is resolved, its a fast way to see how much time I have left to read!
B002GIBVV6|5.0|loved watching this as a kid and now im glad i bought it. it was exactly as described and now i will watch it all the time
B0041KVW2K|2.0|Come on. This is the Beatles. This vinyl box set should have set a high standard for all to follow, yet this is not the case. Three of my lps are in terrible shape, and I am still waiting for their replacements. Two other lps are simply annoying with quality issues. Unacceptable. Rainbo is the US pressing plant, and they have done a grave disservice to this seminal group.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I love all the franchise of the the furious five and recommend to everyone I watch it at least once a week or more and can't wait for the next one
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|A completely unlikely and original premise.  Hilariously inappropriate.  Absurdly heartwarming that only works with a teddy bear and a typical not grown up guy.  Wahlberg is great, but a tad too old for the part.
B00000FC5H|5.0|There one of the best groups in the world and what I and my family have grown up on so I would definetly recommend to friends.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Not only is there lots of action, SoA has great character development and multiple sub-plots.  Seems like it would be hard not to like it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I can get through these levels better than the original Angry Birds game. Some are trickier but I manage to do it.
1594203334|4.0|I have to admit for it... I fell for this one.<br /><br />I bought this book hoping that it would offer a bit more advice or technique on how it is French parents raise their children. Instead it wasn't quite that.<br /><br />Reading the book, written by a journalist in a journalistic style (which I as a journalist appreciated) the author for approximately the first half of the book approaches the topic as an 'assignment' interviewing experts, citing sources, and describing some of her own experiences.<br /><br />This includes the differences in birth for the French (which she later somewhat contradicts in a latter chapter on a different French birth experience.)<br /><br />The differences in how French parents approach eating, bedtime and other common parenting topics.<br /><br />The author even attempts to contrast all this with how &#34;Americans&#34; raise their children.<br /><br />And here again we seem to face what appears to be the biggest problem with this book. It wasn't MORE thoroughly researched. It's as though she wrote both the French experience and the American experience less from extensive interviews with various topical experts and actual parents and more from casual conversation and observation. You might ask, 'well, what's wrong with that?'<br /><br />Imagine if you will a report on American single lifestyles in New York City and the person only wrote the book after watching the TV shows &#34;Friends&#34; and &#34;Sex in the City.&#34;<br /><br />You wouldn't have a fair or accurate portrayal of what's really going on.<br /><br />As an example Mrs. Druckerman says that American parents fear putting their children in daycare. Whom did she talk to other than her clique of friends from New York for this blanket statement? There are plenty of parents that don't like daycare because of the expense, but they like that it allows them to go back to work and for their children to develop socially.<br /><br />Druckerman also titles the book &#34;One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting&#34; yet by the end of the book she admits that she doesn't do everything the French way.<br /><br />Where the book succeeds however is in reassuring normal people who grew up with normal, caring parents, that they will be OK and that so called 'helicopter parents' are the crazy ones. That is, if you had a mother or father who took you to the library and let you pick out a book for you to read yourself and one for your parents to read to you later -- you had chores and were punished if you didn't do them -- you had, well, limits. Then you'll probably do fine as a parent.
0765325950|5.0|A much better, more true-to-Style (Robert Jordan) than the last two books. Many threads pulled into shape. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|While some of the humor is a little over the top (and what's wrong with that?) This movie is great! Will Ferrell stars as a human raised by elves who comes to meet his true father in New York. Along the way hijinks ensue. Zooey Deschanel is an incredible beauty and shows off her amazing singing skills as well.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend getting it and watching it.
B004GGTAQE|5.0|This book is very well written and contains many first hand accounts of German Panzer Tanks in battle with the Russians on the Eastern Front. The author is a highly decorated tank company commander who faught in many battles. Anyone interested in WWII military history told from a front line perspective will like this book.
0395389496|5.0|While it wasn't my favorite story growing up, because my son was born around Christmas it seemed appropriate to purchase this book. The artwork is beautiful.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book again, after many decades!  Though it is a story about boys ... perhaps for boys ... Mark Twain was a master story teller.  I recommend this book for all readers!  It remains a well-written tale ... dbr
0525953728|5.0|I bought this book because my local library didn't have it.<br /><br />I wanted to know why a special operator -- someone who knows the value of secrecy and the price that breaking it can cost -- would write such a book. I was hoping that he would answer that question more than wanting to know whatever details he might spill about the operation itself.<br /><br />What I got was exactly what I was hoping for.<br /><br />While the Pentagon was apparently worried he would disclose too many details about the SEALs and training. Most of what's contained in the book in that regard has already appeared on TV, in movies, documentaries and other books.<br /><br />Mr. &#34;Owen&#34; goes into his personal experience -- his journey to becoming a SEAL -- and what it meant to him. He goes into the rigor of training, the stress of the deployments and finally -- yes what most people will be buying this for -- details about the mission to kill bin Laden.<br /><br />Finally he also opens up about why he wrote the book -- and his explanation -- while it may not hold water for others, is logical. I'm not going to spoil it for you.<br /><br />Buy the book. Read it. Keep it. Read it to your children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't stop watching ..... and whatever you do DO NOT skip ahead.  I am hooked and cant wait for season 4 but I read online it won't air in the US until Jan 2014.  Reason enough to move to England.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I don't play it very frequently, but in a doctor's office or while waiting for some other event, it's fun to play.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Looks great, works great. Totally the easiest fraction calculator out there, hands down. And I have a few physical calculators I've bought over the years to know. Where was this then? :)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|love except for a few glitches<br />but fun to play and free so no worry about it except if buy a some gems
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not a bad game if your looking to kill time. Doesn't really require any skill-but passes the time pretty quickly.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this game is preaty good however it would be a lot better if amazon would update it to the current version 1.5.0
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Priceless collection that everyone should watch at least once in their lives.  Was thrilled to get the boxed set on Blu-Ray
B008133MDK|5.0|This season brings focus and more insight into the personal flaws of these fascinating characters. This is what I wanted to see.
B003YGSLDA|4.0|Yet another twist on the story of &#34;Santa&#34;-- It's an oldie, but definitely one worth watching during the holiday season.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Interesting twist that we have seen before but implemented deftly here. Updated stories based on stories we have all read. Uncompromising characters. Fine acting. Insightful writing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|National Lampoon's never fails to amuse us.  While dealing with the stress of the holiday season, it's nice to watch a movie that proves your not alone.  Non-stop laughter.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its a pretty cool app. it helps me see what the state of my battery is. I don't like the fact it overtakes any other app I'm running but small price to pay I guess
B00006879E|5.0|Can't say enough about this CD.  Definitely my favorite out of all the Maroon 5 CD's. Not a song on there I didn't like.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Great album, love their work. Makes me want to play bango.  cant wait for the next album to arrive soon
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I have several different kinds of calendering systems, but this one has insured that I never forget when a bill is due.  When it sends a reminder, I know to pay the bill, it is that simple.  I have had this app for a few years, and I have not had any issues with them deleting information, or trying to get additional information from me.  It has proved to be one of the most valuable apps I have ever downloaded.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love Imagine Dragons, and I don't think there is a song on this CD that I dislike! Its awesome!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is challenging and fun to play.  I love the graphics and the pace of the game.  Easy to play and advance through.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book beyond words. It was so unique and beautiful I couldn't put it down. I borrowed this book through our library's eBook system from Amazon.<br /><br />The story was enchanting.<br /><br />I loved how this book flowed between characters and wove them together. It was written in such a unique way; blending second and third person so that you barely noticed the transition between the two. You felt as if you were a fly on the wall of every character. You experience the circus as a performer, as a patron, and as someone who knew every intimate details of the circus.<br /><br />It was one of those books that I didn't want to end. I savored each word; each sentence. So well written I have recommended it to many people and I recommend it to all of you!
B005D4YOJ6|5.0|Looks good - the leather makes them quite dressy<br />Fits Great<br />Super Comfortable<br />add to my collection of keen shoes
B009NX409M|3.0|it was sort of slow and sweet and 80's.  I am not sure I like that both characters were married and not committed to those relationships.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This movie was truly one of Denzel Washington's best!  I did not expect the intensity of this movie.  The way in which you saw the truth about addiction both through drugs and booze.  I think all addicts should see this movie to see how they destroy not just their lives but the people who love them.  This movie gives you a real look at how out of control a person can get when using drugs and booze.  Thanks Denzel you did it again!
B008Y6SGC6|5.0|I have seen this movie before, I wouldn't want to own it but I did enjoy watching it again.  I wish more people got what she got out of rehabilitation
B007TXN4TK|5.0|If you long to play piano, and don't know how..you will love piano master. It's worth the download.<br />And the time to play.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|The author paints a sordid picture of life in the pre-WWII Peking.  Its a sad tale about depravity, murder, and the insensitivity of a corrupt and stressed government bureaucracy that fails Pamela and her father.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|i missed him and his scotland.  a man with good music, an interesting array of aquaintances and who doesn't need me.  what more could i ask for.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I received the 11 disc collection instead of the 8 that was originally displayed, but I do not care because I got a superior product thanks to the seller who wanted to give this franchise justice by giving customers the best at a good price. all movies look fantastic in my HDTV and my PS3 and my wife and I enjoy Harry Potter a lot. Totally recommend this collection!
B0076DELIG|5.0|exciting,humane, pacey enough so that you don't need to second guess the story.  The story has good twists and bosch is a lucky individual, again the pace of the story make suspension of disbelief sustainable.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|This movie is not just about reviving a dog. But to also pay homage to old horror movies that became classics over the decades in one great story. I am glad that Tim Burton chose black and white as well as stop-motion animation over cgi to deliver something unique as well as engaging from start to finish.
0553801473|1.0|Such a disappointment......this book had no conclusion!!!! I loved the first 3 books, the four left much to be desired and now the concluding book had no ending!
1742200206|3.0|Lonely Planet's New York City guide book seems like an adequate that could be useful to most people visiting the city. Although thoroughly going through the book I have yet to actually use it in the field. The maps included do look pretty good and the general information on sites and museums also was of interest and practical. Any book like this on New York City is just a bite out of the apple however.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book has so much precious information!<br />Doesn't matter if you're new to working out or dieting or if you are (or think you are) an expert...<br />This book has opened my eyes to see how things really work.<br />Gaining muscle and burning fat isn't nearly as complicated as the magazines and supplement industry want you to believe. It's quite simple actually. Not easy, but simple. It's all about knowing what you're doing at all times. Taking notes of what is done and notes of the changes.<br />If you have been struggling like me with real gains, read this book and you will clearly see what you've been doing wrong and how to fix it. Once you learn it, everything will be progress! :)
B00BESJYAY|4.0|As far as Hollywood surf flicks go, Chasing Mavericks was pretty good. Decent story that will keep the ladies happy and a quality cinematography and surf-related action to keep surfers interested. I didn't expect much from this movie, but I ended up liking it. I would rank it way way above Hollywood's other attempts to capture the essence of surfing in a film (eg: Point Break, In Gods Hands, Blue Crush, etc).
1416575464|5.0|I LOVE this book, so beautiful and inspiring. Every time I pick it up I see something new I love. Buy it!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I usually don't review products I have not bought. My wife bought the DVD 007 Bond movie Skyfall. We just got done viewing it.<br /><br />The color and sound on the DVD was great, no problems there. I won't ruin the movie for you, just give little tidbits of interest.<br /><br />The rugged, more thuggish, more ruthless, less games playing, older looking and not as pumped up Daniel Craig (my second best favorite Bond,after the original S.C.) acts great in this movie. However the one who INMO did an even better acting job was \\"M\\" (Judy Dench). She did a shady bad deal to another agent years ago and that comes back to haunt her big time. Silva (Javier Bardem ) plays a good waco villain/ex agent) in this movie. INMO, this was the best role of \\"M\\" in any of the Bond 007 movies.<br /><br />Typical lots of action. Daniel Craig gets severely injured and is written off as dead, accidently killed by field agent Eve (Naomie Harris). He comes back to help after MI6 is attacked, members killed and \\"M\\"s life is threatened by a madman ex \\"betrayed\\" agent.<br /><br />Scenery was great and we see some of Bond's ancestry and former home in Scotland....Skyfall. Also brought back was the old machine guns, ejector seat Astro Martin. Shades of Goldfinger. Great!<br /><br />I was impressed that there was very little weirdo improbable futuristic devices. Even the new, nerdy young  \\"Q\\" doesn't pull out too many weird inventions for Bond. There was Bond's gun electronically imprinted so only he can fire it. Cool. This INMO was a more believable Bond movie. Less clowning around and more of the darker side of \\"M\\" and the love/hate relationship Bond has with his boss.<br /><br />A very good, enjoyable 007 movie with \\"M\\" Judy Dench playing a great role. A great ending I won't ruin. INMO probably around 6 or 7 out of 23 as the best Bond 007 movie.  4 3/4 stars.<br /><br />Again this movie was more about \\"M\\" and her past and her shady deal she did to an ex agent. Both \\"M\\" Judi Dench and Bond 007 Daniel Craig meshed well in this movie and their characters drew strength from each other. Not the typical Bond/M interaction.aniel Craig meshed well in this movie and their characters drew strength from each other. Not the typical Bond/M interaction.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|LAWLESS.  Good action movie. Great story. This movie also is also educational. We enjoyed watching the movie during the blizzard.

B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I'll definitely watch it again.  Well done and interesting.  Some naysayers did not enjoy because of the historical correlation, but it is what it is IMHO.

B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Sure some parts are rude and offensive with the language, but we actually enjoyed this movie.  Much to our surprise there was acutally a plot to follow.  I'd say watch it when you need a mood lift.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Received the product one day after it become available, and even at a lower price.  LOVE IT!!  Can't wait for season 4
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Suspenseful, great interpretation and very entertaining. Every episode maintains the tension of the action and the involvement of the spectator. Had a great time watching it and probably I will watch it again in a few months.
0767817729|5.0|Great movie - one of my all time favorites.  Based upon Jim Harrison's novella of the same name.  Great story line - lots of action - sad ending.  Well acted.  Gotta' love the Kevin!  Not for kids.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I belong to a book club and we choose to read \\"Gone Girl: A Novel\\".  It was on the NY Times best seller list.  Have yet to hear one of the women say they enjoyed the book.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  It falls in the category of one of the worst books I have ever read.
B000AARKO4|5.0|Great movie.  Orlando Bloom is hot!  Well scripted - well acted.  Lots of action.  If you like medieval history, this one's for you.  Based upon actual people and events.  Highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a super fun game and very very addictive. one of the best free games I have played in a ling time.
1616550414|5.0|Incredibly detailed and beautiful art, as well as the much-desired official timeline of all the games (finally!). I've been waiting for a U.S. release since the book was first announced for Japan, and Dark Horse does not disappoint.  A must-have book for one of the greatest game series ever created.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I love the album and always have. The quality is excellent. The whole package is golden, but the tracks on disc three really shine. Well worth the price.
0062200909|5.0|Anyone who has any previous LOTR art books will know what to expect with this: a wealth of stunning artwork of the design process. Weta continues to impress me with how much detail they put into these films, and as an artist myself, I find the book to be quite inspiring.<br />While all of the artwork and sketches are beautiful (especially those by Alan Lee and John Howe), I like the addition of Bilbo's Burglar Contract and Thorin's Map as well.

B0063IH60K|5.0|For a free game, this one I cannot put down. I play it all the time. Card selection flows quite well with the touch screen. I have not had any problems with this game. Very well designed. Worth getting, especially if you need something to pass the time.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|This is a hilarious movie, bur definitely not for children to see. If you want a laugh (tad bit crude in some parts) I recommend seeing this. I received this DVD quickly, packaged securely, and it was a smooth transaction.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a physician, I have wanted to write some stories about brave patients, especially children. Here is the story I wish I had written. This is not maudlin! This is funny, adventuresome, inspiring, sometimes confusing, frustrating and beautiful. Recommend this book to people who need to renew their faith in young people and the welfare of the human race.<br />There is really no sickness here, only love of life as it should be.<br />Good for old people to read too..lots of memories can be had.<br />Great language on the pages, clarity is brilliant.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I enjoyed this season as much as the previous ones. They keep coming up with new ideas! This is as well-written as ever!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Mental illness rarely takes on such a great story. Very realistic portrayal of signs, symptoms, perceptions, dynamics and treatment. Family dynamics are particularly well portrayed. Element of surprise well timed. Ending was long awaited because that  silver lining took so long in coming.<br />Mental health professionals, social workers, sports psychologists, and people who have family suffering from mental illness should read this..there are characters to recognize in cross cultural and cross gender roles..<br />I read it to see how well this could be done, and how credible it could be. I was pleased.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|New ideas and great acting keep this fresh. Well-written always keeps you guessing! I won't ruin the ending but it was great!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Focus on politics and a triumverate of legislators, this book is a revelation and montage of an aspect of history. The women in this book are especially interesting and a surprise find in much of historical narrative. Very curious stories about the women really capture the imagination. The movie from the book is not the same. I am happy to have read the book and not settled for the movie. Both were good accounts but different.<br />Keeping you enemies close to you appears to be a good thing for Lincoln. Lessons learned here show the nemesis of the unknown enemy proving to be lethal.<br />Long story recommended for thoughtful readers.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have tried a handful of puzzle games/apps and this one fits what I like. You can choose more pieces to put together for sizes to make the puzzle longer to complete. Normal jigsaw puzzles I like the 1,000 to 2,000 to put together along with complex shapes and good photos. The only thing is I wish there were more free pictures to get.

B007REV4YI|1.0|I BOUGHT MINE FROM TARGET, IT WOULD NOT PLAY ON MY BLU RAY PLAYER. THE STORE WOULD NOT REFUND ONLY REPLACE AND THE SECOND ALSO WOULD NOT PLAY. MY BLU RAY PLAYS WITHOUT PROBLEM EVERY BLU RAY I OWN (40) AND ALL MY DVD's (30O) WITHOUT A PROBLEM. I CALLED THE STUDIO THEY CLAIM IT'S MY PLAYER AND WOULD ONLY REPLACE, AT MY EXPENSE, WITH ANOTHER. ENOUGH WITH ALL THE FIRMWARE AND UPDATES. IF IT WILL NOT PLAY ON A STANDARD BLU RAY PLAYER PUT A WARNING ON THE BOX AND STOP TRYING TO SCAM THE PUBLIC.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love that this version exists in a completely different environment than the old game--in the clouds. There are variations in the &quot;track&quot; you run, including hills, stairs, and even a very cool tunnel where you ride in a cart on rails. This alone makes the game more exciting and fun. There are still similarities in gameplay, like frustrating things to trip over, the powerups you jump up to get, and the scary mutant monkey beast trying to eat you at every turn.<br /><br />There are frustrations...one of which is thst the beast is huge and RIGHT on your heels and every time you duck, jump, etc. he does the same, which really gets in my way and makes it difficult to see where I'm going or what target I'm going for. Irritating!!!<br /><br />All in all, though, I'm enjoying the game.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven is not a memorable story and not one of Nicholas Sparks best. I ordered it because Sparks is usually very good.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|This travel app has been very helpful in finding lodging and restaurants. The only problem I had with it, was that often there was no contact number listed for the motel I was interested in. I would have to use another app (YP) to get a phone number. It would also be very helpful if motels would list their animal policy, as so many people travel with their pets these days. Unless a reviewer happens to mention it, you don't know until you call them, IF you can call them.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Entertaining yet disturbing portrayal of addiction.  Denzel Washington's acting was terrific.  John Goodman was thoroughly repulsive in role as a drug dealer - as was expected.  Worth the watch.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Great movie. Urban was a great choice to portray Dredd in the fashion he did. Action packed and well paced.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully done period soap opera!  Okay, it's really a step up from a soap opera.  Can't wait for the next season!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched Season 2 in one marathon session and totally enjoyed every minute of it. The perfect way to sit out a terrible winter storm.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I love the new Bond movies and this one was no exception.  Daniel Craig is amazing!  It's a must-see for anyone who likes adventure movies.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|When the description said &quot;over 200 levels&quot; I was expecting the levels to be different from each other.  All the levels are identical except for the score you have to reach--and if you reach the top score target, you still have to play again and again to reach the lower skill targets.<br /><br />That said, it's still a solid match-3 game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I first saw season 2 on KQED..<br />Now I am even more impressed.<br />What a cast?<br />I am glad I got the bluray version.<br />The picture quality is doing the justice to the production.

B008QDCZJ2|4.0|This is another solid collection of catchy songs by the Pet Shop Boys, an album that should please most longtime fans. It truly is impressive that they can keep putting out albums as consistently good as this one. As on past albums, you will find some true gems, songs that will rank among your favorite PSB numbers, along with other tracks that don't really catch fire or the imagination.<br /><br />I bought this \\"Deluxe\\" edition that contains 2 CDs, the second disc containing intrumental versions of the songs on Disc 1. I played Disc 2 only two times, finding it more than a bit boring. Really, I'm not sure what the whole point was with that idea. Some clever remixes would have been a treat, but just the instrumental tracks of the same exact songs? Not much to get excited about with that \\"bonus.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|very edgy and interactive very cool graphics too. I get a rush every time I play this game and never get tired
B0078ZYXSA|4.0|At this point most Dexys fans know the story behind this long-awaited new album, and judging from the reviews so far the reaction is definitely mixed. Being a longtime Dexy's Midnight Runners fan, this was just one of those CDs that I was going to buy no matter what, and when I saw it at a shop in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year I bought it in a heartbeat. Well, it's good. Very good, in fact. But I don't think it quite qualifies as the \\"instant classic\\" that Mojo magazine labeled it in their rave review a few months back. That said, this album is a grower, taking many listens to absorb properly, and if I give it a few more months, I'll either be sick of the darn thing or even more impressed with it.<br /><br />For certain, this is not the old Dexy's sound. It's daring and different, yet there is a familiar feel at times too. The joy and the horns and the fiddles and festive vibe found on their first two albums is in short supply here; the overall vibe more muted and refined. Kevin moans and groans but he also --- as the album title infers --- soars on occasion too. And yes, there are hints of the old Dexy's sound on some tracks: I love it when he lets loose and swaggers forth into a soulful strut. Go, Kevin, Go! The moods and rhythms on this album cascade and swirl like a bubbling river stream. From morose to uplifting. Some tunes meander on too long for my tastes. Perhaps that's just Kevin getting too wrapped up in his artistry, but that's part of who he is as a musician, so as a fan you come to expect such self-indulgant moments. But the highs on this album are very good and there are many rapturous and joyful songs that will make you smile. The vocal interplay between Kevin and the Madeleine Hyland is frisky and fun, and having Mick Talbot (of Style Council fame) on keyboards (and contributing to the songwriting) is another bonus.<br /><br />I can understand the disappoint of those fans who have waited all these years/decades hoping for a return to the glorious days of \\"Searching for the Young Soul Rebels\\". This certainly isn't a return to form in that sense. But if you approach this album with an open mind and allow these songs to work their charms, you'll be quite pleased.ys of \\"Searching for the Young Soul Rebels\\".

B005LAIH4A|2.0|Why does Hollywood seem to stumble so badly whenever it decides to make a film with an environmental message?  It seems that almost any movie I've seen that tries to have a \\"save the Earth\\" message comes across as preachy and heavy-handed.  \\"Ferngully: The Last Rainforest,\\" \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" James Cameron's \\"Avatar,\\" the horrible remake of \\"Day the Earth Stood Still\\"... all of them seem to prefer beating us over the head with environmentalist propoganda over telling a decent story.  There are a few decent ones that manage to balance their message with a well-told story and likable characters (I'll get to those at the end of the review), but for the most part I've seen enough \\"save the Earth\\" films that favor preaching over quality that I instinctively cringe whenever the issue comes up in a movie.<br /><br />\\"The Lorax,\\" based on one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books growing up, falls into the \\"too preachy\\" to be enjoyable category, and isn't helped by all the usual suspects when it comes to animated kids' films, especially kids' films based on children's books.<br /><br />The film takes place in Thneedville (a location not in the original book), an over-the-top city where everything is plastic and artificial, including the trees, and the air and water are so badly polluted that a child who goes swimming comes out glow-in-the-dark and the citizens must buy bottled air to live.  Our main character (nameless in the book, called Ted here) decides the best way to impress a girl he likes is to find an extinct, nearly-mythic object called a tree and give it to her.  Following his kooky grandmother's advice, he visits a crotchety recluse called the Once-ler, who tells him the sad story about how he destroyed Thneedville's environment despite the efforts of a guardian creature called the Lorax, and gives him the key to restoring the trees and repairing the damage he did.  The greedy, over-the-top mayor of Thneedville considers Ted's efforts a threat, however, and plots to thwart his plans...<br /><br />The original book is a classic, a bittersweet plea to take better care of our world and take responsibility for our actions.  In my honest opinion, it would have performed much better as a half-hour TV special than as a full-length movie, and padding the story's length with a romantic subplot, cartoony antics, and badly-written musical numbers (seriously, these are some the weakest songs I've heard in an animated movie since \\"Quest For Camelot\\") just makes it painfully obvious that there wasn't enough story to fill an hour and a half.  When will Hollywood learn that stretching a children's picture book into a feature-length movie rarely works?  (I'm looking at you, \\"Polar Express\\" and \\"Ant Bully...\\")<br /><br />The movie has all the attention span of a goldfish, with too-bright colors, characters that never seem to hold still, and an unrelenting pace that never pauses to let the viewer breathe and process what they've seen.  The characters are, with a few exceptions, either bland or just plain annoying.  Said exceptions are Ted's spirited grandmother (voiced quite appropriately by Betty White) and the bombastic mayor, an over-the-top villain who provides the most laughs in the film.  The title character himself suffers the worst, however -- he's reduced to a minor role, with Ted and the mayor hijacking the film, and he goes from a wise guardian character to a cranky wisecracker.  I also felt that Danny Devito's voice did not fit the original character, and that the character was rewritten to fit the actor, when it should have been the other way around.<br /><br />And yes, the film gets incredibly preachy, so much so that it becomes tiresome to watch.  It's possible to make a children's movie that has an environmental message without being terribly heavy-handed about it (such as WALL-E), but \\"The Lorax\\" manages to miss the mark.  It doesn't help that it was also a merchandise-driven film, which rather goes against its anti-materialistic message.<br /><br />While not an entirely terrible film, neither is this necessarily a good film.  It will entertain young children, I'm sure, but I imagine older children and most adults would quickly grow annoyed with it.  The fact that it butchers and pads out a beloved children's book doesn't help it either.<br /><br />For a better film that manages to carry its environmental message quite well without sacrificing storytelling, I recommend the aforementioned \\"WALL-E\\" or Miyazaki's \\"Castle In the Sky\\" or \\"Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind.\\"  Or seek out the 2D animated \\"Lorax\\" special -- it's more faithful to the book.stic message.<br /><br />While not an entirely terrible film, neither is this necessarily a good film.

The Dumbook, That other one where channing tatum runs around kissing her feet for two hours; they are all the same movie.

I found myself breathing like was actually running from location to location. The mini games really got my attention. They made you think. You can do this. My one and only problem is the bonus continuation game that you receive in the end. I didn't receive it. It's like a good book you don't want to put down. Please continue to make games like this one available and you will always have me for customer. Can't wait to play part 2.

B005LJKEXS|5.0|I previously left a negative feedback. I purchased this USB extension wire for my ALFA wifi antenna. The Alfa drops the signal every 2-3 seconds when connected to this wire. At first I thought it was a defective wire. But after further testing, the Alfa antenna continues to drop the signal on any wire extension. I do not understand why? I will say BlueRigger is a great company. They immediately responded to my negative review with any support I needed. BlueRigger is a trustworthy company on Amazon. Now I will try a single cord with a mini jack on one end and a USB on the other end for my APLHA antenna. Thank you BlueRigger.

B009JZPH32|4.0|This is a film for the middle class US audience who need a perspective on drug manufacture and distribution different from the Miami Vice take. The main characters, two US cannabis entrepreneurs, embody a group of young people with an ethic that is far more interesting than the the usual action film depiction of the greedy executive on the 86th floor of an urban skyrise.  Their dualist moralities are a metaphor for the spirituality seeking/relief from emotional anguish duality that drives the consumption of mind altering substances in this country (the US).  The narrator is their lover, a very appealing, educated, and lost young woman. The cast and acting are excellent, the sex, the best I have seen in awhile, the politics- right on. Hayak, Benicio, and Travolta are excellent in their roles, highlighting some touches of humanity and family values, with a large dose of monstrosity on the part del Toro that is all too reminiscent of what we suspect goes on at in increasing gallop in the world.

Within days I had ordered this second season and finished watching it within days as well.  It has a little something for everyone - drama, action, romance, comedy (Maggie Smith is deadpan hilarious) and even a little history.  Watch it - I bet you'll be hooked too!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I do like this version of the Robin Hood legend saga....there's many out there, some good, some not so good....this I can almost believe could be the fact based viable historical telling of the story, if there is one.  Russell Crowe is a manly, single minded but sincere personality.  Watch the out-takes for even more insight into how he personified his telling of the character.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Endless, endless narrative by a child of murderers trying to explain it to himself when the answer is clear fairly soon--they were just weak people who couldn't anticipate consequences.  Borrrring.
B001DHXT20|4.0|By far....the CGI work was much better, and I like Edward Nortons' portrayal.  Liv Tyler is good with her character not some namby-pamby simpering daughter, her.....she stands up to her father well.  The other creature (the Hulks nemesis) in this movie is almost too much but does give a reason for the Hulk reemerging after Doctor Banner's self inflicted exile.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|great show cant wait to watch every week . The action isn really good . Also like the character development.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game for all ages. It can also get your brain working trying to figure out how to get the sleepwalker across safely.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game. nice graphics very fun. game works great on the kindle fire. its easy to earn the gems too unlike some other games.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be on blu ray and my family loves it.  Best show ever created.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Black Keys and this album doesn't disappoint! Lonely Boy is my favorite song of the track!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I love this era and the aristocrats, fun to imagine what it was like. Gives you a glimpse into their past.
B0000714BP|5.0|if you are feeling blue, this is a feel good movie with a hint of romance. I pop this movie end to cheer me up.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Not happy with it.  Too bulky and can't get it to seal.  The rubber- like material on the side sticks to pockets.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Being unable to read anymore I search for things to entertain myself.  Television is out, too many commercials.  I don't like movies where the plot is replaced by shock factor as the screenwriters see how much meaningless sex and forced verba; obsenities they can employ.  This movie has a clear plot, well acted and entertainment value.  Am I prejudiced?  Of course.  Who isn't?  Will you like this movie?  Impossible to tell.  All I can say is I liked it enough to give four stars.
0486281523|5.0|great purchase, exactly as described. not much else to really say about it other than a good bargain for the price
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was my first book on my new kindle and I was pleased with the service, and time of delivery.
B00597A6NU|5.0|A sympathetic and family friendly look at B-17 flying in early to mid WWII European theater.  A good view of the postive contributions by the Greatest Generation.  It is reaonably accurate for what the air war was like at that time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven was written by a real professional.  The medical terms were explained for the lay person to understand.  Very realistic.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|In the introduction the author stays he wanted to create a lovely children's tale without all the sad moral mishaps of old fairytales; and he fully succeeded!
0441013597|2.0|At first I was really loving this book. The whole idea of this desert planet where water is gold and worms s*** money. But as time went on, I started to become really paranoid about water. I had to have a glass of water next to me every time I would sit down and read a chapter. It was bad. The book kept making me so thirsty. Eventually it became even worse when friends would come over to my house and ask for a drink. I couldn't bring myself to hand them a bottle of water. That's my water, all right? Back off; get your own. Dune's effects then started to show whenever I would be out in public. I found myself licking my arm for the few droplets of sweat that perspired there. Completely embarrassing, I know. Yet I'm not just going to let that water go to waste. Suffice it to say, I have gone crazy. I now have tens of buckets on my lawn in order to catch rain. At night, I sneak over to my neighbors' yards, and I turn on their hoses and fill more buckets with their water. Avoid this book if you can because it will ruin you.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I haven't read any of Nicholas Spark's other best sellers, but I bought this for my Kindle on a whim. While his writing style was not my cup of tea (he would spend paragraphs describing the most minute and unnecessary details), I did get hooked by this story. A little predictable, but enough surprise and suspense that kept me interested. I would recommend it, and I am interested in seeing the movie version.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3D is great, some of the best we have seen.  You get so immersed in this you quickly forget that  what you are experiencing isn't real.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Fun and entertaining. Story line was a bit slow but still enjoyable. A lot of different search type scenarios which breaks up the routine.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great production with minimum violence (you couldn't have war scenes otherwise). We couldn't wait to see the next episode.<br /><br />Looking forward to starting season 3.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I opened the box and plugged it right into my Asus transformer tf-101 running Cyanogen Mod and the Slick usb app for a terminal emulator. I got right into the console port of a cisco switch with no fuss.  I then plugged it into a usb port on my Lenovo t430s and the com port driver loaded automatically in Windows 7 Pro and worked without issue to connect to the same console port on a Cisco switch.  Very happy so far.
B003F29D44|5.0|Why write a product review on a  twenty year old movie? Because at the end, Gecko's rant was eerily relevant to todays political and financial climate.<br /><br />Good flick.<br />A must for any young people interested in Finance.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Gladwell succeeds in framing success a new way with this book, going &#34;behind the scenes&#34; and looking at factors that we wouldn't normally look at as predictors of success.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|The movie was cute.  Had its funny moments.  However, all the funny moments were in the trailer.  The best thing about the entire movie was Rebel Wilson.  She is hilarious.  The movie was entertaining but not worth the money.  Rent it.  Don't buy it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Since the Kindle isn't like any OS that can have a free version of word on it. It is nice that the documents are share-able and very easy to use. Great for those who love typing and organization.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 has a lot of cool different freatures like the mine and the rope the guybslides down on.
B00A6D5GBE|2.0|It looked like a fun enough game, but continues to freeze up on my Kindle. I was dissapointed with the game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is how the real temple run should be this is extremely AWESOME.<br />I REALLY REALLY, REALLY LOVE THIS GAME.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app! It is awesome for small children  or field trip with your kids. Last time I went on a field trip. Lots of kids wanted to play games that require wireless  this works great to block off internet and adds.
B0065NAKRO|4.0|I like the game,but it would be better if the dominos were larger I'm a senior citizen and my rue sight isn't what it use to be. If the tiles were as big as the ones in your rack it would be so much better. Another thing is  the game would be better if you could use the spinner.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the first season, but I was not interested in this second season. I would recommend the first season to my friends that are interested in horror films.
B008OHV5QO|5.0|Excellent!!! A must have for Neil Young fans! An insight to his brilliant mind. So glad I found his music so many years ago!
B004SBX112|5.0|I don't play this game.  I bought it for my nephew, and he really enjoys playing it. It is nice to have a game for each of the holidays.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I am so glad I got to read the origanil. Now I know if I ever watch an adaptation I can compare it to this one. And to have it archived in my cloud is even better
B009K0P10K|5.0|I purchased this for my sister. She was sick and missed a show so I bought this show for her to catch up.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A thrilling, humourous and believable paean to human ingenuity, the scientific method and the will to survive. I loved it and am currently spreading the word among my teenage son's friends. Best thing I've read so far this year. Thanks Andy!
B005OP7162|5.0|Once again I purchased this episode for my sister.  I do not watch this show, but she loves it. I will purchase more episodes for her when she misses watching a show.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Just love this game. It's so addictive! Would be better if you could retry a level without having to go back to the main menu.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|^^^ why does this review require so many damn words?  I could get out my opinion in only 5 words.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS APP NEEDS TO BE THE TOP SPOT WHO DOESNT LOVE MINECRAFT WHEREVER YOU GO DO DOWNLOAD IF YOU WANT THE BEST GAME EVER!!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Need ALOT of work<br /> Don't get all my notifications freezes ALOT have to keep uninstalling it sucks but better then nothing
B00B2V66VS|2.0|The graphics and the new obstacles and everything are awesome. But, the first time I downloaded this app, I played it every now and then, but eventually, it stops and goes back to my main menu, and it keeps doing it. So, I don't like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever as there is a lot to do its fun there is lots of characters to chose from
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is an excellent series with great actors. The writers are very creative with the storyline and plot. This show is a must-see!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a good book and easy to read. What is a bit annoying is the ending. I'm not sure it is an ending that would make me read the next one.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Good read, but not his best. Wonderful details, but too many coincidences hurt believability for me. Lots of violence, but it is a war story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The colors are pretty y'all and its all turn here and turn there and you can ride in the thing on the wheels through the tunnel thing it's awesomely radical man bros
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. It works great. I wish it would turn sideways with kindle fire, though. It has seemless intergration with website account. Thanks!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A cool fun game I play it regularly but the prices are high and it is awesome.it needs more characters.peace out
B000J5XS3C|5.0|great quality  for the price of the equipment.  I'm using it for amateur games transmitting, the experience is good for now, maybe i will need to buy a bigger one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was obsessed with this book. It keeps me wondering what's going to happen next. Kudos to Suzanne Collins. ALTHOUGH this is a very good book it does contain descriptive violence and blood. I recommend this book to readers ages 12+
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting story.  It's hard to fault the author who should certainly be qualified to assess what he experienced while he was unconscious.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you liked Temple Run, get this. It is a good sequel. There are a lot more things to avoid and it's a little harder, but still fun!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|What a wonderful, refreshing series this is!  The characters are so endearing!  I would recommend this as an escape from the usual fare on tv these days.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Amazing!! It has some boring sections but there are few and there are times when you want to just keep reading!!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is so fantastically awesome! The graphics are great, and I love how you can swing through the city! I would so recommend that you buy this app! It is the best a pp I have so far!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love the book and its faster reading it on the kindle<br /><br />It would have been longer on a book
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Muse reminds me a bit of Depeche Mode. Great lyrics coupled with wonderful sounds of electronic music, hard rock, experimental rock, classical music, rock opera and many others. I bought the disk for the song Madness and was pleasantly surprised by the other tracks. A must have for Muse fans. Keep up the good work....
B00881VLCE|5.0|this is one of the best puzzle apps I've used. I like the interface a lot. It would be even better if the music varied a bit as it gets monotonous after a while. easily fixed though by turning off the sound.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Another sprawling masterpiece by Iain Banks. I don't know what else to say. Buy this and then read it immediately.
B007PEIHKE|5.0|Have used Grandstream products before without issues. Needed to replace a Linksys that failed, looked into the newer Linksys but reviews say nothing but bad things about stability and the firmware. Installed this in 5 minutes and I have not had any issues with it since.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I enjoyed Fall of Giants very much. When I first read the preview I thought it might be hard to get involved into each family, but they interrelated very well.  I especially enjoyed the historical era during WWl, the interrelationship of the European countries and it was a perfect picture of world events and how they related to each other.  Look forward to book ll.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I saw Rodriguez recently on the Jeff Probst talk show; a very interesting interview.  Then I remembered I'd seen the feature about him on 60 Minutes.  His whole tale is extremely interesting.  Especially so for me, being about his age, and raised in Ohio, v near Detroit, and knowing how important our Cleveland and Detroit radio stations were to the great music of my time--the 50s, early 60s.  We high school kids were so lucky to be in the middle of music-making/listening history--and we knew it. On to the late 60s and early 70s...Dylan had no equal in my book--but he actually did--overseas!  Now, I DO remember hearing Sugar Man on the radio, but was unaware of Rodriguez's brilliant follow-ups, even though I was living in Australia until 1970--and after which I now know, he became exceedingly popular, deservedly so.  Good on 'im!  I missed out then.  He is so very modest and soft-spoken, and was so very worthy and of a booming following in the US.  Luckily, his life and story has come almost full circle and America can now appreciate him for the first time.  In this case, better late than never ever.  South Africans and Australians were the lucky ones--and now were are too.  This documentary is awesome and wonderful--and a reminder of how important, talented folks can slip through the cracks of time.  So far I only have the Cold Fact CD...to catch me up on I missed of his budding career here, and later blossoming elsewhere.  (Fingers crossed for the 2013 Academy Award for this superb documentary.)
B002M9WW30|5.0|all the Rocky movies in one set, you can't ask for anything better. Quality is great and the price was just right.
B0081HLM2E|4.0|First off, I'm surprised at the number of user reviews for a foreign movie with only a little more than one million in U.S. ticket sales. That being said, I'm glad to see it because this deserves a wide audience.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Roger Brown is a high-level head hunter who uses his position to gain enough info from prospective candidates to rob them of valuable artwork and support his lavish lifestyle and gorgeous wife. He slips up by targeting a candidate who has worked with a high tech company in possession of nano-tracking technology. Said candidate has also worked as an operative in various hot spots around the world. Roger simply chose the wrong target and is literally in deep doo-doo.<br /><br />This is one clever flick. The plot is just complicated enough to keep the viewer in the game. It unfolds at a very even pace. There was no time in the film that I felt things were lagging. There are also some nifty ways the plot turns as well as some very shocking, disgusting, surreal occurrences that caught me totally off guard. At a certain point this becomes a cat and mouse game which is something I enjoy in a flick. These two guys are surprisingly well matched though it might not seem so at first glance. Seeing the 'back and forth' play out is very satisfying. As in a Hitchcock thriller, the protagonist gets in so deep you cannot imagine he'll dig his way out. You just hang in and hope.<br /><br />All the production values, directing, music, etc. are of high order. I liked the actors and the color palette. This is just a nifty flick from top to bottom. About the only weak spot was at the end where they had to visually and through narrative lead the viewer to how all this was going to play out. This was a common technique in mystery thrillers of the 40s but has pretty much disappeared since. Other than that, plant your jaws into this. You won't be disappointed.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My daughter bent her original cable's metal tip, so this was a good replacement for it - it worked fine.  Hopefully she won't bend it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is additive and lots of fun for the family we all try to beet eachothers score and have prizes for the one with the highest score
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|kill and eat as many things as you can. nice concept. wish there were more people to eat instead on mostly fish.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This series quickly became a favorite in my household, can't wait for more seasons to come out on DVD.  Thanks
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I've tried quite a few file managers and these appears the easiest to use.  I just launch the application on my android device and leave it.  I then access the android device from my home computer and upload files to the desired folder, move files within the tablet and delete files as desired.  Very handy.  Very intuitive.  I've also installed this app on 3 devices.  It seems a lot easier than tethering a device or pulling the exteral storage card from the tablet. Another nice feature is the zipping of multiple files when downloading.  It's very quick.  You can also transfer files from one android device to another.  This app is a keeper.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show keeps me engaged every minute. . I am so disappointed when it ends because I don't want to wait until the next show to see what is going to happen!  Edge of your seat drama every second.  Love it!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Absolutely an amazing novel. The rich, mind churning story brings you in and keeps you there. I would advise that the three prior books be read for full enjoyment.
B0097UGXFK|4.0|In the genre of post-Apocalyptic dystopias, this one is pretty well-done, doesn't violate too many known laws of physics, and manages a little character development.  The movie stays quite faithful to the book, refreshingly enough, and the sfx were ample, w/out overwhelming the story.  I especially enjoyed the minor characters played by Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson (villainous overlord and flawed hero).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hate the world he paints way too well, and I can't stop reading and thinking about it. THere is no higher compliment I can give. Hugh Howey rocks.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|It was nice to find this book.  Love Pollyanna when I was growing up, so nice to find this one.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I have never personally seen any of the Sons Of Anarchy but I bought it for my father who has been watching the series on television. He is an absolute fan. He loves the DVD's and the clarity is great. No scratches, no defects, just an all around great show to watch over and over again and to even get your friends and family to watch (as long as they are old enough).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very life like and fun for all ages of horse lover's.  My 3 year old Niece lovess all the horse choises.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Haven't read a Grisham book in a long time so tried his latest. I would say nothing new but keept my interest.
B0012CCNUU|5.0|Excellent collection for laid-back folk rock eclectic listeners.<br />Fun to try to figure who wrote and played each. Good story songs.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|After the characters are introduced, action moves along. Buy the entire season at one time. I watched 2 episodes a night!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|It processes things, and does so quickly. I had never installed an 1155 socket CPU before but it's extremely simple. Open the latch, drop it in (there are notches showing you how to align) and close the latch. I didn't use the included heatsink, but it appears to be a nice design that I'm sure has no problem keeping it cool.<br /><br />PS: Gives a 7.5 on the Windows Experience Index, for those curious. If not having a 7.9 bothers you, this is the K model which can be overclocked (given that your motherboard supports it).
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Wow ok so there is a totally new way to tell a whodunit and Gillian Flynn has found it. Written in fresh tense prose, this book feels modern and hip but not at all precious or strained.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love the zombies lol i think ricks about to head to the psych ward....cant wait till next week for sure
B003O86FMW|5.0|My son got me addicted to the Hunger Games. Catching Fire is amazing. I read it in one day and will read it again. The series is not just for young readers it is for all ages!!!
B000BSLU2S|5.0|I used this after re-flowing Xbox 360s and Playstation 3 consoles and I will say that it is of very good quality.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|I was not as into this album as I thought I would be. I'm glad I just paid $0.99 because Somebody I Used to Know us the only track I really enjoy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|If youre careful and spend diamonds and money wisely, make lots of friends you can play forever without spending real money...i love it
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I'm a huge Jason Mraz fan so I was very excited for his new album. All the tracks are good and this one is no exception.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Bought as a gift for my grandchildren  ,  Scored big with them.  and that scores big with me. Wonderful movie.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I love this album. It has great beats and vocals. Shake It Out is an amazing workout song as well as Dog Days Are Over! Feel in love with the whole album and feel its a great purchase. Their sound is so refreshing from a lot of today's popular music.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|This book is an easy read and I devoured it in one day, finding it difficult to put down. While some reviewers have remarked that the writing style is too simple, I found that the narrative was sincere, like a girlfriend telling me her life story and the questions she is seeking the answers to, and not just some overly dramatic or spiteful tell-all. As a daughter and the mother of a daughter, this autobiography resonated with me. At some point, children will question their parents' choices regarding them, and likewise, a parent is not always able to admit they have made mistakes to their children. It is rare that a parent-child relationship can be explored without anger, guilt, blame and justification overwhelming the process.<br /><br />If you take away the \\"famous parent\\" element, this is a story about a woman who is trying to understand the elements in her life that affected her personality and the life choices she made as well as trying to create a meaningful and close relationship with her selfish career- and ego-driven parents. As an only child, they are all the family she has, and bonding with them as an adult is important to her. Their life choices and actions left her feeling lonely, unloved, and not worthy of success which has haunted her from childhood into adulthood. I can empathize with Ms. Parker's frustrations as she searches for the truth about her parents and tries to understand why they treated her the way they did; the only people who could help her in her quest refuse to do so, seemingly because it would open them to criticisms they did not want to hear, and one can only come to the conclusion that her mere existence was a burden to them rather than a blessing.  Although she seems to find some peace in the end with her father, at the same time, she doesn't reveal if by letting go after his death resolved the inner conflicts she felt about him.  Knowing somewhat of Shirley MacLaine's own difficult childhood through her autobiographies and her subsequent \\"enlightenment\\", I am disappointed that she didn't come through for her own daughter, but it also demonstrates that nurture has a an important impact on us and sets patterns of behavior that we cannot easily change, in ourselves or in others. I found it heartening that Ms. Parker continued to strive for a better relationship with her parents, her mother in particular, despite their inability/unwillingness to reciprocate. In the future, I would be interested to read Ms. Parker's daughter's autobio, to know if the patterns have been broken. I would also like to read the sequel to this book, one in which mother and daughter are able to make peace with their respective childhoods and form a more nurturing relationship. Yes, I'd like to see a classic \\"Hollywood Happy Ending\\" for these two women.<br /><br />As a fan of Shirley MacLaine's books and movies, I was very interested in reading this book. I have often wondered why, in her own autobiographies, she wrote so little about her daughter when what she did write was in glowing terms, although, through Ms. MacLaine's books, I got the impression that Sachi was a far more confident 'woman of the world' rather than an insecure attention-starved little girl in a woman's body. I guess its all in the spin. I thought that perhaps she was protecting her daughter's privacy by not associating her too much with her quirky search for Truth and Enlightenment, just as she seemed to protect her brother Warren Beatty's privacy by not referring to him too often in her books either.  After reading this book, however, I understand so much better, and it does not make me think any less of Ms. MacLaine. Rather, it humanized her for me in a way that her autobiographies never did.  Ms. Parker's stark revelations may embarrass her mother, as I believe some of what Ms. MacLaine wrote about her own parents in \\"Dancing in the Light\\" embarrassed them, but Ms. MacLaine should know--better than anyone else--that Karma happens when you least expect it, and she seems to have cashed in a lot of Karmic points with the publication of this book!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|its a great app thing, I have to go to school each morning and this really helps me get up early!
B009VGU914|5.0|I had little to no idea what the movie was about when I decided to watch it, and now that I have, I believe it is now my favorite movie. My absolute favorite Michael Fassbender movie, for sure. It was haunting, in the most beautiful way, and the characters are extraordinary in the strangest ways. There is so much depth and dimension to the characters, and it was filmed with so much care, precision and style. This is a wonderful, emotionally moving watch, and I highly recommend it.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Paul goes back in history and looks at other times when we have been in recession and also compares the great depression of the thrities to the depression of 2008. He explains in laymen's term why we should be spending now on our infrastructure at home that badly needs upgrading, to bring about jobs and put money in peoples pockets, which will create demand and cause the private sector to hire. With interest rates at record lows, money could be borrowed to do this and this would get our economy moving again. Banks and companies are sitting on trillions in cash and doing nothing with it, not even lending to people who want to buy homes or start small businesses. He explains why the conservative plan of austerity, as other countries have discovered, will just perpetuate the recession. He also talks about how wages for the middle class have actually gone down with inflation while wages for the CEO's have gone up tremendously to the detriment of everyone. This is a great read.
B004GJIL34|5.0|Beautiful movie, the care and planning of each shot is very obviously seen, and it was all executed perfectly and the acting was absolutely extraordinary. Truly a fascinating and emotional movie.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  It was hard to put it down..<br />The author was a good writer.  I would recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely incredible love story with an amazing plot twist that will leave you breathless! I want to read every book she writes!

B005IQ39AY|5.0|very challenging!! gotta get more like it! hopefully there are more!! will definitely recommend this game to all of my friends!!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I expected the app to work but not be great. I works good overall and is very helpful. 5 stars!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There are so many great things about this game! It's way more realistic which adds great detail. All though the turning is a bit touchy<br />, sometimes it thinks you are jumping but other than that it's awesome
B00499NHLC|5.0|I heard about this series through some friends. They knew my passion for Doyle and all things Holmes. I turned this on and was instantly consumed. Fantastic!
B00973902K|5.0|I want to thank Carly Rae personally for writing this song. Not only do I love this song but the whole world dances to this song. It was a big hit within a week of release. It has brought a lot of people together!! Per Pres. Obama, this is his plan for all of us to do!!!!
B00BC3IKWE|4.0|It is third album in for Oxford band Foals and the bid for major league status begins here with an album which according to the band \\"kills their inner Woody Allen\\" (whatever that means!). \\"Holy Fire\\" is clearly aimed at smoothing the more spiky edges of the band and is easily their most coherent and cohesive album to date. With top producers Flood & Moulder at the helm the weight of their previous experience is brought to bear and the influence detectives will detect snatches of their work with Smashing Pumpkins, PJ Harvey, Nine Inch Nails, and The Killers. Their presence has undoubtedly hardened the bands sound, made it bigger and pushed it into a place which takes the Foals vehicle screaming away from the label marked \\"indie\\". As a result some may find \\"Holy Fire\\" a bit too much like standard rock while others may hark back with fondness to the indie danceability of \\"Antidotes\\". Others may alternatively heave a quiet sigh of relief and point out that for every excellent song on previous albums there were also infuriating examples of the \\"far too clever for their own good\\" syndrome.<br /><br />Perhaps the most clear example of the \\"new\\" Foals is the single \\"My Number\\". This is pure and simple cystral clear brilliant pop music which you can dance to and which could top the charts across Europe with sustained airplay. It is a belter and will entrall festival goers splattered in Glastonbury mud. The same also applies to \\"Inhaler; this is a twisted bible black nasty funk song the sort that the great American band \\"Living Colour\\" used to roll out on production lines, come to think of it there is also a faint nod to Peter Gabriel's 'Sledgehammer\\". Two minutes into the song the bands dominant force Yannis Philippakis screams out \\"I can get no space\\" and in comes the huge Zeppelin power chords to knock you off the kitchen stool. Its a snarling beast of a song and will undoubtedly raise the quantum of noise complaints to environmental health departments across local government. Things calm considerably for \\"Bad Habit\\" which is a fulsome song with an aching melody and a slippery grove brilliantly executed by the band. The three years that have been spent making this album has filled it with a huge dose of confidence and lyrically it is a different division to its predecessors. One of the other standout tracks is \\"Late night\\" which refindorces the latter point. This is a thrilling heavyweight rock song, a sort of distant cousin of the feel achieved on \\"Spanish Sahara\\" but underpinned by a muscular backdrop which could easily grace a TV on the Radio album. The passage of time will probably see it become recognised as one of their greatest songs. Much funkier is \\"Out of the Woods\\" with a great Philippakis vocal, while the joyous electronica of \\"Milk & Black Spiders\\" glides effortlessly towards the albums conclusion. The whole thing is rounded off by punchy rock of \\"Providence\\" and then the concluding \\"Moon\\" takes the album into a different realm ending it on a beautifully sombre note and showing that Foals have drawn some lessons from their Oxford forebears Radiohead.<br /><br />\\"Holy Fire\\" probably does mark the transition from indie to a bigger more mainstream sound for Foals. But collectively it is an album for the band to be very proud of. It shows that the musical unit comprising Philippakis and fellow band members Jack Bevan, Walter Gervers, Edwin Congreave and Jimmy Smith are knitting together like plain and purl, in turn producing some of the finest British music on offer today. This is album is so good that its inevitable that the predictably irrelevant Barclaycard Mercury Prize is bound to pass it over. Don't make the samement.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Of all the stories I have read this is the first one I actually couldn't stop reading. I can't wait to finish the trilogy.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|There are two (2) versions of this DVD.<br />1.) WITH The Lord's Prayer<br />2.) WITHOUT The Lord's Prayer<br />MAKE SURE YOU ODER (AND RECEIVE) THE CORRECT VERSION.<br /><br />Recommend the one WITH &#34;The Prayer&#34; It leaves me in awe every time I listen / watch it.<br /><br />John
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing the Colin Farell version of this movie as I enjoyed the Schwarzenegger version very much. The new version had little similarity to the older movie, but it is still a good story on its own. I love science fiction and when I find a movie or book this good, I like to pass it on to others who enjoy it as much as I do. I highly recommend this movie. You definitely won't be bored.
B000003S5H|2.0|So So CD !!!<br />Bought it for one piece of music and enjoy that.<br />The other songs  are mundane at best.<br />Good for a Goodwill donation.<br /><br />John
0812984412|3.0|Really difficult to follow the plot (plots) I figure the movie was made because of the challenge to act in it.  Actors sometimes take roles for this reason and don't really consider the audience.  When I read about the movie and some of the hype I thought seeing it would be a good idea.  Since I never read the book I bought this copy to read before I saw the movie.  Once I read the book the movie was shoved to the back of my mind.  Might see it some day.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This is the first John Green book that I've read and not sure I really understand the \\"nerdfighting\\" discussions, but I enjoyed it enough to give the author another shot.<br />The book is witty and fun, even with the impending doom that is lurking in the background (protagonists are dying from the beginning).<br />I really enjoyed that it didn't (not much of a spoiler here...) have a happy ending, although I think more and more books are turning to the more realistic endings without always having a happy finale.<br />Both Hazel and Gus made me laugh at times - the interaction between them and the poking fun at the \\"Literal Heart of Jesus\\" just didn't get old to me!  And even though others mentioned it being annoying, I really enjoyed the cigarette discussion of not allowing the killing mechanism its power to kill.<br /><br />What I didn't love was that the characters seemed unrealistic to me.  They weren't believable as teenagers.  I will take the argument that if you are a teenager that has known they were dying for years, maybe there's a maturity elevation that happens more quickly than the norm, but I really wasn't able to really get drawn into their personalities.  Along the same line, I felt the love story was too forced.  I didn't fall for either of them, and never \\"felt\\" their love for each other.  I think it needed to be a bit deeper of an emotional connection for them.<br /><br />The other part that left me with a bad taste in my mouth was the Van Houten character.  His final \\"backstory\\" was very predictable, and his personality was quite artificial.  I feel like Green needed something bigger than dying to form the plot around, and I understand that, but adding this extraneous author character in - especially the 2nd time he shows up - was weak writing.  The story behind Van Houten left me with no sense of closure.  And (now a little more of a spoiler...) the ending with the Eulogy written by Gus and sent to him was silly.  Gus would know that by his terribly miserable character, he wouldn't do what was asked of him by re-writing it.  Gus, if so in love, would have left that directly for Hazel's parents to find or Hazel herself to find.  He wouldn't have mailed it to Amsterdam to be unnoticed and scoffed at - they \\"knew\\" that he was a heartless man at that point in his life.<br /><br />I wrote a lot of \\"bad\\", but please note that I did still like the book a lot, but wish that there were fewer moments that felt forced.  But even through those, it was a memorable story of love and life and self-realization and I will try other books of his!
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Easily one of their best! They haven't had this much inspired energy since the Keeper's Legacy album. I love this album! Even the cover art is classic Helloween. No filler songs here either. Standout tracks for me, however, are Burning Sun and Years by the great Michael Weikath. I just wish he would've contributed more songs! And I must say Deris is still going strong and is the best thing that could've happened to this band.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dude this is a great game  lots of people say it sucks but that's just an opinion you know? This game is so awesome and there is just so much you can do<br /><br />Yo u can save your game too like in the free one I don't think you can  you should get this game it's worth the money and you can unleash your imagination
B002RKSZS0|2.0|Jane Austin struck out. I love Emma, Pride and Prejedice, etc. but gave up on this one because I felt as if I were reading some vapid little teenager's tweet.
B002PLALCO|5.0|I'm am a recent P!nk fan and this DVD is great.  It has several of my favorite songs and includes some of her more daring acrobatic feats.  I think that even a non-P!nk advocate would be impressed.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I enjoy this.  Having to get through all the dialogue is a little tedious, but it's a good time waster overall.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The best way for anyone to learn about Mythology is to experience it through the stories and ideas of Riordan. My kids completely ravaged this series and absolutely loved the Roman/ Greek series that he is writing now. Both of my daughters have finished Mark of Athena. They have also read the Kane books. Any parent who is having trouble getting their kids to read should try anyone of the series that Riordan has put out there, mixing the old with the new kinda draws the kids in. Hope this review helps.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to read the books after seeing the first movie, before the next two came out! The book was JUST LIKE THE MOVIE minus a few details from the book! It was FANTASTIC!
B00B29J0I6|1.0|Looked like a fun little game but I'd never know because it would not load on my Kendle HD,  So a buck is blown away. It's not the first time, and I wish it didn't happen, but one has to try these things out. That's why more expensive games will go untried by the cautious: there is no free trial period!
B007HACDLK|5.0|My husband and I both read this and we both really like it.  Waiting for the next Vince Flynn novel.  This is the 2nd one I've read and they don't disappoint!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Got it for the Sony MDR XB700 6 months back. Satisfied and happy as it does its job. Battery might run out quickly if you push it too hard.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show was awesome! It was so convenient to purchase the episodes I needed and the quality was amazing! I will definitely use amazon again to watch my favorite shows!
B003CW67TQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed the books by this author.  Very smart writing; keeps the reader intriqued and entertained!  Recommended to anyone who likes a good mystery thriller.  A lot of unexpected twists.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you're fan of hard sci-fi - you know, real sci-fi, not fantasy with space ships, you should read it. Right now.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I was expecting it to be like other apps that take you to the site like you're on a laptop. This one is set up a little different so it's harder to get used to. I don't use it much.
B000NQ19QA|5.0|Have to say this is a monumental achievement of writing.  Not all of her books come up to this level, but...
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like having this app on my kindle. It's nice not having to go to the web area to type in the web address each time.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Amazon got me hooked on this show because it was the first time I ever bought a season of any TV show and watched episode after episode. This show starts off corny, but it is only developing the plot and soon takes a huge turn and gets GREAT!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is a must-have for me since I'm on fb all the time. It does exactly what I was expecting it to do.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show! I'm so glad they have the seasons for shows on Amazon because it takes netflix FOREVER to upload them!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this series so much I'm re reading it. Awesome author who thinks outside the box and creates a world that has never been done before......can't wait for the movie!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Very cool game.  4 stars because I keep getting told how much better the full version is.  But the recent update helped get it a little closer, so it stays high.  Keep the updates coming Mojang!
B00821PCJS|5.0|One of the better shows on TV for a while.  Up there in drama with Walking Dead.  So now that I like it so much, I'm sure it will be cancelled soon...LOL!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this book when I downloaded it.  I haven't had much luck with $0.99 books.  However, I found myself reading well into the night (much to my detriment at work the next day).  It's a fantastic idea that is well executed.  The text could use a little editing, but any errors that I saw were very minor and weren't significant distractions.  In my humble opinion, this is one of the best books you'll ever read for a buck.  Well done!!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I got this for taking on excusions to keep my blades in decent shape, or make repairs to damaged blades in the field.  It is everything the title says and you really can't beat the price.
0062101897|5.0|Finally a book packed with all the goodies we expected and hope for!  A definitive book on the world and making of the Harry Potter films!
0316228532|5.0|I loved this book.  It transported me to the little English village when I was reading it.  It is a great study of characters. I would highly recommend Anne Tyler's novels to everyone who liked this book.
1423124111|4.0|I was SO delighted that a book of the Disney attraction posters was done.  I only wish they had given each poster a full page.  Still, it's great to have them all in one book.  Kudos!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Still reading this book but Ive been a Stephen King fan since my teens. Will be buying more. I am done with this review.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe delivers another stellar season and mixes it up with such humanity and character.  Who knew a sci-fi/procedural cop show could give us such a delight.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the were a bit heavy but other than that it is very good it has that addiction to it like the old temple run did.I will give it 5 stars because it was better than the old one
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Wow, did this story speak to me!  Writing can be such a lonely and often misunderstood profession.  It was nice to see the plight of a writer in a somewhat unconventional fantasy.  I'm not even a Woody Allen fan, but he really pulled off a nice film which he called his &#34;valentine to the city of lights&#34;.  Beautiful!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Movie was well acted. I learned quite a bit and loved the background (true) story. But somehow could have done with less sexual contact.
B000FU7ERW|1.0|ALthough it was my fault i didnt look at the description its a little misleading to sell one side of a vinyl, let alone it was all stratched up
0586066241|2.0|The elements that make \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" a classic -- the pacing, dramatic tension, smartly efficient plot lines -- are mostly missing from Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Space Odyssey\\" finale, \\"3001\\". What it retains is Clarke's obvious exuberance for biological, technological and cultural evolution. Each book in the series represents an evolution in itself even, of Clarke's own perspective and thinking on the growth of humanity overtime, while providing a platform for his reflections on extraterrestrial life and evolution.<br /><br />This story follows Frank Poole, murdered by the omnipresent HAL in \\"2001\\", found preserved and alive after floating in the cold vacuum of space for 1000 years. It's through Frank's eyes, mind and mouth that Clarke exposes his views on the future. Religion is no more; and technology is the new religion. And while technological advancement has skyrocketed beyond Poole's own age, one character comments that \\"sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\" Poole doesn't understand it, but has faith enough to accept it.<br /><br />In connecting this story to the previous three novels, Clarke writes in a couple 'guest appearances' by David Bowman and HAL - now a single entity called Halman. They appear, literally and figuratively, as mere shadows of their former selves. Poole's character, and the smattering of future humans he interacts with, are not nearly enough to carry the story itself, however.<br /><br />In tying up loose ends, we learn more about the entities that sent the Monolith's to earth as well. Much of this is speculated in the previous novels so don't really count as 'spoilers':<br /><br />\\"And because, in all the Galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind, they encouraged its dawning everhwere. They became farmers in the fields of stars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped. And sometimes, dispassionately, they had to weed.\\"<br /><br />\\"For years they studied, collected, catalogued. When they had learned all that they could, they began to modify. They tinkered with the destiny of many species, on land and in the seeas. But which of their experiments would bear fruit, they could not know for a least a million years. They were patient.\\"<br /><br />The last two novels in the \\"Space Odyssey\\" series are  weak; are really no more than long novellas (about 200 pages) and do little to build on the mythology started in \\"2001\\". Unless you feel compelled to 'complete' the Clarke's quadrility, you miss out on little by reading only \\"2001\\" and it's very strong sequel \\"2010\\".
B008AK8FHM|4.0|One can only imagine what this sincere and dedicated author experienced as he struggled with the concepts of Heaven;  Do you suppose he is right;  Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful;  It took great courage to set this book to the printed page; a great and much appreciated risk!  Everyone should read this book!

B007HACDLK|3.0|It was mediocre.  Too many names to remember to make sense of the story line. Predictable ending about three quarters of the west through.
B00138H6I2|5.0|Along with &#34;The Stranger&#34;, I consider this among Billy Joel's best. But it is not only one of his best but it is in my collection of all-time best LPs. For those of you, who need to know what LP means, look it up.

1449410243|5.0|I am allergic to cats, but I chose this for a gift - she LOVED it! Very funny and accurate.  Also, my 11 year old granddaughter read parts of it (some parental guidance suggested).  She laughed so hard and talked about it for days!  A funny skewered look at reality.
B006O3MU96|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone. This is adult friendly, child friendly and not difficult at all. The game was free so what more could I ask. When I have small waits or am bored doodle jump helps pass the time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I usually sleep through or wake up &amp; turn off my usual alarm but with this my brain has to wake up. I love the fully customizable features and the clean cut design.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book and quick read, it kept me intrigued. Plus it was a great love story. Now to get my husband to be a little romantic
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I thought that I might just enjoy one hit song but I love, love the whole album!! I hope that Gotye will come up with another CD soon.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love that I can get up in the morning and know without turning on the noisy t.v. what kind of weather I will be facing that day. Very useful and never have a problem with the app.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have bought the first album they had made and I loved it. This one is equally great. It is relaxing and pleasant to listen to any time.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love angry birds and I must say that this free version is so awesome! I'm so totally addicted! Sorry about your luck, Mr. Homework Monster! ;)
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I have quite a few friends who have been a fan of the show since it's debut. The few commercials I had seen for it didn't appeal to me at all and my friends boasting fell on deaf ears. After getting Amazon Prime as a gift, we tried it out on the t.v. Sons of Anarchy was one of the freebies and we figured eh why not. We were hooked from that first episode and not only did we stay up until 4am watching but we went through all 5 seasons in 2 weeks (not having commercials is awesome). Of course in 5 seasons not every single episode can be amazing (there are a couple that drag a bit) and some story lines go on too long. Overall the casting is excellent, the writing great, acting is superb and the music/soundtrack is out of this world incredible (Katy Segal has a fantastic singing voice).
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this everyday to access my college course materials (syllabus, etc.) and it works great. Probably most useful app on my kindle.

B0016CTXTU|5.0|I can not understand why this band never made it big in the great USA. This is a masterpiece. I would like to see evey album available as mp3 files.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love this album. It has a bit of an acoustic folky feel without being too folky, if you know what I mean. I like pretty much every song, and its great to listen to at work, when I can't listen to some of my other music.
B008220BLG|3.0|First we had the spin-doctors telling us \\"Vampires are nice guys, some of them, and they're sparkly!\\"<br /><br />Now, it's zombie rehab. You know, \\"But Daa-aad, he's a really NICE zombie and I like him! And anyway, he's getting better. And he hardly ever eats brains any more, only on special occasions.\\"<br /><br />And, not only does over-eager teenage hormonalism turn the living dead into not-so-dead, it affects all the bystander zombies, too. I mean, all the ones who don't have a cute non-zombie girlfriend of their own - they get better just watching. (As a wise man once said, 'Voyeurism is participation.' I guess that when the teenage girlfriend is cute enough, that's all it takes.)<br /><br />So, we have the star-crossed teenaged lovers with parents who just don't understand. We have them mysteriously un-crossing their stars through The Power of Love (chaste version). And it just happens that their names are Julia and something that starts with R, but no one can remember what. (Get it? Julia and R? Get it?)<br /><br />Well, it could have been worse. They might not have gotten John Malkovich. But, based on recent trailers in theaters, it looks like it's going to get worse.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

140123769X|4.0|The Fables series keeps going for lots of good reasons. One among them is the writers' ability to maintain a long-lived story arc, in this case the training of one of North Wind's grand-daughters as his successor. In order to keep the longer arc running, the authors treat us to occasional side trips, such as the one that fills most of this volume.<br /><br />The new North Wind has siblings, and they didn't get the job. One of these gets abducted to a ghastly island of misfit toys, so far across the magical dimensions that no sign of her remains to the ones searching for her. Only one being can cross that chasm, and he brings the captive's most daring brother to her rescue ...<br /><br />To say more would be to say too much, except that the rescue has terrible costs. Well written, competently drawn, this really pulls the reader along. Like any long-lived series, Fables has its ups and downs. Despite this volume's dark edge, it's one of the better ones.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0063IH60K|4.0|Of course I liked this app cause I like solitaire.... I mean doesn't everybody like solitaire!!!! LOL LOL LOL LOL!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the plots and the scenery.  Show is very captivating.  Makes me want to live in that era.<br />The castle is the stuff of dreams.
B004SRNH10|1.0|I couldn't use it on my android for some reason.... For some reason my android was so stubborn on what I could use on that stupid thing....
B00846F1YW|3.0|The game is a simple distraction and I got it while it was free. Some users are complaining that you are required to sign in to Facebook or Twitter, this is not true.  There is a small X in the upper right side of the dialog box which you can use to close the box after the tiny achievement banner shows up.  I gave it only three stars because parts of the image are almost always covered and you need to zoom the screen and move it around to find &quot;covered&quot; hidden objects.  There is the option to skip dialogue in-game by way of the menu button on the left side of the screen. Which is nice because I find that aspect of the game unimportant in my opinion.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|I didn't really know what this did for my android, so therefore didn't care.... I thought somehow it would make google work better but it didn't do that for me....
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I love sitting down with this game after a long day and playing forms bit.  It gives my brain a rest!

B005NJU8PA|5.0|An exceptional exploration of a difficult subject using a difficult subject.  Cooking to learn through learning to cook.  Quite a journey.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|This is a great movie but we ordered thinking that it wasn't in the pack.... Then it ended up being in the pack so we received it twice....
B008B92U32|1.0|Absolutely did not like this app. It is so bad that I delected it within 3 minutes. Frankly I don't even remember what it is. It's so bad that it caused memory loss.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love youtube so of course I loved this app when I had it that is.... Youtube is a great website!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series, the story line is entertaining, the acting is believable, the set is fantastic, the costumes are true to the period  and have evolved over the past three seasons to fit the time frame.  The authenticity of Hiclere castle and the series inspiration based on the real ancestors that lived there, add to the charm.  Downton Abbey is a show that has a broader appeal to both men and women.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Another flash player that didn't work in my android.... Once I found out it didn't work in my android I uninstalled it right away....
B00846F1YW|4.0|Fine hidden object game. Cute story. Great for when you have some time to burn. Easy to identify objects while being well hidden. Levels get more difficult as you advance.
B0021QJRX2|5.0|This one grooves in the usual Lisa Stansfield style. Words are meaningful as well. A good purchase that you will enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I purchased this for a gift, and they are very satisfied with it no complaints. I wish I had gotten the kindle HD.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My daughter loved this movie so much that we also had to buy it in DVD. I would highly recommend this product.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this app on my Kindle Fire. It's highly addicting though. I have to check it out every day!
B007M45PMU|5.0|&#34;Hey Ho&#34; is getting a lot of play, and still, I can listen to this album over and over.  Also, &#34;Stubborn Love&#34; is an extremely beautiful song.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I found this book predictable and ordinary. Only because I was sick did I finish it. Boredom makes it a little easier to tolerate a less than stellar novel.
0765325950|1.0|This book was a HUGE disappointment. The ending was brilliant, but the journey was terrible. 80% of this book is boring battle scenes dealing with irrelevant characters. But the characters that matter we never see. Moraine and Nyneave stood in the bore doing nothing for most of the book. Moraine has been missing since book 6 - and yet we never get to catch up with her again. Really this book was rubbish. It was obvious that Brandon Sanderson has been overworked by this monster project and run out of creative energy at the end. In the end I gave up and started reading ahead for answers - somethign I have NEVER done on any other WOT book. I just couldn't respect this book. AMOL needs to be recalled by Tor along with TOM. The two books need to be pulped - and then re-edited and re-written as a single TIGHT FAST PACED RELEVANT volume. The first edit - the first junk to remove would be EVERYTHING to do with elain and her boring kingdom. Elaine building it in TOM (boring), Elaine seeing it get smashed up in AMOL (boring).  TOM is 30% padding and AMOL is 80% padding. Both books need to be pulped and remerged into a single volume. Had this had happened - people would have been praising the final volume. Tors complicity in seeking to make more money by padding the final two books into three is shameful - they have ruined for all time a great series. This book has some good answers, a great ending, but the pointless and boring journey make it worse than any of the slow books in the middle.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I put this in my Acer Aspire One D255E in about 5 minutes. It booted right up and recognized the memory without any problems. The Acer I have requires High Density RAM and this fit the needs of my small notebook perfectly.<br /><br />There is a noticeable difference in multitasking performance such as opening more than one tab when browsing. It is not drastic, but it does not go over about 53% on RAM usage since the swap. I am using the Windows 7 Premium 32 Bit operating system.<br /><br />I recommend this upgrade for the Acer D255E-13639, as it works as advertised and is priced very reasonably considering the performance gain. I hope this review helps.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I loved this show! From the first episode to the one I'm currently on. If you have a passion for historical pieces such as the life of Henry VIII, you'll love the show. It brings you to this historical time and depicts just how history and love were expressed during those ages.
B00110K62U|5.0|Just being able to see Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean is enough to recommend this.<br />Being a concert version, it lacks the spectacle of the stage, but it's still marvelous to hear.
B00705GEO4|5.0|If you like power metal you will love this.  Great CD.  I grew up a fan of metal and now I am passing the love of metal to my son.  He is 13 and loves this as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like many others, I'm absolutely obsessed with Downton Abbey! I'm so pleased with my bluray copies of all the seasons. They are so crisp and clear on the screen.
0307730697|5.0|With our house being hit recently with the flu and stomach bug, I have found myself up late at night tending to the girls, and not being able to sleep due to the up and down calls.  So, I have been able to take this time and catch up on some reading.  I have had \\"Fearless\\" sitting on the end table for a couple of weeks now, but never found the time to read it until this past Monday.  And, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  The book is based on the life of Navy Seal, Adam Brown, who gave his life on May 17, 2010, doing what he loved best, serving his country and protecting us from harm.  Little did he know when he awoke that day that it would be his last.  But, like many in the military, he was ready to give his life to protect his country and those he loved.  I am in awe every day when I hear stories from friends who have spouses and relatives in the military and how they continue to re-list, as they feel it is their duty and calling in life.  I can't imagine serving, or for that matter re-listing time and again, if I had a family with young children.  And, in Adam's case, he had a wife and two small children at home, waiting and hoping for his safe return.<br /><br />This page turning will introduce you to a heroic man, who relied on his faith and love of family and friends, to give him the strength to fight day and day out for his country. Adam overcame so many obstacles in his life including drug addiction, to find Jesus Christ, and ultimately become a fearless man, who will inspire all those read his story.<br /><br />I was moved not only by Adam's story, but also found myself being moved to tears as I looked at the personal photos of Adam and his family and friends which are interspersed throughout the pages of this book, as well as personal letters written by Adam for his family (in case he didn't make it home), along with powerful scripture, which he always included at the end of his letters.<br /><br />Adam Brown was and will always remain an amazing man and hero in the eyes of so many who got the chance to know him personal.  But, for those who will learn about Adam through this book, will also feel a connection to him.  And, by the time you finish the book, you will take a look at your life and want to make sure you tell those around you just how much they mean to you, and how much you love them.  Adam's family knew this, and even though he wasn't able to return home alive, his memory will live on in his wife and two children.  God bless the Brown family and those who knew Adam.  And, Adam, thank you for all that you did, and for giving the ultimate sacrifice.  Your heroic story will live on thanks to this book written by Eric Blehm.<br /><br />Disclosure:  \\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.\\"
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is an absolutely delightful show. I hate that it was only 4 seasons long! But I enjoyed watching all the seasons on my instant video.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Don't get me wrong I do like this game , it can be addictive. I just do not like the sneaky way<br />they try to get money. Like while collecting coins it sends me to the purchase sale menu and before you know it it is pending transactions. They claim this can be turned off under settings but this is nowhere to be found under that. They want you to buy ponies, places and more coins and gems which I understand is common with online games but the fact that they aim these at kids who do not know they are purchasing is a bit sneaky.<br />This game at this stage has a lot of glitches. A few known ones are<br />Game crashing after giving gits - one of the main problems<br />Removing items growing back again-- after spending gems on this , it coming back<br />Gems disappearing<br />Hearts not received<br />Daily bonus not working<br />Cannot add friends<br />Game crashing at balloon pop game<br /><br />they know about these and are working on them so maybe it will be fixed soon.<br /><br />How the game is played<br />This is more of a simulation game, where you collect gems, build the town up, give ponies jobs to get more gems to buy more places/ponies. There are a few games like throwing a ball back and forth, catching apples and a bonus flying game to collect extra gems. There is also a bonus game you can play once a day like pooping balloons. With the overall objective to get the elements of Harmony to stop Nightmare moon from spreading darkness over Ponyville.<br /><br />Pony characters<br />They do have a good amount of likeable characters. All the main ones are there of coarse along with fan favorites like Derpy, Dr whooves, Spitfire, Flim and Flam, Zecora, Cadance, Shining armor, Fancy pants, Prince Blue blood ect
B00321MGPG|5.0|I had the opportunity to share this series with a terminally ill patient in the last stages of life. It's paliative power was remarkable and led to hours of comfortable conversation of the content. I believe it had this wonderful impact because the senses are engaged and the perspective of the reader is expanded to better appreciate and accept the circle of life.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I saw it years ago and it stayed in my mind as being such an enjoyable, pleasant entertaining film so I decided to look at it again.  I was not disappointed.  This film is a delight and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B007V65R54|2.0|Had I known that the author was going to treat the broad subject largely in the confines of his betting interests, I proably would not have made the purchase. There are redeeming insights about bias and Bayesian principles. But it was a tougher read than I had expected.
B000085RPU|1.0|The DVD came rattling in the box. When I tried to get the DVD to play my DVD player it said, &#34; wrong region.&#34; I'm not sure what this meant???.  All my other DVDs work just fine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very fast paced book,if your like me you will want to read if straight thru. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I just sent my two daughters the DVDs of Love Actually for Valentines Day.  They both love the movie too.  After watching it at least 15 times over the years, I can catch any scene and just watch it for five to 20 minutes in anticipation that the small time segment will make me feel more joyful and happier. I don't buy a lot of movies but I bought this one because it is so well done. Each venue blends into the next with such ease that you don't feel like it is manufactured.  Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy, Laura Linney, Liam Neeson, Kiera Knightly and all the other cast members are excellent dramatically and comedically. Love Actually is exactly that Love ....Actually.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Book was ok. Not particularly exciting and a bit predictable.  The main character had a good sense of humor given his predicament.  I enjoyed the read but I would not consider this book a page turner.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie had it all:  non-stop action, people you care about, and Stallone, Schwarzennegar, Willis, and even Chuck Norris all showing up.  The movie teasers are there in abundance.  Was there a plot?  Who cares?  There were explosions and shootouts a plenty, and the best cast ever.  Watch this film; it's a lot of fun.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This was the first James Bond movie I had been to in ages. Saw it at the theater and it was awesome!! I plan to purchase it as soon as possible. Just a great movie!! Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond!! Lots of action and intrigue. James Bond completely!!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I've played a lot of mahjong games and this is one of the best. There are a lot of different shapes to conquer and three stars to try and achieve for each. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because you have to scroll through all of the boards to get to the one you want rather than the game opening on the last board you were playing, and scrolling across isn't very smooth. Other than that, this game is a must for mahjong lovers.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I went to see Jack Reacher at the theater. I am not really a big Tom Cruise fan but this movie was awesome!! There is action, intrigue, mystery, and romance all in one. Jack Reacher is definitely cunning and very slick. Tom Cruise did an exceptional job in creating this character. As soon as it comes out on DVD I will be prucahsing it!!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno Mars in general, but the variety of songs and the soul make me really love this album.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|LinkedIn is a great resource for networking. I have almost 1000 connections and LI has been a very helpful resource for me.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|This is just what my four year old grandson needed to keep all of his cars in one spot for his track.  It is easy for him to handle.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game! its addicting! I like how it doesn't only take like 2 days to beat like most of the other games on here.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is a great series that I have recommended to everyone I know.  It's won many awards, and deserved all of them.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you enjoy watching movies from the 60's and 70's; you'll really enjoy watching this series. It's got it all; temptation, lust, style, and the great idea's and tips on how to deal with clients on a professional and/or personal level. It's entertaining. The men and men from the old days where the women kept the house and took care of their men while the men went to work and provided for their family. The stylish decor and costumes are so worth the watch for women who appreciate the fashion of the 60's. It's a must see!
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Alrighty this is where I go back & review a film that either came out in 1993 or 2003 this is 2003 in film Daredevil. A comic book film that doesn't get a whole lot of love just like the 2004 Punisher movie this is underrated which I will reviw the 04 Punisher movie next year. Made for $78 million made $45 million it's opening weekend & $179 million worldwide. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson who would go on to direct Ghostrider. It stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock & Daredevil. Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk The Kingpin, Jenifer Garner as Elektra Natchios, Colin Farrell as Bullseye, John Favreau as Franklin Nelson, Leland Orser as Wesley Owen Welch & Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urlcih. The story deals with a kid named Matt Murdock who is beaten up by some bullies in an alley. He is taught by his father who used to be a big time boxer & contender for The World title not to fight. He tells his Dad that the kids at school said that he works for this crime boss named Fallon he tells that he doesn't cause he is working double shifts at the docks. The next day he finds out that his Dad was fired & he finds his Dad in an alley & that he is a Loan Shark for Fallon. Matt runs off & he accidently bumps intoi these containers that has chemicals & it causes him to go blind but all his other senses have been enchanced so he can do all these crazy acrobatic moves. Matt gets revenge on those bullies from earlier on. His father blames himself for what happened to his son. He goes & tries to make a comeback in boxing. Fallon wants him to lose this bout he refuses & in an alley he is beaten to death. A red rose is left by his body. Then it's years later Matt is now an adult & works as an Attorney at this practice with this man named Franklin Nelson. They're trying to put this man away who assaulted this woman & he is found not guilty cause the accuser used to be a drug addict. Matt Murdock knows he is lying cause he can tell by a persons heartbeat if they are lying or not. He is madthat he got away but there is something he can do about it cause at night he is a crime fighter named Daredevil. He tracks that guy down at a strip bar. Wher you have an ok action scene where he fights off these thugs. He chases after that guy down into The Subway Daredevil throws that guy on the tracks & he gets a brutal death. You have this reporter named Ben urlich who is trying to find out who Daredevil is as well as figurings out who this crime boss named The Kingpin is. The Cops have no time for him. Then you are introduced to The Kingpin Wilson Fisk He is told by his right hand man named Wesley Owen Welch that people are talking to the news papers you find out early on that he doesn't put up with any s  h  i  t he kills 2 of his bodyguards. Then you have this guy named Nikolas Natchios who is a business man for The Kingpin he wants out of the syndicate. Kingpin puts a hit out on Natchios & brings in Bullseye who is skilled throwing almost any kind of sharp object & is acrobatic as Daredevil. He is in this bar shooting darts he's drinking & shooting darts at his side instead of looking straight at the dart board. This guy owes him money cause he made a bet  I guess. He mouths something off at Bullseye he uses thes throwing knives they all hit that guys neck killing him. On the plane ride to The States there is this old lady that keeps talking to Bullseye you know trying to make conversation he thumps a pill that hits the back of the seat & goes right into her mouth & cause's her to choke  to death. I mean this is 1 dude that you wouldn't want to mess with at all. Meanwhile Murdock meets this young lady named Elektra who happens to Nikolas Natchios Daughter. You have this fun little scene in the park where they sparr with each other. It was a well shot scene. A plot that was put back into The Director's Cut was involving this character that is played by Coolio who is on trial for murder. Meanwhile you have Murdock go to this black tie affair & Wilson Fisk showsup gives Nikolas Natchios a Red Rose he gets out of there you have Bullsey following him he throws these throwing stars through the windsheild & kills Natchios bodygaurds. Daredevil goes Bullseye & they have a fight he cause Bullseye to miss his target & Daredevil throws his cane at Bullseye he moves out of the way & it impales Nikolas who is killed. Elektra is enraged Daredevil is framed for killing Nikolas Natchios. The scene at the graveyard where My Immortal by Evenesence was well done. The Reporter Ben Urlich finds out who Daredevil really is cause this scientist played by Kevin Smith has possesion of Daredevil's cane. He also finds out information on who The Kingpin is. Meanwhil Daredevil is looking for Bullseye he is attacked by Elektra this fight scene was a little too brief & wasn't the best I mean Ben Affleck & Jenifer Garner aren't the best fighters but they are better than others. She finds out that he is Matt Murdock. Bullseye shows up she learns the truth. She tries to fight Bullseye she throws a sai at Bullseye he catches it throws it back at her & it goes right through her hand. She tries to fight Bullseye but he cuts her throat with a playing card stabs her in the stomach & she dies. Daredevil goes to this church he is friends with The Preist Bullseye comes in Daredevil tells The Preist to leave. This is probably the best fight scene in the movie cause for a guy like Ben Affleck who I don't think oh action star he does have decent fighting skills this was a good fight scene as I said especially how Daredevil defeated Bulleye. Where a sniper is positioned on the roof Daredevil moves out of the way & causes the bullet to  go clean through Bullseye's hands. He is thrown out the window he lands on a car drove by that Repoter Ben Urlich Bullseye is barely alive. Ben Urlich tells the cops who The Kingpin is & gives them information about Wesley Owen Welch. He is taken into custody. During the fight with Bullseye & Daredevil. Bullseye has this red rose hetells him Wilson Fisk always leaves a red rose for his victims. You have another good fight Daredevil fights The Kingpin Fisk owns Daredevil for most of the fight Daredevil asks him why did he kill the only 2 people he cared about. Fisk tells him that he used to work for Fallon & that was just business. Kingpin takes the mask off he finds out Daredevil is Matt Murdock. Daredevil gets a second wind he takes The Kingpin down knocks him down brings him to his knees literally. He decides not to kill him & let The Police arrest him. The Kingpin knows his idenity but won't tell it due to the humilation & his reputation would be killed cause he was beaten by a blind man. Meanwhil Murdock moves on that guy who was accused of  murder in The Director's Cut is found not guilty. Urlich decides not to run The Daredevil story. Murdock goes to the roof where he & Elektra 1st kissed he discovers that she might still be alive & that's pretty much the movie. I'm sorry if I didn't explain the plot all that well in my retrospective. A fairly solid movie. My only problems were not a whole lot of action some of the fight scenes could be better but overall you it is pretty solid. Mark Steven Johnson did a good job directing. Ben Affleck did a good job. I know a lot of people didn't care for Michael Clarke Duncan as The Kingpin for the silliest reason that he is bl  a  c  k but I thought he was a good choice & I'm not taking it back. He is The Kingpin R  I  P Michael Clarke Duncan. Jenifer Garner was pretty good. Colin Farrell did a good job he wasn't he wasn't a goof<br />a  s  s like he was in The Fright Night remake. Joe Pantolino was ok. Leland Orser  was decent. John Favereua was ok. So as I said pretty solid movie I don't understand why this didn't get a sequel I know Ben Affleck doesn't really have anything good to say about this movie which is a shame cause he did a good job as I said. In fact I like this more than any of The Spiderman movies. Anyway next review will be 20 years ago Falling Down.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Using Windows 8 I had to install the drivers, (they actually had Windows 8 32bit and 64 bit drivers on the included CD).  I was half way through a transfer of a lot of data from a USB 3.0 external drive attached to my machine to another USB drive attached to my network Windows Home Server machine.  With the previous USB 2.0 to Ethernet dongle I averaged 7 MB/s.  Plugged in this bad boy and the transfer completed at 70-85 MB/s.  Wow, well worth it.  If you have to use a USB Ethernet dongle, like the one that came with my Asus Zenbook AND you transfer files on your local network, buy this immediately.  You won't be sorry.  It won't speed up your internet connection as your provider can't exceed the speed of your slower dongle.  This is for speeding up your internal transfers....
B007MAET4O|5.0|This album was terrific, and made a beautiful gift. It was complete with the CD and Vinyl. Perfect condition as well. Thank you.
B007HJ9NBE|4.0|I like the movie because it was fun with a decent story, but it was a remake so the story was already done.<br /><br />The movie was a little long and drawn out for the story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Amazing. They should make this a standard reading assignment. I  more kids read this book it would help them find who they are. And even realize it's ok to be sad but to let the happy things overcome the sadness
B0086221SS|3.0|The story is dull and meandering at times.<br /><br />I find it hard to understand why many of the characters are behaving as they are; A lot of back story seems to be implied.<br /><br />It's hard to explain my rating completely without a spoiler.  I think I would recommend this to a select few of my friends that like this genre.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Story moved fast. Have met nuts as described in book, funny and a little scary at the same time. Do wish the Jack teacher character was a little more believable in his purpose.  A little like a modem day Kane in kung-fu . Wandering from place to place helping solve problems with his military skill never settling or establishing long term relationships.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I  LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO SO VERY COOL AND THE HUGE MONEY I TO COOL<br />Mine carts<br />:) ............yeeeees get  this app
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|lots of fun almost like on the midway<br />plenty of prizes, but no way to save to many of them from falling off the sides
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was such a great book, I couldn't put it down and I didn't want it to end!  It was one of the best by far!
B004KZOWEG|5.0|This book is a vital resource for learning about the effects of racism and colonialism by Europeans, especially the Belgians.  In the case of this book, the villains are Belgians and other special citizens allied to Leopold and his economic interests.  Rothschild performs a great services to the Congolese and to all who call themselves humanitarians.  Their is far too little information about individual Congolese and other Africans, but Hochschild's Afterword explains why this is so -- and why that missing documentation is part of the heart of his book.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I am usually not a fight game fan...but, in this case...HELL YEAH!!!  The action is good the controls are easy for an old guy like me. U would recommend this game to anyone looking for fun.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first book of the Hunger Games series.  The 2nd and 3rd books are not thrilling or anything unexpected.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I SAW THE PBS CONCERT AND AM HOOKED.  HOW DO YOU DO IS A STUDY OF RETRO SOUL it's on my phone and I listen to it often.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great for kids and adults.  Makes you think. I highly recommend this app. Starts to get &#34;interesting by the 8 x 8 level
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This complex production demonstrates one of the best pieces of ensemble acting out there; an interesting mix of characters, acting with no weaknesses, engrossing plots, suspense and resolutions.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love the book, can't wait to see the movie, I hope it as good as the book was.  Hopefully I will find more good book's like this.
B005721W9O|5.0|Each and every scene is carefully crafted, like jewels in a fine necklace. Remember, Never give up, never surrender.  Twenty.
B004DHUAZQ|1.0|Not impressed. Not realistic. Not happy that I won't be able to get the time I spent watching this movie back.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Awsome<br />.this  book makes  me proud to be an  American. I just wish that more Americans would appreciate what these young men  and women go thru  every day to protect our liberty and freedom.  Thank you.  Walter
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The quality of the 3D was fantastic, on par with the quality of avatar's. And the film in general is a must see for all alien fans, if only to get some context of the films.<br />Highly recommended .
B00846F1YW|5.0|It is a nice game that keeps your mind busy with a lot of fun. I works perfect with the Kindle Fire.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|This felt very real to me.  I mean the way the author writes is a little out of the ordinary but it feels very informal as if he is sitting in the room telling his story.  Of course it's frustrating to think this is still going on.  If you want to get a look into North Korea's pain this is a good place to start.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|FRIGHTENLY HONEST! What a risk to BEAR one's soul to the world like this!!! This book not only offers hope to those with an \\"eating disorder\\" but shows the courage needed for ANY AND ALL of us to own,face and confront our inner demons....T'ain't No Perfect Human being on this planet. LIFE is not a Hollywood script,with perfect characters. Portia DeGeneres lays it all out..no holds barred. GREAT and accomplished writing.It pulls you in from the 'get go'....wow!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Unable to review this movie as we were unable to watch it.  We ordered it on Friday February 8th in the evening,  and we lost power for 3 days due to the Northeast Blizzard.  Would it be possible to get a creidt for this movie, and we will order it again when we are able to view it?
0307719774|5.0|This is a great little journal for anyone who has problems writing. It gives you a prompt question and also only a few lines to write a response. My husband went out and bought the very same one the next day he thought mine was so interesting.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I received the headset as a gift. A lot of research was done when I purchased my first one for my brother.He has had his for years. The best thing is that when it is on, no room noise is heard. I like it very much.

B004SDSSFY|4.0|I haven't used it but it might be what i need to be able to finally be able to download  apps from google play.
B004FQX59I|5.0|i was alive when he was killed and his brother and martin luther king.  this movie really gets to alot of poignant facts.<br /><br />  hard to believe all he wanted was peace and war is still the biggest buisness in the world. what can you say<br /><br />  about 911 also.  just a bigger version of jfk.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This is a great game! I'm a huge fan of minecraft and when I saw this for sale I was ecstatic. I downloaded it as fast as I could. Seeing that it was for $7 I was a bit hesitant but got it anyway. So far I have not had many problems, everything works great. The only problem or glitch I see would be in the survival mode when you build a house or dig a mine and leave it to go kill a cow or something and you come back to see creepers, zombies etc in the place and more than not they always kill me and it makes the game less fun.  If you can fix that problem then I will rate it 5 stars. Also if you could put in somewhere to change the difficulty that would be great too. :) keep up the good work!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I expected more from this book with all the buzz surrounding it.  It was so boring and drawn out.  Even the steamy scenes were lame and completely unbelievable.  I don't know anything about this author but based on some things in the book it leads me to believe she's old and out of touch.  What type of college student doesn't own a computer?  Why would Grey give Ana a BlackBerry instead of an iPhone?  Did this story take place in the year 2000?<br />Save your time and skip this book.  It's not worth reading, especially because you have to read books 2&3 to find out what happens.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed recording an episode and was thrilled to see I could watch on Amazon. I am now looking for other series to watch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it. u can share items, promote ur own website, ect. really great. very addicting. everyone ive gotten to download this app has been thoroughly happy. its a life saver to invade something happens to ur device and it deleted all ur bookmarks, if u saved the on pintrest you don't miss a thing.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Mitch Rapp book unfortunately I read too fast and they are so good I can't stop! I can't wait for the next one.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|I am really hooked to all the seasons. All actors and actresses did a great job. Like their attire too. I did not grow up in this country, nor in that age, but somehow I felt carried easily into their life.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is a great time-waster! It's not impossibly hard, but not to easy. I'm enjoying it. I did have to read the reviews to learn how to go to the next chapter without registering with facebook or Twitter - there's a tiny x in the upper right corner of the frame.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Anyone who has watched Downton Abbey is well aware of the exceptional quality of British televison. Season three is a continuation of the award winning series.  I will not take time to elaborate on the details of each episode, but merely invite any and all to treat yourself to some wonderful entertainment - you will NOT be dissappointed!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a good solitaire game and easy to play.  I find it challenging enough to be worth doing and still fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game that the family can enjoy together. It is very user friedly. My 3 yr old loves it![[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B008Y6PK34|5.0|This film is one of the few that I can watch over and over and still not lose interest in it.  Helen Mirren is so good in her role that she probably has done more to explain how the royals got into such a bind when Diana died.
B003U4ZQRK|1.0|They Lost there way or there writers, i liked all the other seasons but completely hated the 5th, its like a soap opera now,totally geared toward woeman.It makes me not even want to watch the last season.
B009EELBIS|5.0|The story and the music - what a combination.  Romance, adventure and history all presented as a recipe bound together by humor and music.  What could be better?
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It's a good game just a few things to improve but other than that it's a great game<br />I give it five stars
B00846F1YW|4.0|This an entertaining little game, similar to the others. A good time killer. Not bad for the free app. Ok
B008JFUMT2|1.0|If you don't like \\"Die Hard,\\" then you may want to get yourself checked out. The original film from 1988 is held in extremely high regard even to this day. It's often labeled as one of the greatest action films of all time and some even consider it to be their favorite Christmas themed film, as well. \\"Die Hard 2\\" and \\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\\" are entertaining sequels while \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" was okay; not great and hardly worth the 12 year wait between films, but passable. Something really terrible happened with \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" though. Maybe it's because director John Moore is saying that it was Bruce Willis who came up with the idea of John McClane being reunited with his son, but \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" feels like the one movie Nicolas Cage rejected in the past millennium that Bruce Willis decided to scoop up. That's an enormous feat considering this is the fifth film in an ongoing franchise.<br /><br />Get ready for a big, heaping portion of thick and extremely stiff acting from both Sebastian Koch and Radivoje Bukvic. Are you trying to portray Russians who can't act? If so, you're doing a good job. Bad acting and stiff dialogue rear their ugly head in the opening scene and just douse the movie in their thick juices repeatedly until it ends. The score sounds like this generic rip-off blend of Thomas Newman's \\"Skyfall\\" soundtrack and Hans Zimmer's and James Newton Howard's \\"The Dark Knight\\" soundtrack. If none of that gets to you, then the lousy camera work will. There is this lengthy car chase that is completely held back by disoriented cinematography and reprehensible dialogue (more on that later). Everything is so blurry and shaky. Meanwhile what you can make out is so sloppy, shots aren't steady, and the camera seems to zoom-in suddenly for no reason at all and is jiggled around like someone is holding a camcorder while drunk and trying to balance on a trampoline.<br /><br />Bruce Willis turns 58 this year. While middle age usually means slowing down for possible retirement or at least investing in some chewy vitamins or laxatives, it apparently means that John McClane has become indestructible. In this film alone he flips a truck and then gets up and runs away without a scratch, rolls two cars, jumps out of a building twice, and is thrown through a window by a helicopter. There's also the ridiculous amount of one-liners you have to put up with that are just so corny and feel so forced that you almost forget about that weird gun-knife thing John's son Jack (Jai Courtney) has on him for half the movie that always has to be pointed out for some reason. We get it; it's a knife that shoots bullets.<br /><br />Golden examples of John's lame dialogue includes yelling \\"Guess who?\\" at a truck, calling Komarov (Koch) \\"Papa Gepetto,\\" the McClanes offering each other hugs and then bringing up that they're not a hugging family, John asking Jack \\"You're not gonna cry again, are you?\\" before giving him a hard time about it for five minutes, jumping and falling out of a building and then asking if Jack wants to go again, and John saying he deserves the father of the year award. The phrases, \\"Shut up!\\" and \\"I'm on vacation!\\" are also only said about a dozen times each. It's the gift that keeps on giving.<br /><br />In between all of these daddy issues between Jack and John, Komarov is in possession of a file that could assist in incriminating corrupt Russian official Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov). An all out war breaks out between the CIA, which Jack works for, and the men who work under Chagarin and his lackey Alik (Radivoje Bukvic). A good portion of the film is devoted to Jack trying to get Komarov to a safe place with John in tow. Jack keeps talking about how John screwed him and continuously brings up how there's no time for this or that, but then makes time to stand around and listen to daddy's emotional breakdown. Alik decides to do his best Bugs Bunny impression in front of his hostages before doing a little jigand pointing out that he could have been a dancer. The sad thing is that bullet piercing your brain would hurt a lot less than witnessing him dance or try to act again, but it does make you wonder why they didn't try to squeeze in Elton John's \\"Tiny Dancer\\" during the end credits.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, someone is shot in the head and then the gunman shoots this same individual five times in the chest. The body lingers around and is shown on camera for the next few scenes. Once you see the body lying on the ground, you see that this individual was wearing a bullet proof vest and where the bullets hit completely rendering those extra shots pointless. Maybe it was a new gun that was just being tested out or maybe it's some unusual Russian custom. The real culprit probably lies within the writer trying to write this movie blindfolded with a potato bag over his head while being hogtied, skewered, and slowly rotated over a roaring campfire like some sort of weird hillbilly approved rotisserie.<br /><br />There's one scene in \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" where John and Jack jump out of a building and fall through its layers in slow motion. It lasts maybe 60 seconds and is the only enjoyable aspect of what is otherwise a waste of 97 minutes. Its cinematography is a mess, the acting is painful, the dialogue seems like it will cause permanent brain damage if exposed to it for too long (kind of like the radiation in Chernobyl), and the entire story gives you fatigue as soon as it starts because it's been done so many times. Those laxatives are sounding pretty good right about now, aren't they John?and pointing out that he could have been a dancer.

1452110581|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my niece who has two house cats!  She loved the book and was laughing as she told me.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Thank you the timely delivery of this movie is fantastic. My son is coming home from boot camp and I wanted to make sure that it was here for him.  Fantastic Job!!
0143114085|3.0|I did enjoy reading this novel and I thought that the story-line was brilliant.However, there are a number of errors that I found irritating and spoiled that enjoyment. On page 102, the author has the protagonist describe herself as being 'cast' as the victim in the drama triangle that she has created.this is a misconception of the drama triangle.Without going into too much detail, the drama triangle is part of transactional analysis and the protagonist is right in that there are three positions of victim, persecutor and rescuer. However,these aren't three separate people but two and at one point there is a switch of positions.For instance one person may switch from victim to persecutor.On page 117 a woman is described as having a large bosom that would be more fitting on someone more buxom. That is what 'buxom' is - having a large bosom.<br />This novel could have been so much more.
0316228532|5.0|But I loved it! I don't know why so many people didn't like it - maybe because they were expecting something like Harry Potter? It's not a happy story, but it's really well written. It was a little tough at the beginning to figure out/remember all the characters, but other than that, it was great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love all three of the books in this series..... I blushed and I laughed at several parts! Good book.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Not just shoot'em up.  The story is well written.  If you like CIA/ special ops, this movie is for you.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Very boring. Nothing related to the airplane crash or investigation. The movie is based on the denzel drink problem and them he accept he has alchool problems.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is an easy and relaxing book to read full of twists & turns. It's fast pace, easy to understand and follow. After reading the two preseding books it brought everything together with a great and surprising ending.  Great reading.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this series! It is historically engaging. The characterization is great. Love the costumes too. It's my &#34;guilty pleasure!&#34;
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Even for none runners, this would be an enjoyable book to read.  I was sad to finish it as l did not want it to end.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the features better than the weather channel app. The hourly is helpful and the locations work well. I recommend
B009FZHYKU|1.0|the season looks good but im pay for $15.12 plus $1.89 for all the season and today I had to pay more , I cheated ,I consider myself a good customer of amazon but this is the second time that I find myself in a situation like this
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|And that is the good news! This movie is in the best (recent) tradition of Casino Royale. Car chase? Check. Bond-in-Trouble? Check. Villian's plot actually makes some kind of sense? Check.<br /><br />Superb performances all around - from Dame Judi Dench (who i've hated up through this most recent installment where she has redeemed herself) to the &#34;old family groundskeeper&#34;, characters were fascinating and provocative. The plot actually made sense, even when the science didn't.<br /><br />Fantastic new performances: The new Q - I love the Quartermaster reference and the realism of the gadgets given to Bond. No &#34;exploding pens&#34; indeed. As for the shiny 'Minority Report' interfaces, I can't complain as they told the story far better than reality would have.<br /><br />I cannot wait for this Bond to return.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm keeping this one short & sweet. MUST READ...enough said :)<br />it is the only book that i've finished ready & immediately read again. I've read it now five times and each time i fall deeper in love with Abby & Travis!....if you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for???
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I recommend reading this one.  It is an easy read and touching story told by a dog!  Would recommend it.
B00846REIS|4.0|let me start off by saying this is not a negative review. after getting back into reading, i read this a few books after FSOG & kept comparing the two & that's what took me out of it THE FIRST TIME. then after reading 40+ books i realized that books can have things in common, but it all depends on the author and how they write their stories. i loved this book the second time around. Keeps me wanting more.
0765325950|5.0|I bought this book for my wife, because she is a huge Wheel of Time fan. She loved it! It's the last book of a very long series, so it's great that I bought it for her.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Christian and Ana are trying to settle into the new life they've built but outside influences keep trying their limits. Christian is still Christian but Ana to me is coming into her own and isn't as meek as she was when we first met her. Many people get what they deserve in this installment including the Grey's. I think if you've enjoyed books one and two that Freed will bring the story full circle and leave you satisfied.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My mother put me on to this game and I can play it for hours!  It really is a stress reliever!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|GREAT! it's just like a good movie that you say oh the sequel cannot live up to the original...this can & it was even better than the first. the book never dragged and was pissed when i was done because now it leaves me hangin' until the next one :)
B00170I7GG|5.0|one of the best romantic comedies ever. right up there with planes, trains, and automobiles and one of the very few movies i watch at least once a year.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone and everyone because it makes you really think about your life and your circumstances. Especially parents should read this to connect with what their kids may be going through.
1451696191|2.0|I wanted to like this, I did- it's one of the original YA book! But the borrowing from The Catcher in the Rye was just too much for me. And before you protest that it's original (and there are some differences- that's why I was able to give it 2 stars) let's take a look at some similarities:<br /><br />- Both are well-read<br />- Both end with the main character going to a mental facility<br />- Both rely on teachers as mentors (and both visit their homes)<br />- Both protagonists are very intelligent<br />- Both have trouble making new friends<br />- Both are very affected by dead  family member<br />- Both are self-aware (they know that they are struggling)<br />- Both have similar syntax<br />- Both have experimentation with alcohol/drugs<br />- Both are intimidated by sex<br />- Both are respectful of women<br />- Both are from the first person narratives<br />- Both value sibings<br /><br />Drop mic.
068485743X|4.0|Those things you know you have to fix in your Ms, but you haven't figured out how to do that? One or two might not kill your ms. but there are never only one or two. Lukeman, a longtime agent, shows how to fix them, even the very tough ones like pacing. Excellent book, and may spare the writer a case of sender's remorse. (You know, you hit &#34;Send,&#34; and then you read your e-mail just once more, and you see all those things you really should have caught before you hit send: sender's remorse.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is something here for everyone!!!  Don't like the game you chose?  No problem....go on to the next one!<br />Fast gameplay for that quicky break!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Love the Batman series and glad they did this one- but will go back and watch  1 and 2 more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If the option for an infinite amount of stars to rate this story, well then I'd spend everyday of my life filling out those infinite stars. Dean Holder is Hopeless until he sees Sky. Sky feels nothing most of the time with boys she's with until she sees Dean. Right away there's something there, connecting the two. This story of Hopelessness will have you laughing at Sky's quick and clever sassy remarks, to holding your breath as secrets slowly unravel themselves between Sky and Holder. It will also have you feeling a little heated between their need for each other. (; A truly astounding and heartbreaking story about finding out who you really are when you thought you already know.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in two days. Well written with unexpected twists and turns. A must read! I would highly recommend this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game!! It reminds me so much of the old school Mario game that I grew up playing :-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so awesome! You should totally get this app! I TOTALLY LOVE THIS APP! If you get this app too you'll like this app too.
B001QTMSYA|5.0|I would recommend this to any hardcore MCR fans.<br />It arrived in great packaging and was exactly as described.<br />It also arrived way before the expected date which was amazing!<br />I love it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have a hard time putting this one down! The price is great and of you love hidden object games, this one is for you!<br />I bought this for my Kindle HD 8.9&#34; tablet, and the artistry is fantastic, and the ame doesn't &#34;ding&#34; you for wrong taps or for directional hints! After all, we're in it for the hidden object search.<br />The android price was great. The iPad version, not so much. You get a trial version and then the purchase price was too rich for my blood.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Everything was excellent!!!!  I received the book in my kindle app within seconds and I received the necessary code within minutes.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very good book, Mr. Landry captures a teenagers thoughts and language. He really makes you feel like you were in the courtroom. It's a Quick read and I would think anyone would like reading it.  It really makes you think, as a parent, what would you do.
B002BVQU5A|4.0|The movie ran smoothly and with no glitches. It was fun to see Johnny Depp again from 20 years ago.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|Very good martial arts movie both Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu were both out standing and martial sequences were to perfection.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|Great place to store pictures and at a good price. The only part I didn't like is I found sharing pictures a little tedious.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|awesome and inspiring for an extra-biblical content movie.  There were areas which are truly secular in teaching but still goo inspiration.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What is all the brouhaha about?  A Harlequin romance with hands tied.  The characters are boring and predictable.  Don't waste your time.
B000002OOY|5.0|This is a great soundtrack.  I hope the full score from the movie gets released on either CD or digital download in time for the 20th anniversary 3D re-release.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Works well with fire, but I wish skipping dialogue was easier. Stays interesting longer than similar games. Uses shadows and description and various versions.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I just live this show laughter is always good for the soul I love it I watch it all the time just having theses season are great to have to watch when I like..
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I am a huge Batman fan and thought \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" were some awesome movies. That's why I couldn't wait to see this one, especially since \\"The Dark Knight\\" ended with Batman going on the run. I've got to admit, I have mixed feelings for this one. In some ways it's an awesome movie, and in others it's crap.<br /><br />First let me say that the length of the movie is far too long (at least ten minutes too long). It's 2 hours 45 minutes long and could have easily been 2 hours 35 minutes long. Alfred argues with Bruce Wayne a lot, in three scenes, and in the third scene (which is about 4 minutes long) he decides to leave, refusing to help Batman at all. I don't know about you, but I perfer Batman's and Alfred's relationship better in the previous Batmans as opposed to this one. Plus it's one of the main reasons that makes this film so long and slow moving. Take away those scenes and you take away 7 minutes of the movie. They could have also done without the love scene between Batman and Miranda. That's another 3 minutes.<br /><br />It's also funny how director Christopher Nolan didn't want to use the Riddler in this film because he thought the Riddler was too simular to the Joker, and yet Bane's character in this film is characterized very much like Heath Ledger's Joker by preying on people's fears and gullibility to manipulate them into doing his dirty work just like the Joker did in \\"The Dark Knight\\".<br /><br />Not to mention the ridiculous ending which could have been tweaked just a little bit to make a much better ending.<br /><br />This film does have some good things about it though. Bane is portrayed a lot more realistically and scarier than in other Batmans, performances are pretty good for the most part, the film does have a good plot, and the action scenes (when they finally get to them) are pretty exciting (especially when Batman and the city's cops attempt to retake the city from Bane and stop the bomb from going off).<br /><br />All in all, it's worth checking out, but I wouldn't waste my money on buying it. But in the end it's all up to you. If it turns out you like, then buy it, but it wasn't for me. And it's a shame too because I think with a little bit of tweaking, it could have been the best Batman movie of them all.n all, it's worth checking out, but I wouldn't waste my money on buying it.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|I'm an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I'm still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it's still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I'm enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This is a fun game with lots of good graphics and a spooky story line.  I have not completed the game as of this review but i think it will continue to be a good game.
B000002KB8|5.0|Chapter 1 of the book of Heavy Metal. Period. Dark themes, brooding music. Like nothing that ever came before it. If you're a hard-rocker and don't have this, you're missing an important part of the genre.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|I bought this for my granddaughte, but discovered that is was free to start, but everything we tried to do was going to cost more and more money, sorry don't call this a free game and it wasn't that much fun to play.
B006BQM762|4.0|For a free amazon prime movie it was very good. It was a movie I wanted to see when it came out but never got around to. Good rainy day or weeknight film.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|If u like these type of games buy this one I have it on my phone and kindle great games five stars
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well we're to start.. it hard to say really. I watched the movie before I read the book and I'm quite impressed at how close the movie was to the actual book so thumb up there.  I've got to say reading the book definitely draws you in and doesn't let go I read the entire book and about 5 hours total. Putting it down to get things done was really difficult. I've got to say that Suzanne Collins did a fantastic job writing it from start to finish and I'm looking forward to reading Catching Fire and subsequently Mockingjay. May the odds be ever in your favor.
0525953728|5.0|This book is a great read about a pretty historic day in America's war on terror.  This particular SEAL shows great respect and admiration for those that came before him and fought alongside him.  It is a fast read as well.  Again, much respect for our SEAL brothers in arms.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Shane and the farm are gone. The diminished group finds relief at a state prison. Meanwhile we are introduced to a town called Woodbury that has sustained a normal life with the help of the mayor who we later find out has bad intentions. Lori is lost when the baby is born. Ricks mind is starting to slip. Not all the details but what's not to love! Death, gore, suspense, drama by far my favorite show. I 💚zombies!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was recommended this book by a SEAL.  It did not disappoint.  The things these men go through for the protection of each other and United States is nothing short of amazing.  Each one of the men on this mission and each one of the men in all of the SEAL Teams deserves everyone's respect and admiration.<br />Great read as well.
0792839749|5.0|My 1st time ordering on line it came early and my son loved it!!! I will do lots more onlie ordering now :) it was a net exsperince
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|The movie itself is the next best thing instead of a continuation of the Firefly series with the same cast, writer/director, etc.  (IMHO, the TV show should never have been cancelled after only one short season; and I see nothing wrong with the originally intended episode order as shown on the \\"Firefly - The Complete Series 4-disc set\\".)<br /><br />Personally, I love watching extended scenes, deleted scenes, and outtakes.  The Collector's Edition also includes more-detailed Serenity information, including comparisons between the TV show and the movie versions of the ship - very cool how real Josh Whedon and team made both come to life.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|AAANNNGGRY BBIIRDS!!!!!!!!!!! loved it, such a awesome game to play. I can plash angry birds for hours. :) Angry birds

B009EEFTMC|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game.  There are two ways to play it.  You can either be challenged or take your time and relax and play it.  Excellent game!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|The writing is excellent.  The story line are intriguing and well crafted.  The acting is better than average.  Love every minute of it!
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|If you're looking for a DVD copy of the original cult classic... The Fog, then this is for you!  It has some cool extra features including director commentary by John Carpenter.  I'm always leary of buying DVD's online in fear of getting some pirated copy, but that wasn't the case here - it came in original packaging and factory sealing.
B0038P59A0|3.0|It's not the engrossing drama that BBC's Sherlock is, but it's a fun popcorn movie to watch when you just want to stay in.
B0095P31L6|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. The subtleties of life are amazingly portrayed. Love Rangos character. Johnny Depp was great!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this! I'm hooked! Couldn't stop watching. All of the characters are simply lovely. My favorite is Lady Mary. Her love  of Matthew.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fun's Some Nights has been in continual rotation on my car CD since the summer, and on my dog-walking ipod rotation as well and I'm wondering what kind of hypnotic, addictive powers Nate Ruess's voice has over me.  These songs are joyful, despondent, imaginative, psychotic, just like real life. It's one of those albums where I can't rank my songs in order of favorites as there is something I love in each of the tracks.  Now I've added Aim & Ignite to the rotation and have to go back and forth between the two albums.  Great artists.
034580404X|5.0|I certainly do not agree to being a submissive but I found this series amazingly entertaining in every way. I loved every bit of where it went and how it ended. Outstanding. I would recommend it to spice up the love life any couple or single person.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|Came to Aim & Ignite because I was looking for more Fun after Some Nights.  There are some really fantastic songs on this album, number one is The Gambler, which I tend to put on my itunes repeat as I go about my day, or Be Calm, which is a genius song that will provide a constant challenge to anyone who likes to sing along and aim at getting the lyrics 100 percent right.  I still can't do it on that one.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|We purchased the series to watch with our 4 children.  It provides a great platform to talk to our kids about tough life issues.  We enjoy the episodes and have some great discussions after!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A little short, but still a good game with good graphics.  I did enjoy it, and will most likely play several more times.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I liked it. The other seasons seem to be more interesting.<br />I am know watching it on t.v.. Hope it continues.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I have had lots of problems trying to use this Bible. I can'y access different things . I am still trying to work it out.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Repeat after me:<br /><br />&#34;Introducing Kenzie, Hale's bitchin' girlfriend.  Family- Waddup!  Clan- Hey Now!&#34;<br /><br />The Girl Who Faed With Fire is the best episode ever!
1400032717|5.0|We have an autistic son.  its always interesting to get a chance to read about other kids with similar challenges, especially to hear &#34;from the horses mouth&#34; so to speak.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Love their sound.  Kinda 70's Motown funk with an alternative twist.  The only song I'm not crazy about was State of the Art.  I know they were trying something different, but it just came out weird.  Every other song is really good (especially their single Somebody That I Used To Know).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband asked me to watch this, I am not a zombie fan. However I really enjoy this show. There are lots of different stories within one episode. Something for both of us to enjoy.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I have seen both seasons and they are awesome, but the first season puts me in my elusive &#34;happy&#34; place.
B008DM4OTA|1.0|i download this for a little kid and it always shuts or restart my phone, horrible app i would say
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel is a wonderful actor.  Not sure about the ending....in some ways it was really good and in another sad.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|more updated with curves and new running technique and the quality is much better. With new skills, it's more fun
B002JWD6AS|4.0|This was an awesome book! I truly enjoyed reading this one. Can't wait to read the next one! Thank you.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|this game is so much fun and hard at some point when going after OCD. but i wanted to see the painter =[
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed Colleen Hoover's previous 2 books and new I would enjoy Hopeless too, but instead I absolutely LOVED it.  One of my favorite stories.  I kept getting surprised by what happened next, loved how it all came together, and really loved the sweetest love story between the 2 main characters.  A great read!
B0085YNML2|5.0|i like this game and so does everyone else who plays it on my phone. some 3rd and 4th were thinkers i would say
B008MEM24S|5.0|my kids love this game it is such a blast. they enjoy every aspect of the game. makes you think quite alot of finding ways to get water or steam where you need to.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I kept reading because of the suspense build up, but I did not enjoy the characters.  We never do find out what makes them tick.  The twin sister is really poorly developed.
B009X00E18|5.0|I love the stream lined mareware covers! they fit the kindle perfectly and are easy to keep clean! Not balky and easy to carry the kindle around in anything! A better color selection would be nice!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is what everyone said, very addictive.<br /><br />My question is for anyone who has a Kindle fire and bought the new Fire HD.  Has anyone tried transferring this game to the new HD from the old fire and does it maintain whatever level you are at?
B009X01D9U|5.0|rEALLY LIKE THE COLOR AND THE WAY THE KINDLE FITS IN IT BUT IT IS A LITTLE BULCKY! WILL USE IT FOR TRAVELING
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a very handy tool. Enabeles me to pull up programs in the house on my laptop or my tablet without going back to my shop computer. To ck. The status on a job ready to be pickedup. The total charges and ect. How ever sometime it don't seem to update right away. But very good app.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|Havent used it to much, need to have time to play with transferring photos! Wish the kindle had double sided camera!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I can have it on my HTC Hero, my Samsung Tablet, and my MacBook Pro and can switch from one to the other!<br />That means that I can read anywhere, at any time, no matter how dark or light!<br />Thanks Amazon, for this wonderful app!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Fun game just sont play it enough! need to see what it can all do! would be fun to play against my friends!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Macht wirklich Spass und ist sehr abwechslungsreich. Es gibt immer wieder neue Herausforderungen. Ausserdem wird auf angenehme Weise das Gedächtnis trainiert. trainiereNden man das Freischalten neuer Locations einen Obulus zahlen muss, finde ich okay.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|nice to use on bigger device, works flawlessly and have it on all of my devices, reccomended to use everywhere
B0066WJLU6|2.0|It does what it says, but it is nothing special or overly bright.  just open up a book on your kindle and you will get as much light
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|I haven't used it, I think the kindle should have a double facing camera, and then this app would be more useful!
B009G78EE2|5.0|I checked out this record because I loved the Thrift Shop song, and found it to be a wonderful collection altogether. There's a great variety of sounds and subjects to choose from.
