0684857219|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger's New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding is an immensely helpful book. Its 800 pages are carefully organized into broad sections on diet, competition, training programs, exercises for specific muscle groups, and even the history of bodybuilding.<br /><br />What I found most helpful were the straightforward descriptions of exercises and equipment, and the many, many illustrations. After buying this book I immediately improved my workout regimen, and while I may never be an Arnold (one function of this book is to keep the amateur humble), I'm certainly better off than before.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

IF YOU LIKE TRUE HORROR FILMS AND NOT ALL THE CRAP THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM 1990 UNTIL NOW, YOU WILL RESPECT THIS FILM.  WATCH IT ONCE, AND THEN WATCH IT AGAIN AND SLEEP ON IT.

B0000DZEE3|5.0|I am more of a metal fan,and RHCP was never really a constant on my playlist.But that has changed after watching this DVD.This concert blew me away.This is a \\"musicians\\" band..not just a rock band with a few hits.This is amply demonstrated in the fantastic improvisations that almost every song features.JF is inspirational.He shreds like the best of them,sings beautifully and lends soul to every song with his back up vox.Chad Smith tears up the place with a simple 3 peice kit....amazing.The easy vibe of the band,the crowd and the location is a treat to revell in.I wish this concert would have taken place after Stadium Arcadiums release.Having some songs from there in the kind of form the boys are in here, would have made this the best concert ever in the history of music concerts.Production values are top notch.My only gripe would be that the extra's provided are bloody useless.Some gear talk or band interviews would have been fun.All in all - a must buy dvd for any rock fan.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|It's a rare thing that a TV series based upon a movie's premise ends up being as good as the show's origins: while slow to start, with a dreadful pilot and many sub-par episodes, the first series of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, over-all, became something that arguably lived up to that standard.    The show follows Sarah and John as they try, again, to prevent Judgement Day. The show follows on from the original two movies, generally ignoring the third (thankfully.) Much of the plot surrounds the character of Cameron, a female terminator sent back from the future to protect John. The show, so far at least, has eschewed predictable cliches involving the character, and often takes the viewer by surprise, from displays of dark humor to dragging the viewer through alternate displays of coldness and humanity.    Episodes I particularly recommend include \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" and the jaw-dropping follow-up \\"The Demon Hand\\". Performances are variable. Lena Headey doesn't match Linda Hamilton's portrayal of the title character, reflecting more the post-La Femme Nikita (Dark Angel, Bionic Woman) obsession with angsty heroines. Thomas Dekker either gives the best or the second-best performance as John Connor, depending on whether you're familiar with the Director's Cut of Terminator 2. It's a good performance. The best performances are arguably by Summer Glau and Richard T Jones, as Cameron - a Terminatrix sent back to protect the Connors - and James Ellison - the surprised FBI agent chasing Sarah Connor - respectively. Glau's performance, while initially confused, provides depictions of humour and coldness that surprises or shocks the viewer every time.    This DVD set is reasonable for what you pay for, reflecting the short nine-episode run of the first season, cut short due to the 2008 Writer's Strike. The set includes a few commentaries and cut scenes. The aforementioned \\"Demon Hand\\" episode is complemented by a \\"rough-cut\\" of an alternative version, though the jarring changes in visual and audio quality make it somewhat difficult to enjoy by itself. Over-all, visual quality is excellent, I doubt you'll get much more enjoyment out of the less portable Blu-ray edition.    For all of their qualities, the original two Terminator films - at least, as released theatrically - were basic killer robot fantasies with their depth being limited to surface level discussions of time travel and anthropomorphism. Some would argue that the Director's Cut of T2 was a considerable step above this and I'd agree with them. But regardless, the first series of The Sarah Connor Chronicles managed to rise above the Theatrical versions of the movies: what seemed like another attempt to cash in on a pop-culture classic turned out to be a smart, entertaining, thought-provoking science fiction series. This DVD set is definitely recommended.

B00004Y6NK|3.0|If you're familiar with Eric Clapton's output in the 80s, and mix in the influence of Phil Collins, August is a fairly predictable album. It has a few really good songs (The Way That You Use It, Tearing Us Apart) and several other songs that are decent enough to make this one worth owning for Clapton fans. I don't mean predictable in a necessarily bad way, I mean that it sounds like No Jacket Required crossed with a mellowed post-rehap Clapton. A lot of it sounds dated, with 80s synth and drum sounds. But Clapton is an exceptional musician and so is Phil Collins, so this is in no way a \\"bad\\" album. It's just not a CD that blows me away. After you've worn out all the Cream material, the Layla album, his self-titled \\"Eric Clapton\\" release, and burned out on the greatest hits, if you want some more EC, buy Journeyman. Then, if you'd like another good Clapton CD pick up August.

B0007XZUIW|4.0|Out of the 4 Avril CDs (Let It Go, \\"acoustic EP,\\" Best D... Thing) her 2nd release, Under My Skin, is my least favorite. However, that's not at all saying this is not an excellent package, it just shows how great her entire output is and that she gives herself some very stiff competition. I highly recommend the special edition with the DVD, because that's a very cool addition with a lot of insight to Avril's life on tour and really worthwhile interviews and footage. I like the DVD included with this package better than the DVD that comes with The Best D... Thing package (although that one is very good also). If you're an Avril fan like me, you need to have all of her albums and Under My Skin is no exception. Avril is much more than a record-company-product. In fact, she's not that at all. Avril is the real deal- she's a multi-instrumentalist, a fantastic songwriter, an amazing singer (who doesn't need to use computers to fix her vocals), and a high-energy performer. The DVD lets fans see that she's also fairly grounded, and a professional musician. I think she will be around for a long time even if her popularity fades I bet she will be making good music for years to come. Just as a side note, I'm not in what I believe is Avril's target demographic. I am a 36 year old male musician, who listens to a lot of classic rock and heavy metal. I don't listen to commercial radio or even have MTV. I got into Avril after hearing a mostly acoustic concert she did, then I started buying her CDs and every one has been really good. My favorite tracks on Under My Skin include: Take Me Away, He Wasn't, Happy Ending, Nobody's Home. The bonus DVD alone makes this worth buying for Avril fans.

B000VAHR00|3.0|I saw Logan's Run in 1976 and about the best I can say about it is that it was \\"so-so\\" even for the science fiction films of that year. As one writer has stated, the same can be said about the DVD transfer. I must reluctantly give this film three stars and think I am being generous.<br /><br />The best feature of this film was beautiful Jenny Agutter who played lovely Jessica while Michael York played Logan by the numbers. Peter Ustinov was as good as could be expected playing an \\"old man\\". I don't see how he let them talk him into making this turkey.<br /><br />I also think the film may deserve an \\"A\\" for effort for the model work done to produce the many exterior views of Logan's City. However, in execution it only came off like a very well done train layout of the 50's. It just wasn't something that professional special effects people or cinematographers could be proud of.<br /><br />After seeing the groundbreaking work of Kubrick's 2001, this film just couldn't be considered good sci-fi. It really was a major disappointment and I was embarrassed to have suggested seeing it. I purchased the DVD just to remind myself to try to make better film suggestions.<br /><br />This happened after promising my new bride of a couple of month's marriage that our visit to the theater wouldn't be a complete waste of her time. How could I know it would be this poor? I read about how grand it was in the newspaper. She looked at me when we left the theater and I didn't say a word. Needless to say I was in for a couple of \\"slice-of-life\\" movies after this turkey.<br /><br />Students of architecture will appreciate that the great city of Logan's Run was prophetic of the construction materials and style of many of the modern malls popping up across the country. Perhaps this has more to do with the price of contemporary construction materials of that time than in any visionary thinking on the part of the set designers.<br /><br />In my defense, the newspapers wrote promising hype about upcoming grand science fiction films to be released starting in 1976 and mentioned Logan's Run as one outstanding example. As you would imagine when I went to see the film in an excellent theater with good sound and a large screen I was beyond disappointment. It was only when we went to see STAR WARS that I was partially redeemed and my wife would again allow me to suggest a movie without too much discussion.e released starting in 1976 and mentioned Logan's Run as one outstanding example.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|As with any book to movie, after you've read the book, the movie doesn't ever quite do it justice, but this one came close.  I didn't feel like much was left out, or any major extra things put in.  The world created, looked much like the world I imagined, so I was pleased with this movie, even for those who have not read the book, this story is an endearing love story.

B0011HF6GE|5.0|Bob Boilen has been raving about this album for a while, and I'm sure every other independent music spokesman has been too. Bon Iver is comprised mainly of Justin Vernon who isolated himself in a cabin in Wisconsin where he wrote this album over the course of a winter. The name Bon Iver is a pun on the French \\"Bon Hiver\\" which translates \\"Good Winter.\\" The music is dark, haunting and entrancing and Vernon's vocals are so unique. The album is decorated with atmospheric harmonies, baritone guitars, twanging sounds, a dash of horns, and masterful production that brings out all of the different colors of winter. Grays, whites, blacks and the like. The lyrics are dark and pensive, and quite obscure. This album will be talked about for a while, since it's clear that something is holding it together as a cohesive unit but quite unclear what it is that is holding it together. I can't wait to drive in light snow with this album on the speakers and see where I end up. Whether you know what he's singing about, Bon Iver is certainly the perfect soundtrack to a bon hiver and this will probably find it's way close to the top of a lot of top albums lists at the end of the year.

075640407X|5.0|I just finished reading the book, only a few days after I bought it. Great read and a page turner. Somewhat similar to the Harry Potter books but much more realistic and for a mature audiance. Characters are more belivable and everything happens with a sort of cause and effect type of way. The main character is not invincible or a fairy tale hero. He is very much an everyday person. The author is very clever and knows how to change the mood and set the tone of each scene. He throws you right into the rich world and you forget yourself while reading it. I cared about the characters way more than I even did while reading the Harry Potter books. Very recommended. Can't wait for book 2.

B0008ENHTE|4.0|1968's \\"Bullitt\\" featured Steve McQueen at the top of his game as tough, laconic San Francisco police detective Frank Bullitt, assigned to protect an important Mob witness.  When the witness is gunned down in his hiding place, Bullitt is on the clock to find the perpetrators as quickly as possible.<br /><br />If the plot rarely rises above what would now be a mundane police procedural, the two chase scenes are the highlights of the movie.  One is the iconic, oft-imitated but never matched car chase between McQueen and two fleeing gunmen up and down the streets of San Francisco.  The second is a climatic chase on foot through San Francisco Airport for a fleeing suspect.<br /><br />Bullitt is a classic McQueen role, played as understated, realistic, single-minded cop.  Bullitt is an anti-hero absolutely without frills or pretension and utterly inhabited by McQueen.  McQueen is backed by Robert Vaughn as an ruthlessly ambitious district attorney and Simon Oakland as his tough police boss.  Jacqueline Bissett has a cameo as Bullitt's girlfriend.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to fans of Steve McQueen.  Forty years on, it holds up remarkably well as an example of some of his best work.
0618918248|1.0|Dawkins is fine in biology, its his field, and he survives his brief (formula free) forays into chemistry.  But he fails utterly in his attempt at physics.  Going below atoms (which is all the further down Dawkins goes -- almost like examining the African savanna by looking only at the elephants) to the world of the quanta his argument starts to wear thin.  The infinite sustaining of reality at the quantum level, as a buffeted instantly variable field, is precisely where God does interact.  Dawkins doesn't go there and that is his main failing in the part of the book entitled \\"Why there almost certainly is no God.\\"  First, he posits that God must be simple, which is not logical, and must be circumscribed by his own creation, which is not possible.  He uses a lot of philosophical arguments and does not delve into the reality of the quantum foam, of the seething flow of \\"instantons\\" and quarks where the deterministic, cause-and-effect world of his logic begins to give way to the kind of weirdness that can ONLY be described in terms of the totality. His \\"atoms\\" are manifestations of the illustrations and simplifications of the ultimate reality which lies orders of magnitude below them.  Down in the quantum foam, in the totality of the field, is where the sustaining of every part of existence lies.  His inability to see \\"atoms\\" as something other than concrete, physical, ball bearings, to the reality of their existence as mathematical simplifications of an all-encompassing, multi-dimensional field which is neither here nor there and dispenses with both time and space as mere illustrative constructs. The reality is in the math and Dawkins stays carefully, or through ignorance, out of that world in his argument.  Read Roger Penrose, Godel, or even Einstein (Dawkins discusses Einstein as a man, as a philosopher but never as a mathematical theorist), and you come away with a picture that is vastly more complex than the straw man simplifications of God that Dawkins knocks down. By this weird idea that God must be simple he can argue away a simple God, but remove the word simple and replace it with \\"infinitely complex, infinitely unknowable, unfathomable, omniscient, omnipresent\\" and he has no real argument at all.     There can be no part of the universe without its totality.  Ultimately, there is no here or there, now or later, past or future, all of these are just simplifications so that we can try to fit reality into our biological limitations.  Grand Unified Theories, string theory, the realities of quantum entanglement, teleportation (its easy to be in two places at once when you're not anywhere at all), all are tantalizing hints that behind the shorelines of our experience lies a vast ocean of not just unknown but unknowable.  It might be \\"Spinoza's'God\\" but it still exists.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|2007's \\"Death at a Funeral\\" is very British humor, a series of sight gags and slow rolling social catastrophies that threaten to overwhelm one dysfunctional family's valiant attempt to conduct a dignified funeral service. An outstanding cast stiff-upper-lips its way through this short and tightly paced comedy.<br /><br />As the story opens, dutiful son Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen) and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) host the funeral service for Daniel's father at their country home.  As relatives and friends gather for the service, things begin to go wrong.  The funeral home delivers the wrong body to the service.  Simon (Alan Tudyk), the fiance of Daniel's cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan) accidentally ingests an hallucinatory drug and slowly but hilariously proceeds to come unglued during the ceremony.  Martha's brother (Kris Marshall) who made up the drug, spends the movie trying to retrieve the medicine bottle when he isn't helping to move an inconveniently dead body.  Another cousin, Howard (Andy Nyman), gets stuck with the care of cantankerous Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughn), leading to a disasterous incident of scatological humor.  A friend (Peter Dinklage) of the dead father turns out to be a blackmailer, who must somehow be kept from disrupting the service.  Sundry other family members decide the funeral service is the right time to air family laundry.  Daniel and his estranged brother Robert (Rupert Graves) deadpan their way through the middle of the chaos, trying to sort out their relationship while keep the service on schedule.  The much put-upon Daniel will assert himself at the end to retrieve what little dignity remains in the ceremony, revealing MacFadyen to have a subtle sense of comic timing.<br /><br />This movie earns its R rating with strong language, some nudity, and drug use.  With those cautions given, this is one funny movie, highly recommended to those addicted to its very British humor.  Don't forget to check out the gag reel included in the DVD extras, to see just how hard it was for the actors to deliver their lines.hard it was for the actors to deliver their lines.
B00104W8T6|5.0|\\"Juno\\" was an excellent movie, and I was amazed to learn, when I read the liner notes to this soundtrack CD, that the script had been written before any of the songs were selected, because they fit the movie so extremely well (not only in creating appropriate moods for scenes, but also having lyrics remarkably applicable to the movie's characters). It stands on its own as a collection of music, but if you have seen \\"Juno\\" it brings you right back into the middle of the movie (it is a movie that sticks in your mind for a long time afterwards). The last movie soundtrack this good was \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\".

B000HIVQ94|4.0|The evolution of Depeche Mode hit stride when they tackled their fourth album. Instead of the thinly structured synth-pop of the two follow-ups to [[ASIN:B000ESSTKQ Speak & Spell]], \\"Some Great Reward\\" took the plunge into the heart of darkness. They'd gotten caught up with technology, giving the sound a fuller feel, and the lyrical content became more mature and cynical. The Dominance/Submission roleplay of \\"Master and Servant\\" (which was the second single) and the sociological blast of \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" picked and cut deeper than before.<br /><br />This was also the album that made Depeche Mode in the states. \\"People Are People\\" got into the American Top 20, and according the liner notes by producer Daniel Miller, the first thing recorded for the album. Egalitarian in tone, DM apparently even tried to darken the sound of the song lest it be construed as too pop. Those three particular songs make \\"Some Great Reward\\" on a par with [[ASIN:B000ESSTL0 Violator]] and [[ASIN:B000002L9M Black Celebration]] for consistency.<br /><br />Like all the reissued back catalog of Depeche Mode, the 5.1 remix of the bonus disc is terrific. It fills the room with both the arena ready music that the Mode was growing into, but emphasizes the industrial samples the band was adding to the music. The clanging metal and factory wheezing leaps from the mix and shows just how ahead of the curve the band was. As for the mini-movie, \\"You can get away with anything...\\" chronicles the band working on the LP. I doubt I'll watch it more than twice. A pair of B-Sides and a remix of the lovely \\"Somebody\\" round out the package.<br /><br />Given that Depeche Mode would next reach their emotionally darkest music by the next CD and then blast to superstardom (\\"Black Celebration,\\" [[ASIN:B000002LCI Music for the Masses]]), this is the CD where you can here it drop into high gear. The remastering alone is worth the extra bills.
B00104QSOM|5.0|This film is almost three hours long, and there's not a word of dialogue for the first fifteen minutes, but I could barely believe it when the credits rolled. Based upon the novel Oil! (1927) by Upton Sinclair, the film is set in the wild California frontier at the end of the 19th and beginning of the early twentieth-centuries. Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, a silver miner who discovers crude oil on his land, and Paul Dano, who plays a preacher named Eli Sunday who sells rights to the oil on his family's property in order to help his church. Playview and Sunday become moral rivals, and thirty years later, at the end of the film, both characters have been deeply corrupted. Plainview goes mad, whereas Eli admits that he's a fake and God doesn't exist. In an important sub-plot, Plainview's adopted son lives under his father's very dark shadow, and declares at the end of the film, \\"I thank God I have none of you in me.\\" Plainview's own last words are a confessional understatement: \\"I'm finished.\\" Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film won two Academy Awards -- Best Actor for Day-Lewis and Best Cinematography for Robert Elswitt.

B000B5OD4I|5.0|This watch has the cleanest, most readable face of any watch on the market today.  Even for middle-aged eyes, the time is easy to see at  a glance in almost any light.  The metal band, often maligned by reviewers, is actually a very attractive copy of the Rolex-style \\"jubilee\\" band, with large side-links in brushed stainless steel and inner small links of mirror-polished stainless steel.  The case is a flowing sculpture which alternates brushed- and polished-stainless surfaces.  I own two: one is a dark-blue face with blue and red bezel, and the other is as pictured here, with a black face and bezel.  The blue-face watch, I have had for four years, while the black-face watch is a recent purchase.  I retained the steel bracelet with the first watch, but with my new black watch, I fitted a German-made Hirsch waterproof black leather strap.  Both get compliments.  The older blue watch is a galloper, gaining approximately seven seconds per day.  After a couple of weeks of \\"break-in\\" wear, the new black watch has settled-in slow, losing about four seconds per day.  YOU WILL NOT GET \\"QUARTZ ACCURACY\\" FROM THESE WATCHES.  They WILL run, when fully-wound, with a 36-48 hour power reserve, and they will run year after year without any servicing.  Once broken-in, these watches will run CONSISTENTLY fast or slow, without detectable variance.  Learn your watch and adjust it accordingly at strict intervals, and you will be able to navigate by the stars for weeks at a time, even without an outside time reference.  Pictures do not do justice to this watch - it is beautiful, functional, and spare of style so that it won't be out of fashion when you pass it to your heir.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|Like so many others this viewer avoided the theatrical release and deferred to the DVD release of DEATH AT A FUNERAL, thinking that a comic take on a potentially morbid subject might not be very entertaining.  Couldn't have been more wrong!  This is the kind of humor the Brits do so well - intelligent, expertly delivered dialog and action that can make even the most unlikely situations hilarious.  Writer Dean Craig and Director Frank Oz have created a farce and have put this tongue in cheek situation in the hands of some the best of the British actors.  The result is a spinning top that only gradually allows the viewer to breathe from laughing during the clever final credits.<br /><br />The father of a very dysfunctional family has died and son Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen) and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) have agreed to host the funeral. After the mortuary first delivers the wrong corpse the tone is set for all the wrong things to happen.  The arriving family is a bizarre clan of characters - a novelist living beyond his means in New York (Rupert Graves), a man who unwittingly mistakes an hallucinogen for Valium and ends up on a trip that entertains all, a 'drug distributor', a crotchety old man with toilet problems, and the usual stuffy and goofy associates that so often populate the British comedies. And when it seems as though little else could support sanity, up pops a figure form the US (Peter Dinklage) with a secret about the deceased and proceeds to cause a situation that becomes the focal point of this zany funeral.<br /><br />Saying too much about each of the characters diminishes the surprises that abound. Were it not for the fact that each of the actors in the film is 'top drawer' this little movie could have become mawkish or tasteless, but this cast and director have produced one of the most refreshingly funny films of the past year.

B0000640VN|2.0|Leopold is a man from the past who follows someone into a time warp and pops out in current day New York.  He meets Kate, a modern day career woman, and the two fall in love.  Will she follow him back to his own time?  Hmm, bet you can't guess.    The storyline was simple and really could have worked if Kate had been more likeable.  Hugh Jackman played Leopold well, really making his character come alive, but I just didn't understand why he would fall for such a plain-looking, gruff woman.  There wasn't any chemistry between the two and I couldn't pinpoint the moment when the two fell in love (especially on Leopold's side).  There were some good secondary characters, but the primary relationship (or lack thereof) made this movie a dud.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|I had never heard of Tift Merritt, but this morning on my way to work Bob Edward interviewed her on XM public radio with his inimitable class.  She sounded so genuine and unassuming, and when she talked about living in Paris I was immediately smitten.      Being a Francophile myself who has spent time in Paris, I knew exactly what she meant about the French shop keeper spending four hours arranging cheeses in his window.  Then they played the cut from Another Country where she sings in French, and I just had to buy the album. I haven't even bought it yet, and I'm already writing a review.  I wish her much luck and success in the cut-throat music business.

B000P12LWY|5.0|There's much I could pick on about Showtime's The Tudors, but I won't, because why complain about a gift this magnificent? The fact is despite its anachronisms (saline injected modern-day lips, twenty-first-century makeup and hairstyles), lack of historical fidelity and head-shakingly annoying lapses in fact (I won't even begin to go into all these), it is still one of the most beautifully produced and filmed series ever made. Fine performances abound here, particularly Sam Neill's turn as the scheming Cardinal Wolsey, and as for its artistic use of lighting and set designs, the crew deserves every award out there. As it unfolds episode by episode, The Tudors is the sort of series you stare at as well as watch: yes, it's that lovely. Sure, it's a fact that however charismatic and watchable Jonathan Rhys Meyers may be, he would not have been my first (or second, or...) choice to portray the robust, red-headed Henry Tudor, but setting aside the lack of resemblance between the historical figure and the actor portraying him, Rhys Meyers has given this role his all and fills the screen with so much energy he dominates a viewer's attention. The Tudors might offend historical purists as readily as it does the puritanical who cannot tolerate rampant sexuality even when intertwined with superior storytelling, but for the rest of us, we are lucky enough to have this truly outstanding series to see, with its second season soon to arrive. A forgiving five stars, because what The Tudors gets right, it gets very right!
0743486285|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  Although, I will admit I am a bit bias..being a fan of Mötley Crüe for 27 years!! :-)  This is a book like no other, it is very dark and absolutley insane!  The way the book is written is very cool.  It reads as a journal with inserts of current comments from the people who where there at that time.  It's truly astonishing to me that Nikki is still alive.  Obviously, he had to live and tell this story for a reason...perhaps to save at least one life.  Destiny!  Buy the book!  You won't be disappointed, especially if you like biography pieces.
B00004W4UB|3.0|Re-telling a classic tale from a new perspective, usually courtesy of a relatively minor character from the original work, is an old and in some cases dubious literary tradition. It has been undertaken with deliciously successful results in, say, The Return of Moriarty, by John Gardner, or has fallen shamefully flat: Donald McCaig's recent Rhett Butler's People comes to mind.<br /><br />The 1996 film Mary Reilly is the lukewarm but not charmless on-screen adaptation of the superior 1990 \\"alternate history\\" novel by the acclaimed Valerie Martin, who in penning her tale drew on Robert Louis Stevenson's magnum opus, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. In the film as in the novel, Mary Reilly, an Irish maidservant far from home and melancholy, lately given work in the household of one Dr Henry Jekyll, a London gentleman and medical researcher in the year 1885, forms a friendship of sorts with her dual-natured employer, and stands in as a background figure in the events described to greater effect in the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.<br /><br />Inexplicable mega-star Julia Roberts is passable here and courageously attempts an Irish accent with moderate success--hey, I can't do one well, either, Julia, and trust me, I've tried---while John Malkovich, not quite the Dr. Jekyll the original author described, is still enjoyably creepy in this role. Though the murders in this movie are largely implied and committed off-screen, there's a compensatory scene in which a tub full of fresh-caught eels meet their maker in the Jekyll kitchen and that should churn even the toughest stomachs.<br /><br />Fans of the Stevenson novel tend to either love this second take on the old tale or else recoil at the ballsy blasphemy of what Martin and film maker Christopher Hampton (Atonement) did. For those who loved the movie, I say please read the much-better novel. And for those fans of Stevenson's original who sneered at the movie, I'd note here that Valerie Martin's book is a much more a case of loving tribute to the nineteenth-century masterpiece than Hampton's motion picture.s book is a much more a case of loving tribute to the nineteenth-century masterpiece than Hampton's motion picture.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a huge fan of Joss Whedon's most famous television works, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\", I just had to check out his shortlived \\"Firefly\\" sci-fi series. Despite a dedicated fanbase, the show was canceled after 11 episodes due to poor treatment from the FOX Network, which aired episodes out of order and constantly changed the timeslot (they released the pilot episode after all the others).     With this DVD set, you will get all 11 television episodes, along with the 3 that never aired. The show has a much different feel to it than Whedon's other two shows, though his trademark humor and character development are still present. Combining a western feel to a Star Wars-like setting, Whedon creates a world unlike any seen before. The characters are all extremely likeable, and the actors to a terrific job portraying them, particularly Nathon Fillion as the lead of Captain Malcom Reynolds.    The show's greatest weakness is perhaps it's criminally short length, though this is of no fault of the show itself or it's creator. As a result, many plotlines in the show are left unresolved by the final episode. However, the feature film \\"Serenity\\" continues where the series left off, and wraps up everything the series didn't, so I highly recommend picking up the movie as well.
0767802470|5.0|There isn't much to add to what's been said about Das Boot, because the acclaim this motion picture has gathered over nearly thirty years speaks loudly enough. I will note that Das Boot is not only the greatest movie about naval warfare that's ever been made, it ranks as one of film's most intense portraits of human psychology. I don't care how anti-German a person might be in his or her feelings about the Second World War, I guarantee anyone possessing common humanity will quickly bond with this U-boat's crew and be pulling with all his or her might in hope of their survival in the brutal crucible of mechanized war. Just as it has validly been said Stanley Kubrick achieved the impossible in 2001: A Space Odyssey and compelled audiences to suspend disbelief long enough to forget they were not actually watching a mission taking place in deep space, so viewers quickly set aside the fact that Das Boot was shot inside a set, albeit one that recreated a German submarine down to the tiniest detail. Das Boot radiates authenticity and not only suspends all disbelief as to the reality of what one is seeing, it obliterates it. A fine motion picture by any scale, though not for one second for the faint of heart.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|After Joss Whedon's \\"Firefly\\" television series was unfairly canceled back in 2002, fans clamored for a continuation. Joss finally delivered with this theatrical film, \\"Serenity\\", which ties up as many of the lingering plot threads from the series in the amount of time provided. However, the film still stands well enough on it's own, and could have been the Star Wars of a new generation if it had succeded in the box office.     The plot picks up 6 months after the final episode ended, with the United space Alliance still in pursuit of River Tam (Summer Glau), a 17 year old girl whom they experimented on to turn her into a weapon. After being freed by her brother Simon (Sean Maher), the siblings ally themselves with a mercenary named Captain Malcom Renolds (Nathon Fillion) and his crew in their Firefly-class ship named \\"Serenity\\". The group tries to uncover just what the government did to River, and stumble across a conspiracy that could jeapordize not only their lives, but anyone who comes into contact with them.     While watching the film, I noticed that it definately seems smarter than most Summer block busters. I may be biased due to being a Whedon fanboy,but the themese presented in this film seem to be more morally ambigious, which is common in Whedon's work. Even the villain of the film, the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor)believes that what he is doing is for the greater good, and Malcom learns he has more in common with him than he'd like.    The cast members give likeable to great performances, particularly Fillion as Reynolds and Glau as River. All in all, it is as satisfying a conclusion that we will ever get to the Firefly universe. No Whedon fan should miss it.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|I have always been a fan of the 1960's space program and the movies that have represented that time in our history.  However this mini-series \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" takes it literally to a whole new level.  They way they have crafted out various elements in one hour time periods is beyond incredible.  One of my favorite episodes is #5, \\"The Spyder\\".  It is about the creating of the Lunar Module.  It literally takes the viewer through the entire '60's in how they created the Lunar Module.  I love how it shows that they had to create everything from scratch, including the budget.  Other episodes show very specifically the different elements of the space program including one about the wives.      By far one of the best movies/ mini-series ever about the space program from start to finish....beyond incredible.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Where do I begin? This was impressive all around.  Excellent special effects  Gripping story and drama  Intense action  Beautiful score  Excellent acting.  Chemistry between characters was perfect. Especially between Crowe and Phoenix.  This is one of the best movies of the past decade. This is a must and a treasure for any film collection.
0143038419|1.0|I agree with all the other reviews about this book being very disappointing. I couldn't wait to hear about her experience of self-discovery and independence, and I felt like it never came. Granted, I didn't make it half way through the book, but that should tell you something. The writing wasn't that eloquent and it was frankly, boring. It's tempting to read because of all the great reviews it got, but trust me, skip it, or at least get it from the library. Don't waste your money.
B00104QSOM|3.0|Firstly, comparisons to KANE are pale.  KANE was a muti-faceted, myriad-sided film about a multi-faceted, myriad-sided man.  Plainview is.....in \\"plain view.\\"  He is Greed incarnate, with no redeeming qualities, no \\"Rosebud\\" haunting his desire to drink up all of the world's milkshakes.  That being said, Daniel Day-Lewis is the REASON to see this film.  He is - throughout his career - NEVER the same person twice.  The film's cinematography, music, other actors are all strong:  it is the story that is weak.  One note.  The story of James Dean's Jett Rink in GIANT  - while not exactly the central story of that film - is very akin to the story of Daniel Plainview....except that the character of Jett Rink, like Kane, is as deep and as rich as an oil well.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD is about surfaces, and as such it is a wonderful film - but not a deep one.  And one point that greatly annoyed me:  if Plainview's \\"son\\" could speak - why didn't he more often do so??? And how is it that Plainview is NEVER with a wife or any woman?  It seems he would have taken a wife at some point if only to use her to attain his ends by presenting to those he ripped off a picture of himself as a more-balanced family man.  Maybe he figured, though, that just having the kid would make him seem less a wolf in sheep's clothing. Who can say? Motives are murky in this movie.  Murky...but not Mysterious...and that is why the film comes off as one note.  A symphony with one theme.  Watch the film, though, if only for one of the most watchable and fantastic acting roles to grace the screen in some time.  It is also a great primer if you want to learn how to drill for oil!
6300268985|3.0|I finally got to see this movie after seeing stills many years ago. WHAT A TRIP!!! I am not a Franz Liszt historian but it is quite clear, early on, this movie is full of  . . . well, fancy. The viewer is shown exhibits of bare [...], a guillotined giant male organ, phallic columns, smoking rear ends and other amazingly bizarre visual nuggets. There is more eye-candy than one person probably should take in but it is quite fascinating as an artist's canvas.     The story is strange, and to say the very least, weak. Roger Daltrey pulls his stiff Tommy acting skills into his role of Liszt. He does manage  an unexplainable presence that keeps one entertained. You don't watch this for the story, or the acting, but rather the pure extravagance of the visual presentation. The ending is just beyond belief!!! It's unintentional, but I was roaring with laughter at the finale of the movie. Even after seeing how far Ken Russell had gone throughout the picture, the ending left me giggling at the audacity of where he piloted his production. WARNING!!! If you're of the imbibing persuasion, see this thing straight or you'll surely think you're on a bad, if not demented trip.    Just for the visuals I have to give this movie 3 stars. It's pretty much a one-viewing experience unless you're interested in seeing the fantastic, although strange, art direction again. I doubt if it's possible, but I would rent it first to see if it's you're cup of tea. I have a feeling it won't be many folks thing but if your an artist, writer or lover of fantasy, this is the one for you!!!
B00005JOHC|5.0|Two and a Half Men is one of the funniest shows on television and is destined to become a classic.  We've watched the shows on TV, and the DVDs at least 2 times since they finally came out.<br /><br />Basic story line is that one Brother, Alan is getting divorced, moves in with brother Charlie and brings his son Jake for the weekends.  They become a sort of dysfunctional family and the show takes off from there.  The acting is great, the humor is definitely adult and risque but lots of fun.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Story of a boy who is raised by wolves in a jungle but after many adventures is finally reunited with other humans. Delightfully told with voices provided by Phil Harris, Louis Prima and others.
B000005RU2|5.0|Yes everyone this is the real Deep Purple! This is the true LIVE Purple Album. Once you hear this there is no turning back. Talent, quality, professionalism, power, etc...its all here. This is the album that shows the abilty of Ritchie Blackmore/Jon Lord/Ian Paice/Ian Gillian /Roger Glover. I first got his album when it originally came out, now I needed to get it again for my music library. It is a MUST!
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Honestly, I had lost faith that Erykah could make anything different than her first classic. I WAS WRONG. She continued to grow her art on this one.

B000TFINY6|5.0|After watching the first two seasons of Lost last year on DVD, I was hooked and could not wait to pick up the third when it came out. Since the Blu-Ray was on sale for just $39.99 in a Gold Box special here on Amazon, I had to get it. I watched it over 3 straight days, and it was absolutely fantastic.     The picture was stunning and really shows off the Blu-Ray format quite well.  The colors of the forest just really popped out, and the facial details in close-ups were amazing. The sound was also great, producing the eerie noises of the jungle along with the explosions of the more action-packed scenes.     Some thought this season started a little show, but I think that was mostly due to the fact that they watched it in its serial format, making it seem like a long time before any real \\"action\\" occurred. However, watching it on Blu-Ray is like watching an epic 17 hour film, and it is quite the ride.    One feature that I really appreciated, especially since I was watching the episodes one after the other in those 3 days was the \\"Season Play\\" feature, which allowed you to do two things: 1. You could turn off the player, and the next time you started \\"Season Play\\" again, it would begin from the same point and 2. when you had finished watching the episodes on one disc, it would prompt you to eject the disc and put in the next one, and it would then continue playing the episodes of the disc without the usual maker logos, FBI warnings, and the menu.    Overall, a great buy and I highly recommend it to everyone who is a Lost fan or has gone blu.
0452287022|5.0|I was fascinated with this book.  I also bought the DVD and enjoyed it as well but books add so much more detail and information.
0385341067|4.0|Lloyd Jones' novel, Mister Pip, is a wonderful, intriguing, tale that traces a village's discovery about literature, and the influence literature can have in one's life.  We first meet \\"Pop Eye,\\" who later becomes more affectionately known as Mr. Watts, as he pulls his wife Grace in a trolly.  Mr. Watts chooses to wear a red clown nose while pulling his wife along, and because of this odd behavior, and his status as the only white man in the village, he commands the attention of the young village children.  The narrator of the story is Matilda, a young village girl whose father left her family to work in Australia.  Matilda's mother, Dolores, becomes her sole companion after her father leaves, and Matilda tries to help her mother struggle through the pain of losing her husband.  Eventually, war begins on the island, and Matilda's village becomes isolated and separated from all outside interaction.  Soon, no one but the villagers, and Mr. Watts and Grace, remain.  Without any teachers, or any indication about when life will resume its normalcy, Mr. Watts begins to teach the young children.  With the only tools Mr. Watts has being an old, worn copy of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, a pencil, and a notepad, he sets out to provide some sort of formal schooling to the kids.  Mr. Watts reads from Great Expectations everyday, and soon, Matilda is enraptured with the story, and most importantly, Pip.  Pip's world in Victorian England becomes more real to Matilda than her war-torn, ravaged village.  Mr. Watts attempts to include the mothers in this learning community by inviting them to teach the children about village customs and folklore.  Matilda's interest in topics and events unimaginable to her mother creates tension and anxiety between Mr. Watts and Dolores.  Years later, the story of Pip remains an integral part of Matilda's being, and she remains captive in her past, until she finally becomes able to return to her home.      Lloyd Jones' masterfully created text is a beautiful story that commands and engages your attention from the opening line to the very last word.  This novel serves as a testimonial to the importance of a child's imagination, and how, through literature, readers can immerse themselves in another time and another land.  Mr. Watts teaches all the children that literature can transcend differences in cultures and languages.  This book also depicts the vital and integral role teachers play in children's lives.  Mr. Watts, and his dedication to instructing his village's children, altered the life of at least one of his students forever.      I would strongly recommend reading this novel, particularly because of the beauty of Lloyd Jones' language and his easy style.  Mister Pip reaffirms the belief that literature is valuable and that reading is an enriching, absorbing activity that works above cultural differences.  This novel will sweep you into its story, and it is a such a moving tale that you will not mind.
B000V6BE6M|4.0|I'm such a fan of the movies that I naturally had to get the music. These extended versions of the musical scores are heavenly.  Having several hours of music to fill my days and my senses is my kind of bliss.  Anyone who hears the music is magically transported back to the wonderful movies and can relive the wonder of three great experiences.  My only wish would be that someday many of the themes-in-song would be made into full-length songs instead of just the snippets we hear throughout the movies. Now THAT would be music to buy.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Certainly not a bad film, but certainly not a great one either. It's good to see domestic animation take a route that is obviously far from the kid/family oriented animation we generally see. Make no mistake about it, this is definitely no kids movie.<br /><br />Their actual take on the Beowulf legend is quite interesting. It certainly did go over the top at times, particularly in the earlier portion of the film. It can certainly lead to some eye rolling moments, but it doesn't effect the enjoyment of the film to negatively. At times it really feels as though they were trying a little too hard to toss in adult themes and those led to many of the eye rolling moments present in the film.<br /><br />The animation can be distracting at times, no doubt, but it is still quite well done. The most significant complaint I have isn't that it's creepy, like others, but rather that their animation of horses really didn't seem to be very good at all. The artistry was generally quite nice and the details were very impressive.<br /><br />The voice acting was well done and the soundtrack seemed fitting with the story and the theme of the series.<br /><br />The added scenes in this version are barely even noticeable, and the special features are interesting but nothing you haven't seen before. All in all I would say you're just as well off purchasing the regular edition unless you're one of those who simply must have all features available to you. In the end it is not a bad buy and is still a good movie, but it certainly could have been better.

B000RGGYI4|4.0|Argus was a Greek mythological character who had a hundred eyes, any one of which would have seen the problems in this namesake. I'm not a fan of art by committee, but the opinion of a collector or two might have corrected the compiler's vision.<br /><br />I'm very curious why Mark Powell, who did such a fine job compiling and producing other reissues (Camel, Nektar, Man), would allow such a frustrating compilation to grace the Wishbone Ash market. This 2CD set sounds wonderful, thanks to Paschal Byrne, who performed similar duties for the first two of the just-mentioned reissues. It was remastered from the original mix and the original master tapes. Powell's liner notes continue to be excellent. But, unlike in the other reissues, the proofreading is bad--a first sign of something out of focus, something missed.<br /><br />Proofreading? Who cares? Well, sometimes bad proofreading suggests other problems (cf. Budgie). In this case, random punctuation seems connected to questionable compiling judgments.<br /><br />The \\"Argus Deluxe Edition\\" comprises \\"Argus,\\" \\"Live in Memphis\\" (minus one track, 'Jailbait'), a stereo version of the previously released \\"BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert\\" (minus two tracks, 'Jailbait' and 'The Pilgrim'), the B-side of a single ('No Easy Road' from 9/72), and two mono tracks previously released on \\"Wishbone Ash Live at the BBC\\" ('Blowin' Free' from the BBC Radio 1 Bob Harris show 5/31/1972 and 'Throw Down the Sword' from the Pete Drummond show 5/10/1972).<br /><br />The expanded edition of \\"Argus\\" was nearly perfect. Remixed by an original and highly important band member (Martin Turner), remastered by a pro (Erick Labson)--all of which supervised by an expert in the reissue business (Andy McKaie) and someone well-versed in Wishbone Ash (Leon Tsilis)--its only flaw was its somewhat hagiographic liner notes by Tsilis.<br /><br />This deluxe edition, however, makes little sense. The B-side, 'No Easy Road,' for example, was recorded in between \\"Argus\\" and \\"Wishbone Four\\" and has a lot more in common with the latter. It actually appears on \\"Wishbone Four\\" but with a brass section; otherwise, the single and the album version are the same. Why include it on \\"Argus,\\" especially when a remastered version of \\"Wishbone Four\\" is sorely needed? (In my experience, \\"Wishbone Four\\" shares the title of Worst Major Label CD Issue with Bruce Springsteen's \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\")<br /><br />And that's perhaps the best news. An incomplete \\"Live in Memphis\\"? \\"BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert\\" is in stereo, to be sure, but what about the missing tracks?<br /><br />Powell could have made the \\"Live in Memphis\\" addition complete by adding 'Jailbait' to Disc One and either eliminating the unnecessary 'No Easy Road' or putting it on the second disc. Disc One would then have repeated the track listing of McKaie and Tsilis's edition, but so what--why mess with perfection?<br /><br />Powell could have included the two missing tracks ('Jailbait,' 'The Pilgrim') from the original \\"BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert\\" CD on the second disc, ignored the other two BBC tracks, and added 'No Easy Road' at the end of the second disc to indicate the new direction Ash was taking.<br /><br />Or, for the second disc, Powell could have avoided previously issued material altogether and focused solely on something unissued, such as a live concert.<br /><br />Instead he decided to cut songs that were originally on \\"Pilgrimage\\" ('Jailbait,' 'The Pilgrim') because, I think, of CD time constraints and because he might be using them on a possibly forthcoming deluxe edition of \\"Pilgrimage.\\" Yet, if so, the second rationale seems strange to me because it ignores context and concert-set-list thinking. I'd rather have a live performance presented \\"as is\\" instead of cut and parceled out according to the original studio album sources. I'd rather recognize history and the musicians' decision making than a shoehorned, Procrustean fit.<br /><br />Collectors will haveto ask themselves if an original mix remastering, the B-side 'No Easy Road,' and a stereo version of a truncated \\"BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert\\" are worth the price of this new edition. Non-collectors would do best, I think, to stick to the previously released CDs.<br /><br />I just hope that problematic sales of \\"Argus Deluxe Edition\\" aren't in a position to compromise the remastering and reissuing of other Wishbone Ash albums, such as \\"There's the Rub\\" and \\"Pilgrimage\\" as well as \\"Wishbone Four\\"--not to mention \\"Live Dates Volume Two.\\"eo version of a truncated \\"BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert\\" are worth the price of this new edition.

B00005JLPK|5.0|I recently watched this for the second time after initially watching it some years ago and was even more impressed the second time around. While the reasons might not interest anyone but me, the fact is, this movie touched me and moved me deeply. For starters, it is a gorgeous film to watch. The seamless integration of live actors into Kahlo's stunning and evocative work is a magical joy to behold and adds even more depth to the artist's brutally candid art. Secondly, Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina deliver top notch performances and most impressive may have been Hayek who is on screen nearly the entire time. I can forgive the vanity hiring of Ashley Judd and Edward Norton as their portrayals are less than the aforementioned two, but this is a minor issue. Lastly, regarding the dvd features and what-not, the second disc is mostly behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the movie whereas the special features on the first disc have lengthy interviews that are illuminating and candid while demonstrating the love Hayek and Taymor have for Kahlo.<br />I am not a Frida Kahlo scholar by any means nor do I wish to convey any knowledge of her art, life, politics, or anything else. I know that I find her paintings to be vivid and mesmerizing and that's enough for me. I am grateful to this movie for giving me an introduction to an artist whose work I have grown fascinated with and I am furthermore glad that I have a little knowledge, albeit Hollywoodized, of this remarkable human being. My interest has been piqued by this sumptuous love letter to Frida and I will continue to enjoy this movie and my exploration of her work and her life. I hope you find a similar experience.
0780622553|5.0|I am not here to describe this movie.  (It is in many reviews). I just wish to say that it is a great movie that I was surprised it was any good.  Many people are looking for things in this movie that it was not really trying to be.  You do have to have a brain, so if you are stupid then it is not for you.  It has a good (somewhat dark) score,  the highlight of which is a lovely version of \\"Sway\\" (sung in the movie by Jennifer Connley's character). Just enjoy it.
B000TFINY6|5.0|I hate LOST... but my wife and I bought this on a deal-of-the-day from Amazon for something to watch during the writer's strike... and WOW. It snagged me almost immediately.

0740748475|5.0|The books are beautiful.  Actually, if I were to change anything, I might make them less magnificent so they weren't so heavy!  But the large format and high quality paper and printing enhanced my sense of emersion in the strip -- and it was a joy to be reemersed in this long-missed world.  Also, I enjoyed hearing Watterson's comments about his time doing the strip, from the pre-Calvin and Hobbs days through to his decision to end on a high note.  If you're a C & H fan, you'll love these books.
B000053VAZ|4.0|This is a very sad but sweet ending movie with great characters. No one can deny impression Johnny Depp has left in this movie. He has proven time and time again that he is if not the greatest, one of the greatest actors of all time. This is a very hard to swallow movie at times but that means the makers did their job and made the end even better by doing so.
B000005RT8|4.0|I've been holding myself back from buying this particular McCartney album due to bad reviews. But since I wanted to complete my collection (this is the only missing then), I ordered it from Amazon and got it a few days later with the least expectation of a good listening (nothing worse than the 'Press To Play' torture). BUT, the first 2 tracks alone is worth this CD. 'Coming Up' is alright, but the highlight must be the infectious 'Temporary Secretary'. It's so experimental, yet catchy in an 'irritating' way....but it is one of mccartney's hidden gem. The rest of the tracks is worth further listening as well. It may sound silly at times, but it's quite an enjoyable album.

Its simply a rehash of Cosmic Conscious nonsense that you are me and I am you and there is no male and no female nor whatever other polarities you can come up with, there just \\"is\\" and your \\"it\\". It lacks real psychospiritual integration that holistically raises one up as a new creation in Jesus Christ, the incarnate true God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the Word made flesh, the only I Am WHO AM in whom we live and move and have our being. Yes, breathe and enjoy living in the spiration of Holy Spirit and being led daily into ongoing transformation through the Word Incarnate in genuine Christianity....read your bible, because this book is far fom what the bible teaches. The language of this garbage sounds authentic and impressive but is absolute falsehood. Oh its real alright but so is Lucifer. The left hand looks like the right but is absolutely opposite. Stick to Jesus and you can't go wrong. This junk spirituality won't take you to the magnificant vision of oneness with God The Father or The Son or The Holy Spirit. Oh you'll get a spiritual realization alright...that your 'god' but we know where that lie comes from as Genesis 3:4 & 5 demonstrates.  Thanks.
B00006JMQG|3.0|I'd like to add my two cent's worth here.  Not going in to the film itself, I just want to discuss the 2 main versions out there, the Image \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" disc from about 10 years ago and the new Kino \\"Restored Authorized Edition\\".  I watched both side to side (2 TVs & 2 DVD players)<br /><br />Despite some raves about the Kino version (which I can't really understand), the Image version wins hands down.  Kino, which normally puts out a superior product whatever movie they are releasing, I believe really dropped the ball with this one.  For one, they went totally overboard with tinting...most scenes now appear to be a deep, dark blue, and the black areas have a weird, mottled, speckley, \\"wavy\\" look, like TV reception that isn't quite coming in.  Granted, this is mostly only really bad during the first reel, in the opening garden scene, improving slightly as the film goes on, but it's still annoying.<br /><br />The Image disc, by comparision, is brightly lit, scenes being either a \\"regular\\" grey like you see on the usual b/w silent film, or an amberish tint that still shows up fine.  The entire Kino version just seems too dark & murky.  The intertitles of both are in that funky, abstract font, but each has slightly different wording for the same scenes (and I don't know which is actually more accurate to the original, but both convey basically the same information).  For example, one may say \\"Listen while I tell you a story\\" while the other says \\"I will now tell you a story\\" (I made both those up, but it was to get the idea across!).  However, the intertitles on the Kino version are, again, much darker than the Image disc.  Also, the Image print in general just seems much sharper & clearer than the Kino, and the musical score is much better & more fitting.  Kino gives you a choice of 2 musical scorings & both are atrocious and do not seem to fit the \\"mood\\" of the story.<br /><br />On the other hand, Kino does have more extras, particularly a much longer segment of GENUINE: THE TALE OF A VAMPIRE (43 minutes) while Image gives you about a 3-minute snippet.  Also, and most important, that annoying horizontal line that cuts across the top of certain scenes on nearly every version out there (including the one shown on TCM) has been removed on the Kino disc.  Long considered to be a flaw in the original film, it's most likely a goof in the converting process somewhere, and this shows that we DO have the technology to remove it, which we did not have back when the Image disc was made.  Quite frankly, this was the ONLY main advantage I could find in the Kino print, and it does not make up for a blue, murky, dark movie.  I'd much rather have a clean, crisp, clear, brightly lit film & deal with the line (it's not in every scene in the movie, just certain ones anyway).<br /><br />I guess the best of both worlds would be if Image put out a new version, using it's same print but removing the line as Kino did.  THAT would really be the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" in my opinion.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This Disc is just amazing. I love it. An incredible musical journey full of textures and excellent harmonizing. Tracks like the 'Deadwing' and 'Mellotron Scratch', with its Pink Floyd-ish melody lines, just get under your skin and don't relent. Beautiful. The bonus track 'Shes Moved On' is a song thats harmonies can bring you to tears, yet is refreshingly soothing.<br /><br />There are heavier tracks like 'Shallow' which could easily had been on radio if anyone had balls anymore.'Open Car' is great with its heavy guitar and offbeats. Yet the keyboards on these songs make them work even more. And i am not a huge Keys fan with my Rock/Metal.<br />The epic track 'Arriving Somewhere..' and 'Glass Arm Shattering' are just excellent Prog tracks that don't bore you and seem to take you away. I love the way this band can make a 12 minute piece actually sound normal. And they really rock out hard in parts.<br />The other tracks are awesome. There is not 1 bad track on this disc.<br />I just don't feel the need to emphasize what so many said before me.<br /><br />I am relatively new to this band, but this is amazing stuff. For the old metal head like myself, who is mellowing a bit, to the Rush, Yes - prog- rock fan looking for something new. Or the Pink Floyd fan who misses their better stuff yet likes some heaviness thrown in, i just cant emphasize enough as to the quality of this disc and this band.<br /><br />Its a sad state of music when so few know about such talent, but they have a huge cult following, so at least they make a decent living... This is a MUST HAVE CD!
B00104W8T6|5.0|To me this was one the best soundtracks that i've heard in awhile. All the music fits,and its just a joy to listen to over and over again.
0553260111|5.0|So I have just finished this book, and it was incredible. I waited until I had seen all three movies, so now I am reading the trilogy. And having now read the first book, I have to say that the movie was a lot different. Usually that would leave me disgruntled, but the movie was awesome as well. Now I am going to start the Supremacy!
B000E1MTZE|5.0|I have to agree with the general consensus, High Definition was made for movies like The Matrix Trilogy. Or is that the other way around? Either way, The Matrix Trilogy looks absolutely stunning in 1080p/1080i High Definition.     I remember when the first Matrix came out on DVD, we all thought the picture quality and audio quality were the best thing we had ever seen. And it was, at the time. Now, the Matrix returns, this time in HD, and it once again takes the cake as the best picture and audio quality ever seen.    I cannot help but laugh when people tell me that \\"there is no difference between standard definition and high definition\\"; all I want to do is show them The Matrix Trilogy HD side by side with its standard counterpart and watch their mouth hit the floor. Seriously, watching this trilogy in HD breathes new life into it, and movies in general. There is a HUGE difference between 480p/480i (standard definition) and 1080p/1080i (High Definition).     You can see every imperfection on every actor, their pimples, their pores, their scars. And its all beautiful. Details, details, details. You can clearly see the detail on virtually every object in the foreground of each shot, each scene. Colors are vibrant and clear; the whole picture has ten times the clarity of its standard definition counterpart. The picture is so clear that you can make out every piece of fabric that comprises the actors clothing; to me THAT is amazing.    For a particularly amazing scene, check out the Lobby shootout segment in the first Matrix film. Then compare it to the regular DVD version. You WILL see a huge difference.     All three films are pristine and clean from any artifacting, dirt and any other blemishes. There is a slight film grain pervading each film, but nothing that wasn't originally present in the source material, and it is never intrusive or distracting.     The audio is so crisp and booming, bringing the film to life. If you have a surround sound setup it is even better. From the high intensity explosions to the pulse pounding music is so clear and pristine that it clearly beats that of any movie theater quality. The audio is presented in Dolby 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 TrueHD. Both are spectacular.     These kinds of details may not be a huge deal to the average joe, but to someone who really enjoys movies it makes all the difference in the world. Before I witnessed HD with my own eyes I too thought that it didn't really matter how blurry and bland the movie looked. But now, after I have tasted the divine, I cannot go back. Standard def movies look plain and muddy. Yeah, I'm spoiled now, but I don't care. High Definition is the way to go.     So, we all know the story of the Matrix Trilogy, and most of us can agree that the first Matrix is undoubtedly the best, while the 2nd and 3rd iterations are slightly inferior products in the storyline department. Yet, all three are equally amazing in my mind, and this HD trilogy easily   ranks as one of my all time favorite films ever.     There are extras, mostly ports from the DVD version of the Matrix films, but there is also something called \\"In Movie Experience\\" that brings you even deeper into the world of the Matrix and the mind of the infamous Wachowski Brothers.    HD-DVD adopters truly lucked out with this fine trilogy, something Blu-Ray owners are literally begging for.  Its sad that HD-DVD is dead now, what with Toshiba giving up in the format war. Blu-Ray fans need not fret though, The Matrix Trilogy will soon become Blu; its only a matter of time. For all of the HD-DVD die-hards and early adopters, I implore you, pick up The Complete Matrix Trilogy on HD-DVD. You will be very happy and pleased with this purchase. The picture is amazingly stunning, the audio is better than the movie theater, and the total experience will blow you away.     HD-DVD owners, do yourself a favor and grab this item while you can. This is definitely demo material.

0743297334|5.0|For one who is living so remotely from WWI, the war that didn't end all wars, it is difficult to understand its effects on those that lived it. And, when one comes into a story that assumes you have lived it, it is difficult to fully appreciate the story. The Sun Also Rises is that kind of story.    The dissolutes who wander Paris and Pamplona hardly muster sympathy from the likes of us, who know only a war fought surgically at high altitude, on television. In our times, so far anyway, the hapless grunts in harm's way are volunteers, who volunteered without conscription as the alternative. To those of WWI, it was a Hobson's choice.    This story is set in the early to mid 1920's. With the glories of battle of a Beowolf now permanently erased from the imaginations of these characters, and the mindless slaughter of civlized warfare firmly implanted in its place; our heroes roam foreign lands in search of a reason to live. That debauchery is the reason should be no surprise. It was age and experience appropriate.    Yet there's implied redemption. The fiesta ends in reflection, Jake doesn't return immediately to Paris, and Brett (Lady Brett) sacrifices what she, in the beginning of the story, was unlikely to sacrifice.     Many of the veterans of WWII, especially of the Pacific portion, buried, for a long time, their experiences of slaughter. Hemingway was taking a different approach, revealing its toll on a generation. Which is the greater generation remains an open problem.
0679720200|5.0|This is not light reading. Despite its length of 123 pages, The Stranger is a literary endurance test: exhausting, exhaustive, excruciating ... and excellent.<br /><br />Meursault is nobody special. A pied-noir residing in pre-World War II Algeria, he guns down an Arab in cold blood on a blistering summer day. The protagonist is thrust into the limelight, and a man who once took life at face value finds himself examining a vacuous life.<br /><br />Such is the plot, but this author's main interests lies elsewhere. Is life not absurd, Camus challenges us through his anti-hero Mersault, when human life is so terminal and soon-forgotten? If yes, why not thrash it and mock it? This question of the absurd has drawn many comparisons with Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, but Camus shook off the existentalist moniker, and this is a tribute to the Frenchman's intellectual honesty. For the idea of the absurd in this novella contrasts sharply with those of classic existentalists, and Camus's artistic technique differs as well.<br /><br />My reading of The Stranger hinged on whether, like existentialists, Camus intended to create humor or artistic distance, and in the end, finding no such evidence in the text, I decided he did not. This is bone-hard reality: a prima facie argument delivered with raw power and skilled craftsmanship, but without, I think, sufficient perspective. Unlike Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, Camus is not poking fun at a 20th-century Chernyshevsky or Hegel here. Camus is right in there with Mersault--dead serious--in this tract of complex ideas and stark layering. The protagonist's declarative statements carry a raw, political force, and indeed he's quite terrifying, and the novel will leave many readers baffled and disturbed.<br /><br />In a word, this book is surreal, and when read from a surrealist's perspective, the book falls neatly into place for me. A central, philosophical question is this: is Mersault stark-raving mad, or is the world? And if it's the latter, is this murderer in fact sane? What does this say about morality and ethics? Camus doesn't want us laugh at his protagonist as we do Dostoevsky's underground man; we might agree with him instead. As surrealist Andre Breton would say, Mursealth is above \\"conscious moral or aesthetic self-censorship,\\" where the convicted becomes society's accuser. The crowd is lost in self-serving hypcrisy and delusion, and only Mersault has the wit and integrity to tell them. In this way, Camus argues for his protagnonist's sanity and ethical grounding as he delivers a dark, foreboding message from the cell of an Algerian prison.<br /><br />The author's sillogism goes something like this: life's unhappy and then we die. Life shouldn't be unhappy, even though we're going to die. Therefore, if we want to be happy, we must embrace death. Like all arguments, this one makes assumptions: people aren't happy, people can't find happiness in the absence of embracing death (such as through spiritual faith). Mersault shouts out his disgust with a rotten world and finds solace in it; he does this in a kind of self-declaration, where he's entitled to speak for himself if he so pleases. In true, post-modern style, Camus suggests we listen to his maverick. Surrealists typically embrace the idiosyncratic and individual while rejecting all forms of group-think--even to the point of refusing to define insane. So no irony is intended when Salvador Dali declares, \\"There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.\\" This is Mersault.<br /><br />Surrealism was popular in Camus's France during the 20th century, but as a reader I nevertheless need to ask whether Mursealt is mad. Mersault is a man of acute awareness struggling in an insane world. This man can murder without contrition, and when the crowd screams out ugly bile in response, they speak with a twisted--but elegant--harmony on the matter of life's cruel nature. In this there's universal solice, and Mersault's individual, relative reality is conjoined with the universal's. Having come full circle, we're left in a moral conundrum where murder is sane. Now Camus has trapped us.<br /><br />Or has he? It's difficult to laugh at Mersault since he's so disturbing. So I approached this question of Mersault's sanity by evaluating the argument, a dangerous foray inside a man's matrix. But this is precisely where Camus failed, in my view--a wry commentary on a book that was so beautifully constructed atop the human intellect. Kierkegaard avoided the trap of self-declaration when he acknowledged a universal idea of the ethical before allowing a need for a telelogical (i.e., with a purpose) suspension of that ethical, and only as a true act of faith. Mersault has no faith, and his suspension of the ethical is purposeless. That is, he has not placed his transgression on the shoulders of a higher authority. Faith is a paradox, Kierkegaard says, and a moral individual will transcend the ethical only on faith that a higher authority will intervene in this life. Mersault absolves himself of such consequences, and as such, morally disconnects himself from the world of mankind. If this is not a form of madness, then what is? I think the argument collapses here: what's missing in The Stranger is layering. Dostoevksy, too, on the other hand, layers his argument vis-&agrave;-vis artistic distancing by presenting his anti-hero in the form of parody. Knowing this, can't we begin to smile at Mersault's self-certain simplicity, despite the internal logic of his argument? The elements of paradox and mockery are not present in The Stranger, but should be.<br /><br />It's a shame. The 20th century was the most violent and ideologically deranged century in human history. This is a great novel and an excellent read, but like so much literature of that era, The Stranger said more about the world in which it was written than perhaps was intended.<br /><br />My Titles<br />[[ASIN:1419645498 Shadow Fields]]<br />[[ASIN:1419649256 Snooker Glen]]tive reality is conjoined with the universal's.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|As far as adaptations go this one is good, as a stand alone movie is outstanding. I'm a big time fan of Jane Austen's but I'm not a purist and not only am I very willing to be pleased but I'm also very aware of how difficult it must be for a screen writer not to inject his own ideas whether good or bad into a screen play.<br /><br />I instantly developed a crush for Rupert Penry Jones' Captain Wentworth and a great deal of sympathy for Sally Hawkins' Anne Elliot.<br /><br />The 1995 adaptation was pretty great except I never bought Ciaran Hinds or Amanda roots as the leads despite them being excellent actors because they were simply too old. So in a perfect world I would be able to take the leads from this adaptation and switch them with the leads from the 1995 adaptation.<br /><br />The film would've been perfect if they screen writer had not taken creative liberties at all but alas that could not be. Still I highly recommend it as long as you are prepared to overlook a few very silly changes to the story and a few miss casted actors.
0143038419|5.0|I drank this book up! I counldn't put it down! Elizabeth Glibert wrote 'Eat,Pray,Love' in a way that speaks directly to her reader and she made the journey humorous and so enjoyable. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever struggled with life, love and/or finding peace within themselves. 'Eat,Pray,Love' is a real treasure.
0064407667|4.0|In general, I am not a person who prefers dark humor, but I make an exception for The Unfortunate Events series because it is adept at being dark as well as funny and intelligent.<br /><br />The story stars three siblings with unique capabilities who are quickly orphaned. Violet Baudelaire, the eldest, is an inventor. Klaus Baudelaire is a bookworm. Sunny Baudelaire, the youngest (just a baby), likes biting things. The Baudelaire orphans soon embark on a series of adventures that are typified by trying to escape their devious uncle, Count Olaf, a loaf of an actor bent on killing the orphans and stealing the fortune they inherited.<br /><br />The story falls in into a predictable clockwork of events where Olaf uses his one talent, acting, to disguise himself as various people seemingly interested in helping the children but really focused on stealing their inheritance. Every puzzle the children encounter to get away from Olaf they have to solve using either their individual or combined talents.<br /><br />It may sound like I am deriding the book, but actually I find this simple construct appealing as it makes the books quick and enjoyable reads. The diction and tone of the book too lends a strong ethos to the story that adds to its enchantment. This tone, in fact, was a big influence on me when writing my book, The Incredible Origins of the Onyx Sun, also available on Amazon.<br /><br />Overall, I think the Snicket books are fun, fast reads that instantly present themselves as unique.

038073186X|3.0|Why US marshals Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule have to be called to Shutter Island to track down multiple-murderess Rachel Solando who has escaped from a well-guarded hospital for the criminally insane located on the island should have been puzzling. After all Shutter Island was eleven miles out to sea off the coast of Mass. with its own security forces. But then again, is this really Daniels' mission. It seems as though he may be there at the behest of a senator to investigate alleged patient abuse or on a personal mission to avenge the death of his wife in a fire.<br /><br />Actually this is a story of constant misdirection and the blurring of reality and delusion. Unfortunately, the author does not quite pull it off. Even though at end the author attempts to tidy up the ongoing \\"who is really who\\" and all the encrypted clues, the reader is left with a sense of incompleteness or having been played with.  One is hard pressed to say what has occurred spontaneously, been orchestrated, or merely imagined. The book is not boring - it moves well - but it is a lot to wade through without a better delineation of fact and fantasy.
B00006I53S|4.0|I've purchased this lens with the EOS 40D kit and it is just a great walk around lens.  It is great for general purpose shooting if you just want to pack 'light'.  Don't be surprise if the pictures turn out a bit blurry sometimes even with the IS when shooting actions in low lights (indoor basketball game, hockey etc..)  Some people may think that just because it has an IS all pictures will come out sharp and clear.        Bottom line is, this lens is a great lens at an offordable price.  It gives you a nice focal range and produces beutiful images.

0307388840|3.0|Although I was tempted to just see the movie, I picked up the book Atonement instead, reminding myself that the book is nearly always better than the movie.  Now I'm curious, wondering whether the movie has corrected the book's faults.  It started off so well: a good concept, a main character with good potential, and an engaging, beautifully written first section.  But by the second section, I had to force myself to keep reading, wondering why people thought the book was good enough to be made into a movie. When I got to the war section, I started speed reading. I still don't know what the war section had to do with Robbie's character development or the plot development. After that, I just jumped ahead to the predictable ending (something I never do...but even the speed reading was putting me to sleep...). I wish McEwan had developed Lola's and Paul's characters more--what reaction are we supposed to have at their wedding?  Why does Briony first become a nurse instead of a writer? We are led toward visions of her attending an MFA program or at least getting an internship at a magazine. Although the ending is poetically correct, it's not very satisfying.  I'll think I'll wait until the movie comes out on DVD (at the library) to find out if it is a more satisfying story than the book was.  This book was quite a surprising disappointment.

I've found that many authors speaking on inner peace and law of attraction repeat themselves alot.  I know of many that write numerous books and sell them under different titles. All the material is a spin on the same idea of the first book.  It's an author/publisher's way of cashing in.  It seems exploitive making a mockery of struggling mainstream humanity.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|Murder. Cannibalism. Death. Obsession. Revenge. Blood. Goth makeup. And lots of razors -- \\"at last, my arm is complete again!\\" Sweeney Todd exults.<br /><br />Somehow it doesn't come as a shock to me that Tim Burton adapted Stephen Sondheim's musical \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- or that he somehow spun it into something so delicious. That dark, grotesque, hilariously melodramatic story is perfectly suited to Burton's style, and Johnny Depp is absolutely stunning as the titular bloody barber.<br /><br />The malignant Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) lusts after the wife of Benjamin Barker (Depp), so he convicts Barker of a crime he didn't commit, and enfolds his family into his evil hands.<br /><br />But fifteen years later, the Barker returns to London and sets up a barber shop over Mrs. Lovett's ghastly meat pie store. Of course, he's enraged when he learns that his wife was raped and since poisoned herself, and that his daughter is the ward of the lecherous Judge. Enraged and maddened, Barker renames himself \\"Sweeney Todd\\" and vows revenge.<br /><br />And he finds that he LOVES using his razors for a far bloodier task than shaving. With the help of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) -- who finds a thrifty use for those bodies -- Todd cuts a bloody swathe through all who have wronged him. And when his daughter is punished for refusing to marry the cruel Judge, Sweeney closes in to get his revenge at last.<br /><br />There's always been a gothic look to Burton's movies, and he's always dabbled in very twisted, macabre storylines. And he really tops himself with \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- London is painted in black, white and grey, right down to the ghoulish faces of the characters, and their bleak little dens of horror. And songs -- lots of magnificently horrible songs.<br /><br />But Burton pretty obviously adores the combination of gory grotesquerie and very, very sick humour (\\"They don't commit sins of the flesh, so it's pretty fresh\\"). And he doesn't try to make Sweeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully. While we sympathize with Sweeney's losses, and the horrors that have changed him into the Demon Barber, you just can't pass over scenes where they sing, \\"It's man devouring man, my dear!\\" \\"Then who are we to deny it in here?\\"<br /><br />There are some moments that relieve this gory gothic parade -- there's a sweet love story between Sweeney's daughter and a young sailor. And the plot becomes progressively darker toward the end (yes, it CAN get worse), when the plot throws us some shocking new twists, resulting in a Grecian-tragedy finale soaked in even more gore.<br /><br />Oh yes, there's blood. Tons of it. It spurts like Monty Python's bloodier sketches, which ends up being more hilarious than yucky -- as is the casual introduction of cannibal meat pies. And there are some spectacularly gross moments, like a finger found in one of the pies.<br /><br />Burton uses some of his favorite actors in this one, particularly Depp and Bonham-Carter. Depp is THE perfect ideal Sweeney Todd -- his creepy eyes, pallid face and still, almost seductive manner are perfect for the maddened murderous barber. He goes through the movie slashing his razors at the world, and injects a real creepiness into scenes like Sweeney cooing at his \\"friends.\\"<br /><br />While she's only a passable singer, Bonham-Carter is eerily wholehearted as Todd's equally amoral partner-in-crime, who is quite happy to assist him.... and make tastier pies in the process. Rickman is wonderfully loathsome as the Judge, and Sacha Baron Cohen has a small but priceless role as Pirello, a huckster acquaintance of Todd's who starts causing trouble.

Astoundingly great.eeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully. While we sympathize with Sweeney's losses, and the horrors that have changed him into the Demon Barber, you just can't pass over scenes where they sing, \\"It's man devouring man, my dear!\\" \\"Then who are we to deny it in here?\\"    There are some moments that relieve this gory gothic parade -- there's a sweet love story between Sweeney's daughter and a young sailor. And the plot becomes progressively darker toward the end (yes, it CAN get worse), when the plot throws us some shocking new twists, resulting in a Grecian-tragedy finale soaked in even more gore.    Oh yes, there's blood. Tons of it. It spurts like Monty Python's bloodier sketches, which ends up being more hilarious than yucky -- as is the casual introduction of cannibal meat pies. And there are some spectacularly gross moments, like a finger found in one of the pies.    Burton uses some of his favorite actors in this one, particularly Depp and Bonham-Carter. Depp is THE perfect ideal Sweeney Todd -- his creepy eyes, pallid face and still, almost seductive manner are perfect for the maddened murderous barber. He goes through the movie slashing his razors at the world, and injects a real creepiness into scenes like Sweeney cooing at his \\"friends.\\"    While she's only a passable singer, Bonham-Carter is eerily wholehearted as Todd's equally amoral partner-in-crime, who is quite happy to assist him.... and make tastier pies in the process. Rickman is wonderfully loathsome as the Judge, and Sacha Baron Cohen has a small but priceless role as Pirello, a huckster acquaintance of Todd's who starts causing trouble. He really steals his scenes.    Most directors would have prettified, sanitized and defanged the grotesque \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\" but Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revel in the gore and madness. Astoundingly great.

This is a perfect book for anyone who wants to be more productive, for an admitted procrastinator, for someone who feels swamped, or for anyone who just wants to tighten up time managment skills.     It was a quick, easy read and entertaining, too. I wish I had this information 20 years ago!

B00000GAIW|4.0|I'm about to piss off a lot of Tull fans, which is ironic really seeing as I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Tuller and have been for twenty-nine years. Here's my opinion: I don't think Aqualung is anywhere near the best Tull album. In fact, Aqualung would rank pretty near the bottom if I were to make a list of Tull albums from favorite to least-favorite. The only ones to rank below it would be Too Old to Rock and Roll Too Young to Die, Under Wraps, Catfish Rising, and Dot com.  Nor do I think Aqualung is representative of the band's music as a whole. In fact, I regard it as being somewhat atypical in regard to their total output. Furthermore - and this complaint has a lot to do with my previous statement - I think the sound quality, at least on the album's original release, was pretty lousy. As far as I'm concerned, the albums on both sides of Aqualung suffer from a similar problem: Benefit is only slightly better than Aqualung, although it's dismal on certain tracks (Play in Time, Teacher), and Thick as a Brick is only a marginal improvement on the previous disks. I don't know how or why it happened, but A Passion Play, though scarcely a year later than TAAB, marked a return to the excellent sound engineering found on Stand Up, which had practically gone missing for three years. Before I continue, I know these are unusual statements to make, but I've been saying them for a long time and I stand by them. Also, Ian Anderson himself has said that he was not happy with how Aqualung sounded, and he has also intimated (particularly on the interview contained on the CD reviewed here) that he doesn't regard Aqualung as his strongest work and often seems as mystified as I am over the fact that Aqualung became so much more famous than any other Tull album, at least in certain parts of the world.<br /><br />I love Ian Anderson and his band as much as anyone. In fact, I can say without reservation that Tull is my favorite band. My admiration for Anderson is very profound. But that being said, there seems to be a struggle going on inside the man, a struggle between creative genius and genuine humility, between fierce individualism and a \\"collective soul\\", to steal a phrase. Despite the obvious talent and the will to succeed, there was a man who was slightly unsure of himself. This insecurity manifested itself quite frequently in Jethro Tull's music, and I think Aqualung might be a good example of it. In the late sixties and early seventies there was a harder edge coming to pop music, a more menacing and troubling approach: the infancy of heavy metal. I have little doubt that Anderson was aware that groups like Zeppelin and Sabbath were at the forefront of this metamorphosis from the placid naivete of flower-power to the industrial angst of metal, and I can't kick the feeling that Aqualung was Tull's first, and perhaps only, real foray into the darker side of rock music. If there was ever a riff that could be considered a classic template for heavy metal, it was the opening riff of Aqualung's title track.  There was nothing remotely similar to it on Benefit from one year before, and the heavy tracks on Stand Up were indeed heavy but still firmly rooted in blues. There was nothing bluesy about the song Aqualung, nor in much of anything on the rest of the Aqualung LP; but there is plenty of music that is dark and heavy: Aqualung, My God, with its sinister riff, Cross-Eyed Mary, Hymn 43, Locomotive Breath, and the better part of Wind Up. Note that in these songs there is a lot of single-note riffing as opposed to chordal, which was something Zeppelin and Sabbath did a great deal (Dazed and Confused, Heartbreaker, Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Black Sabbath [song], Wicked World, Behind the Wall of Sleep, Electric Funeral, Faeries Wear Boots). Needless to say I wasn't the least bit surprised to read an interview where, when asked what would have happened if Tony Iommi had stayed with Jethro Tull (the Sabbath guitarist had \\"joined\\" Tull very briefly, couldn't stand it, and quit), Ian answered: \\"Then every Tull album would have sounded like Aqualung.\\" This statement is of particular interest since Iommi, of course, never played on Aqualung and had nothing whatsoever to do with that album, or any Tull album.<br /><br />Ian was uncomfortable with the studio where Aqualung was recorded and in my opinion this is more than evident on the end result of those sessions. I find the sound on Aqualung to be quite shallow and thin, and maybe this was because of a lack of confidence in Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond's playing, who, according to Anderson, was a fledgling on the instrument? Also consider, this was Clive Bunker's last outing with Tull. According to what I've read, he was becoming uncertain about the musical direction in which the band was heading, and I feel that this uncertainty could have somehow been transfered into the recording process. Not that the drumming is mechanically sub-par, just that Bunker is far less present on Aqualung (and Benefit, now that I think about it) than he was on the first two Tull albums. Listen to Dharma for One, Cat's Squirrel, New Day Yesterday, and Nothing is Easy. Bunker is absolutely up front and bristling on those tracks. As an example of what I mean when I refer to the bleak sound quality from this particular period, compare the versions of Teacher offered on Benefit, where it originally appeared, and on Living in the Past, where it re-surfaced on that early compilation. The version that appears on the latter album was re-engineered and is far superior to the original version. You don't have to be an audiophile to hear the difference. In my opinion, it would have been nice if the same set of ears that produced that better version of Teacher (it might have been Ian, I don't know) could have worked the same magic over the Benefit, Aqualung, and Thick as a Brick albums in their entirety (not that TAAB is all that bad, but it wasn't as good as it could have been).<br /><br />This re-casting of Aqualung is an improvement on the original, and I have to admit that I warmed to the songs a fair bit more than I usually do (of course that could have been the Rumplemintz), but it could be that there is too much deficiency in the original tapes to ensure a top-end sound no matter what magical wand is waved over them. The bass lacks punch and presence (Oh for Mr. Cornick a la New Day Yesterday!), the drums are not immediate or forceful, the voice lacks resonance and depth, I feel in large part to Ian's wanting to sound snide, sarcastic, and rebellious: it's higher-pitched and somewhat hollow. This snide, sneering tone is present on certain parts of TAAB, but is almost altogether gone on A Passion Play. I am referring to the aural, emotive quality of Ian's voice here, not lyrical content, though obviously the latter effects the former.<br /><br />To hearken back to what I was saying about Ian Anderson's essential humility (in a healthy, not religious, self-loathing, sense) and what appears to me a small degree of uncertainty in regard to his muse: I think Aqualung was by and large an experiment in a musical genre from which Jethro Tull was subsequently to depart completely and in which I doubt they ever felt completely comfortable or honest. TAAB has none of Aqualung's metallic tone insofar as the music itself is concerned, and APP is miles away from it, so far in fact that it's not even hard rock let alone tentatively heavy metal; but while this is true there are quite a few times through the years when Ian seemed to be more persuaded by the fact that he was a pop icon, a position to which he might have felt duty-bound to stay at least ostensibly true, than by his own purely musical instincts. The Album \\"A\\" comes to mind, which seems like a response to the flimsy, keyboard-saturated music of New Wave; as does Under Wraps, which has our beloved Ian creating still more technologically-oriented soundscapes in order, it seems, to escape the Celtic, folksy, bucolic image Tull engendered automatically in people's minds; then there was Crest of a Knave, where almost anyone can detect the influence of Dire Straits. I put Aqualung in the category of Tull albums which, though very good and even excellent in many respects, were in some significant ways more the result of external influences and trends than of true artistic inspiration. Of course all of this is merely conjecture based on impressions I get from the music and from things Ian Anderson has said over the years, and I could be completely wrong about all of it; but If I could name one album which I *believe* to be one-hundred percent sterling Ian Anderson/Jethro Tull, it would be Songs from the Wood.<br /><br />Even in old interviews when he was a young man I get the feeling that Ian was far too humble to do himself justice. At one point he says something to the effect, \\"Why should people pay more to see me than to get a hamburger? I know I wouldn't.\\" When he introduces his songs in concert (see Youtube) he often seems apologetic and reluctant to play them, and acts surprised when the audience cheers like crazy as the number begins. I saw one video of a live version of Minstrel in the Gallery where Ian appears to be hesitant to even utter the title of the song, and looks around shifty-eyed once the words come haltingly forth as if waiting for audience approval, or for some heckler to raise a stink. An artist as original, intelligent, and talented as Ian Anderson shouldn't need a nod from anyone. All the critics and hecklers will recede into oblivion where they rightly belong.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't pinpoint exactly why I was drawn in to this series so strongly. I guess the number one thing is the characters who are just a lot of fun, and well cast across the board. After that it's the stories, which are sort of western/sci-fi/adventures with a touch of Mission Impossible at times. And then there's the universe and the ship/setting itself. I even love the title theme and opening sequence. Simply put, I just LOVED this show and I'm VERY disappointed that it got canceled. I've watched the series 2-3 times now, as well as Serenity the movie 3 times, and I still can't get enough - this is exceptional in my experience.<br /><br />I think if they could have gotten more people to watch the show in the first place and give it a chance, it might have been something much much bigger.

B000007OY0|5.0|After so many positive reviews already written, some personal observations.In the first place one does not readily identify Shawshank with the state of Maine. Evidently, author King did.Perhaps his mind works better in his home state. Freeman and Robbins finally get out; the revenge factor against a corrupt establishment is the key theme to the movie. But, what of those who never get out? Next, the realism of the movie is abeted by its brutality scenes, pictures of which one would rather deny. One would also assume in 2008, the likelihood of such a scheme succeeeding would be next to impossible.Yet,  reports of 3 million incarcerations at present in the USA makes one wonder. Finally, the movie is totally engrossing, leading to multiple viewings. The reason for this,I suspect,is probably different for every individual. Please take the time to mull over your reasoning. Please take time to mull over the \\"system\\".

140120306X|3.0|Having just read this League adventure, I have to say that a lot of the plot was a bit of a mess. For myself a lot of the Fun of this was reading the Book and spotting the Cultural references from the Start. From Roy of the Rovers, Coronation Street to Hi-de -Hi to Dan Dare pilot of the Future and Fireball Xl-5.Virtual every page had  little injoke, however if you don`t have these bits of amusement then the Book would have passed you by. Not the best work that Mr Moore has produced.
B00004WG2F|1.0|I hated the plot of this movie. I started watching it and almost immediately hated it. I wanted to see how it ended so I forwarded through to different chapters which only made me hate it more. I watched the end and screamed at the movie (which I never do) took the CD and broke it and threw the cover away. Yuck.

140120306X|2.0|This was quite disappointing compared to the earlier volumes in the series. While there were glimmers of many interesting ideas, none of them were well explored, leaving nothing but a series of brief cultural references that would probably be lost on anyone who isn't old enough to remember the old Flash Gordon serials.
B000Z0OX9O|4.0|Vangelis has given a wonderful present to all fans of the movie and his music. Of course we miss the opening titles, that impressive theme is once more missing (why??) but at least we can enjoy previously unreleased music and, above all, there is completely new music based on BR which is particularly interesting since it means a new turn in V´s music career after so many \\"neoclassical\\" albums. Jazz, electronica, new age..., styles he visited in the past sound now as fresh as ever and sheer experimentation is also there to the delight of his 70´s music fans. A real must.

Loved the book, liberals will not like it, but that is fine, this is America and everyone has a right to their opinion.  Thank goodness America has men who will do these types of jobs so the rest of us can complain while we sit in traffic, feel bad because we didn't get that last promotion, or get upset when we get a speeding ticket.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|This purchase was a great addition to my full collection of the gilmore girls, although i wasn't too impressed with the last episode. I am sure the writers could have done better considering it is the last season. Over all I enjoyed the season. Gilmores is great for mother and daughter bonding or with a group of friends hanging out. Another thing I like about the Gilmore Girls is that it is very relatable, and its content of unconditional love with friendships and relationship is universal.Thank you for the quick delivery and undamaged purchase.
B000050HTO|5.0|Bashing Dylan's vocal skills as a means of arguing that he's not a great artist is kind of like complaining that Woody Allen isn't a versatile actor.  If you have to resort to that, his talent is completely over your head.  Look at this track list - 30 of the greatest songs in American popular music & he wrote every single one & had huge radio hits with many of them.  Granted, there are versions of these tunes out there that surpass the original recordings in terms of sing-along-ability & pleasing listening.  But that's hardly the point.  So his poetry is not your thing?  Then why come here & review an album you obviously haven't even purchased or listened to??  If anyone wants a wonderful summary of Dylan's repertoire, this is a CD set that can't be beat.  And just look at that price!  A+

His daughter, who is superb  doesn't know who he is other than her mother's old friend, turns out to be a very fiesty teen who espouses hate for the absentee dad while he's befriending her in the grief of her mother.  Danger lurks, action, escapes, and very touching moments.  Superb film even for teens with their parents.

My most favorite book in the world is Nelson DeMille's Charm School, and now David's Total Control shares that title.  The 624 pages went FAST.  This is a page turner that you just can't wait to find out what the next exciting action packed page has in store!  I could not believe the extreme pace, multiple plot lines that were tied together and finally a finale worth the entire read.  GIVE ME MORE~!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Excellent movie!!! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry!  The cast is amazing.    The Holiday has a Bridget Jones' Diary feel to it.  It is a movie about romance and also finding yourself.  Kate Winslet's character is one that most women can relate to.  She keeps falling for the wrong man.  Eventually she becomes more confident and finds the right man!     Jude Law has never looked better!
B000YENUIQ|5.0|Eastern Promises is a very good movie.  Viggo Mortensen was outstanding and you can see why he earned an Oscar nomination for the role.  The other leads did a fantastic job and their really is no weak link in the cast.  If you like gritty personable mob movies than you will like this one.  It has some nudity and some violence, no more than \\"A History of Violence\\" which is by the same director.    The video on the HD-DVD is outstanding, I did not watch the normal DVD which is on the other side.     I only have standard stereo speakers hooked up to my system so I am not really able to judge the sound on this disc, but the sound was good through them.    The only negative is that it is a HD-DVD and not a Blue Ray. But if you own a HD-DVD player and want to own this move now and not wait for the Blue Ray edition (which as I write this has not yet been announced) I strongly recommend this movie.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Great cast. Excellent film all-around.  One of the best I have seen in a long, long time.

B0014CQNTK|4.0|When using the term 'quirky,' it's truly an understatement while speaking of Juno.  Ellen Page [[ASIN:B000GI3KGC Hard Candy]] plays the titular character with gusto and charm.  She's the type of girl everyone should have as a friend.  Juno is probably like someone most of us know; she's witty, smart and lovely.  This 16 year old junior in high school winds up pregnant.  Of course, this puts a big roadblock in her life's path.  It was an accident but she just doesn't have the heart to end the pregnancy.  She relies on help from a friend to find suitable parents via a local newspaper.<br /><br />The story is truly a journey the audience takes with the lovely Juno.  Page has a brilliance about her with makes her a wonder to watch.  Michael Cera [[ASIN:B000WZEZG8 Superbad - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] is awesome in his own, neurotic way as he plays Juno's beloved boyfriend.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner [[ASIN:B000Y7WGOW The Kingdom (Widescreen Edition)]] are sweet as the potential adoptive parents.  Plus J.K. Simmons [[ASIN:B000UR9T82 Spider-Man - The High Definition Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3) [Blu-ray]]] and Allison Janney [[ASIN:B000065V39 Walking and Talking]] are pretty good as Juno's father/stepmother.<br /><br />Written by Diablo Cody [[ASIN:B000FZDKNO Candy Girl : A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper]] , the movie had almost an annoying amount of pop-culture references.  Not since an entire week of VH1 specials, have there been so many references to movies/toys/cartoons/songs/etc.  The story is heartwarming to say the least.  It's certainly not the normal romance flick.  It does have something for everyone, and it climaxes with the best possible ending for the story.  However, I hope for Cody's next movie, she can prove that it's not all just pop.

Plainview is a down and out silver miner who happens to strike oil in the turn of the century west.

When Plainview goes to research the land he meets Paul's twin Eli.  Eli helps to negotiate a fair price for his fathers land.  However, he asks the atheistic Plainview for a donation to help his church.  This is where the vengeance comes in.  Plainview is a stubborn man who won't take no for an answer.  He firmly believes that everyone and everything has its price.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is a stunning piece of work.  P.T. Anderson [[ASIN:B000PAAJYW Magnolia]]has a true knack for creating fascinating stories with even more fascinating characters.  Throughout watching, I couldn't help but mentally compare it to one of many Stanley Kubrick [[ASIN:B000UJCAKO Stanley Kubrick - Warner Home Video Directors Series]] films.  The music is haunting.  The scenery is breathtaking.  Plus the pacing is a simple work of art.  It's not the normal flick wherein a scene or shot lasts a mere thirty seconds.  Instead, each scene is a story within the entire story.  It's not made at a brisk, action-packed pace, but it certainly holds the interest of the audience.  To top it off, it has one of the greatest all time lines which is unexpected in an \\"Oil Tycoon\\" film. \\"I drink your milkshake.\\"  Now I'm thirsty for milk and ice cream.

I love this movie and cant tell you how many times I have watched it and still have the excitement of it being the first time I love this tale and the best part is that the color is bright not like the VHS.

B000PTYPAC|2.0|When the opening track of an album such as Paramore's Riot! is entitled `For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic', you just have to bite your lip and attempt to avoid the snide retort.    But, I fail. Y'see, I'm quite the pessimist, but even I was surprised by the levels of anodyne, track-by-track, prontaprint-generic, middle-of-the-road dullness here.    There was a lingering hope that, despite the Fuelled By Ramen home and airbrushed brightness of their photoshoots and over-earnest press representation, some sort of truth might be had in their portrayal as a spunky, balls-out, whirlwhind of girl-power emo ferocity.    Of course, it's all rot. Riot sounds like a crunching, flashlight-white amalgamation of Avril Lavigne and Kelly Clarkson, save for token ballad `We Are Broken' that echoes the enchanting eighties sounds of Belinda Carlisle.    Topic-wise the sole fixation of the record are those mean, horrible, cheating boys. Either singer Hayley Williams has read a lot of trashy teen fiction, or the poor girl has had more bad relationships in her tender years than the average person would deem themselves unfortunate to have in a lifetime. Riot should have the title prologue of (...Or How All Boyz Sux). Musically, it's equally as one-tracked, as Josh Farro and the now-departed Hunter Lamb (nice name) struggle manfully to get just the right amount of generic chugging and insipid riffery from their hookless guitar lines. Tracks like `That's What You Get' and `When It Rains' blend seamlessly together until it seems that the album is one long, sugar-infused bleat.    At 38 minutes long, it's mercifully brief, but still manages to feel like a double album for those who endure it. That's those who don't manage to forget that it's on the stereo at all.     People, get your pop-punk thrills somewhere else. At least somewhere where there are actual thrills to be had.

B00008OWZC|5.0|Only at the end of a legendary career, long after the release of their last studio album, can a band just sort of shrug and say, \\"Yeah...why not put out a triple live?\\"<br /><br />Early, it would be seen as arrogance.  A triple live album?  For most bands, it would still remain a daunting task.  But this is Zeppelin.  The normal rules, and quite possibly the laws of physics, just don't apply.<br /><br />Disc one is just great.  The opening notes of \\"Immigrant Song\\" seem SOOO heavy, when compared to the studio track, and Robert Plant's vocals take on an almost haunting quality over the heaviness of the riffs.  And then comes \\"Heartbreaker,\\" which might as well be labeled \\"The Jimmy Page Show.\\"  \\"Black Dog\\" really highlights Plant's stage presence (yes, even on an audio album), in that he constantly changes the vocal melodies from those found on Led Zeppelin IV, taking the performance from audience sing-a-long to one in which he is a captivating performer, teasing the audience with a silent break in the music, followed by a soaring high vocal line that contrasts nicely with the lower tones used in this performance of the song.<br /><br />It is only then, after a heavy, full scale rock n' roll start that things slow down a bit, with the subdued opening of \\"Over the Hills and Far Away,\\" before the groove infused riffs burst forth, as if they just can't be contained.  The deliciously slow blues of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" plays well, live, and once again lets Page's playing shine ever so brightly...and so continues the first disc, with great performances of what have become classic Zeppelin songs.<br /><br />The second disc is remarkably different.  \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" initially stretched out to a tortuously slow pace, seems all the heavier for it, taking on a sinister, almost Sabbath-esque quality.  When the song bleeds into an extended jam, Page's use of a bow on his guitar strings lends a great atmospheric quality to the music, creating a dark, eerie sound, before leading back into a reprise of \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" all told, clocking in at an impressive 25 minutes in length.  The crowd is then treated to a playful rendition of \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" and a pretty by-the-book rendition of \\"Dancing Days,\\" before another incredibly long performance, this time of \\"Moby Dick.\\"  While there's no question that John Bonham is an incredible drummer, the solo here is excessive, and takes away from a song that had such a cool back and forth between a great riff and killer rhythm section.  If you really dig a drum solo (which I do not), then you'll love this track.  If you don't...well, it drags on a bit too long.<br /><br />Disc three begins with an incredible \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" medley, going from heavy to bluesy to an oldies feel to slow blues, and then back to \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  After another such incredibly long track, the album closes off in fairly straight forward fashion.  \\"Rock and Roll\\" is played pretty much by the book, as is \\"The Ocean.\\"  \\"Bring It on Home\\" is a great closer for both the disc and the album, and is played with a lot of energy and soul.<br /><br />All together, this is a great live set.  It captures the energy and talent of what I think may have been the best band ever to play.  Excellent!se of \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" all told, clocking in at an impressive 25 minutes in length.

0307388840|5.0|I'd never read McEwen before and the first 100 pages of this book were rather slow, but I plowed on through and was rewarded with a masterful, well written story.  McEwen is a master of the english language and the plot was very intricate and well conceived.  There is also much in this book about the history of England during World War II, and that is perhaps the icing on the cake of this great story.  The evacuation of the British troops at Dunkirk and the subplot of the three soldiers making their way to the French coast during the mass retreat was probably my favorite part of this book.  However, the final portion of the book, which had to do with training nurses in London during the outbreak of hostilities was also very interesting.    I wasn't as interested in the lead-in to the story, which revolved around the pre-war English country life, but it also had it's moments of intrigue and drama.  The story is centered around a romance and while I'm not much for romance stories, I must admit it did draw me in.  The many twists and turns in the plot build towards a fabulous ending, which although I thought I had figured out by the time I got there, I hadn't.    The prose and style is incredible throughout, very descriptive and rich with detail.  Character developement is obviously a specialty of McEwen's and each of his subjects is multifaceted and complex.  I would recommend this book to everyone, and I have, and I will be looking to read many more of McEwen's novels in the future.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I don't think having one negative review on amazon was right so i feel that I should put in my thoughts on this.  This film is a brilliant, if unusual character study.  The first thing anyone should notice about this film(besides Daniel Day's oscar winning performance) is the soundtrack by Johnny Greenwood.  It is easily the best score of the year, and immediately distinguishes this film.  The first twenty minutes are without any dialogue, and it is to the score's credit that it engages the audience so much.  Then there is Daniel Day Lewis.  He enthralls for every second of the film's admittedly long runtime.  He is terrifying, funny, and fascinating to watch.  Overall this film may not be mainstream, but it is never boring.  It was easily one of the top ten films of 2007 and well worth a rental or even a blind buy.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I refused to go see this when it came out because Deep Impact also came out and I just thought it was another boring natural disaster flick.  It is probably one of my favorites. I enjoy the characters and their dialogues. Steve Buscemi has some great lines - which is why I probably also recommend/own Con Air,  The Wedding Singer and The Island (although he isn't the only reason I have those movies).  Armageddon is an enjoyable action flick that brings a tear to my eye - way to go Bruce!
B0010X8NF0|4.0|Touching film that is difficult to put in a particular genre.  It is quiet comedy, reflection on American consumerism, meditation on meaning of family and quest for spirituality.  We meet three brothers who have not seen each other for a year, since the funeral for their father who died in a car accident.  Their mother never comes to the funeral and for all of the brothers this event seems to be a culmination of the prolonged family disfunction.  They are almost like boy-men who cope with their inadequacy in their own way:  eldest one (Francis - Owen) almost kills himself in motorcycle accident, middle one (Peter - Brody) collects material things: his deceased father's glasses, keys, belt; while the youngest one, a pretentious writer who speakes poor French in spite of living in Paris (Jack - Schwartsman) sleeps with anything that is female and still moving.  I like the metaphor that director Wes Anderson uses for the brothers.  They travel across beautiful Indian landscape with so much luggage that they require three porters and a car to carry it.  The luggage itself is no less but Louis Vuitton designed by Mark Jacobs.  As the film progresses and comes to its closure, all three manage to release themselves from the baggage and their dysfunctions turn into sincere brotherly love for each other.  They no longer need to medicate themselves with cigarettes, Indian caugh drops and pain killers.  They have each other and they finally trust each other.  Wonderful cast, music and scenery.  Film moves slowly and has fragments that connect past with the character's present.  Heartwarming movie with support cast of Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray.
B00003CXDD|2.0|by Dane Youssef<br /><br />This one wasn't much when it first came out. The budget was extravagant and the box-office returns just barely covered the big fat price tag. And as measly as a movie as this was for it's day on it's own merits, it's dwarfed even further by the immortal \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" saga.<br /><br />\\"Willow\\" is the film the impish Warwick Davis is renown for his participation in the never-ending Horror-movie stories, the \\"Leprechaun\\" movies.<br /><br />This was his first lead role and he brings a likeable and earnest charisma to the role instead of just trying to be little and cute like so many child performers and other midget actors. Thankfully, he proves himself as to be more than just a cheap gimmick like so many other \\"bit-players.\\" He allows himself to really give a true performance and the film itself doesn't go for the cheapest of shots with any of the height of it's little people.<br /><br />As a filmmaker, George Lucas is and has always been a homage-payer. He's one of those filmmakers who always tries to re-make those old films he loved during his own adolescence. With space operas: \\"Star Wars,\\" With Matinee Adventure flicks: \\"Indiana Jones,\\" With futuristic sci-fi adventures, \\"THX 1138.\\"<br /><br />And now with \\"Willow,\\" he attempts to do the same for the sword-and-sorcery genre.<br /><br />Notice I use the word \\"attempts.\\"<br /><br />The whole universe is derived from the whole medieval sword-and-sorcery genre. And it's a full bar and buffet smorgasbord here: We've got \\"Lord Of The Rings,\\" \\"The Story of Moses,\\" \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,\\" \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" just to name a few.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is pound-for-pound one of the great heavyweight champion actors from here to Timbaktu. Perhaps even Pluto. But he even he and the rest of this considerable cast can't make it's movie as special and magical as it's title character is supposed to be.<br /><br />The 20th century and the 21st saw few better thespians. He truly delivered an Oscar for his re-birth as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's \\"The Doors.\\"<br /><br />Here, anyone could have done the same job he does. It's his most unremarkable performance to date. They didn't need the great Kilmer for this one.<br /><br />Any stock actor with a Screen Actors Guild card or with one year of high school drama class experience could have done as good a job.<br /><br />Jean Marsh does a good job as Queen Bavmorda, but just about any random British actress on the planet could have done the same and gotten the same results.<br /><br />Sadly, this one just stands toe-to-toe with the He-Man \\"Master Of The Universe\\" movie from 1987.<br /><br />Even though Ron Howard Opie Cunningham was at the helm for this one, just about any hack with access to a tripod (that tilts low) could have done the same and gotten the same results.<br /><br />The real problem with \\"Willow\\" is that it's totally unremarkable. It's about a likeable little guy with a big heart for his family. He has a magical gift and uses it to make a name for himself. He meets a great warrior with a shady record who may find love along the way.<br /><br />They do battle with a wicked queen who happens to be a powerful witch with a great army, a two-headed dragon, a menacing lieutenant General who wears a mask scarier than his own face, yada yada yada yada. Do you even care?<br /><br />There are two little like the 3-inch tall people in \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" called Brownies named Rool and Franjean with helium voices and ethnic caricatured French accents that would have been considered embarrassing in the '30's. They irritate and confuse, but never amuse. Unlike R2D2 and C3PO or Marcus Brody, they never provoke as much as a smile.<br /><br />Lucas planned for this to be something of a series saga of films. But since this one barely made any return whatsoever, Lucas wound up scrapping the film \\"trilogy\\" and continuing the story in books. Hey, anyone out there ever actually so muchas read a copy of the continuing \\"Willow\\" story?<br /><br />With \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"THX 1138\\" and \\"American Graffiti,\\" Lucas swung for the fence like a dominant male gorilla. He pulled out all stops and then some. This one is on-par with your average episode of a Saturday Morning TV series, even for the day.<br /><br />With Lucas' legendary \\"Indiana Jones\\" saga, we all remember one key gruesome scene in each movie---like the \\"false grail\\" scene in \\"Last Crusade\\" or the \\"Ripped Heart\\" in \\"The Temple Of Doom.\\" In \\"Willow,\\" there's a similar sequence inspired by the \\"Bay Of Pigs\\" from the Greek tales of \\"The Iliad and The Odyssey.\\"<br /><br />Lucas story pretty much recycles the whole outline plot of the \\"Star Wars\\" saga (episodes IV, V, and VI). Unfortunately, Lucas and Howard don't really feel like they're trying<br />to have the last word of the genre as they did in many of their earlier efforts.<br /><br />You can see anything just as good and inspired/thrilling/etc. every Saturday morning on just about any network.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Indiana Jones\\" or \\"Cocoon,\\" this is not a product of theirs that defines the genre it's from.<br /><br />And what is it with the baby Elora Danan?

630542845X|2.0|by Dane Youssef<br /><br />Victor Salva's \\"Powder\\" is the kind of movie that when you first read the screenplay, you think... God, this is so full of potential.<br /><br />Think of the endless possibilities. It just needs a rewrite, maybe even a script doctor and we can make this the talked-about film of the year.<br /><br />But the movie gets rushed into filming and it's left with an unfinished feeling.<br /><br />It feels like the studio or the director wanted to make a movie about persecuted outsiders and then thought, \\"Well, we want this movie to drive people here in hoards. We need a mainstream film... so lets not make it too smart for people to follow and too deep for people to want to get into. We don't wanna go over people's heads.\\"<br /><br />It takes a truly original character and plugs him into a movie as routine and unremarkable as the bullying, red-neck catalysts who flaunt 85% of the film's supporting roles. Who just gawk and insult 'cause they're so damn screwed-up themselves, on a personal level.<br /><br />Who's fault is this? The director... or the executives?<br /><br />\\"Powder\\" has some moments that are almost Spielberg-Ian and insights that cause you to think. But there are too many others that almost feel phoned in.<br /><br />Sean Patrick Flanery plays Jeremy Reed, nicknamed \\"Powder\\" is an amazing superhuman who is almost pure energy and conducts electricity better than water or metal. He has the ability to read minds, magnetize and he can also shatter glass telepathically. He is also a genius.<br /><br />The movie begins with an establishing scene where an expectant mother is driven screaming in an ambulance to the nearest hospital. And not only has her water broke, she has just been struck by lightning.<br /><br />The father demands to see him. The baby is screaming inside the oxygen tent as if it's a burn victim. It almost seems to know what's going on right now. The cries are deafening and heartbreaking.<br /><br />And the father abandons him. The boy lives with his grandparents until they die and poor Powder is once again without family.<br /><br />People who find Powder downstairs in the basement, hiding. From them. From outsiders. From the world.<br /><br />They bundle him up, take him away to a reform school. Why?<br /><br />Um...shouldn't he be sent to an orphanage or something? Why throw him in with criminals who can't be tried as adults?<br /><br />Oh, the formula. Sorry, I forgot.<br /><br />Jeremy is bullied all throughout the movie and takes way too long to retaliate. As if the director is getting too damn into this or has time to kill. Even when it's clear there's no other choice. \\"Not much fight in you, huh?\\" asks one of them at one point. Obviously not.<br /><br />I can't tell if we takes so long to just use his abilities because he's afraid, he's too good... or the film's gotta too much time to kill and the director's enjoying lashing back.<br /><br />We see Jeremy's pale as death skin and his defined male form. Salva incorporates this scene because of his preference for the male physique. He shows male nudity in a lot of his movies and homosexual elements. There is a moment that suggests that Jeremy might be gay or some of the other kids in the film might have those elements as well.<br /><br />These scenes are well-drawn, no doubt related to Salva's experiences dealing with his own sexuality. Salva himself is gay, yes.<br /><br />Which explains a lot of the endless elaborate homo put-downs throughout the movie and male nudity as well. Even the southern redneck kids don't mind too much getting a gander at Powder's privates.<br /><br />Of course we need (yes, NEED) scenes where Jeremy is persecuted for the way he is. But there are too many of those. They take up way too much of the movie. A scene in a cafeteria, in the woods and in the gymnasium that moves outside onto the field.<br /><br />There are many, many scenes where Jeremy shows his endless powers. Yet too many people are slow to catch on, even the smart ones.<br /><br />There's a truly great scene where a redneck hick deputy sheriff (Brandon Smith) shoots a deer and Powder uses an empathy power so the deputy can feel the deer's pain and suffering.<br /><br />And another where Jeremy is getting involved with the only sweet girl in town and they have a moment where they share kind of Vulcan mind-meld.<br /><br />He has every superpower known to man. He's smart, sweet, kind and all-powerful.<br /><br />But for some reason, he lacks the ability to do the simplest thing and the most obvious thing when the opportunity is right there. So does pretty much everyone else in this film most of the time.<br /><br />I asked myself, why?<br /><br />Oh, the formula. Sorry, I forgot.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum believes in Jeremy and thinks he could be an advanced step in human evolution. He delivers eloquence about where he explains what Powder is and again later with everything wrong with humanity and how we haven't moved very far in the great human race. And Jeremy could be humanity's answer.<br /><br />The ending is inevitable, but sad. I guess there was just no other way for Powder or the movie. But you walk away wishing Powder AND the movie itself just did more than have big moments involving special effects, dealing with antagonists and only occasionally having a real moment.<br /><br />Still, it's a nice renter. Goldblum's lines about humanity will make you think and Patrick Flanery's performance as the title character are all worthwhile.<br /><br />And there are several scenes that really do stay stuck with you....<br /><br />danessf@yahoo.com<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]r so the deputy can feel the deer's pain and suffering.

0439680093|5.0|This was a great book, I couldn't put it down.  I wanted to know more about Matt and felt bad for him and his grim situation.  I hope that the Gatekeepers would be made into a movie, it would be filled with suspense and intrigue, like the book series.  I havent gotten the other books in the series yet, but am excited to read them.  Matt Freeman is a great charactor, Horowitz wrote a fab book.  I would recommend this book to not only the junior high set, but older kids and adults, its hard to stop reading it once you get started.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|Just received this product and I love it. It fits perfectly on my umbrella MacLaren stroller with the separated handles.  It  was a great alternative for the other organizers including the MacLaren version. It can hold two-  real/ adult beverages along with your necessities. Great shopping pal.  - Shopping in MS
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Ok i confess  i saw this movie three times in at the movies. The first time i hated it. The last two times I left starry eyed. Then I rewatched the BBC adaption. And now basically I'm over it. The flaws are waving like red flags. I am now starting to hate it. Honestly it wasn't horrible. The music and scenery and cinematography are awesome. But the portrayal of the characters especially Darcy I can't buy.I'm sorry. From the first time I saw it I didn't believe a word he said. It just felt like the writers tried to hard. They were so eager to make pride and prejudice appeal to younger generations that they tried to add humour and romance. There are so many punch lines and I don't know. Jane Austen wrote a wonderful story it doesn't need help. In the attempt to make pride and prejudice more whatever they just killed the book. Of course people will read it, but I have so often seen a movie loved it and hated the book for being different. You have to be very open-mind to read the book after the movie. And even more open minded to like both. It's not awful, but its not what it could or should be. If you haven't watched it yet STOP!!! BBC first, then this one. If haven't read book, it's a must read. Don't judge the book by it's movie, give it a fair shot.
B000YABYLA|4.0|`Juno' at times comes off a little `too' abrasive.  Diablo Cody's script, which has been lauded as new-age perfection, can in moments come across forced and just a little `too' eccentric.  You may find yourself wondering if anyone really talks like this.  That said; the movie is so genuinely sweet and movie that it's easily forgivable.  In fact it's not a bad script; it's funny, witty and fresh, completely original; it's just a little `too much' at times.  That is the one and only complaint I have with this movie.  There is nothing else within this film that warrants another bad word from me.  The performances are sincere and touching, the plot is brilliantly constructed and the overall feeling of emotional connection I had in the close of this film was unexpected but joyously welcomed.  `Juno' is a great film.<br /><br />Here's why.<br /><br />The biggest plus this movie has it its fantastic cast who all commit wholeheartedly to the task at hand.  Everyone in this film is on point and that is not just a huge feat but a critical steeple for the films success.  When you think about the `witty' script filled to the brim with teenage lingo for the next generation it's some tough dialog to spurt and make believable.  The actors had a hefty assignment set before them.  If they didn't slip into character perfectly and fluently deliver their lines the film would have been a total loss.  It would have been choppy and awkward and a complete mess.  Delivering those lines fluently on the other hand would have taken a lot of work; and work they must have because not one actor failed to be convincing.  Everyone, and I stress the word `everyone', delivered magnificently.  It's the only way the script would have worked.<br /><br />The story follows young Juno MacGuff, a young teenage girl who finds out that she is pregnant (all thanks to that wonderful, blessed chair).  She decides against abortion and for adoption and so she searches to find the perfect family for her little sea monkey.  Those perfect parents wind up being Mark and Vanessa Loring.  It's apparent to the viewer that their relationship is not so perfect, but that's beside the point.  Juno thus decides that there is no other couple she would rather raise her baby and so with everything settled we now must wait, as do they, for the baby to come.  Waiting alongside Juno are her father Mac, her step-mother Bren and her baby-daddy Paulie.<br /><br />`Juno' is not your typical teen comedy for it actually delves deep into the workings of the characters it presents and helps us get inside their heads, know them and become a part of their story.  Juno is more than just another pregnant teenager to us.  Thanks to Ellen Page's Oscar nominated performance (so happy for her) Juno becomes a real person, with problems and issues and frustrations just like the rest of us.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as Vanessa and Mark, especially Garner who adds layers to her character, layers I didn't know Garner could deliver.  Michael Cera is just blowing up this year, and here as Paulie Bleeker he manages to make geek sheik.  J.K. Simmons is great as Mac and Allison Janney is flawless as Bren, utterly flawless.<br /><br />Like I said, there are times when `Juno' seems like it may be trying too hard but it's such a sentimental and sweet film that by the time the credits begin to roll you'll have forgiven it its minor trespasses and embraced it for the critical darling it's already become.arents wind up being Mark and Vanessa Loring.

0307346617|5.0|Simply brillant. Buy it. Read it. Sleep with the light on and an entrenching tool under the bed. Sure, laugh now... You'll see.<br /><br />The audiobook is FANTASTIC despite some omissions of narrative due to time. Alan Alda, Mark Hamill (use the pick ax, Luke!), J&uuml;rgen Prochnow, Henry Rollins, John Turturro, Rob and Carl Reiner all add remarkable characterization to the oral 'histories' of World War Z.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you have nightmares. My girlfriend had them on and off for weeks, actually... But she was utterly fascinated by the presentation. Neither of us are horror genre people, but this was gut-retchingly real. It had us rapt much the same way people must have been around the old radio serials of the 30s and 40s. The 'Lone Ranger' this ain't however; more Orson Wells 'War of the Worlds'.<br /><br />Cheers to Max Brooks. When will we have a sequel or additional record of 'personal experiences' regarding the Z event?!?<br /><br />And cheers for mentioning the Dairy State (WI) in the work. Frozen zombies coming to life in the spring- gotta love it. Sounds like Summerfest. LOL

B000QCTNIW|5.0|I am a Special Education Instructional Assistant. The parents of the student I have been serving for the past couple of years(she is now in first grade) gave our supervisor this book to read. My supervisor gives all such books to me as I have more time to read them than she. This book has given my student's parents and me a fresh optimism. My student was born with tumulor sclerosis. This  past December she underwent two surgeries which have served to diminish her seizure activity considerably. Dr. Doidge's wonderful book informs us that this little girl does have a chance for healing beyond what any of us imagined or hoped.    I also care for my older brother who has suffered brain damage and seizures. Dr. Doidge's book helps me to understand my brother better and informs me as to what I can do to help him improve the quality of his life.     I have had to read other books for information that could help us help my student but Dr. Doidge's book is the only one I hate to put down, can't wait to finish, and look forward to re-reading. I know I will not absorb it all with this initial reading. Thank you, Dr. Doidge!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Music taste is a very personal thing, so perhaps music reviews are a waste of time unless aimed at existing fans of the artist or performer. This, however, is one of those rare concert experiences that you just want to share with everyone! It's the only music DVD I've ever bought having not previously experienced the artist's music. I bought it on the strength of the amazon reviews alone. Sure, in this day and age, it's apparently easy to fool many people much of the time, but surely SO MANY people couldn't virtually ALL be wrong??? No, having now experienced the DVD, I reckon the rave reviews were absolutely spot on!    Yanni's compositions are brought to life in a spectacular orchestral experience - combining new age, classical and contemporary music - highlighted by a refreshingly varied world mix of supremely talented musicians. It sweeps you along for a journey that will move you - both in body and soul.    The full depth of this concert is best enjoyed through a fairly competent hi-fi system or better (surround and 2-channel are both catered for) - not least because the soundtrack recordings are as good as the best I've ever experienced. Just remember to 'make nice' with the neighbours first, as that volume control is headed in one direction only!
B000KGGB2A|5.0|After watching the film \\"Stardust\\" and listening to THE song \\"Rule the World\\" by the Group called \\"Take That\\" during the film's credits, I fell in love with this song and Group!! I had never heard of this group or song before, but went on to purchase both of these CD's \\"Beautiful World\\" and \\"Rule The World\\".  All the songs are great and in my opinion, should ALL be number one hits. I just wonder why I haven't heard of them before, why they are not played on US radio stations, and why not so well known here.  I think they would be a big hit here if they toured in the US and our radio stations played them.
B000VI04HK|3.0|I was really looking forward to getting this and I enjoyed it for the most part. The audience noise is fairly loud and the sound isn't that sharp but I guess that's what they were going for. It's great to hear the band re-interpret some of their songs and do some classics. I was very disappointed when I realized that the 2nd CD is only 5 songs! Who was the genius that did that?! Not only does it offset any kind of balance or symetry but it's sort of a rip-off to anybody expecting a real 2 disc set. Why not just say it's a live CD with a bonus EP??
0525950079|1.0|\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is one of my favorite books of all time.  This sequel might rank as one of my least.  I am halfway through and have rolled my eyes countless times.  I have thought of abandoning it, but I spent $24 on this dud so by gum I'm going to read it.  That's how bad it is.  The speaking style and words used by the characters remind me of 21st century mall-rats.  Follett seems to think readers are clamoring for a sex scene every five pages or so...and not tasteful sex scenes either.  I feel like he wrote this for teenagers whose interest will wane without sex, sex, sex.  This book is just plain DUMB.  Don't waste your time or money on this.

0307237702|5.0|Barack is obviously very intelligent since he has a tremendous grasp of not only American history, but of world history too.  And he recognizes that there are different cultures and views around the world.  He tells us of his views and ideas, but, and this is a big but, he realizes that we must talk to our enemies and discuss our problems.  Every American should read this book even if they do not want him to be our president.  A truly inspirational book with great ideas.  And a lot of common sense.
0375842209|5.0|OH MY GOSH. I will read probably 50 - 60 books this year. It is going to be tough to top this one. Oh yes, I have read the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns is on my nightstand right now. I have read Water for Elephants...I have read Shadows of the Wind. All excellent. Any time a book can make you smile and snicker and then fill you with sadness or grief...anytime a book can stir emotions like this one did me...I rate it five stars with no problem. This book takes place in Nazi Germany during the war. Rudy and Liesel are the young protaganists. Nuff said...buy this book...it will blow you away. BTW...I am a 59 year old male reader. Enjoy.

B000I2MRHE|5.0|My 11 week old daughter could not handle tummy time.   She would lay on her tummy for 5 mins TOPS and then WAIL!  Now when she is on the ladybug she moves herself around and has tripled her tummy time!   She did not like it much as first but we worked up to it.   She seems to do a little better JUST on the ground, too.   Her favorite part is the mirror and will spin herself around everytime to find it!  She also likes the bright yellow face of butterfly!  :)
0385486804|5.0|Me being the age that I am I was too young to remember or just too young to pay attention when this story first came to be. I unfortunately never heard of Chris McCandless until I heard about the movie which immediately grabbed my attention and never let go. I unfortunately never got to see the movie, so I decided I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and Im glad I did. The first chance I had to sit down I read it. I enjoyed it greatly. It is a very good book.
B000VR824S|4.0|This set is full of blues celebrities, including some I had never seen before, such as Hubert Sumlin, the great ex-Howling Wolf guitarist. There's lots of great guitar playing of course, and all the old-timers (and the youngsters too) give a good account of themselves. B.B. King, over 80 years old, is in surprisingly robust voice and plays as well as ever, though he is very overweight and played his set sitting down. But the highlight for me was Jeff Beck's incredibly imaginative and dramatic guitar playing. Though over 60 Beck has retained his youthful figure and shock of black hair, and continues to sound like a visitor from the future. Following Jeff's every twist and turn and taking her own extended solo was young Tal Wilkenfeld, an amazing talent on bass. Her solo blew me away, and it doesn't hurt that she's cute and radiates enthusiasm. It's nice to see musicians smiling instead of trying to look mean and alienated.

0805211063|5.0|Review of \\"The Castle\\" by Franz Kafka<br /><br />This book made me into a Kafka admirer.  He brings life to characters in otherwise drab situations and makes them seem very real.  The reader feels the frustration, absurdity, the pettiness and the powerlessness in a personal way.  You feel the haughtiness and aloofness of the Castle staff as if they were a part of your own community.  You feel the pettiness and delusional gossip of the townspeople as if you were seeing it first hand.  The story is riveting and the pace seems fast even when there is little action.<br /><br />The story starts with the protagonist (identified only by his initial, K.) walking to what sounds like a routine surveying job.  Soon he is frustrated by a very confusing series of obstacles.  As the story develops the obstacles become more chaotic.  K.'s original purpose in going to the castle is never fully elaborated and his motives seem lost or stolen.  The forces acting upon K. are shrouded.  It seems as if some invisible force has plotted to test K. to the limit of human endurance of tolerance of ambiguity.<br /><br />Kafka combines the themes of:<br />  social class commentary,<br />  alienation from a heartless social system,<br />  absence of any protective power,<br />  salvation,<br />  redemption,<br />  fear of strangers,<br />  fear of change,<br />  search for the meaning of life,<br />  inscrutability of authorities,<br />  indifference of forces ruling human fate,<br />  persistence in the face lost purpose,<br />  abuse of power<br />  and<br />  acceptance of pointlessness goals.<br /><br />As the plot progresses it takes on a surreal nightmare quality.  Is the protagonist having a nightmare, going insane or confronting the reality of his situation?<br /><br />There is no end to the frustration.  We are never told if K. is having a nightmare or going insane.  We never discover why K. is so determined to enter the castle that he would tolerate and even join in to the absurdity.  His original purpose of doing a surveying job could never justify his struggle to gain admittance.  We are left seeing K. as a perpetual outsider.  Perhaps Kafka is telling us that there is no end or limit to frustration, alienation and absurdity.  Those seeking an answer to the ageless enigma of existence will never find a simple resolution.<br /><br />This is a disturbing work that challenges conventional notions of plot and character development while testing the readers conception of his/her purpose in life.  The Castle will confront the reader in unexpected ways and raise emotional personal issues that would otherwise be repressed.<br /><br />See:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400052998 The Metamorphosis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0805210407 The Trial]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0805210644 Amerika]]<br /><br />Collections:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0805209069 The Diaries of Franz Kafka (Schocken Classics Series)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0679423036 Collected Stories (Everyman's Library)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0805212078 The Z&uuml;rau Aphorisms of Franz Kafka]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1878972049 Blue Octavo Notebooks]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393924793 Kafka's Selected Stories (Norton Critical Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1561631256 Give It Up: And Other Short Stories]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:048643205X Great German Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)]]<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.His original purpose of doing a surveying job could never justify his struggle to gain admittance.

B000K15VSA|4.0|Blade Runner is my second favorite movie, and there's always been a certain amount of dissatisfaction among Blade Runner fans regarding details that should or should not have found their way into the original release of the film.  Owners of this 5-disk collector's edition have no reason to complain, as EVERY VERSION OF THE FILM THAT HAS EVER EXISTED (barring any that were edited for television) is included here in the packege.  Personally, I debated whether or not to shell out the dough for this edition for a little while, and I think that the deal-maker for me was the inclusion of the work-print in this release.  I'm satisfied, more satisfied than I feel I would've been with just the 2-disc edition, but I also feel like I'd have been just as happy buying one fewer disc, and a lot fewer plastic doo-dads.    Disc one is Ridley Scott's Final Cut, currently the definative version of this film and hopefully the last \\"improved\\" version that will ever be released.  The content is just about the same as that of the 1992 director's cut, with a scene here and there from the workprint spliced in, and some special effects wizardry to correct gripes such as a stunt-double's wig not looking proper, or Harrison Ford's lips not matching the audio track.  There are three commentaries, and although I've only listened to two of them so far, I'd say that they're worthwhile (although it's tough to tell if Hampton Fancher and David Peoples were really just about fed up with each other during the recording of their commentary, or were just putting on a show for the microphone.)    Disc two is a making-of documentry.  If you've ever read Paul M. Sammon's \\"Future Noir:  The Making of Blade Runner,\\" know that this disc contains most of the information that was included in that book, plus a whole lot more.  Most of the original cast is interviewed here (Ford included, although Will Sanderson is strangely absent, and a disclaimer at the end of the credits claims that absent cast members politely declined to be interviewed...,) both screenwriters give their input, and even PKD gets a little screen time with recordings made around the time of the filming.  In my mind, discs one and two absolutely make this edition.  (It should also be noted that discs one and two ARE the two-disc edition.)    Disc three is just an \\"archive\\" of the previous three versions of the film; the theatrical release, the home video cut, and the 1992 director's cut.  To me, there is so little difference between these three versions that this disc was probably just a waste of my money.  It's expendable    Disc four contains more featurettes, and it's as appriciated as disc two was.  There's some repetition of information, but they go a lot more in-depth with the specific aspects of the filming - wardrobe, effects, and so on.  If you're an info junkie like me, you'll like discs two and four equally.    Disc five is the workprint. I wanted a copy, and now I've got a copy, but it's not so much different from the film that a casual fan needs to see it.  Its lukewarm.    The rest of the space inside of the plastic briefcase that these DVDs come in is taken up with packing foam, artwork, and toys, for lack of a better word.  We're graced with a plastic model spinner, a plastic origami unicorn (which isn't even that good of a ringer for the one that Gaff leaves in the film, if you compare the two), and a plastic block with an animated second or two of footage from the movie - one of those graphics that appears to move if you rock it back and forth.  As an adult, I really didn't feel that I needed to pay for any of this, and all it did was jack up the purchase price unneccesarily.  I wish that I could sell them all back to Warner Home Video, but I can't.    The briefcase itself, also plastic, is really just as much a toy, and a cumbersome one to store.  The only reason they needed this large of a packege in the first place was to include all of the playthings, and as I've already said, I could have done without those.    The five discs are stored in a folding cardboard-and-plastic slipcase, decorated with conceptual artwork and photos or scenes from the production.  I wish that they had kept it one disc to a divider side, rather than overlapping the discs one on top of another, two to a side.  I'm always worried that I'll scratch a disc when I have to pry it off from on top of another just to get it out of the liner.    So, all in all, I'm satisfied, but they could have cut out one of five discs and all of the extra toys, and made me just as happy.
B00007KWHO|5.0|Time and Word was a great find back in the late 60's displaying Yes' and their progressive classical style of the time. Especially noted is Richie Haven's No Opportunity Necessary, No Experiency Needed. An old favorite and an album that needed to be re-visited. The entire collection holds its orginal promise so many years on.
0066620996|4.0|Good to Great.  It's such a goog book that it has not only become the best selling business book of all times, but it's title has become a very common phase.  \\"...let's take things from good to great...\\".  \\"...we went from good to great...\\"...etc. and so on.    Yes, a great book.  But I also found Good to Great to be an even better tool.  I've used it a number of times to build new teams, correct teams, build a business and correct businesses.      If you've yet to read it do so.  But approach it as a great book and even better tool and you will get a lot more out of it.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Another classic progressive rock album long lost in the attic and basement to boxes, moves and life in general that deserves to be re-visited. \\"You're Move\\" was a leap in the late 60's and ealry 70's after the acidity of woodstock. Yes one of the curators of such style formulated their expanding sound with others like \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" and the \\"Siberian Kahtru\\" Certainly memories from the Cornell Fieldhouse! Worth another listen after all these years!
B000A2WF3S|5.0|Here is a recording of the Music Bible that is so very different for all others. It's not conventional but it is so not just to be different, to be eccentric. Mr. Kremer goes beyond the usual task of just creating beautiful sound on his violin to reach something far more important. Every movement, every dance is so much alive and refreshing that engages listeners to the music itself.  You do need an open mind and an open ear to enjoy this. I do have many recordings, two of Szeryng, of Tetzlaff, early Milstein, Enescu, and Luca, of this monumental work, yet this recording will stand by itself as far as music and inspiration are concerned.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This Yes album was the pivot point as the etherial artwork of Roger Dean's floating edgeless landscapes evoked visions of another world and realm beyond that of progressive rocks border. 'Roundabout\\" the most memorable piece from this album stands the test of time as does the artwork! Worth a re-visit after all these years.
0131103628|5.0|The Best book to start with. This was my first C Book. I still treasure it. One of the classics still floating around.
0316166685|1.0|I'm not going to repeat much of what has been said already.  In short the writing of this book seemed forced.  The premise, much like the rape in the novel \\"Kite Runner\\" really was just another shock value device in order to give the author an opportunity to ramble on about, quite frankly, a not very interesting childhood.
B000YEUUCK|4.0|I saw this show in Vegas. The Blue-Ray disc captures the magic moment. The  picture quality was very good. The audio Dolby 5.1 audio was a disappointment; thin sounding. Why the audio engineer did not use DTS 5.1 audio? Highest audio resolution? Otherwise the Blue-Ray disc gets only a 4 star rating.
0452289963|5.0|This book has helped me overcome difficulties which have haunted me for a long time.  People may say all they want against it but Tolle is right only if you are ready will you understand its messsage.  Having suffered from severe depression and anxiety I know about reaching out.  I have tried psychotherapy, anti-depressants, healthy diets, exercise, 12 step programs, EA, and positive thinking.  Things did get better but there was always an underlying pain that I could never succesfully overcome.  This book has had an irreversible, positive and liberating effect on all aspects of my life and for that I will always be grateful with Eckhart Tolle.

B000007MVD|5.0|The two Live at the BBC CDs contain live radio broadcasts of The Beatles from March 1962-June 1965. They answer a question a lot of us were asking then: \\"Where did these guys suddenly come from?!?\\" The answer we had before this release were a glossy public relations product. \\"They are John-Paul-George-Ringo... They are Lennon-McCartney...They are true originals!!\\" So we were told. The real truth revealed in these live recordings of the early Beatles is that, musically, the Beatles came from the USA by way of movies and mid-50's to mid-60's records from Memphis, New Orleans, Detroit, New Jersey, New York and more, and became a rocking club dance band by getting the people up on their feet and keeping them up. In short, they rocked, and here are 69 recorded tracks of proof, dating from the days when they played every night in small dance venues. If you are in a hurry, remember, Live at the BBC rocks!      Did I mention they were funny? Although I'm from Memphis, home of the blues, rockabilly and Elvis, I've been a Beatles fan since I was fifteen. In December of 1963 I got my first guitar for Christmas expecting to play folk music. But wait! After Christmas, Memphis pop music radio suddenly began to be full of hip, wry and joyfully energetic Beatle songs. They sang about life as a teenager, our life, in such a way that we \\"got it\\": \\"And when I touch you I feel happy inside, It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide.\\"; \\"And now it's up to you, I think it's only fair...Pride can hurt you, too...apologize to her; because she loves you, and you know that can't be bad...you know you should be glad!\\" They were serious, or at least real, and, they were funny. \\"She was just seventeen. You know what I mean.\\"     The humor of British comedy movies some of us had seen at the local foreign film theaters found its way into my high school with the Beatles. We did not know, at the time, that their mentor in the recording studio was also Peter Sellerscomedy record producer. They were so new to our ears and eyes that we knew nothing but the laugh-out-loud truthful songs and the playful, hip attitude we immediately recognized as cool: our cool... `60's cool. By early 1964 they monopolized the top of the American pop charts.    As revealed in Live at the BBC most performance material was apparently chosen based on their experience of the strength of the song with a live dance crowd rather than its place on the charts. I suspect much of what they played, they had rarely, if ever, heard on the radio, even Radio Luxembourg. This was because at that time, under agreements with the musician's union, English radio was allowed very little \\"needle time\\" to play recorded music. This, by the way, is why the routine about playing \\"Hard Day's Night\\" live was done over the end of the record's playback. These CDs have a lot of songs on them that were probably really new music, a turn-on for The Beatles' radio audience. Other songs seem to be personal favorites of the individual group members, whose taste is revealed in a way that later recordings of their original music homogenizes and conceals, especially George, who sings more lead and comes off funnier and more personable in this release than their records.    In these recordings we find that The Beatles were clearly Elvis fans, and part of the Elvis generation of musicians, just as I am part of The Beatles' generation. On this release, they do a spot on cover of Elvis \\"That's All Right Mama\\", both vocally and instrumentally. Paul really can sound like the early Sun Records rockabilly Elvis, and George could play like a Tennessean. For you younger fans, I am not talking \\"Suspicious Minds\\" Elvis here, I mean the Louisiana Hayride Elvis. The Elvis I saw when I was six years old, playing a set in a parking lot in Memphis for the original grand opening of Mrs. Jacobs' Fawn Laundry-Cleaners at the corner of Alcy Rd. and Bellevue Boulevard (now known in memoriam as _Elvis_Presley_Boulevard). They also have other Elvis material, \\"I've Got a Woman\\" and \\"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\\".    They each had their own taste and vocal specialties. Paul sang high ranging Elvis and Little Richard, and smooth vocals like Peggy Lee's hit \\"Till There Was You\\". George and John loved rockabilly like Carl Perkins and Dorsey Burnett. John loved Chuck Berry rock, and well-written songs by several writers on an apparently song-by-song basis. George had a slightly skewed, zany, humorous taste in songs, including The Coasters \\"Youngblood\\" and the crazier rockabilly, like Carl Perkins' \\"Glad All Over\\". He clearly had a style, but at that time, expressed through covers.    They clearly had not only favorite artists, but also favorite writers, like Jerry Leiber-Mike Stoller and Gerry Goffin-Carole King (who are about the same age as the Beatles and have been mentioned by John in interviews as role models for Paul and him). Many more favorites are revealed on these 2 CDs. I have really enjoyed The Beatles' Live at the BBC. In fact it's ripped and hanging around my neck, stuck in my ears right now. Did I say that there are 69 tracks?! What are you waiting for? Stop reading this and order! You can be listening tomorrow!    Live at the BBC rocks!      John Evans of THE BOX TOPS
B0012K1ILW|4.0|We can sit here and try to criticize her album or call it what is is a brilliant.. This is without a doubt her best work since Mama's Gun.. The edgy and innovative  tracks are mind blowing.. In the R&B scene its hard to stay on the cutting edge but with this album she proves that she is more than a R&B singer but a ARTIST...the track \\"honey\\" is the only watered down downfall of this album the rest of it is amazing..its truly cutting edge work.. From SA'RA MadLib and K.Wiggs...the best of the best...If u were looking for some watered downed sh&* u wont find it here!! This album is on some next level music and probably to innovative for those looking for your typical Jagged Edge or bobby Valentino R&b album..The only thing that is stopping me from give it 5 stars is HONEY...
B0011HOEY4|5.0|American Gangster provides a rare view into a USA that most of us, thank God for that, fail to see.    Frank Lucas, played by Denzel Washington is a Harlem crime lord that grows up in the shadow of a great man, who teaches him great life lessons, but also... to become a criminal.    Frank Lucas is able to amass wealth at the expense of drug addicts, bringing heroin, directly from Asia, during the Viet-Nam war. The key to this story is that the US army supports his efforts and is the means for the distribution and entry of drugs into the USA.    The intricate web of support created by Frank Lucas is under observation by a New Jersey cop by the name of Richie Roberts, played masterfully by Russell Crowe. He is a cop who studies law and passes the bar, something that allows him to understand the consequences of each and every action and makes him a rather interesting character.    Richie Roberts is honest to a fault, not taking kick-backs, even when it appears that no one is looking and that it is in his best interest to do what all other cops are doing. The subject of good versus evil in this movie is a constant force that makes us be riveted on the screen.     Frank Lucas follows rules that protect him, trying hard to NEVER call attention to his person, but falls prey to the vanity of wearing a chinchilla coat his wife purchases for him. His beautiful Puerto-Rican wife fully understands who he is, and yet at some point, you can sense the guilt of never having confronted her husband to MAKE him leave a life that ultimately destroys their marriage. Frank Lucas' mother never questions all she gets from what she suspects is illegal... but at some point tries to save her son by \\"hitting\\" some sense into his life.    A must see, perhaps one of the best movies we have seen lately!

0345444051|5.0|I feel that Childhood's End is the greatest science fiction book ever written. Arthur C. Clarke is in a class of his own, an author who understands the difference between fantasy and science fiction. Childhood's End is his first novel, written in the early 50's, yet it's more relevant now then it was back then.
B000ASSDVA|5.0|This is a very good quality release of the original Cid. This film is the reconquista on an epic scale.
B000002IZM|5.0|I'm not a great fan of movie scores, but this is an exception.  Vangelis' style is perfectly suited to the movie, but the score is very listenable on its own, with cuts of movie dialogue between a few pieces, giving the whole thing unity.  Most of the music is deep and well written, unlike that of other artists filed under \\"new age\\" in the record store, and tracks like \\"One More Kiss Dear\\" -- an homage to music of the 30s and 40s -- show variety of style.  It is worth owning.

We were assigned this book for work and will be meeting to have a \\"mini class\\" about it.  I wasn't too impressed.  It reminded me of a high tech \\"Magic 8\\" ball that could've have gone different ways.  If I were to take the test again, I would probably answer some of the questions differently and get different results.    This might be a good test for someone to take before they are hired depending on the position.

B000TFINY6|5.0|Being shot on Hawaii, you know you are in for a visual treat, and this BD has some of the best HD quality I have seen on blu-ray yet.  If one were to complain, it would be that the studios seem to release the most recent season on TV in HD first, where I would prefer to watch the seasons leading up to it in HD as well.  But I just got done watching this set and have DVR'd all the new eps, so this has been a joy to relive.      If you are a fan of the show and a fan of great visual candy, this is a must own.
0810993139|4.0|I read this book in a couple of days. It's an easy read for an adult, and seems to be just the kind of book that might motivate a pre-teen into reading, as it's interesting, noting lots of things they might be currently going through in their lives, and it has pictures, lots! I highly recommend it.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Typical Civil War romance built around the conceit that a rebel soldier would desert and then traipse through hell to get back to a woman he kissed once and barely knew before he headed off to war. The film would have you believe that's all the motive Jude Law needed. Times sure must have been a lot more innocent back in 1864. Of course, the soldier finally makes it back more than two hours later, only to die in his lover's arms when shot by some Confederate vigilantes. Nicole Kidman's accent is pretty funny: Aussie tries to sound Southern. Didn't work. Renee Zellweger's part is well done as is Philip Seymour Hoffman's. The battle sequences are pretty realistic, I guess. I didn't fight in the Civil War, though. All in all, quite overrated Hollywood hokum, as usual. Too long, too. But worth a rent or a library borrow.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|Goldfrapp is the most amazing group out there today. The way they capture each album in one theme is remarkable. Felt Mountain was haunting & beautiful, Black Cherry was dark & grinding, Supernature was fun & playful. Now, Seventh Tree is dreamy, mystical, & light. Yes, some songs are better than others.. but they're all amazing in their own ways. (Definitely an album for stoners by the way =P) Can't wait to see what their next album will be like! Can you say techno?    A remarkable achievement for a remarkable band to create such a beautiful summer album just in time for spring. \\"Happiness, how'dya get to the happiness...\\"    Highlights: Clowns, Little Bird, Happiness, A&E, Caravan Girl, Cologne Cerrone Houdini
B0002O7XWC|5.0|This is a great movie with a sad ending (very rare), I`ve seen this movie almost 10 years ago, and I was shocked with this ending, and now that I can see it again, it happens the same, but I think that the speech of Nicholson about freedom is timeless, I mean, you can apply it now, in few words, this is a movie to have it in your dvd player, and the soundtrack is fantastic, but its dissapointing that only have 8 songs
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I bought this and the two like Star Wars DVDs as a gift for my father who had seen the remastered versions and wished that they were never made. I wanted to find the original films, just like the VHS tapes I grew up with, for him to add to his collection. There may be a box set out there somewhere with those films but I wanted to be positive of what I got and this was perfect. It contains both the Original and the Remastered on two DVDs which is perfect. No bells and whistles, which is just fine with me. I would suggest this to anyone who wants the unchanged films that we grew up with.
B000YGIIQI|1.0|As a fan or Gordon Ramsey's, I thought this would be an interesting read...NOT!  Extremely boring.  Very little aboout his personal life.  Mostly describes his various restaurants.  I'm halfway thru the book & doubt I will finish it.
1594489505|5.0|No work of fiction, be it film or literature, has ever caused me to feel as depressed, as extraordinarily sad and heart broken, as this book right here. A Thousand Splendid Suns is nothing short of a masterpiece, a work that will be remembered forever as one of the most haunting and beautiful stories ever told. Khaled Hosseini brings back the same magnificent writing style which made his first novel, [[ASIN:1594481776 The Kite Runner (Riverhead Essential Editions)]], such an epic masterpiece. But where The Kite Runner focuses on the internal guilt and suffering of a young Afghan boy who lives his life in exile from his native land, A Thousand Splendid Suns focuses exclusively on women in Afghanistan as they struggle to survive in a land ruled by war, hatred, and bigotry. Told in third person, this new novel tells the story of two generations of Afghan woman though the eyes of Mariam, an illegitimate child forced to marry a cruel husband at an early age and the older of the two, and Laila, a bright young girl whose innocent life is thrown into chaos by war and poverty. The suffering endured by these characters during the course of this 367 page story is simply unimaginable, and the way they somehow manage to endure though even the most horrendous of tortures literally brought tears to my eyes. It took me about two weeks to finish this story, not because it was slow and boring, but because every ten pages I had to put it down out of sheer despair. Every beating these woman took, every act of senseless cruelty that was inflicted upon them, I felt as if I were there. Every joy, no matter how small or how insignificant, every small ray of hope, I enjoyed with them.<br /><br />This is not a story for the weak of heart or those nauseated by depression and sadness; this is a story for those who wish to understand the plight of Afghan women and others across the Arab world. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to understand Afghan history.<br /><br />Re-read value; High.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|I know a lot of people have difficulty with musicals. It is hard to sit and watch a story and have the characters spontaneously burst out into song. I enjoy them; good musicals serve to transport me and I suspend belief and go with the flow, accepting and expecting the characters to begin bursting into song at any minute. We have been fortunate to have a revival, of sorts, of the genre in the past decade or so. Disney Animation has kept up the tradition, but as far as live action musicals, the genre died for a number of years. With the release of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" (love it or hate it, there is no in-between), the genre was reborn. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" led to \\"Chicago\\", leading to \\"Dreamgirls\\", which led to \\"Hairspray\\".<br /><br />Many may not be aware there are actually two kinds of musicals created for Broadway and film. Traditional musicals tell stories and the characters sing songs to express their emotions and to move the story forward. There are also `operatic' musicals. These feature the characters singing throughout most, if not all, of the story. Stephen Sondheim's \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is an example of an operatic musical.<br /><br />Even with the rebirth of the genre, musicals are a difficult sell. \\"Hairspray\\" did well because it featured a bunch of young stars kids and tweens are familiar with. \\"Chicago\\" did well because it received a lot of awards and positive press. But they are difficult sells which is why they probably always feature funny, romantic or upbeat storylines. So, I was surprised to learn \\"Sweeney Todd\\" was going to be made into a film. It isn't particularly romantic, although much of the story has to do with one man's love for his wife. It isn't particularly funny, although there are some moments of black humor. And it certainly isn't upbeat.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp, director Burton's muse) returns to London from prison. We learn Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) sent Todd away on a false charge because he coveted Todd's wife. While he is in prison, Todd's wife dies and Turpin takes in his daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) as his ward. When Todd returns, he meets Ms. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) his former landlord and sets up shop above her meat-pie emporium, where she proudly sells the worst meat-pies in London. Todd intends to use his former profession, barber, to extract his revenge on Turpin, Beadle (Timothy Spall), his accomplice and any one else who gets in his way, including an Italian barber (Sacha Baron Cohen) who may steal some of Todd's business. But as Todd's body count rises, he and Ms. Lovett have a problem. What do they do with all of the bodies? Ms. Lovett comes up with a plan and her meat-pie shop becomes more popular than ever.<br /><br />Directed by Tim Burton, \\"Sweeney Todd\\" seems to have found the perfect director for the subject material. Really, the only other director I can think of who might have been a better choice is Peter Greenaway. Both directors treat the screen as a canvas and create beautiful imagery out of strange and sometimes dark material. Burton brings London, in the mid 1800s, to life, complete with black smoke, dirt and grime. It is hard to imagine people living in this London, Burton's recreation, but that is sort of the point. Unless they were rich and well-off, like Judge Turpin, people struggled to survive. As the film begins, and Todd sings of London being a cesspool of despair, Burton makes us believe in this image of the world capital. This may be the first time I have seen London depicted in such a dirty, grimy state. Other stories have shown this side of London, but those films are usually filled with night scenes. Burton places much of the action in \\"Todd\\" during the day. There seems to be perpetual fogs (both literally and figuratively) hanging over the city, making everyone appear a little more sallow and unhealthy.<br /><br />As soon as Todd returns to Ms. Lovett's shop, she offers him one of \\"The Worst Pies in London\\" offering us more of a glimpse into her life and the life of people living in this city. This moment also helps to establish their relationship. Lovett appears to not recognize her former tenant, he does look quite different, but when he reveals who he is, she states \\"I thought that might have been you.\\" It is Lovett who reveals what happened to his wife and daughter, and this sets Todd on his murderous rampage. But Lovett is also a little attracted to Todd, even in his murderous state. Apparently, there are worse catches in London, the London of mid 1800s anyway. Maybe this is still true today.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is always a strong actor. He may not appear in the best movies (see the third installment of \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" for an example) but he is always at least interesting. In \\"Todd\\", he further explores a character he has been building with Burton over the course of their careers. Sweeney shares similarities with Willy Wonka, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and all of the other characters Depp has played in Burton films. Burton really found his muse when he started to work with Depp and any actor would relish the opportunity to play such strange characters. It is really a match made in heaven for the two men.<br /><br />In \\"Todd\\", Depp also proves he can sing. He isn't a formally trained singer, but he does a remarkably good job with what must be a difficult role. If you look at \\"Todd\\" a little closer, Depp, an American, has played many Brits throughout his career, but to sing with a convincing British accent? That is the challenge and Depp pulls it off very well. I have a feeling this is the aspect of the role that attracted Depp to the film in the first place. He has played very strange men before but never one who sings. And to sing an operatic score? That is an even greater challenge for an actor.<br /><br />As Todd, Depp shows us the rage simmering beneath the surface. It is really amazing to see this anger boiling, threatening to pour out at any moment. But Todd knows he has to keep it in check. He has a plan and if he lets the anger overtake him, his plan is ruined and he will never be able to avenge his wife's death or rescue his daughter. Turpin is his goal; everything else is just a stepping stone to vengeance.<br /><br />He also seems to regard Ms. Lovett as a necessity. He clearly recognizes she is more interested in him, perhaps in a romantic way. While he doesn't seem to share the level of ardor, he recognizes he needs her to keep his plan moving forward, so he plays along, stringing her along until he reaches his goal.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's wife, is not a classically trained singer either and she does a very good job. Ms. Lovett is not quite as desperate as Todd, at least on the surface, but she certainly has things she desperately wants to have happen. She sees in Todd perhaps her last chance at happiness, strange as that may seem given the barber's psychotic tendencies.<br /><br />Has Alan Rickman ever turned in a bad performance? Like Depp, he has appeared in mediocre films, but anytime he appears on screen, he brings the project, good or bad, to life. Because he has played many villains, it was nice to see him play Emma Thompson's husband in \\"Love, Actually\\", a character similar to the role he played in his first big film, \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\". But villains is what he is best known for so, in \\"Todd\\", Rickman plays Judge Turpin, the man who changed Todd's life forever. Turpin's reason? He coveted Todd's beautiful wife and had Todd locked up, taking his daughter in as his ward. The beautiful wife? She couldn't stand the thought of living in Turpin's hands, so she committed suicide. When Todd returns, he sets his eyes on Turpin and would love nothing more than to get him in his barber's chair and give him a very close shave.<br /><br />During the intervening years, Todd's daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) has grown into a beautiful young lady. Naturally, Turpincan not hide his feelings and tries to keep her hidden from the eyes of handsome young men. When this proves too difficult, he decides he will marry her. This man is truly despicable and Rickman manages to portray his desperation in a convincing, fascinating way.<br /><br />Timothy Spall plays Turpin's oily henchman, flouncing around, always at Turpin's side. When he is on his own, he knows his position carries a certain amount of power and prestige, which he isn't afraid to show.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen plays Signor Aldolfo Pirelli, the Italian barber who may provide some difficulty to Todd, stealing some of his business and hindering him from reaching his goals. The moment Cohen appears on screen, everyone recognizes him and the accent he uses is so ridiculous, it is hard to separate the actor from the role and it proves more of a distraction than anything else. It smacks of stunt casting and brings the film down a bit.<br /><br />There has been a lot of comment about the amount of blood in \\"Todd\\". Necks are slashed and a lot of blood flows, but the blood becomes cartoony and comical very quickly. It is ketchup red and flows so freely you can't help but laugh. Also, what else would you expect to see in a film about a barber who uses a straight razor to cut people's necks? In the middle of the film, as Todd works towards his goal, so many people fall victim to his razor during one musical number it is difficult to feel queasy.<br /><br />\\"Sweeney Todd\\" is a very good film.

0307388840|5.0|\\"Atonement\\" is almost precious in the telling, rather like one of young Briony's stories. The World War II saga, of course, ends up being the story of Briony, though that becomes clear only gradually as the novel advances. It is engrossing, marvelously written and dusted with a sharp realism that makes it one of the most moving and transcendant books I've read in a long while.

B000P12LWY|1.0|I've always LOVED the tudors. I know every detail about the Tudor family and can pretty much teach a class on them. So I was really excited about this show!! But alas, my expectations proved futile. It is nicely filmed, but sooo inaccurate!
B0010V4TZU|4.0|THis band delivers the promised product, new music with a somewhat old feel. I took a chance with this music and I'm glad I did.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|To keep it short, I'll break with most of the SOAD fans and say this album, as well as its companion, Hypnotize, contains my favorite music by this band.  I was introduced to the entire discography at once and slowly came to realize that the haunting folk harmonies are what really gets me.  Most reviews I read malign the prominance of Daron's vocals, but I feel exactly the opposite, which also make me hesitant to grab Serj's solo album.  To each his/her own, I guess - but I'm really hoping when they get back from hiatus that they continue in this direction, despite the backlash the band will no doubt incur.

B000ZN8036|5.0|Usually when a film is adapted from a literature counterpart, something major gets lost in the translation: details have to be left out to account for time and pacing, and in doing so, the inner workings of the characters are often lost, left only between the pages of the original format.  Jon Krakauer's novel version of Into The Wild is one such broad case, focusing not only on the lost and somewhat troubled young man that was Chris McCandless, but also the author's own relation to similar feelings of displacement.  It became a muddled justification of youthful angst and the extreme actions one might take to rid himself of such feelings to find a place in this world, and many readers came away from the book writing McCandless off as an overindulged kook.  Thankfully, though, Sean Penn's adaptation cuts out all of Krakauer's commentary and focuses solely on McCandless (Emile Hirsch)'s journey--both the physical, as the settings become characters within themselves, as well as the spiritual and emotional, and in doing so, he allows the audience to get under the man's skin in such a way one can't help but be moved.  No one is just sitting and waiting for McCandless to \\"come to his senses\\" and just go home in Penn's version because he passes no judgment on his protagonist.  In Into The Wild; Penn treats McCandless how the real life inspiration longed to be treated: he just lets him be, and in turn he is able to craft a tragically painful true story into a thing of extraordinary beauty, both in message in addition to imagery.    Penn and Hirsch both seem to \\"get\\" McCandless in a way Krakauer tried to convince himself (and his readers) that he did when he was actually quite far from true empathy.  From the short glimpse of his well-to-do home life and the subsequent narration by his sister (Jena Malone), this dynamic duo sets out on their own journey to explain just why a young man with the world at his feet would abandon it (identification, map, and all) in search for the unknown.  Into The Wild is a celebratory tribute to a man who unfortunately, through all of his courage, never found the comfort of carving out his own place in the world.      Don't be fooled by the \\"man alone in the wilderness\\" angle of Into The Wild; the film is not another Castaway by any means.  While there are definite moments where Hirsch is forced to only act off the trees, rapids, and mountains around him, the most poignant scenes come from his interaction with the few stragglers he meets along his way.  Hirsch is a method actor if there ever was one; he went as far as to lose forty pounds of his already lean frame to accurately depict McCandless' physical features as his journey took its toll on him.  He emotes with the same intensity, his face betraying the rugged outdoorsman persona he put on and instead exhibiting the inner sheer desperation he felt deep down inside to make a connection--even a slight one--with those he encounters.   The sadness on Hirsch's face reads loud and clear in these moments--most notably apparent in scenes opposite widow Ron (Hal Holbrook) and teenage Tracy (Kristen Stewart)-- and plays almost as a commentary on what it takes for some to be happy.  It is ironic then that he acts as such a source of wisdom and enlightenment to all of his new friends.      Hirsch's expressiveness is enhanced by DP Eric Gautier's hauntingly picturesque frames, where the scenery is crisp enough to fool the audience into thinking they, too, can take a deep breath and smell fresh pine air or get hit by a spray of cold white water.  The coupling also serves to capture the harsh oxymoronic nature of a world that is both cold yet majestic and of which McCandless both yearns to be a part yet simultaneously abhors.  It is hard for anyone who has experienced even the slight disenfranchisement of monotonous routine not to feel a deep connection to the way in which Hirsch's McCandless carries himself.  On one hand, he is one part youthful optimist, dreaming of an escape from rigid boundaries placed on him just for being born into the situation that he was; but on the other hand, he is mature beyond his years, having learned that no matter how far you run away or with who or what you surround yourself, you may still be overwhelmed by an unsettling feeling of being alone.
B000001ED1|5.0|Her songs have framed moments in my life.This album in particular.  'St. Teresa' was the first song I ever heard sung by Joan Osborne. I saw her performance of it on late night TV...Amazing-a prayer full of rhythm, smoke, love and the pain of grief observed from a distance. The next song I heard by her was 'Spiderweb' On a radio-again late at night... a dream journey and the open window-dancing around my bedroom. Each<br />song on this album is a touchstone to someplace/someone/sometime. The album's style mixes the richness of blues...hear a little of Bonnie Raitt \\"Streetlights',Some Velvet Underground..at times feels the darker edges of Sarah Mclaughlin emotional hotwire ('Crazy Baby'), The lyrics border Dylan (Man in the 'Long Black Coat' is his) and have the feel of a diary-raw and real. Over a few beers a friend and I decided *Relish* was like the perfect cup of coffee-hot,a dark roast-not to sweet, creamy edges and very satisfying! This to me is her seminal album. O' and it has her radio hit-'One of Us' If you are going to buy one of her albums -this is it. Enjoy!
B000HT386M|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible!  The entire time they are building you up with things that they expect to make you feel emotion, and then it ends with him waking up and the whole thing being a dream and him not learning any lesson at all!  Probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, this is a definite movie NOT to watch!  Totally disgusting, boring and emotion-less, Click is a movie to leave on the shelf!
B0000VCZK2|4.0|All four Alien movies in one package loaded with bonus materials to keep fans of the series well informed and entertained.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Besides the fact that I am madly in love with Jim Sturgess, this movie is utterly fantastic!

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I know many complain about this movie and I can understand where the complaints come from. The movie is shorter and has a more modern twist to it (especially where she runs back and forth in the last scene...that was kind of funny). But throughout the entire movie (due to directing, acting, music, everything) I felt the emptiness, the desperateness of Anne. And when Wentworth realized he may have to marry Louisa, I really felt from the actor the sense of fear, to be entraped, and how in one moment he had lost everything...if only he had not been so careless and sieze the day with Anne.     So even though this particular one did not follow the book word for word, I felt it really portrayed the emotions and frustrations of the characters and the director and all the actors conveyed the entire story very well. I think you have to separate the book from the movie-making and just enjoy the story and how the movie brings you into that world.     The six hour BBC version of Pride and Prejudice and the 2005 Pride and Prejudice (with Kiera Knightley) I both enjoy. They each have their own style and give a different experience to the viewer. I think this 2007 Persuasion is similar in this sense. I hope you guys enjoy it.

B000YENUI6|2.0|I cannot keep my silence on this film. This is a stunning example how good directors (and a good bunch of superb actors in here!) fall prey to bad writers. Who in the world wrote this script? We know, it's Steven Knight, by the way, but how did this thing get filmed? The complete lack of authenticity is practically a trademark of this movie, both psychologically and ethnographically. Why the lead female (Naomi Watts character) so naive, not to say stupid? What is the problem with Cassell's guy - a closet gay with Edipus complex? So, why such an erratic and crazy behavior? What's wrong with his father, how did he stay in business for so long, being such a moron? What is this overblown fantasy on prison tattoos and stuff? None of this has any rational, or, in fact, any explanation. Finally, where did they find these Russians? They are meek caricatures on Italo-American mobsters, and awfully non-believable. And as of far-seeing secret FSB agents - give me a break! It has Ian Fleming SMERSH paranoia written all over it. All this nonsense is filmed beautifully, though, and there is one really good scene in the baths - the two clothed on one naked fight. I'll give it two stars for that.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|If you haven't seen Reds, then you need to, because even though it's now 25 years old, it's still wonderful: well-written, well shot, beautifully directed, and wonderfully acted. The story is still pertinent - and now, 25 years later, seems to be even more poignant. Especially interesting is Beatty's decsion as a director to include interviews with the movers and shakers of the time, and the way they were shot and edited is fascinating...  Don't pass this one up!
B0012K1ILW|1.0|Thank goodness I only paid $10 for this CD. I really want my money back.  It amazes me how record company people write these \\"glowing\\" reviews to boost record sales.  Trust me....save your money on this one. I am a real fan of Ms. Badu but sometimes the truth must hurt. I think it's OK for an artist to grow and to go in different directions but Ms. Badu went into space on this one.  With the exception of \\"Honey\\"-a hidden track at he end of the CD, the CD is hard to listen to from beginning to end. I really like \\"Honey\\" and I was fooled into thinking that the CD would sound like this....I was very disappointed.  Where is the Erykah that we all know and love?  She shouldn't stray too far from what made her an award-winning artist.  Once you loose that chemistry  that put you on the map.....you loose your fan base and a drop in record sales.  Well what can I say.....I'm out of $10 and stuck with a CD that I will probably never play again.

And the grain...  were they shooting this thing on 8mm home movie?<br /><br />Yeah, I know I shouldn't expect much from a 15 year-old film-shot grain-fest, but hey...

B00005JPOO|4.0|This quirky ugly-duckling fable is ideal to see with your 'tween- or teen-aged daughter. Its message of self-acceptance is obvious but not heavy handed, and worth talking about afterward. A modern-day fairy tale, the movie begins with the traditional line \\"Once upon a time...\\" but soon becomes a twisted take on [[ASIN:B00003CX8Y Beauty and the Beast]]. In this case, it's the princess with the curse that turns her ugly. Can she learn to love herself?<br /><br />Well of course she can. The journey that pig-nosed heroine Penelope travels is not at all believable, but then again fairy tales rarely are. If you give yourself over to the uplifting moral -- that everyone is lovable and interesting BECAUSE of their differences, not in spite of them -- then this film is a treat. The energetic cinematography aptly depicts both grime and splendor, the costumes are loaded with detail (I especially loved Penelope's coat with mismatched buttons) and though the script drags at times, it has many unexpected twists and turns that keep things entertaining.<br /><br />Though Christina Ricci does a good job expressing herself behind a snout, the real performance here is that of James McAvoy. Given the task of playing Prince Charming as a washed-up musician with a gambling problem, McAvoy glows with charismatic star power. The shaggy haired, sleepy-eyed actor doesn't look like your typical leading man, but when he is onscreen the movie hums. Catherine O'Hara and Richard E. Grant also click as the wrong-headed parents, and Peter Dinklage is his usual excellent self as a one-eyed reporter.

B00000J2PH|5.0|This was the first album I ever owned; a gift on my 8th birthday, back in 1971.  Now I've bought the cd as a gift for my music-loving 8 year old, and I expect to see her with earpods and the liner notes, singing along just as I did with the album unfolded in my lap as a child.  (well, maybe the \\"earpods\\" were just a LITTLE bigger in 1971:-)).  Real music, heartfelt lyrics, when it's this good it holds up over time.
B0000009S3|5.0|1969 was a great year in rock music. The Beatles issued the legendary 'Abbey Road,' King Crimson released the epic progressive masterpiece 'The Court Of The Crimson King,' and Frank Zappa released arguably his best record to date, 'Hot Rats.'    There are plenty of highlights on this record. All six songs featured here are highlights. But 'Peaches En Regalia' remains the favorite on the record for me. It became a concert staple for Zappa in the 1970s.     'The Gumbo Variations' is one of Zappa's epics, clocking in at just under 17 minutes. You get some great guitar work here from Zappa. He is quite the guitar player, and this song shows it.    Listen for some killer vocals sung by Captain Beefheart on 'Willie The Pimp.' He was one of Zappa's closest friends, so it's no surprise to hear his vocals here.    'It Must Be A Camel' is a nice little ditty. And, it's great way to close out a great record. This song clocks in at just over 5 minutes, and it's one of the shorter pieces on the record.    Zappa's work is legendary. And if you want a great starting place, pick this one up and 'Strictly Commercial: The Best of Frank Zappa.' Also, you'll want to check out his legendary live record 'Sheik Yerbouti.'     This is highly recommended for any rock and roll fan. If you like Zappa even a little bit, you'll love this record. ENJOY!!!
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|The sequel to Elizabeth I has been long awaited only to leave me disappointed.  I give the film 2 stars due to a watered down plot that was drug out and unimpressive. The 2 stars are for Cate Blanchett and the extraordinary display of costume.  They may have well put their money where their mouth is with a better script.
B000002GVZ|5.0|I'm a longtime fan of Carly Simon. I wanted a CD of hers, and I wanted a cheap one with excellent sound. So, 'The Best of Carly Simon' was an excellent solution. This is an excellent Carly set that documents her years on the Elektra label in the 1970s.     You get plenty of hits here. 'Mockingbird,' the duet with her then-husband James Taylor, 'You're So Vain,' 'Attitude Dancing,' and of course 'That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be.' If you want her   '70s chart hits, you'll find most of them here.    And, as I said earlier, Elektra did an excellent job remastering the songs.     If you're just starting your Carly collection, I recommend this set and her 1982 record 'Torch.' If you're a casual fan, than this is all you'll probably ever need.    An excellent set. Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I wanted to like this version of Pride and Prejudice.  The actor playing Mr. Darcy did ok, but Keira Knightly just couldn't portray the sarcastic humor and self-deprecation of Miss Elizabeth Bentley.  The footage of the landscapes, houses, etc... was breathtaking but couldn't quite make up for it's other flaws.     Keira Knightly is just too pretty and happy for this role.  She would have made a better Kitty or Lydia.

Anyway, the story was good and so was the pacing. I really enjoyed the effects and they'll probably look even better once this goes to Blue-Ray, that is if they plan on giving it an HD transfer.<br /><br />I realize many of you haven't had the opportunity to see this yet since it won't come out until March. But let me say I don't think you'll be too disappointed.

After finishing just a bit ago, wanting to keep this elevated feeling, I practiced a little yoga and silently said mantra above to go with breathing.  Wow.  Hope this new awareness lasts a lifetime.<br /><br />The premise that the world is nuts and nature can heal reminds me of a movie I just happened to see after many years called \\"Grand Canyon\\" that had been on my top ten list.  When Kevin Kline and the other characters gaze at the Grand Canyon at the end he says something like \\"It might not be so bad after all\\"...  This movie is thought provoking and an amazing prelude to the book.<br /><br />Ready for the transformation of the world.  I just can't wait...um, or can I?

I can't wait for the next two seasons. the only thing I don't like is the double sided discs Hd on one side standard dvd on the other, it just makes it harder to keep them clean and protected.

B000WZAE0Y|5.0|This is a wonderful fairy tale with such a superb cast of supporting actors and actresses. Ian McKellen was an excellent narrator. Who would have thought Rupert Everett had such a short screen time and Peter O'Toole such a short-lived King? Robert DeNiro (Captain Shakespeare) was subtle and funny. Michelle Pfeiffer as the witch Lamia was amazing. She was ugly and beautiful all in one. Unlike her role in Hairspray, Lamia was the soul of the movie. And her piercing eyes and withered body delivered in the big finale.     As for the visual effects - the flying ship, ever stretching green pastures, the seven ghost princes are created to the finest details. The movie was fun to watch.  The romantic thread, provided by Claire Danes and Charlie Cox, was also refreshing. This movie excelled in shaking off the Hollywood formula but focused on developing a good story.
B00104QSOM|5.0|you have to know what you are getting into when you see this film. pt anderson makes three hour films usually, so take that into consideration. also, this film is a study in evil, power, corruption, money, family, and the list goes on. it is very thematic and depends on cinematography, realistic dialogue, and mood. it could probably be performed in a theater, yet the camera plays such an important role. i recommend that you watch this with the lights off, and try not to get distracted with the computer or cell phone. i know its long, and if you dont like it i understand, but it is definitely worth a shot. i mean, i didnt really like reading charles dickens in high school, but  i certainly gave him a chance.
B00005V1WO|4.0|Considering he's supposed to be 'obsessed with the image' Ken Russell's 'Gothic' is notable for what it leaves to the imagination.<br /><br />Russell is no tyro-hack, he's seen 'the Haunting' and 'the Innocents' and knows an in-tune audience will pick up subtle terrors which may or may not be glowering in dark corners, or in the dull recess of a guilty imagination.<br />Is that a branch scraping the window, or something much more sinister trying to gain access? Russell's anti-thriller gives no answers, even in a rather disquieting epilogue, where the excesses of the previous night are 'explained'<br />Briefly; Don Boyd at Virgin Vision had a literate script on his hands. The core plot had Percy and Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, his pregnant lover Claire, and a snide, repressed biographer, Dr. Polidori all spending a Saturday night at a mansion in Geneva.<br />Now, thought Don, let's see what happens if we give 'em loads of drugs, vats of wine, throw in a thunder-storm, a haunting, some scene-stealing goats, and let 'em go.<br /><br />Now who do we get to direct? Hmm...<br /><br />Russell doesn't disappoint, (he NEVER does, all his films, good or bad, have got something of interest in them) his imagination is at full throttle here.<br />It's frequently a furious and upsetting picture.<br />You can feel that creepiness as the protagonists decide to hold a s&eacute;ance, to call their darkest fears to exist in this world. Russell has a field day illustrating in detail what a houseful of stoned, tortured geniuses are afraid of in the depths of their debasement, with their guard temporarily down.<br /><br />One grotesque tableau follows another but Russell never makes it easy for the rattled viewer. As to what's real and what's not, that's left open, as is the interpretation at the end.<br />Was it all suggestion and hallucination?  This reviewer isn't convinced, and Russell's leaving only the vaguest of clues.<br /><br />It also works on a madcap comedy level. If you sit and think about what you've just seen, you WILL laugh, as with many of Russell's movies.<br /><br />There are many redolent Russell repulses to rejoice in. A gory stigmata, a make-your-own-mind-up abortion, leeches, rats, incest, slime... In fact, if you can think of it, it's probably here, dowsed in Thomas Dolby's vivid score and competing like crazy with all the other fierce imagery.<br /><br />There's an attractive funeral pyre sequence, filmed in the lake district involving Shelley. In his autobiography, Russell indicates this is how he would ultimately like to be 'disposed' of.<br />Good idea, better than cold earth, hope the weather's good so the 40 piece orchestra - assembled by Melvyn Bragg - don't get sodden, as they play Liszt or the Who at full blast!<br /><br />Performances are good; particularly Gabriel Byrne as 'mad' Lord Byron and Natasha Richardson as proto-feminist Mary Shelley (and I'd love to hear the advice mum Vanessa Redgrave gave her about working with Russell. She may proclaim 'the Devils' to be her best film but she never worked with him again!), and I don't think Julian Sands performance as Shelley is as bad as reported either.<br />It's not great by any stretch but I've seen worse, and he IS playing a highly strung (out!?), self-suffering waif-in-a-storm, zonked out of his literary brains.<br /><br />'Gothic' isn't Russell's best film but it is a good one. Compared to the output of most modern Hollywood directors, it's a masterpiece. It has wild imagery, some very tender and moving moments but most of all it has an atmosphere of utter dread, created masterfully by a visionary who knows instinctively how to use light and dark, sound and shadow and Richard Branson's money to make a looney entertainment about some of the worlds most respected and austere literary figures, verbally and physically abusing each other, raising the dead, ripping off their clothes and writhing round in slime.<br /><br />A Ken Russell film, could it be anything else?of Russell's movies.    There are many redolent Russell repulses to rejoice in. A gory stigmata, a make-your-own-mind-up abortion, leeches, rats, incest, slime... In fact, if you can think of it, it's probably here, dowsed in Thomas Dolby's vivid score and competing like crazy with all the other fierce imagery.    There's an attractive funeral pyre sequence, filmed in the lake district involving Shelley. In his autobiography, Russell indicates this is how he would ultimately like to be 'disposed' of.   Good idea, better than cold earth, hope the weather's good so the 40 piece orchestra - assembled by Melvyn Bragg - don't get sodden, as they play Liszt or the Who at full blast!      Performances are good; particularly Gabriel Byrne as 'mad' Lord Byron and Natasha Richardson as proto-feminist Mary Shelley (and I'd love to hear the advice mum Vanessa Redgrave gave her about working with Russell. She may proclaim 'the Devils' to be her best film but she never worked with him again!), and I don't think Julian Sands performance as Shelley is as bad as reported either.   It's not great by any stretch but I've seen worse, and he IS playing a highly strung (out!?), self-suffering waif-in-a-storm, zonked out of his literary brains.    'Gothic' isn't Russell's best film but it is a good one. Compared to the output of most modern Hollywood directors, it's a masterpiece. It has wild imagery, some very tender and moving moments but most of all it has an atmosphere of utter dread, created masterfully by a visionary who knows instinctively how to use light and dark, sound and shadow and Richard Branson's money to make a looney entertainment about some of the worlds most respected and austere literary figures, verbally and physically abusing each other, raising the dead, ripping off their clothes and writhing round in slime.    A Ken Russell film, could it be anything else?
6305078491|5.0|*Vampyr* is full of stark and terrifying images, and the atmosphere of eeriness and illogic approximates the feel of a nightmare better than any horror film... That's not knocking other horror films; most horror films are out to tell a story, but *Vampyr* is about images and atmosphere and in the process creates something truly haunting.
B000SFJWLU|2.0|The music is fine - just straight up no frills metalcore with some solos. Nothing new really, but well done. The vocals are not bad either. But the lyrics...oh, man, I don't even know where to begin. They are just so terrible, that you start feeling bad for the rest of the band. There are bands that you can enjoy and could care less about what the hell they are screaming about. Not with these guys, you can hear every single dumb syllable that comes out of the singer's mouth and it's like someone is constantly slapping you in the face with stupidity.
0452289963|5.0|The book was brand new and came quickly. I was pleased. I think the shipping charge was too high, however.
0812975219|4.0|This book has a lot of very strong opinions and some excellent insights.  The discussions of the role of probability and economics are very interesting. The comparisons of trading styles are also very useful. However, his own very strong opinions makes one wonder what black swans he might be missing.
0525948023|5.0|AMAZING... I am slowly reading this book due to the nature of its content.  Each page holds pearls of wisdom and nuggets of ideas that need time to digest before I go on.  Other books on spirituality have been interesting and enlightening, but, in many ways for me just building blocks. I look forward to being apart of Oprah's on-line class with Eckhart Tolle (more than 500,000 persons world wide have signed up to participate).  I have also chosen to be part of a book club to discuss and delve deeper into the thoughts and ideas contained therein.   This book, at this time, in this world is like a road map or a recipe for those of us interested in more than just going through the motions of life; in making a change.  History will show Eckhart Tolle  as an important facilitator for a movement of change; his purpose in life seems to be to  \\"show us the way\\" and provide some \\"missing pieces\\"  for so many who have been trying to find the actual road to a better way with positive purpose. Presently our world seems so full of hate, violence, and greed.  If this book can wake up just some of us to a different way of thinking, then there is HOPE.  2008 will be an exciting year of change!

B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol was the penultimate punk rocker.  Whether he was really a punk or just effected that role(like most of them), his snarl and raspy Brit voice could do Elvis better than the great one himself.  His driving rhythms were non pareil.  If you saw any of his videos, then you saw a visualization of the great Idol at work, and this album is his magnum opus, a collection of his finest works.  Enough said...
B0000AXE8I|2.0|this is the second movie in the Matrix saga.it chronicles the  continuing fight of the resistance to free humanity from continuing  enslavement from the machines which keep reality hidden from them.this  is not what i would call good movie.it is a collection of repetitive  and ridiculous unrealistic fight scenes,coupled with an incoherent  storyline.plus there a lot of 'profound' sayings which aren't really  profound at all.then you have characters speaking in riddles which are  gibberish half the time.at time,i felt i was being preached a  philosophy lesson.My vote for The Matrix Reloaded is a 2/5
B000VDDDY6|3.0|I read the reviews for this set and, as a collector, I found many of the complaints, unsettling: poor package design, excessive echo in the opening voiceover by Shatner and problematic discs.    When I received the set, I thought I had dodged a bullet - it arrived unbroken and complete. I popped in the first disc and watched an episode. I thought the video and audio were stunning - minus the opening voiceover. I decided to watch a second episode... About half way through, the video paused repeatedly. Then, started running without audio. The audio stumbled back on, but, was totally out of sync with the video. This continued for several minutes before the disc resumed normal playing. I decided to quit for the night.    This morning, I loaded another disc and attempted to play the second episode. My player reported that it could not play the disc and gave me an error code. I have had the player for three months and previously, had not run into a single issue with my other 15 discs - NO ISSUES! From this, I have to conclude that the HD side of these discs have problems. I am now faced with the decision of whether to send the set back and be without OR pay a ridiculous price for the functional standard DVD set (with HORRIBLE packaging)!
B000O77SRC|5.0|wow.i forgot how great this movie is.this movie has it all.this is one  thrill ride of a movie.all you need to know is this:terrorists have  taken control of a high rise building and have hostages.the only thing  standing in their way is one man:John McClane(Bruce Willis.)a New York  cop who just happens to be In L.A. too visit his wife for Christmas.  Willis puts in a great performance as McClane,who becomes a one man  army.this movie is so much fun,you won't care(or have time to care)  about realism.this movie raised the bar for the action genre.it doesn't  take long to get going either,and you'll wonder where the tow hours  went.if you're an action junkie,and you haven't seen this movie,what  are you waiting for?for me Die Hard is a 5/5
B000MZHW40|5.0|Blood Diamond is a great action-packed film directed by Edward Zwick. The leading actors are Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou. As pure entertainment, the film is quite action-packed and exciting.<br /><br />  Though this is a work of fiction, the film brings up very important issues about exploitation in the diamond industry. The film will inspire you to read about blood diamonds and to become more informed about the ethics of resource extraction.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|i found this concluding chapter of The Matrix trilogy much better than  the second installment and probably better than the first one.this one  was more coherent and made more sense story wise.plus there aren't as  many drawn out repetitive,and absurd fight scenes.this movie is  actually pretty exciting,particularly during the showdown between Zion  and the sentinels.but this movie,like the other two,borrows heavily  from other sources,most notably the Alien franchise,and the biblical  parallel is once again very strong.there are some logic gaps,and things  that don't make sense,but at least the story wasn't as muddled.to  me,this was the most satisfying of the trilogy.for me,The Matrix  Revolutions is a 3.5/5
0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah lived in a village in Sierra Leone until he was 12.  He played soccer, listened and danced to hip hop and reggae, and recited speeches from Shakespeare to his neighbors around the fire at night.      At the age of 12 his village was invaded while he and his brother were away, and he never saw the rest of his family again.  He wandered around with a group of boys avoiding the warring factions but was finally drafted into the army to fight the rebels.  He became a ruthless boy soldier at the age of 13 and stayed with it till he was 15.  His description of the fighting and his own lack of remorse when he killed people is horrifying and moving.      When he was 15 he was taken away by some people from UNICEF and put into a rehabilitation camp outside Freetown.  The counselors worked with him for months and he fought them off, first physically, then by withdrawing from them emotionally, but finally through his own sensibility and intelligence and their love he was won over and was offered the chance to testify before the UN.  The counselor's repeated assurances that it wasn't his fault and his gradual understanding that what they said was true was the most moving part of the book.      He had more travails after that but wound up through his own efforts living with a new family, going to high school and college and writing this book.    Ishmael Beah is a remarkably good writer.  His description of his life is matter-of-fact, making the horror show through more clearly than any number of Anguished Adjectives would have done.  Not many wasted words, and the language gently includes some African attitudes and expressions that give a real sense of the people.  This is a very important book.
B000O78KW4|3.0|of the first three Die Hard movies,i liked this,the third one,the  least.i think mainly because there wasn't very much action,but i also  didn't like the story.plus,i found the movie too long.it wasn't any  longer than the first two movies,but i didn't feel the pacing was very  good.plus,this movie doesn't really do a lot to distinguish itself from  other movies of the genre.i did like Sam Jackson in his role as a  shopkeeper who ends up helping John McClane.i thought he was funny and  a good fit for Bruce Willis.i also thought Jeremy Irons was good as the  man villain.Graham Greene is good too,in his role as a cop.anyway,this  isn't a bad movie by any means,but it's just not as good as number  two,and nowhere near as good as the first one.for me Die Hard:With a  Vengeance is a 3/5
B000AXWV40|5.0|Musicologists love to debate where Jimi Hendrix may have ventured had he not tragically died in 1970.  It is true the master was going to work with Miles Davis, and that would have been monumental.  It is worth exploring the possibilities of a foray into the newly developing funk scene as well, and nobody came closer to carrying on the Hendrix legacy than Funkadelic's guitar wizard Eddie Hazel, a true contemporary of Hendrix and Jeff Beck.  Unfortunately, he has not enjoyed the mass appreciation of other guitar gods, and that's a crime.<br />  \\"Maggot Brain\\" opens with the title track, a simple rhythm guitar backing Hazel in a ten minute opus that belongs in the rock god pantheon.  George Clinton wisely lets Hazel shine, knowing genius when he hears it.  If \\"Maggot Brain\\" isn't enough, Hazel soars throughout, welding funk with metal and making it work.  It makes you wanna boogie and play air guitar at the same time, which would look really stupid, but that just proves how well the two styles of hard rock and funk can work together.<br />  As with great jazz musicians like Wes Montgomery, John Coltrane and Charlie Christian, to name a few, it's a shame more young black musicians aren't interested in making real music, preferring instead to rap over minimalist backgrounds and completely ignore their musical ancestry that invented blues, rock and roll, and jazz.  \\"Maggot Brain\\" belongs in every collection.
B00000K19E|3.0|i'm not sure what the big deal is about this movie.i mean,it borrows  heavily from other sources,such as the bible and Star Wars,among  others.the gist of the story is that the world people see around them  is isn't real.it's actually a construct made by machines.Humanity is  actually enslaved by the machines.but there is one man who can free  humanity.that man may be a hacker who goes by the name Neo.Neo is  portrayed by Keanu Reeves.also playing prominent roles are Carrie Ann  Moss and Laurence Fishburne.but in my mind,it is Hugo weaving who  steals the show as the enigmatic agent Smith.i will admit the movie has  some great special effects and some spectacular fight scenes.but some  of the moves in the fights are really silly and are not what i would  call practical.also,a lot of the movie is slow moving,and the  characters don't behave in logical ways.still,the movie does have its  good moments.there are some genuine moments of high tension.this is the  first of three movie in The Matrix franchise.for me,the first movie in  the series is a 3/5
0385338724|4.0|Lexi Smart has an entry-level position at a carpet company.  She has frizzy hair and crooked teeth.  She has no sense of style, and she's dating a guy whose nickname is none other than \\"Loser Dave.\\"  Her father died and, the night before his funeral, she slips on the street, right in front of an oncoming cab.  When she awakens, it is 2007 (instead of 2004), she looks gorgeous (hair, teeth and other body parts have been \\"enhanced\\"), she owns designer clothes and handbags, and is married to a drop-dead gorgeous multimillionaire.  She is also one of the top dogs at the carpet company, and rules over a whole department, the one where all of her friends work.  Lexi has lost her memory.  She doesn't remember the last three years of her life.  How on earth could this happen, and how did she become a beautiful fashionista with an important job?  Slowly, she uncovers the mysteries regarding this shaded piece of her life, but things truly spin out of control when she meets Jon, a handsome architect who stops at nothing to win over her affections... again.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of this author.  The Shopaholic series is one of my favorite book collections out there.  Sophie Kinsella is wonderful.  She has such a light and sassy sense of humor, and I love her writing style.  Remember Me? isn't exactly out of this world or even original for that matter (the plot is vaguely similar to the movie 13 Going on 30 with Jennifer Gardiner), but Kinsella makes it a fun romp worthy of reading.  I devoured this book in a single sitting.  There's nothing better than a great British chick-lit when you're in the mood for something light, romantic and fun, and Kinsella never fails to deliver in this area.  Remember Me? will no doubt become yet another notch in the author's bestseller post.  You're in the mood for a fun, sassy comedy?  Pick this one up.  Not as hilarious as the Shopaholic books, but it is just as entertaining as Kinsella's standalones, The Domestic Goddess and Can You Keep a Secret?a Secret?
0790731924|4.0|to me,this is a better movie than the first one.it's got much more  action,it's more exciting,and faster paced.it's also funnier.the  characters are better defined,and the storyline is better.i also think  this movie had a better villain than the first.this time,along with  Danny Glover and Mel Gibson,Joe Pesci is along for the ride,and  provides some laughs.also,there is more banter between Gibson and  Glover.the movie is just more compelling all around.the first one was a  bit slow at times,but not so with this one.for me,Lethal Weapon 2 is a  3.5/5
0452289963|5.0|There are some books that simply are worth reading.  Whatever your backround, your issues, your life style or profession-there are things in this book that you already know and are put into the written word.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|this ,the 4th installment of the Die hard franchise is easily the most  thrilling and action packed.however,logic and reality are thrown out  the window for the action scenes.if you like your action with a little  bit of realty and logic,you won't like this movie.but for me,the movie  was so fun,i didn't care.but beyond being just a slam bang action  thrill ride it's also very relevant and thought provoking.if the  technology that society almost totally depend on were to completely  crash,how would you react,and hoe would the general public react.this  movie gives one hypothetical example of the answer to that  question.it's great to see this installment is geared more towards our  techno savvy contemporary audience.but it's also still great for  audiences that grew up with the franchise. not only is this a thrilling  and thought provoking movie,but it's also very funny,possibly the  funniest of all four movies.for me,Live Free or Die Hard is a perfect  5/5 for sheer excitement alone.the rest is just gravy.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|As a dedicated Anglophile, I liked this one.  It's a fun movie.  Light-hearted romance.  Nice photography. My son recommended it to me.  I rented it, then liked it enough to buy it.  The theme of trading houses (and lives to some extent) gave the movie that little something extra that kept it from being boring.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I viewed this movie for the first time last night, and I was overwhelmed by the uniqueness and beauty of the music in this film.  I went out and picked up the soundtrack today, and know I will listen to it many times in the coming months.  Thanks to those responsible for creating this music!  It is truly beautiful.
B00020JPI6|5.0|the first family of Music and this compilation captures all of the Classics from Motown through Sony. the vocals and harmony and the songs capture the Jackson 5/Jacksons fully in there zenith Musical Glory. this is the best overall Compilation on the Jacksons. the Jacksons are Music Royality period. Great songs, Great times and memorys. so many classics.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Erykah's subject matter this time around is concentrated on social ills, drug addiction, and self determination in the ghettos. Very creative and insightful. The album is somewhat dark but not everything can be candy and roses. The album's masterpiece is \\"Telephone\\" which was written for the late Hip Hop genius James Yancy aka J Dilla. She wrote it the day after the funeral. This album is Pt. 1 of a 2 album series. I can't wait for the other one. Hopefully this album will inspire other artists to be creative rather than putting out the same sounding crap over and over again.  P.S. \\"Neo-Soul\\" is a term created by the corporations in order to seperate and divide the generations. There is no such thing as \\"Neo-Soul\\". Its all Soul.
0142437611|3.0|It hurt to read this book. Once a son, now a father, it is painful to see how poor this relationship can be. Who is correct here: father or son? What is clear here? Hatred.
0060005424|4.0|Lirael is an amazingly complex book that switches back and forth between two characters. (Sam and Lirael).  The beginning is dark, as Lirael is considering committing suicide!  The beginning is quite slow, but once you start going and finish the book and re-read the beginning, it's fascinating!   But, if you're a young reader who only reads books that start right away (the action) this book is not recommended for you.  Take it from a 15-year old teen that's into metalcore to buy this book.  If i bought it and loved it....you will too.  Oh, and I recommend that you read Sabriel before this book in case you're not into the zombie idea or something...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|You really need to see this movie.  I've been a closet environmentalist for years so I wasn't completely suprised by the information contained in the movie.  What I was suprised about was how engaging Al Gore was in his delivery of the information; he made it easy to follow along and did a fine job of engaging the viewer.  Even with my pre-existing knowlege of many of these issues this movie reached out grabbed me from beginning to end.  My husband who quite literally detested Al Gore prior to this movie has found a great deal of respect for him since viewing this movie and has actually been more active in trying to be more environmentally friendly.  I wish more people would put aside their political issues and take an active role in protecting the Earth and ultimately our future.  I've read reviews from the naysayers but generally they are the views of people who have done little or no research into the problem or who have been mislead by petroleum funded scientists.  I would also state that as a county we would be stronger if we had alternative fuel options and didn't need to rely on hostile countries to supply our needs.  I hope at the end of the day that whether you believe in global warming or not you err on the side of caution and realize if your wrong there are no second chances......
B000GFRDN6|5.0|For Steve Miller fans and classic rock fans in general, this remastered edition of the classic FLY LIKE AN EAGLE album is a must have. Not only is the sound quality vastly superior to the original CD release but the bonus disc has a very nice interview and a fabulous 1997 concert video that magnifies the beauty of this classic record. If you haven't previously owned FLY LIKE AN EAGLE or if you already own it on compact disc and are content with the original, you must buy this release. This version should be the standard for all remastered versions of classic rock albums.
B000004286|5.0|I have always enjoyed this soundrack so I finally ordered it and can honestly say I enjoy listening to it while driving.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|What I knew of Kenny Wayne Shepherd prior to this wasn't exactly to my taste. It was good - no doubt about that. He is great guitar player. But his music was a bit too tough, too electric for my taste.  As I never give up on good musicians, I looked and listened into this one - man, was I blown away!!!!  The concept is quite simple, Kenny Wayne together with his friends Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon (of Double Trouble) visits the players he loves and adores and joins them to create this country blues jam-fest. It's improvised, just taped the way it was, but that's what makes it so special.  Watching and listening to him play together with Etta Baker in her kitchen, or with Buddy Flett in a graveyard as a tribute to the late and great Leadbelly. With Cootie Stark performing U-Haul. Waiting for BB in his own hometown - ooooh these solos just hit me! WOOW!  No matter which track you pick, there's so much love for the music jumping off the disc - amazing.   And even for non-blues fans, this is something to watch. The fun these terrific musicians have playing together, sharing their craft and the joy will jump over to you, who knows, maybe in the end even turning you into yet another blues fan like me.  It comes as a two disc set. The dvd is my favorite, but sometimes when you just want to listen to the music, then you pick the cd.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|I saw it in my home but can honestly say if I had seen it at the theater I would've felt it was money well spent.  While not normally my choice in movie; it was gritty, disturbing, and definately violent, overall, well acted and directed.  We started watching this after the children went to bed and I was so tired I thought I might fall asleep; no worries, I was glued to the screen till the very end.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I saw the original STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE when it first came out in 1977. I rated it then as I do now an unconditional five stars.  I can't comment on the transfer quality of this particular DVD release as I own so many copies of this episode on RCA video disk, VHS tape, Pioneer Laser Disk and various issues of DVD that I get them mixed up.<br /><br />My ultimate STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE experience was my original screening in a great sound and extra large screen theater in CT in 1977. We simply were just not accustomed to that kind of sci-fi in 1977. It was as new and exciting a film as 2001 was in the late 60's. Shortly after seeing LOGAN'S RUN with my wife and being terrribly dissapointed with that film we went to see STAR WARS at the same theater. When we saw the opening of STAR WARS and the Imperial ship went overhead, my wife said \\"You can close your mouth now!\\", which just about sums it up.<br /><br />My second best STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE film experience was when I had the opportunity to screen an excellent 16 mm copy in a private theater in scope and beautiful color. It too was grand. I hope to purchase a HD-DVD or BLUE RAY copy of this film and see it on my 52\\" HDTV after the format battle is waged and won.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Sweeney Todd on Broadway was never a hit and apparently the movie is not doing so well domestically BUT the film is absolutely brilliant from the production to the acting and oh that score! I have read some of Amazon's reviews and I must say many customers don't know what a genius Stephen Sondheim is.  He is the voice of the American musical.  Listen to the score of Sweeney Todd. It is complex, tuneful and operatic.  No, it is not popular music but it is music that is integrated into the characters and their tragic downfalls. Johnny Depp, Helena-Bowen-Carter Alan Rickman are all superb in their respective roles.  The production is impeccable.     Tim Burton and Stephen Sondheim lowered the scope of the play.  On stage, it was Brecthian world view. The film reduces that scope and I do miss it but, the film  is so personal that the tragic ending seems all the more touching.  2007-2008 was a banner year for the screen musical.  Hairspray came mid-summer, which brought the musical back to the joys of the golden age of the musicals, and then came Sweeney Todd, a breakthrough musical that, in my opinion, is one of the top ten ever made.  Buy it!!!

6305128952|4.0|So Much To Learn About Life...    This is such an insightful story about life, one's decisions about the things that should matter to us, and how relationships such as marriages often are not \\"until death do us part\\" but rather are stepping stones to future growth, or holding places for us until the time comes that we must decide to move on or forever stay stuck in mediocrity.    What a pity then that the hero who was doing such a good job of teaching then fails to teach the young girl that one must take responsibility for one's actions in life.  Instead he encourages her to go into denial and refuse to accept the fact that it was her own lack of maturity and good sense that damaged her for life.  Even the horses should have known  better than to get goaded into tragedy like they were, but alas even horse sense was lacking here.    Let's hope all the positive lessons this movie can teach us will stay with us.  It truly was a moving tale, and a beautiful love story as well.
B000ETQPYM|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book after seeing the movie trailer with Hilary Swank.  It looked like a great, original story.  So, I was very dissapointed when I got into it.  I understand that poor Holly lost her husband, yet she is so self-centered and wishy-washy throughout the story that it substantially took away from the uniqueness of the \\"gift\\" left behind to her by her dearly departed husband.  This is really just OK, and sort of reads like a young adult novel.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Just how far does this rabbit hole go? Lost season 2 take you back to the island somewhere in the south pacific to those 48 survivors of Oceanic flight 815. There are twists and turns in every episode. And, you don't have to wait very long to find out where that hatch leads to. I was surprised that the writing on this season seems to get better and better. This DVD collection is a must have for anyone who likes a great t.v. show.
0060589469|5.0|this book is amazing.  some of the ideas are hard to agree with, although plenty of reason is given for each thought.  although the philosophy is drawn out, it is far easier to understand- pirsig explains the thought proccess with which the philosophies arose, instead of just spouting off difficult and ludicrous sounding ideas.    do not go into this book expecting a novel.  there is a plot, and a good one at that, but everything is encased in philosophy.  it is all fascinating, even to a new comer in the area like me, but you simply cannot expect it to be a story you read straight through.
B000065U1N|5.0|Riveting, horrifying, nonstop action.  Painted a too real picture that  made sleeping the next evening difficult.
B000HA4WTS|5.0|The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a pretty decent action flick.  It's about a teenager (who looks like he's about 30) who constantly gets in trouble for racing cars against other people.  So his mother ships him off to Japan and to be with his father, who was in the Navy and doesn't take any nonsense from his son.      However, his son must not be too bright, seeing as how the father has to explain to the boy time and time again he won't put up with his car racing hobby (and when the father eventually found out anyway but the son tried to explain why he was racing didn't make much sense to me) and yet, he continues to race anyway.      Throughout the movie, the teenager has to deal with a tough Japanese gang who not only races cars, but doesn't tolerate a lot of garbage from people.  This of course leads to some fighting scenes later on.    The actual car races are fun to watch, and there's a lot of storyline focus on the races themselves, which makes this movie an action-packed quality adventure.  I like it, and I'm sure most people who like action and car racing will feel the same.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|Apparently, I am a rareity here having loved Tift since her 1999 duets album with The Two Dollar Pistols.  For those of you new to her, a (very) brief and mostly musical history.  That album is a very classic country cover album with Tift's sweet soprano soaring gracefully next to John Howie's rough barritone.  In 2002 she released her solo debut Bramble Rose, which went to a very 70's Gram Parson's and Emmylou Harris side of country and was produced by Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams).  Two years later she teamed with George Drakoulias to record Tambourine which went off in a much more bluesy/R&B direction.  In 2005 she released the live cd Home Is Loud and 2007 saw the issuing of her Austin City Limits appearence on DVD.  She was dropped by her label Lost Highway and moved to Paris, not sure if she was going to stay in the business.  Then she wrote all the songs for this album, came home and released them on Fantasy.<br />With all that out of the way, how does this album stack up?  Sonically speaking, she returns to the same overall sound as Bramble Rose, but pushes past what she did on that album.  The lyrics are much more personal than they have been on her earlier albums, but she retains her sense of incident based storytelling.  In a way she is almost the anthesis of Neko Case.  Where the red headed torch singer wraps her life in dark images that pull the everyday into the realm of fantasy, Tift grounds her images in incidents so everyday that often the lyric passes before you realize the full weaight of truth behind it.  Her voice here is sweeter than it has been on previous albums, fuller and more mature, with a control of her higher registers that sometimes came off as a bit squeaky before.  While Tift does play both the piano and guitar, her voice is a true instrument of rare value, as fine, delicate and strong as a well cut diamond, as as capable of refracting a multiplicity of colors.<br />Oh, and for those who were wonder, she is an absolute must see live.  Her voice soars to the rafters and fills the room in a show that is half glorious music and half a brilliant revivial show for the human spirit.  And that is the element that she brings to each of her songs, both vocally and lyrically, a simple and elegant knowledge of the messy beauty of her own very human spirit, and by extention, each of ours.ce soars to the rafters and fills the room in a show that is half glorious music and half a brilliant revivial show for the human spirit.

B0002NRQTS|3.0|\\"Presto\\" has never been one of my favorite Rush albums.  Not that it is bad, but much of the material here, just seems mediocre in light of the band's past achievements.  I'll start out with my favorite track \\"Presto\\" which is acoustic based and the longest song on the album at close to 6 minutes.  This is prime 80's era Rush and a great little song.  Other tracks that I like include \\"Red Tide\\", \\"Superconductor\\", and \\"Available Light\\".  In fact I really like the 2nd half of this album quite a bit better than the first half.  The single \\"Show Don't Tell\\" is probably one of my least favorite of all Rush singles.  The album is not one that Rush fans tend to gravitate to, and most of this material was dropped from the band's live set years ago (although \\"The Pass\\" was resurrected on the band's last outing.  If you are a fan \\"Presto\\" is worth owning, but this would be way down my list of recommended albums for starters.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Great movie and want to buy on Blu-Ray but only DVD is going to be released earlier. Althoug I assume that Blu-Ray will come out later, I cannot wait that far so probably will buy the DVD first. But sad that I may have to replace into Blu-ray later which means I will end up with buying two discs.  I know that HD-DVD will be gone, but why they are not releasing Blu-Ray and dvd at the same time? I wonder.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|This was my first radiohead cd.  To be completely honest, the first listen didnt impress me much. 15 step was catchy, and overall a pretty good song, but none of the rest really got to me....at first.  But, like all good music, it has to grow on you.    This is one of those rare cd's i can listen to start to finish and enjoy every last second.   Absolutely brilliant.  Its got it all.  Listen to nude or videotape and compare to bodysnatchers or jigsaw falling into place.  No matter what mood your in, this cd has a song for you.    Odd as it sounds, this cd will make you happy.    I am now a radiohead fan, and have since buying this album about 15 days after it came out, have bought OK computer and the bends [both are brilliant].    The album artwork is splendid as well. The cd wouldnt be the same without it.  Be warned:  You are not buying a jewel case cd. You are ordering a sort of \\"make your own cd\\" packaging.  I find it interesting. The way i see it sounds strange so i just wont include it.  Just make sure you have a spare jewel case around. You can usually get them at cd shops.    Basically, if your a new radiohead fan like i was, and your not feeling it, give it a few more listens, and a bit more time. It might just not be for you. But i believe this album to be gold. I will be listening to it for a long, long time.

B0001Z363W|4.0|Black Label Society frontman Zakk Wylde named this mostly unplugged album \\"Hangover Music\\" because it's an album which makes for a very easy listen. And if you have a hangover, you're probably not going to want to listen to any other kind of music. Imagine 2003's \\"The Blessed Hellride\\" being your night of drinking, and this album is an easy-to-swallow Aspirin.<br /><br />There are a few crunchy riffs here and there, and a guitar solo also flares up in most of these songs, but for the most part, this is a completely new side of Mr. Wylde. The docile acoustic guitar strums, occasional dabbling in piano, and Zakk's deep, almost flinty crooning and passable singing voice make these songs very laid back, harmless, somewhat pretty, and even a bit bluesy at times. The lyrics aren't very harsh, either. Zakk omits words like \\"Crawl through the things that eat your flesh\\" in favor of inoffensive lines, which at times (e.g. \\"Woman, don't you cry\\") are downright sweet-hearted (aww, I know)!<br /><br />\\"Hangover Music, Vol. 6\\" opens with \\"Crazy Or High.\\" Aside from a surprisingly fast and wild guitar solo in the middle, this is a very relaxed song, with a slowly thumping drum beat. \\"Queen Of Sorrow\\" features a couple of semi-heavy licks, a beeping bass line, and another careening solo. \\"Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow\\" is one of the prettier songs on here, and has a piano, proper singing, guitar feedback, and a grumbling bass. \\"Takillya (Estyabon),\\" which has light, nimble-fingered guitar noodling, is equally as beautiful, though it's just an interlude. \\"She Deserves A Free Ride (Val's Song),\\" is very melancholy, and almost country music-esque; \\"Damage Is Done\\" includes ambient piano keys and a catchy sing-along chorus; \\"Layne\\" is a sweet, touching tribute to the late Alice In Chains singer who had a big influence on Zakk; \\"Woman Don't Cry\\" is a tender love song (yeah, you read that right!) And lastly, the cool thirteenth track, \\"Whiter Shade Of Pale,\\" stands as the album's only piano driven ballad.<br /><br />\\"Hangover Music, Vol. 6\\" isn't as mesmerizing as, say, Opeth's \\"Damnation,\\" (because Zakk's voice isn't as great as Mikael Akerfeldt's), but it is still a darn good album! Highly recommended listen if you're a fan of Zakk Wylde/Black Label Society, if you like gentle, easy listening music, or if you spent last night on a binge.o driven ballad.<br /><br />\\"Hangover Music, Vol. 6\\" isn't as mesmerizing as, say, Opeth's \\"Damnation,\\" (because Zakk's voice isn't as great as Mikael Akerfeldt's), but it is still a darn good album!

B0010X745K|5.0|It's almost like some of you people want to just give away the whole thing. STOP even hinting toward it, or giving opinions or \\"he should have waited...\\" I mean, if the original reviewers had kept their mouths shut when the film first came out, I would have been broadsided by this one, but they all had to babble on and on about the \\"shocking ending\\". Seriously- if someone who has not seen it went and read each one of these reviews, they could probably figure it out. Just zip it already!
B00005JPOO|4.0|\\"Penelope\\" is about a girl who was born with the nose and ears of a pig, so I think the message it's sending to the audience is obvious: you have to love yourself no matter what others think. This isn't to say that the film is bad or even that it doesn't work; in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoyed it. \\"Penelope\\" is a delightful, charming little fantasy, full of humor and heart with just a touch of magic to top everything off. I mean that as more than just a corny phrase for a movie review--the general look of the film has a slight surrealistic edge, so slight that at times it's hard to pick up on. But it's there, believe me. It's most noticeable in the design, color, condition, and population of the city, a place never directly named but somewhat reminiscent of London. A somewhat unrealistic location requires a somewhat unrealistic character; we find this in Penelope Wilhern (Christina Ricci), a sweet and charming young girl from a rich family who's having a lot of trouble finding a husband.    There's a very good reason for this. Apparently, her great grandfather--a blue-blooded man of wealth and distinction--was secretly having an affair with a servant girl. When he decided to completely forget about her and marry the rich woman he was arranged with, the servant girl killed herself by jumping off a cliff. The servant girl's mother, who practiced witchcraft, retaliated by placing a curse on the entire Wilhern family: every daughter would thereafter be born ugly, doomed to spend their lives as lonely social outcasts. The curse could only be broken if one of the daughter's own kind--presumably a blue-blooded type--learns to accept her for who she is. The Wilhern family was lucky for many years because, by some strange twist of fate, they produced only sons (the one exception was the result of an affair, so the curse had no effect). Then came Penelope, the daughter of the elite and famous Franklin and Jessica Wilhern (Richard E. Grant and Catherine O'Hara). Because they didn't want the press to see her pig-like facial features, the Wilherns faked Penelope's death.    And this leads me back to why she's now having trouble finding a husband; the instant they see Penelope's face, every suitable blue-blooded candidate either runs off or dramatically throws himself out the window. They have to sign a confidentiality agreement before meeting her, one stating that the Wilherns' lawyers won't talk if they don't talk first. The only candidate who didn't sign anything was Edward Vanderman, Jr. (Simon Woods), and this is bad because he immediately runs to the police after seeing Penelope's face and escaping the Wilhern estate. Of course, no one believes what he says (then again, his description of Penelope is grossly exaggerated). But by chance, he meets Lemon (Peter Dinklage), a reporter who had a bad encounter with Jessica when Penelope was born; while he believes Edward's story, he knows that without proof of Penelope's existence, the press would never be willing to print it.    Here enters Max (James McAvoy), a down-on-his-luck musician who spends most of his time competing in underground Poker games. Because Lemon believes him to be from a wealthy family, he persuades Max to pose as a spousal candidate and secretly take pictures of Penelope. After engaging with him through a two-way mirror, she lets him see her face; his knee-jerk reaction convinces her that no one will ever look past her face, despite what her desperate, overbearing mother tells her. She decides to run away from home, not because she hates her family, but because she finally wants see the sights of the city.    A trip to a local bar introduces Penelope to the streetwise Annie (Reese Witherspoon), a character who has no real significance other than to be an extra character. However, it is through her that Penelope's face is publicly exposed, resulting in a whirlwind journey through the world of celebrity. But has Penelope actually made some friends, or are they nothingmore than the frenzied fans of a pig-faced freak? Jessica believes it's the latter, which is why she's completely unsupportive of her daughter's newfound fame. All she's concerned with is matching Penelope up with a rich suitor, because the sooner she's married, the sooner the family curse is broken.    Max, meanwhile, realizes that he has feelings for Penelope, pig nose and all. He also realizes how wrong he was to introduce himself under false pretenses and toy with her affections. But now he has to work doubly hard since Edward has reentered Penelope's life. Penelope also has some work to do, especially when it comes to discovering who she really is. Sure, she may find a blue-blooded young man to marry, but will that ultimately have any affect on the curse? Finding Mr. Right is one of the themes of \\"Penelope,\\" but it's definitely not the main theme--at its core, the film is a self-esteem fable, telling a story that instills age-old ideas about liking yourself even when others are putting you down. I'm surprised this idea hasn't worn itself out since it's been used many, many times before. Then again, theme wasn't that important here. Neither is story, for that matter. I was more interested in the title character as a person, simply because she's a young woman that's strong and vulnerable at the same time. That's the one thing about her more noticeable than the nose on her face.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Go into this one with a fresh canvas of a mind.  Don't expect this to be brilliant.  Don't expect it to be awful, either.  Take it for what it is.  And try and pay attention to all the little details.  Like Ewen Mcgreggor's flood pants.
B0012QE4QC|3.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" opens ominously, develops into a dark tale of nasty sibling rivalry, and ends with virtually every character crying bitter tears. I was essentially watching a medieval soap opera, one that lulled me into that gray area between fascination and repulsion. Yes, this movie has that effect, and that makes me wonder if it really achieved what it wanted to achieve. Was it supposed to be a nonstop gloom fest, or were the filmmakers actually trying to say something important? I honestly don't know. I'm well aware that this is a representation of historical events, and as such, I know that the circumstances leading to Anne Boleyn's death were not pleasant. So that begs the question of why this movie had to be made in the first place; if nothing even remotely upbeat could be made up for the sake of the screenplay, maybe it would have been better to just leave the idea alone.    That being said, I did find a lot of the film compelling, especially in terms of the relationship between the Boleyn siblings. Initially, Anne, Mary, and George (Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and Jim Sturgess) are close-knit, more like best friends than relatives. But things quickly change, especially for Mary and Anne. Around the same time Mary weds William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), we learn that the Queen of England--Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent)--has given birth to a stillborn child, and worse yet, that child was a boy. This is unacceptable to King Henry VIII (Eric Bana), who only wants a male heir to the throne. The Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) sees this as a perfect opportunity for the Boleyn family, especially for his niece, Anne: she can be the first to offer herself as the King's mistress, and with a little luck this will lead to the birth of a son.    With a little coaxing, Anne accepts the offer. The King arrives at the Boleyn estate within no time at all, and at first, it does seem as if he's taken a liking to Anne. Consider the moment before an afternoon of hunting, in which Anne announces she'll be riding her own horse: \\"Without a man,\\" asks the King, \\"how will you hold onto your horse?\\" \\"The same way you do, my Lord,\\" she answers coyly. \\"With my thighs.\\" But when an accident injures the King on the hunt, he's introduced to Mary, who tends to his wounds with care. He finds her fascinating, so much so that he wishes her to come to his castle and become the Queen's Lady in Waiting. He also appoints her husband to be a Gentleman of the Privy Council. Thus the seeds of jealously are planted within Anne, who believes her sister purposely stole the King away from her.    The jealously becomes full-fledged resentment when Mary exposes Anne's secret marriage to Henry Percy (Oliver Coleman). Mary insists that she did it for Anne's own good, since Henry was already betrothed to another woman. But Anne hardly feels grateful, especially since she's now been exiled to France. Not long after, Mary discovers that she's pregnant with the King's child; when she's confined to bed rest after a near miscarriage, Anne is brought back with the hope that she'll be able to \\"amuse\\" the King and to keep his thoughts on Mary. This, of course, doesn't happen. If anything, her resolve to win the King's affections has greatly increased. By the time Mary gives birth, Anne convinces the King that his newborn son is nothing more than a bastard child, and therefore unsuitable to be the heir to the throne.    As you can see, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" paints a very unflattering picture of Anne Boleyn. Whether or not this is historically accurate, I have no idea. What I do know is that, as far as a film is concerned, there's only so much backstabbing and betrayal I can handle in one sitting. The birth of Mary's son kick starts a series of even more deplorable acts on Anne's part. She seduces the King with every glance. She refuses to sleep with him until she's Queen, and in order for that to happen, she has Katherine humiliated into annulling hermarriage. Anne also persuades the King to cut off any political and religious ties with Rome and the Catholic Church, essentially tearing England apart. And all because she's mad at her sister for being noticed by the King.    The last thirty minutes are too dark and depressing to describe. I will say that, by the time Anne realizes the harm she's caused, every character is lost in despair and things just keep going from bad to worse. It doesn't matter whether or not this happened in real life--my comments are solely focused on what I saw in the film, and I'm really not sure that I wanted to see any of it. Was it really necessary for this film to be so dreary, even if the subject matter was anything but cheerful? It really seemed as if the filmmakers were purposely milking the melodrama, forcing the audience into an almost constant state of apprehension. It wasn't at all a pleasant feeling. Still, I did find some of the material was convincing, if only just; the connection between the Boleyn siblings is fascinating, even when times are darkest for them. One gets the sense that even in midst of deceit and emotional turmoil, they will always love each other, no matter what. This is probably the only thing stopping me from giving \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" an even lower star rating--everything else about it is just too overwrought.

B000HA4WTS|3.0|Even though I am well above the age that should like movies such as this...I couldn't help but be entertained.    It doesn't get any shallower than this movie....the first FATF movie was about young 20 somethings trying to find their place in the world...Tokyo drift takes us back to the highschool days (but uses 20 something actors)both in America and Japan....exaggerated and stereotyped versions of both.    The plot and acting doesn't even meet the standards of a Disney teen flick..but if you love cars, (particularly Japanese imports) street races and chases...then Tokyo Drift is for you. It is beautifully filmed...and looks spectacular in HD. This movie is all about over saturated colors, pumping music and screaming engines/screeching tires. Just toss a bag of popcorn in the microwave, shift your brain into neutral (no thinking required) and have a good time with this movie.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I wand to start by saying that I had high expectations for this film. That being said, it's not often that those expectation are surpassed. Well this movie did it for me. I don't like musicals but I do like the Beatles so I'm sure this helped. I absolutely love the renditions of the songs done by the cast. Some almost brought me to tears. Visually, the movie was also spectacular, somethimes psychadelic while still staying grounded in the story. I thouroughly enjoyed Julie Taymor's vision of a fictional history that revolved around Beatles songs. If you like the Beatles you should enjoy this without question. Otherwise, it's still an amazing movie.    Almost forgot....the extras on the second disc are pretty good too. My favorite moment being during the audition for the woman who sang Let it Be. She absolutely killed! The room was stunned and Julie Taymor was crying. An absolutely amazing moment captured on film.

B00005Q45W|5.0|Although I have been a devoted LC fan for many years, truth be told there is a lot of his music I don't listen to regularly.  Not so with this CD.  Ever since it came out, I have found Ten New Songs a constant and steadfast companion:  It provides comfort in dark times, and a muted celebratory vibe for good, quiet times.  While I was (like so many) put off by the production of this CD (recorded without a proper band and the use of a drum machine), I've decided that none of this matters at all or detracts from its wondrous beauty.  As others have said, this CD contains almost uniformly great, great songwriting (except for \\"That Don't Make it Junk\\" which I have never been able to completely embrace).  Moreover, colloborator Sharon Robinson's vocals are absolutely gorgeous throughout.    This CD reminds us that truly wonderful music is one of a kind, just like Leonard Cohen himself.      Listen, here, to the music of our collective secret life.  I am thankful it exists, now more than ever.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|Prior to buying the DVD I had seen Phantom in live theatre.  I was not prepared for what I experienced with this movie--why it didn't sweep the Academy Awards in 2004 I'll never know.  It is a magnificent production and I think even better than the stage version. I am frequently disappointed with movies since it is difficult for film to do justice to a book or classic, but that is not the case with Phantom.  Beautiful music, an absolutely fantastic cast, great direction and screen writing, editing, beautiful costumes, make-up, set design, cinematology, and sets--it has it all.  I was immediately swept up with the poignant story and must admit I was rooting with tears in my eyes for Christine to stay with the Phantom and bring love and beauty into his life. Just as an aside, I think it was brilliant making the phantom's face a genetic anomalie rather than Hollywood's usual horror-show monster.  You could understand the loneliness, rejection and isolation of the phantom and his desire for love and acceptance by the beautiful Christine.  Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy and now this production of Phantom of the Opera are my absolute favorite movies of all times.  I was mesmerized by this film--this is the quinessential phantom of the opera and will be the production against which all productions will be compared.  Think of The King and I and you think of Yul Brenner--indeed it is hard to imagine a production of The King and I which is not Yul Brenner in the lead.  This production will be the same to Phantom of the Opera.  It is a classic and I plan to view it again and again--I don't think it could have been done better!  This film is a must-see and is a keeper--as far as I am concerned it is the definitive Phantom of the Opera!  Bravo to everyone associated with this production!
B0000029DD|3.0|I've listened to this album for a while now and I'm ready to give my review...    Overall, I really don't care for this album. The only standout is \\"Hallelujah,\\" which is incredible.    As another reviewer put it, the album as a whole is very unfocused. Most of the songs sound like he is singing them for the first time and hasn't settled on a solid vocal melody yet. Add that to the unique music in the songs and you get tracks that are really hard to latch-on to. I can't think of one song besides \\"Hallelujah\\" that I can hum the vocal melody to.    The lyrics also ramble on a bit too much for my liking. I'm not saying you have to rhyme the last word of each line, but a lot of this stuff is like someone is just singing a story overtop of the music without any sense of direction or overall purpose. Some people like that, I don't.    It seems to me that he was so focused on making something original that he consciously steered clear of ANYTHING that sounded mainstream. No catchy guitar licks, no real punchy choruses. Nothing.    I know a lot of people like this album, and I can respect that because it is original sounding. That said, I'd recommend people just by the track \\"Hallelujah\\" off an online music service and save the rest of their cash.    ~Slick

I first heard them on KEXP in Seattle,last year and they remind me of some of the innovative music from the Police and Paul Simon.  The lead singer reminds me of the Young Rascals lead singer, great voice. Their music has lyrics which are both legible and clever. The Graceland infuence of Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa is unmistakable. I think this is a must have and some of the finest new music available.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|All We Know is Falling by Paramore is a fantastic and somber album. I have their second album, Riot! which is my fave cd right now so I decided to pick up their debut album, I am glad I did. All We Know is Falling has more slower tracks, a very drastic sound than Riot! What I like about this album is the power in Hayley Williams's voice, pretty impressive pipes for someone so young, the rest of the band have tremendous talent as well. The best song on the album is hands-down the angry and catchy, Emergency. I like every song especially Conspiracy, Franklin, Never Let This Go, and the refreshing and slightly poppy, Here We Go Again. Paramore have proven they can rock no matter how fresh-faced and impressionable they are, pretty cool their from Tennessee. I highly recommend this album and their breakthough album Riot!

0143143492|5.0|I didn't read this because of Oprah. I read (listened to) this because I was a fan of Tolle's Gateways to Now. Again, Tolle managed to capture my attention with his accent. I thought it started off a little slowly at first, but it did pick up in chapter two. He speaks of the ego, thought process, voices in the head, separation from thoughts, attachment to things, illusion of ownership, and so on. The way he talks about the ego needing to feel superior and the thoughts being responsible for the ego are just mind-blowing. What he says makes perfect sense. If a person can separate from his thoughts and not react to them, then he can be at peace. I would highly recommend this to anyone seeking deeper meaning and more peace in their lives. My husband heard me listening to this and said he actually likes this guy and wants to listen to the book when I am done! It doesn't hurt that Oprah and Tolle are offering a free Internet class on Mondays starting 3/3/08 for ten weeks on this book either.
0767020308|4.0|A&E's 1997 \\"Emma\\" was unlucky enough to follow 1996's popular big screen production of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow in a sunny, funny turn on Jane Austen's classic romantic comedy.  However, A&E's \\"Emma\\", built for the small screen and starring Kate Bekinsale, has its own distinctions.<br /><br />The storyline is familiar.  Emma is the young, charming, and perhaps too clever daughter of the wealthy and indulgent hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse (Bernard Hepton).  Emma has just managed to marry off her governness as the story opens, and fantasizes about being a match-maker for her friends and neighbors.  Mr. Knightley (Mark Strong), Emma's confidante and brother-in-law, warns her against this, to no avail.  Emma's first target is her friend Harriet Smith (Samantha Morton).  Emma persuades Harriet to reject the marriage offer of Mr. Martin, a honest and hardworking farmer without social status, in favor of the more sophisticated local vicar, Mr. Elton.  This plan collapses, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.<br /><br />The arrival of the mysterious, handsome Frank Churchill in Emma's small village creates additional complications for Emma, in whom he seems to take a welcome interest, and for Jane Fairfax, a target of gossip who was once the paid companion for a gentlewoman and who must now make her own way.  At a picnic in the country, some rather harsh teasing by Frank Churchill is topped by Emma, who thoughtlessly insults the poor spinster Miss Bates.  The picnic breaks up in confusion, and Emma is properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley for her bad manners.<br /><br />Following the picnic, Emma learns that Frank Churchill has been engaged to Jane Fairfax (in a nice turn by Olivia Williams) all along, and was using Emma for cover.  She also learns that her protege Harriet believes she has drawn the affection of the ever-gentlemanly Mr. Knightley.  In a classic epiphany, Emma realizes that she loves Mr. Knightley and must face the possibility of losing him altogether to Harriet.  The stage is set for a fateful conversation between Emma and Mr. Knightley.<br /><br />A&E's Emma is perhaps truer to the spirit of Jane Austen's novel than its big screen competitor.  It is much clearer on the status of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and by extension on Churchill's misbehavior with respect to Emma.  Mr Knightley is portrayed as a mature gentleman landowner, critical of the much younger Emma's mistakes but also obviously caring.  Emma measures people by social status, and tends to interfere in their lives without understanding the possible consequences.  Her mistake in encouraging Harriet Smith past her social status is clear.  By story's end, she has arrived at some painfully-earned maturity that makes her finally worthy of the man she was meant to be with.<br /><br />This movie is a well-cast quality production highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.ther to Harriet.

B00004LMAH|3.0|After the hoopla of the first two Oasis albums, the bewildering misery of \\"Be Here Now\\" and the anxious wrath of the NME, The Gallagher Brothers were bound to stumble. While not a classic, STOSOG still possesses some great songs. \\"Where Did it All Go Wrong\\" and \\"Go Let it Out\\" are two of my favourite tracks.
B000F7OPCC|5.0|1989's \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" was the last of the highly entertaining trilogy of adventure films brought to the screen by the talented duo of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  The trilogy featured Harrison Ford in his iconic role as the swashbuckling archeologist of the title.  With a fourth movie due out in 2008 after a 20 year hiatus, the last one deserves a look back.<br /><br />Spielberg and Lucas consciously borrowed from the 1930's adventure serials in creating Indiana Jones.  \\"The Last Crusade\\" is perhaps the most fully realized story of the trilogy, not least due to the stroke of genius decision to cast veteran actor Sean Connery as Indy's missing archeologist father, Professor Jones.<br /><br />After a prologue in which we learn how Indiana Jones got his start in archeology, the story proper begins with Indiana learning that his father has disappeared from a research project seeking the long-missing \\"Holy Grail.\\"  Indiana, assisted by his academic friend Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot), and his father's attractive blonde co-worker, Dr. Elsa Schniender (Alison Doody), takes off in pursuit.  The group quickly find themselves in a desperate race with a group of Nazi plotters to reach the Holy Grail first.<br /><br />The race for the Grail ends in a virtual tie at an ancient and obscure temple in the deserts of Jordan.  Here, Indiana and his friends must survive a betrayal and unlock a series of archeological puzzles to find the Grail and save Indy's father.<br /><br />This movie was the best of the trilogy.  The priceless interaction between Connery and Harrison is worth the movie all by itself. The familiar features of an Indiana Jones adventure are all here.  The potentially sensitive subject of the biblical legends about the Holy Grail itself is nicely handled.  This movie is very highly recommended to fans of the Indiana Jones series and to newer viewers looking for an entertaining story.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|Teatro Real of Madrid has done it again. Any of you who are fond of gorgeously staged productions, surely have noticed how high the bar has been set by Madrid. The Gran Teatre Del Liceu is another one you can put real faith in. I am becoming fond of comparing productions, buying one then another. This one trumps all the others I have seen.<br />I recall Il Viaggio A Reims and the stunning array of staggering talent. Maria Bayo was in Viaggio, but I didn't notice her so much-owing to all the melodic melee and endless parade of stellar vocals. So I was very pleased and stunned by Maria Bayo this time! I think my mouth was agape, and eyebrows raised. She received a very long and enthusiastic ovation near the denouement;  that would bring tears to your eyes-and why should she not? She had finished yet another in an interminable series of tour de force arias, and this one the best, saved for last! What nabobs of negativism whose reviews I read at times on these pages. They bring new meaning to the phrase, 'finding flaws in Paradise'.  Disregard any review that does not recognise how extraordinarily difficult these shifting tempi and syncopated melodic reparte are... to sing, act and move about, in choreographic harmony all at once! I bet some of these  reviewers have difficulty setting up their dang  DVD! You will adore Maria Bayo and if you have a heart at all, will find yourself wishing to God you could sing that purely, and sonorously, strongly, and indefatigeuably! Belle, belle!<br />I have not begun to praise this production enough-space does not permit. But you will come to greatly admire Pietro Spagnoli, as THE perfect Figaro-what a voice, what stage presence, what great acting. Move over Placido (whom I adore, don't get me wrong). Juan Diego Florez..a more believable Almaviva, a more tender and enviable light tenor you will not find today;..except for Roberto Alagna, and his knockout wife and unsurpassable soprano, Angela Giorghiu.<br />Now I am keen not to overlook a smaller part, after my mistake with Maria Bayo...I must give Ruggero Raimondi a huge, vigorous shout of hurrah...as does the whole audience! Absolutely a flawless , but somehow, affable, bad guy! and man what a thrilling baritone to hear.If an audio cd of a good baritone is missing in your collection, here is one!  It's small wonder he is so beloved. I keep hearing reviewers point out where an aging performer is losing it. How...simon cowell like. It's haughty. Paula Abdul pointed out to the audience, after a particularly snide comment by Simon, that Simon has NEVER appeared on stage. You see what I mean by a degrading haughtiness? Perfection of interpretation does indeed come with age.American Idol is more about worshipping youth.( and fame and wealth). Older performers could easily blow those kids off the stage.<br /> Ruggero's interpretation and performance of this role practically steals the show - eats the scenery as it is often said. How is the arch nemesis, the do anything for money bad guy - make us smile - and just be utterly delighted! This is perfection!<br />I tell you even the cast in the background is flawless. Everything works in this production. And I must again compliment the costume crew. Wow! Forgive my wordiness, but I must point out what is genius about the costumes. It relates to the beloved opera \\"Pagliacci\\". Before the industrial age, when everyone toiled in the fields without relief, the traveling minstrels would blow into town with great fanfare. And what was the attraction? Typically, great fun would be had with the power elite. It was the saturday night live of its day. What makes the SNL sketches work, is whoever is being made fun of, will be  wearing the clothes Bush, or Hillary, .. or what  Babwa Wawters is wearing; her mawking obsequiousness portrayed in charicature. The costumery really does not have to be so baloony or absurd.<br />In this production of the barber, the costumes are perfect. They bring to mind the people, choreography, and culture of southern Spain of that era. The clothes are still , somewhat normal looking, yet frightfully close to clown oufits. The delicate balance is acheived consummately. It is all brilliant.<br /><br /> I do hope to see more of all of these performers...and sets and staging by all involved in this production. A shimmering, scintillating,sparkling performance by every player, seen and unseen.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!of southern Spain of that era. The clothes are still , somewhat normal looking, yet frightfully close to clown oufits. The delicate balance is acheived consummately. It is all brilliant.     I do hope to see more of all of these performers...and sets and staging by all involved in this production. A shimmering, scintillating,sparkling performance by every player, seen and unseen.

B000N6TYLW|4.0|I bought this set to complete my collection of the series.  Excellent show and very well produced dvd's.    The extras are nice and there's been a bit of thought put in them.  Still, I would've liked to have more audio commentaries on the dvd's, especially from the two starlets of the show.    Aspect ratio is interesting, as I seem to recall that the later seasons on tv were widescreen, and still the dvd release is only 1.33:1. That is a disappointment.    All in all a good release of a great show, too bad there aren't shows like Gilmore Girls anymore in tv... but thankfully I have the dvd's.
B000ZK4466|5.0|For people who have never heard The Mars Volta before, this album will probably sound like a bit of a shock. Noisy, chaotic, confusing could be some terms a first-time listener might choose. However if you've followed the band, or are interested in this type of music, this is a great album. Not quite as experimental as Amputechture, there are a few more accessible tracks on the album. In an interview, Cedric and Omar stated that the idea behind this album was to have everyone and everything start right at once, as opposed to previous albums which have a long, drawn out introduction. This is one reason for the shock, as the first song starts with a jolt. If you can stand to give it a few listens, even as a first-time fan, the album starts to show it's magic. Once you start to understand the rhythms (jazz and latin influenced) you can really tune in to the incredible musicianship of the band. Not to mention the new drummer, who's playing style I would say most closely resembles Animal from the Muppet Show. He really shines, keeping insane rhythms and breakneck speeds. All without a double-kick pedal, if you believe it!

Feynamn must have been a great mind in physics (you can't tell from this book) and he must have been a very charming person  - or so they say, cause you can't tell from this book either. I find him boring, self-centered, obnoxious and someone that will be nice to persons with an IQ exceeding 200, and ONLY if they are into Nobel prize level of physics...To regular folks he was a nasty, egoist, allegedly funny guy. If you want to read a whole book about his pranks, go ahead and good luck.   Don't be fooled by the title like so many others.
B000NA2776|5.0|My favorite song on this CD is Relax (Take It Easy), I first heard this when I was living in Russia in 2006-2007. Not sure why in Europe it comes out faster, but i felt the moment I heard the song. Every song on his disk is different, so you can definetly find the song you like for your mood. I also found it dissapointing that so far he has only 1 disc. I really hope more are coming!
0143038419|5.0|I was surprised by this book.  From \\"judging it by it's cover\\", I passed over it several times thinking it was a quick and superficial read.    I stopped to inspect the book (what ARE those letters made from?) which then pulled me into reading the back. I picked up/put down the book 3 times...then 'gave in'.  It was a most enjoyable read; the story pulled me into Ms. Gilbert's journey, both travel and personal.  The anguish she expressed from the bathroom floor resonated with a time in my life when I have felt similar.  The contrast from lush, worldly, and sensual experiences in Italy to the austere, spiritual, yet equally sensual experiences in Bali nurtured and nourished my imagination.

B00005ASHM|5.0|I must have played this album well over a hundred times  and I am still amazed at the  emotional power of the music. It would be churlish to list any particular favourites but\\" Don't Talk (Put your head on my shoulder)is a remarkable example of a romantic love song. I am surprised that no one appears to have attempted a cover version of this track in the way that Frank Sinatra did with George Harrison's \\"Something\\" (in the way she moves). Maybe someone has but it would take a very fine singer to do so. This is a much more complex song and its power comes from the extraordinary cadences and variation of rhythm. You don't need to know much about music to be moved by this. Take time to listen and it will open your heart. It is just beautiful.

Unlike so many political books, he doesn't have a negative thing to say about anybody.  His mother must have taught him if  you can't say something good about somebody, don't say anything.  He has a positive outlook and it's obvious he is extremely intelligent.  I can't wait to finish the book.

It's an abs lout MUST read, and can be a good reminder in a fast phased world of what really is important.     (I shop a lot on Amazon, but this is my first review I just had to put it out there)

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Being able to \\"visit\\" other parts of our earth is always fun & informative, but this series will take you to places that very few humans will ever have the ability to enjoy. While there you will be continually reminded of the beauty, complexity, diversity & wonder of this planet on which we live. In the background a theme rears its head in every single segment - that such habitats and sights are so easily disturbed or even threatened by man's poor stewardship. Yet this series does not come over as a \\"fanatical\\" cry over environmentalism. Rather, it simply places facts before the viewer - facts that too many of us have not had the time to meditate upon.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Tim Burton. When I was young one of my favorite movies was The Nightmare Before Christmas, so of course as I grew I watched more movies Tim has directed. When I first heard about Sweeney Todd the story sounded interesting and Tim Burton Johnny Depp films tend to be pretty good, so with my doubts of a musical murder movie I went with a few friends and came out truly amazed.  Where did all these great singers come from!? Was one of my first questions. One of the greatest shocks watching this movie was hearing the actors sing I mean even Alan Rickman was good I would have never thought to see Severus Snape singing in a musical but my god he wasn't bad at all, no one was. In fact I found Johnny and Helena's singing to be excellent.  Sweeney Todd tells the tale of Benjamin Barker a content barber living with his wife and child Johanna in London on Fleet Street. Johnny Depp shows a true depression and anger in his stunning portrayal of the tormented barber (Benjamin Barker) Sweeney Todd. After being sent to prison under false charges because a judge wants his wife, Sweeney escapes to return to London with the help of a boy named Anthony. When returning to London he find his previous life gone with only the empty room he once shared with his family above Mrs. Lovetts meat pies shop. Of course this evokes a want for revenge upon the judge and drives him to think of noting else. Throughout the film he stomps around singing about revenge and his shiny razors, after a while you feel bad for the poor guy driving himself crazy with rage... The music in Sweeney Todd is great from singing about baking humans into meat pies to living by the sea all the actors tackle the songs and give you an illusion of experience which not many of them have. The ending to Sweeney Todd is incredibly sad, I don't remember ever feeling so bad for a character who slashes innocent mens throats as they get shaved.... This is a truly great movie that I dont believe got enough credit especially from people in \\"the academy\\" of whom I am not a fan.  Overall I would give Sweeney Todd a 5 out of 5 because i can think of any ways to make it any better or change it at all. Good job Tim.    [...]
B0010X8NF0|5.0|When the award season rolled around, I was disappointed to find that this movie was virtually ignored by them all. I thought Wes would be a lock for best original screenplay at the Oscars, but alas, no. This was easily the best movie of 2007 that no one saw (well, I saw it at my theater). I don't know why the studio didn't get behind it and market it, but many people are probably hearing about it now for the first time.  I've seen all of Wes Anderson's movies, and for me, this one falls right behind my favorite: [[ASIN:B00003Q42P Rushmore - Criterion Collection]]. The Darjeeling Limited is a very funny, smart, bitter sweet and at times a surreal character study of three brothers searching for their mother after the mess that was their father's funeral. The story is very original, the movie flows effortlessly, the cinematography is superb and the soundtrack is the best of all of Anderson's movies.  The dry style of comedy may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally love it.   I can't recommend this one enough. If you missed it in theaters, here's your shot at redemption.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|Paul Thomas Anderson once again fashions an original and ambitious film of layers filled with challenging themes that, despite producing an occasional scene of brutal realism, fails to be that good. This two-hour and forty-minute story of one man's greedy ambition and his unwavering quest for wealth at whatever cost, reminded me of a Charles Dickens story where all the characters are caricatures--and that is not a good thing.      Daniel Plainview is an oilman who is seeking to make a fortune by finding a piece of real estate with a profitable oil well. He has no family except for a baby boy he adopts and quickly turns into his young prodigy. He is approached by a boy, Paul (played by Paul Dano), who tells him of a ranch where there is such an abundance of oil it is seeping out of the ground. This is all Daniel needs to hear before setting off to find it. When he arrives he quickly goes about buying up the ranch as well as all the surrounding land and then with a crew starts drilling. He does run into some confrontation with Eli (also played by Paul Dano) the brother of Paul. Eli realizes the oil is worth something and wants a share of the profit for his church which he is minister of. Daniel agrees to this, but once he strikes oil and starts raking in money, he completely ignores his deal with Eli as his true colors are shown and he slowly turns completely bitter to everyone around him.      This is one of those films that seems to easily garner many award nominations and termed \\"masterpiece!\\", but when you go see it you are left wondering if you saw the same film. There were simply too many flaws in this film to be even close to a masterpiece.       To start, as I said before there are moments of true brilliance and some scenes were so engrossing that you would hang on every motion and line of the characters only to be shut back out the moment the scene was over or the acting would become so ferocious that serious parts were almost humorous. PTA, the director, seems to have this style of pushing his actors almost into the territory of over-acting (as was the case of Tome Cruise and Julian Moore in Magnolia).      The production was nothing new or magnificent. The cinematography was mediocre almost annoying at parts as it showed close-ups for extended periods of time. The score was a \\"nail-on-chalkboard\\" type with every note out of tune and absolutely no melody just repetitive clicking, banging, or stringing contrasted against the silence of the plains.  For the story to be almost three hours long it was too focused on the main character, so that the supporting characters (none of who are women) appear more like those extras who just have a few lines before they head to the next studio. Because of this fact I felt the reality was taken out of it as Daniel Plainview seemed to exist in his own world were there was no society and the people surrounding him were so vacant of any character that everyone did as he said. Also the lack of a female character (supporting or main) was a big mistake.      I give this film points for trying to bring a message, but there were too many messages and themes that got mixed together so at the end I was wondering if it was trying to show the affects of greed, money cannot buy happiness, capitalism vs. religion, etc. All of these themes are good but when they are not made clear enough.      Lastly I feel that since it is not an entertaining film, it is more a character study filled with different themes to critically analyze (which I LOVE) that the director should have chosen a different actor and story to illustrate those themes instead of oil drilling, Daniel-Day Lewis and nearly three hours of screen time (half of which has Daniel covered in oil beyond the point of recognition).

0452289963|4.0|Interesting read.  I'm not all the way through it, but I want to get as much read as I can before the class begins on Monday on Oprah.com with Oprah and the author.  I'm not sure if I am trying too hard for a revelation, but there are parts of this book that are confusing to me, but as I read, it is becoming clearer, and I am definitely feeling more of a sense of peace within.
0452289963|5.0|This is not a book that you can read non-stop.  Besure and get yourself several highlighters as well.  The first chapter might not grab your interest if you're not ready for the author's style of writing.  BUT - BOY DOES IT HAVE A MESSAGE IF YOU WANT TO \\"HEAR\\" IT - YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR A TRANSFORMATION - of MIND, BODY and SPIRIT.  The ideas are simple and are so true - Lots of information on EGO and LIFE and especially being PRESENT.  The book teaches us that our EGO likes to take control - and Anger, jealousy, nervousness, pride, negativity etc... etc.. are just the EGO in control.  We should all take Oprahs class and learn to use the simple tools in this book - Learn to be at Peace with this moment - all there is, is the Present.  The result is gentle freedom from the past pains and the future worries.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Only the masterful Tim Burton could turn such a twistedly morbid tale of depravity into a shockingly entertaining musical with enough blood and guts to rival Saw.      Sweeney Todd, based off the broadway musical, is the story of Benjamin Barker a successful barber whose life is destroyed when a corrupt judge (played by Alan Rickman) falls for his wife and has Benjamin sentenced to life in order to get her. Benjamin escapes and returns to London in the opening of the film only to find that his wife is dead and his daughter in the custody of the Judge who sent him to prison. Wanting nothing but revenge he joins forces with a woman he knew in the past, Mrs. Lovett (played by Helena Bonham Carter) who helps him open a barber shop above her meat pie shop. His plan for revenge soon spirals out of control as he starts killing his customers and then sends them below to be used in Mrs. Lovett's pies.       Johnny Depp does an excellent job singing, but Helena Bonham Carter does the best job in the film. Her voice is stunning and she has the widest range or emotions to go through in the film; all the while creating a morosely charming character. The supporting cast also does very well singing and acting including Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Jamie Campbell.      As all Tim Burton films, this is a visual delight. He uses that same fake-looking blood from Sleepy Hollow which helps tone down the stories graphic content. He also plays with the coloring and lighting, covering everything in bleak, dreary grays and ashes to set a tone of the overwhelming despair.      This is a magnificent film, and my only complaint or more the reason why I did not give it a higher rating is because it is a musical. I personally do not like musicals (Phantom of the Opera and Sound of Music are exceptions), but still just the acting, and grand filmmaking turns this musical into a engaging film.

0691131511|4.0|In writing this book, Professor Judith Herrin set out to answer a question posed by to her by two workmen in 2002: ` What is Byzantine history?'<br /><br />Those of us with some interest in Byzantine history should be grateful both to the two workmen for asking the question, and to Professor Herrin for seeking to provide a succinct answer.<br /><br />Byzantine history covers a period of 1000 years (from 330 to 1453), involves 90 emperors and 125 patriarchs.  Professor Herrin approached the subject by theme, rather than chronology and has provided a broad overview of the history, traditions and resources of this fascinating empire.  Looking both east to Persia and west to Rome, Byzantium was shaped by both. The rise of Islam, the depredations of the Crusades and the final demise of Byzantium at the hands of the Ottoman Empire in 1453 saw the passing of a unique and rich empire.<br /><br />Professor Herrin argues that without Byzantium there would be no Europe.  On one level at least it is difficult to disagree.  Fortunately, for those who want more information on the history and culture of this fascinating empire, Professor Herrin has included a bibliography<br /><br />My only question: have the two workmen read the book, and did it answer their question?<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

B0012K1ILW|4.0|I had to give my review the title above in answer to the people who gave this CD 1's. Don't buy this CD if you want ten tracks that are like \\"Honey.\\" If you are familiar with Badu you should realize that you will get no such thing. Moreover, if you are truly receptive to Badu as an artist, I don't know why you'd want her to reign in her creativity in that way.     This is a very funky album, on par with \\"Mama's Gun,\\" but definitely something new and different. A lot of the songs have codas (a concluding musical section that is formally distinct from the main structure) which is perfectly fine with me--one of my all-time favorite Badu songs is \\"Green Eyes\\" which is in three movements. If you are such a philistine that classical music structures bother you, again, I wonder how you came to be familiar with Erykah Badu.    For me, two of the three Madlib-produced tracks are real standouts on this album-- \\"The Healer\\" and \\"Twinkle.\\" (I'll allow the philistines this one point--the exhortation at the end of \\"Twinkle\\" is quite intense and, after listening to it twice, I skip to the end or to the next track). I always appreciate the intimacy and sincerity of Erykah's work which is obvious in the tracks \\"Me\\" and \\"Telephone.\\" In order for Badu to make the funk-driven, personal statement that she makes in \\"New Amerykah\\" every track is necessary, particularly \\"Amerykahn Promise.\\" It's a true intro to the CD and it sounds like George Clinton was in the studio with her when she made it. I don't love every track on the CD, but I don't hate any of them and I don't think that any of them are filler. Here, Badu is thoughtful and inspired. (Notice that I haven't made any comparisons to \\"Worldwide Underground\\").
0142004413|4.0|Ever wonder what kind of person takes such an interest in every form of flora or fauna there is? One who is hyperobservant, apparently. And when Gerald Durrell turns that eye on the eccentric characters in his family and around him on the island of Corfu, you'll absolutely love reading his words.

B000VNMMQ6|5.0|12 Years after Die Hard with a Vengeance McClane is back and he has a teenage daughter who calls him John and simply doesn't want to know. John hasn't seen any action since him and his old partner Zeus took down the New York bomber Simon Gruber. Now seems like the right time to get back in action and kick some major terrorist booty, only this time he needs the help of a computer geek. Ex-government official turned cyber terrorist aims to get revenge on the government that refused to listen to him and bring them to their knees. He employs a group of hackers to build a program for him which will help him take down the entire US networks, including Utilities, Traffic & defence. Once the program is built, the terrorist and his small team have no need for these small time hackers so by turning their hard drives into bombs he goes about executing every one of them. Unfortunately for him one of the hackers is being brought in by John McClane for suspicion of breaking into the FBI networks. The bomb goes off with McClane and the hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) inside, they don't die but now John is in the action and from that minute you know the big guy is back. He fires off a quick one liner after the explosion which makes you tingle with excitement as you remember the good old' days. \\"I hope that didn't wake the neighbours.\\"<br />After the gun toting battle McClane and Farrell get out of the apartment building and proceed to go on the run, but although McClane has the intention of just dropping off Farrell at the station he is now pulled into this world of cyber terror.<br /><br />Bruce Willis has always been perfect for this role, and although people had their doubts about whether he could pull off the McClane character 12 years after the last film, he surely put their doubts to rest.<br />When we first meet Justin Long as the Cyber Hacker (Matt Farrell) it seems from the very first scene that you know he's going to be perfect for the role. He gives off this aura that he's someone who's not familiar with the world outside of his apartment, and becomes completely on edge when he first meets McClane. The relationship between both McClane and Farrell starts off the way it was meant to be is that Farrell is the criminal being brought in by the cop. This relationship develops through each scene and you see quite a clich&eacute; image of the technically wise kid teaching the slow old man about computers. It's not a bad thing, as the chemistry between the two really works and develops into what can only be described as a father/son relationship. Between the two characters a subtle side plot begins to develop as it gives us a clash of cultures story. Farrell teaches McClane about the world of computers and how they play a major part in the lives of everyone, and McClane teaches Farrell of the importance of putting his life on the line for his country and his family.<br />Justin Long and Timothy Olyphant are two very small time actors but acting alongside Willis in this film series can really put their names up in lights and build their careers. The character of Thomas Gabriel is a man who loved his country and after 9/11 he tried to warn the government how vulnerable their defence networks were. The government dismissed the claims and this effectively destroyed his career. He became angry and vengeful and decided to instil upon the U.S. government what's known as a fire sail which is a 3 stage program that can destroy the United States networks.<br /><br />The action is very much non-stop and quite reminiscent; more of the 3rd Die Hard movie rather than the first two. It's over the top and it's very much on a larger scale when compared to the other films in the series. An example of this is the scene in the tunnel when Gabriel directs all traffic towards McClane and Farrell under the tunnel. The number of cars that are smashed up and flung towards the two in an over the top fashion is insane. The CGI although used quite minimally is usedin an intelligent manner and only used for when a live action sequence is simply impossible. Dare I say that this film brinks of the level of possibly being better than the first Die Hard film. The action is superb, the acting and chemistry amongst the actors is something special and something that a fan of cinema can truly appreciate.<br />Although this was a film based entirely on fiction, one has to wonder about the true possibilities of such events that took place in this film. Our governments will have us reassured that our networks are secure and impenetrable, yet time and time again we hear stories of how teenagers hack into what we're told as the most secure systems in the world. The possibility of a fire sail which is talked about in the movie is something which is possible in reality and that is something which I think gives the bigger impact in our minds and makes this all the more believable.<br /><br />Willis brings us the nostalgia effect in this film as we remember the man who had what we could call at least a marginal head of hair and he brings back the enthusiasm that he has for his country no matter how bad the pay is.<br /><br />Justin Long brings us the typical image of how we see today's young adult.  He has this disrespectful immaturity, yet this childish vulnerability that we come to adore with this character as he demands the constant protection of McClane but builds his self confidence after he is faced with difficult situation after difficult situation.<br /><br />Timothy Olyphant I feel is the star of this show as he creates a believable character who is as patriotic as McClane yet wants revenge against a government that betrayed him. He gives off this disgruntled insecure individual who started off simply wanting to prove a point but dug himself into a hole he can't get out of.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best films I've seen in a long time and I'm glad it's a Die Hard sequel as I would hate to be giving it a 1 star and telling everyone how terrible I thought this film was. The action was full on and non-stop and this was mixed with believable characters and a storyline that matches with today's fears of terrorism.<br /><br />I truly loved this film and have loved the past films in the series and this is the reason why this has been my longest review to date.ly used for when a live action sequence is simply impossible.

0385338724|5.0|Remember Me? is another fantastic book from Sophie Kinsella.  It was delivered to my house on a Friday morning, and 6 hours later, I had finished it.  Kinsella's writing is so engaging, you can't help but get sucked into her books.  This latest book was another great escape into the life of a witty and charming character.  I only wish there was more to read!
0439813786|5.0|This is a fun, mysterious book for kids, and it has great illustrations. Any kid up to the age of 11 will probably really like it and be challenged by it. Over that, it will depend on the child. I think the story is one even older children and adults will like, but it may not be as challenging for some older children.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I loved seeing Across the Universe in a theatre, & I saw it there 3 times. It is such a VISUAL movie that seeing it on the big screen really did it justice. As I was concerned about, seeing it on DVD doesn't have the same visual impact. Of course, I just have a 32\\" TV, if you have a big screen TV, then that would be better. Having said that, it is still a very good film. Julie Taymor, the director, did a wonderful job of creating a story to go along with many of the Beatles' songs. This movie will make you both laugh & cry, but most of the time, I had a big smile on my face -- just LOVED it! I thought ALL of the cast members did a great job, especially Jim Sturgess, who played Jude. With his Beatle-type of haircut, & his British accent, he really brings to mind a young Paul McCartney -- which was GREAT for this film! I can't say enough about this film, but DO see it on a BIG screen TV if you can -- it really comes to life much better when it's larger-than-life!
B000K4WPCM|3.0|The Story: In 1692, five families in the Ipswich colony of Massachusetts  hold a mysterious power that they are forced to hide from society for fear of being executed of witches. To hide themselves, they form a secret Covenant which will help protect their ancestors from being hunted down.<br />Fast forward to the present day and four teenagers are forced to live in the modern day with these powers, though they can't resist the temptation of using them now and again. Caleb Danvers is coming up to his 18th Birthday and will thus ascend to the next level of this mysterious power, although a mysterious 5th power is seeking to destroy Caleb and take it from him.<br /><br />The Review: This was a surprisingly entertaining film which, for the teenage movie genre was very unique. The friendship between the four boys, and the development of the relationship between Caleb (Strait) and Sarah (Ramsey) are in my eyes very believable which leads you into caring for these characters on another level. Being of the story behind this movie and the overall format, I felt that the director was trying way too hard to bring up the age rating by adding some random pointless nudity and language in an attempt to have it appeal to an older audience. The scene transition I felt didn't work as well as I'd hoped, some scenes will feature some really cool and memorable moments, e.g. the scene where Caleb is driving and he hits an 18 wheeler head on. This type of scene would have you think this is worthy of a 5 star rating but then the next scene would contain some extremely corny dialogue which will make you want to bury your head in your hands in shame.<br /><br />Overall this is an entertaining film that you will enjoy if you don't watch it with this expectation that you're getting a 5 star script and 5 star acting.
1933492287|5.0|I have to say that I am very pleased with the illustrations and drwaings that Daniel Simon has cretaed for this book. The stories are entertaining to read and the illustrations are great. If you are looking for clean drawings, you will find it here. A lot of 3D renderings are shown for the final piece of each major vehicle he produces for the book, but there are nice progression pages that show Simon going from rough drawing concepts, to refined pen drawings with photoshop shading to complete detail perfect images. If you are a car designer, want to be one, or appreciate them, you need this in your library.
0060763892|5.0|I have read every James Rollins book and this one does not disappoint.  His plots and characters are always exciting, I just can't put the book down.  Clive Cussler has always been my favorite, now I have 2 favorites as James weaves just as good a story.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Is in regular DVD format (not HD or Blue-ray) which I think at this point in time is preferable.  Each of the movie DVD's has a directors cut as well as the released cut.  There are also a bunch of DVD's that contain extra stuff which I haven't and probably will never watch.  I think this collection is excellent.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This documentary was right on target and showed the truth about healthcare companies. They don't care about their \\"customers\\". They simply want to sign up the healthy and deny the sick people so they can serve their shareholders. If the Michael Moore haters even bothered to watch the movie, they would realize that the insured aren't necessarily fully covered. These healthcare companies are denying \\"covered\\" people left and right with their loopholes. And shame on healthcare companies and the government turning away 9/11 rescuers simply because they were volunteering and weren't on the clock!
B0000640SA|1.0|...unless you're into being tortured. I won't be redundant as other's have stated how utterly ridiculous the menu system is and the battery of test you're forced to take to see the features you paid for. this edition is for the pretentious, \\"hip\\" psuedo-intellectual. Don't get me wrong, I love the film itself but this edition is just terrible.  I have never reviewed anything here but I felt so strongly about this edition that I had to join the others in warning you in advance.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I felt this movie was incredibly good and emotionally spot on!    Before I see it again, and before the volume of the critical voices in my own  head  increase, I wish to say that having been born in 1960 and having played Beatles music the majority of my life, I feel proud of the creators of this movie!    I also feel that this movie is generationally helpful because the emotions of \\"pools of sorrow, waves of joy\\" is clearly understood.    As The Beatles were wonderful conveyers of emotion, so too was this movie.
0385341067|5.0|In this compelling story, the children in a faraway place (Bougainville in the Solomon Islands) travel to an even more faraway place--Victorian England. The narrator, 13-year-old Matilda, and the rest of her village are mostly unaffected by a civil war off in the mountains--unaffected, that is, until even the white schoolteacher flees.  The only white person remaining is Mr. Watts, a reclusive man married to an island woman.  Given to occasionally appearing wearing a red clown's nose, the children find him both fascinating and ridiculous.  Though he's never spoken to any of the children or, it seems, to anyone else, Mr. Watts volunteers to become the new schoolteacher.  Thus begins the children's--and the reader's--journey.     Mr. Watts's teaching is composed almost solely of reading aloud one chapter of Great Expectations every day.  The effect on the children is electric.  Never before has the faraway world come to them.  Never before have language and concepts so challenged them.  Never before have the children come to know anyone or anything outside their village.  Now they are confronted by the City of London and its masses of people, horse-drawn cabs, marshes, snow, Miss Havesham, Estella, Pip, and all the rest.  Matilda, in particular, is captivated by Pip and his expectations.  Pip sets the course of her life.    Eventually, though, the snake--in the form of the civil war--comes into the Eden of this village, and all is changed.    Capturing every element of our dreams of life on a tropical island, Mister Pip demonstrates the truth of those dreams and then starkly stamps on them with the hard boot of the outside world.  This deceptively simple story is not only a cry for our lost innocence but also a paean to the power of narrative--both Mr. Dickens's and Mr. Jones's.
0061122416|1.0|I found this author to be very self-righteous and preachy. The book has little to no action, and has a simple story line that could have been written by a child. Overall the book is cheesy and just plain lame. Take my advise and read something a little more clever than your typical, \\"follow your dream, listen to your heart\\" kind of book.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Two people connecting over music.  Doesn't sound like must of a movie.  Yeah I was wrong about that one too.  I'd summarize the plot but I just did.  Nothing different or out of the ordinary, but it is a real film that puts a smile on your face.  It even looks real and is shoot in that \\"grainy\\" style.  The songs are gorgeous and you find yourself leaving your worries behind and digging the flick.  The ending is sweet and unexpected.  Its amazing to see an accurate portrayal of...well...I wouldn't even call it love, but connection.  Falling slowly is a song with so much sweetness and texture that you just gotta love it.  Love it or not, but you have to respect song, emotion, and realism of this sweet little movie.  Enjoy
0618918248|4.0|I was having a discussion with a friend the other day about whether this book can qualify as being good or not. I should add that the person I was having a discussion was an atheist, and so am I. I should also add that the person I was having a debate with believes religion is bad, and so do I.     So where is the debate?    She says, \\"The book is useless in that it gives no direction for atheists to move. It's just a collection of arguments that have been already used ad infinitum. There is nothing original\\"    \\"au contraire,\\" I respond, \\"that is not the point of the book, originality is not it's purpose\\"    \\"Then what is it?\\"    \\"It's a propaganda book, an advocacy book. On the position that god is absurd.\\"    \\"You need a book to do that? Wouldn't a paragraph do?\\"     \\"For me and you perhaps, but that's hardly relevant.\\"    \\"Why?\\"    \\"Because the book isn't aimed at atheists. Atheists already know all of this.\\"    \\"Then who... the faithful?\\"     \\"Don't be absurd; they will obviously reject it.\\"    \\"Then who?\\"    \\"The agnostics, the half-hearted religious, and those who just don't know.\\"    \\"okay...so it is still essentially useless for people like us?\\"    \\"...essentially.\\"  ...    For me personally, though I didn't learn anything, found the book somewhat charming and one or two things rather funny -- with Dawkins and Hitchens the famous new crop of atheist propagandists certainly don't lack wit, and Dawkins summary of the old testament god is bordering on hilarity. And though I have no use for it, I'll give it four stars because I think it's politically useful unlike Hitchens and Harris' books... which are often illogical and silly. But those are reviews for a different time.      Democracy Now,   R.D.B.    P.S. I mentioned that a paragraph would do in disproving the likelihood of god's existence. Here you go.     For the religious I suggest that your assertion of god is merely an infinite regress and beg the question: who created god? For the agnostics who believe that because you can't technically disprove god's existence it's a 50/50 concept, I merely suggest you think about the invisible pink unicorn, and realize you can't scientifically disprove it's existence either.     Game. Set. Match.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Just an additional piece of info for people deciding which to buy, the Discovery version is only 720p while the BBC version is 1080p.
0316067598|5.0|This book is excellent! the shipping didn't take too long and the book looks brand new.
0446614459|1.0|The start of this book grabbed me right away. Two secret service agents who failed to protect their political candidates are brought together with a chance to right their past wrongs. Good concept! This mystery-thriller was filled with twists and turns, and with each one, the book became more and more far fetched. I'm more than happy to suspend belief in a page-turning thriller, but this book went so far over the edge, the ending was truly laughable. One of my all time favorite thrillers is Baldacci's Absolute Power. Nothing else I've read of his comes close to that. This is by far the worst. If you enjoyed Absolute Power and want more Baldacci, my advice is to get the audiobook of Absolute Power. It's fun to listen to as well. Regarding Split Second, it is ironically named. The story really dragged. I think I'm done with this author.
B00004TEUX|5.0|Excuse me, but whoever attempts to dissect these performances and/or discuss \\"minor flaws\\" overlooks something that in today's world, we cannot afford to miss: these are performances that leave the listener in a Peter Pan or Alice in Wonderland like state of wonder. Bean-counting just won't do: try and come up with a more uplifting, invigorating, life-affirming experience than this in the history of recorded music - you can't!    Greetings from Switzerland, David.    P.S.  And yes, there are other very fine recordings at least of the Incidental Music (I have never heard an interpretation of the Scotch Symphony anywhere close to Maag's, including his own digital remake), Previn's from 1976 (EMI/JVC XRCD) and Klemperer's from 1960 (EMI). The problem is, knowing Maag's, will you ever want to listen to another?    P.P.S.  And yes, that Maag's \\"Fingal's Cave\\" Hebrides Overture from 1960 is missing is a huge pity, as it is equally irreplaceable. But here at least, his digital remake from 1986, coupled to one of the finest recordings of the Italian Symphony you're ever likely to hear (IMP/Carlton Classics), is another beauty, and it is readily available: [[ASIN:B000000TJI Mendelssohn: Symphony No. 4 \\"Italian\\"; Hebrides Overture]]
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I love the album. I am a fan of all of the emperors that she salutes to throughout this album. I felt Parliament, Roy Ayers and definitely the feeling of Miles Davis \\"Bitches Brew\\" on \\"Telephone\\" by Erykah. Which is one of my favorites from the album. I keep the album on repeat at work. It is soul and funk all blend into \\"1\\" if you can't dig change then get out the vending machine!!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I heard Love Song and thought...this is the CD I've been waiting for. I love the Sundays, Nelly Furtado, Suzanne Vega and Natalie Merchant.  Sara Bareilles fit right in with the ladies.  The songs are so original and do not droan on or blend together.  I always look forward to listening to the whole album all the way through.  A real delight!  BUY IT!
B000EULJLU|4.0|Excellent album and innovative packaging. I strongly reccomend this album. Tool fans may find this one a bit lighter than their earlier albums but I like that they are continuing to evolve as a band.
B000VR824S|5.0|I bought this for my husband for a Valentine's day present.He had recorded the PBS version of Crossroads and was watching it again and again. The way the PBS version compares to it is likened to that of a movie trailer.<br />I highly recommend this even to any one who doesn't like Clapton.(Is there such a person?)The variety of iconic talent were performing at there very best.I think the highlight was Jeff Beck. He was making beautiful, nearly impossible sounds come out of his guitar.In between sets, there are brief interviews with music legends in their own right.
0812550706|2.0|I read this book about six years ago as a school student, so my memory of it isn't that clear. But I do remember being distinctly unimpressed. I was later informed that Ender's Game is an immensely popular novel. I was flabbergasted. I couldn't understand why such an average book was such a crowd-pleaser.    In recent conversation a friend of mine said he liked Ender's Game and I had to ask what it was that he found so appealing about the book. He said there were three main things he liked about the novel:    1) It is exciting and full of unexpected plot turns    2) Ender's character relates to youth, particularly the kind of youth interested in science fiction. He was over-intelligent and isolated, yet a military genius. My friends exact words were: \\"it's what every sci-fi geek loner would aspire to be.\\"    3) Enjoyable plot with lots of combat and such    His argument made sense... so why don't I like this book? Well, I have a number of reasons.    Firstly, Science fiction is a genre that is supposed to be creative and thought provoking. I enjoy stories which are creative, original and imaginative. The idea of aliens attacking the Earth was original and creative - back in 1898 when \\"The War of the Worlds\\" was published. But since then it's been done to death. My whole life I have been bombarded with stories of aliens attacking the Earth. People love this stuff - so much, in fact, that that abysmal movie Independence Day actually managed to make box office records.    Let me give you an example of the lacking creativity in this book: The aliens are a bunch of bugs. After humanoid aliens, insectoids must be one of the most overused clichés in science fiction. Orson Scott Card's imagination simply failed to impress me. The buggers, the use of a prodigious youngster as the protagonist, the simulated battle game and the computer game - it simply struck me as boring when compared to some of the other imaginative stories out there. Admittedly, Ender's Game was based ona story written in 1977. Perhaps the concepts used by Card were fresher back in 1977. However, there are older novels in this genre whose creativity and originality far outshines Ender's Game (Dune, Star Maker etc.).    But any story can get away with a lack of originality if it is emotionally moving. Once again, though, Ender's Game completely failed. Orson Scott Card's depiction of an incredibly intelligent six year old was thoroughly unconvincing. There were one or two points in the book when Ender was tricked and I was left thinking \\"if this guy is so smart, why the hell was he so easily fooled?\\" In fact, I never felt like I was reading about a really smart six year old - Ender's dialogue seemed strikingly similar to that of an adult of normal intelligence.    As for the plot turns and exciting battle scenes? Well, I only recall one plot turn which really surprised me. And it was not the big plot turn on which the climax relied. In fact, the climax was completely and utterly predictable.    Finally, I rarely enjoy literary battle sequences because TV, comics and movies are so much more effective at delivery exciting action scenes.    All in all Ender's Game failed to impress me on any level. Judging from the vast number of positive reviews, you may very well find this novel to be enjoyable. But if you enjoy speculative fiction, and are looking for a story that is not a mere rehash of your previous readings, then look elsewhere.
B0000640S1|5.0|Like the title blurb says, \\"First Blood\\" is an action/adventure masterpiece of the first order. It's easy to forget this in light of the two cartooney sequels that made a caricature of John Rambo: \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\" (1985) and \\"Rambo III\\" (1988).<br /><br />Most people reading this know the plot: Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into a Rocky Mounain town looking for a war buddy, only to learn that he died due to exposure to Agent Orange the summer before. The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and ends up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army. He easily escapes into the local forests where he takes on both the police and the National Guard in jungle warfare. Before all is said and done he almost levels the entire town!<br /><br />The picture was filmed in beautiful Hope and Golden Ears Provincial Park, British Columbia. Yes, it's drizzly and dreary with absolutely zero sunshine, but it's incredibly picturesque nevertheless. A wonderful place to commit suicide I'm sure.<br /><br />Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy and intimidating sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western \\"Silverado\\" (1985) albeit the character in that film is ten-times WORSE.<br /><br />Stallone is physically in his prime here, although he's not as bulked-up as in the two sequels. In fact, he's almost skinny in \\"First Blood.\\" His waist is obviously only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing \\"First Blood\\" is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape (or get in better shape).<br /><br />Stallone sort of blows his initial lines talking to the black woman about his war buddy at the beginning, but aside from this he's outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally screams out and lets out all his pent-up rage. This is a potent scene. He screams: \\"Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!!!\\"<br /><br />I'm not normally into dvd commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition dvd (the one with the red cover) by writer David Morrell is truly worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the film set many precedents in the action/adventure film genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of films, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how many times you've seen \\"First Blood.\\" The film has such a captivating anointing you'll be spellbound from start to finish every time. If your a sucker for lost-in-the-woods/survival pictures \\"First Blood\\" is a must.e.

B000LC55F2|3.0|I'm glad that a reviewer explained the significance of the infernal machine upon which \\"The Prestige\\" centers, because this darkly-elegant Victorian thriller about magicians is so contorted with twists and turns of plot that it is almost incomprehensible. Although I was willing to suspend my disbelief for much of the film, eventually its unpleasant--not to say sadistic--undertone made me stand back, as it were, and take a closer look. I then realized that what ought to have been coherent narrative was nothing more than smoke and mirrors. And while these are to be expected in a movie about illusion, the smoke was so thick and the mirrors were so distorted that they made the considerable talents of Michael Caine and Hugh Jackman simply disappear--as if by magic.<br /><br />In the bonus feature, the director explains his reliance on visual metaphor, such as birds in cages, glowing incandescent bulbs, and multiples of top hats and black cats, and although I certainly enjoy a good visual metaphor when I see one (The oranges in Coppola's \\"Godfather\\" trilogy serve as an example.), I do not like being bashed over the head with one. Without a coherent plot, such metaphors not only remain empty but also render the film pretentious.<br /><br />The blurb on the DVD cover informs the viewer that he'll \\"want to see it again the second it's over.\\" That might be because he was totally mystified the first time around!
B000002U82|5.0|Classic,timeless,Pink floyd's best.These are a few of the phrases often used to describe this album.I will go a step farther and say this is the best album of all time.This is a complete piece of music about life,time,and eventually death.Its sad,emotional,inspirational,and everything in between.Gilmour's guitar and voice and water's lyrics and concepts,together they are magic.I'll listen to this until the very end.
0316067598|5.0|It is funny when you think about it how much we debate about the troops but how little we actually hear from them. Well, reading this book is a great opportunity to change that. It was through reading this book that I realized the military conflict in the Middle East is not simply a dinner table topic; it is real, and that truly hit me like a ton of bricks. Whether you agree with our military involvement or not, I think I can safely say that you can never discuss or think about the matter without the sober respect that this book will grant you.    I urge you to bear in mind, however, that this is the account of only one guy.  Some of the 1-star responses criticized the book because of the strong opinions of the author and how some of them were soldiers and didn't agree. Luttrell is not claiming to be objective or even the voice of the U.S. military; this is simply his story. Whether you end up agreeing with him or not, I urge you to respect him enough for his service and his experiences simply to listen to what he has to say.      So take this as what it is.  Luttrell's story about what it is like to be a Navy SEAL and to experience a moral dilemma and amazingly outnumbered battle that fiction authors would wish they had first thought of it. This was probably the most emotional book for me to read, probably besides the Bible, and was all the more powerful because it is a true story.
B00006SKRX|5.0|I'm so happy I just found this IMPORT version of the CD.  As you can see, on the album/CD cover art, the girl's behind is not covered with a black rectangle mask like the US version has had since the CD was released in the 80s.  For those of you who bought the LP when it originally came out, this extremely offensive black mask was only on the cellophane LP covering so as to not permenantly destroy the underlying artwork.  The lazy and thoughtless defacement of this beautiful CD artwork has rankled and infuriated me since it came out.  I am utterly thrilled to see the original LP artwork restored to its original condition on this CD IMPORT version!
B0011BGY66|5.0|This cd is one of those rare occassions where my husband and i both love it.      Such a great new sound -- reminds me a little of the old 50s music and kinda a new happy-wave of music for 2008.    Great for doing chores or just chilling out with your friends -- the beat will keep ya moving    I usually just do the subscription thing from napster and never actually own any music cuz i tire of it so easily -- but i've already listened to this cd prolly over 30 times... so i'm buying it :)    Give it a try, i think you'll like their style
B000RZGFZC|5.0|This is considered by most to be Slayer's peak. And who am I to disagree? This is Slayer firing on all cylinders. Every side of the Slaytanic machine are represented here. The guitars sound like chainsaws from hell and the drums are like machinegun blasts of the apocalypse. War Ensemble is possibly the most vicious recording ever captured. Tom araya's voice is incredible, mixing up vocal styles throughout. Thrash,death,doom metal,its all here. After the smoke clears Slayer stand far above the hordes of generic death and black metal bands and are still the most intense and extreme metal band on the planet.
B0012K1ILW|3.0|I wasn't looking for this album to be like her first because it didn't feature some of the same producers, plus Erykah has matured a while ago musically.  I wasn't expecting \\"Honey\\" to be the album's standard sound because she don't do albums like that.  I did however expect this album to be a lot less loopy sounding including more changes during songs.  I couldn't really catch a groove on this one because the songs get soooo boring after a minute.  One thing I always injoy on Erykah's LP's are the live instrumentation and improv, but this time, it's almost none.  The highlight of this album IS \\"Honey\\" and I wish Madlib had of chopped it up more on the Jaylib tip.  His joints start out good but end up stale, expecting hook and bridge changes but, nope!  Maybe more cuts from Professor 9th (respectively) would have help this album more, but who knows?  I'll wait for Amerykah 2 and see if it all comes together, but until then I'm not feeling Part 1.  Maybe she'll get some Black Milk & RJ Rice in the mix...  In the meantime, I recommend [[ASIN:B000JJRIOI Desire]]<br />GONE!
B00111L0MY|4.0|While not a huge fan of Mystic River (from the same author as Gone Baby Gone), I thought it was well made and had good performances. The same can be said about this film, but I found Gone Baby Gone to be more thrilling and paced much better than the other Boston crime drama. The acting is very good from the likes of Ed Harris (no supporting actor Oscar nomination?), Morgan Freeman and the amazing Amy Ryan (should have won the Oscar). Casey Affleck is a better actor than his big brother, but I was never really convinced by his performance here. I liked the fact that Ben Affleck used people off the streets of Boston to act and add to the realism of the movie. As for the film itself, the twists keep coming and the movie actually gets much better as it moves along. Worth a rental for sure.
B000GH3CVQ|4.0|I love the Once soundtrack, but must agree that this CD is a disappointment and offers not enough new songs to purchase.  If you've got the soundtrack, you've got enough.
0452287588|4.0|I found the first few chapters a little hard to read because Tolle's style is something like I've never read before. Stick with it though because it gets really good after about the second chapter and you will have lots of \\"AH-HA\\" moments. I found myself later going back and re-reading the first couple of chapters after I was comfortable with his writing style and enjoyed them more then. Its a book I think everyone will get something from.
055358894X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read, in the fantasy genre or otherwise.  Reading this, it's hard to imagine that this is Scott Lynch's debut novel, as it reads like a book from someone who has had plenty of time to master their craft.        I hate always bringing a comparison to George R.R. Martin, but here it's inevitable, for me anyways.  First, I bought the book because of Martin's blurb of praise on the cover.  Martin has great recommendations and he's never let me down.  But not only is it a great book, Lynch's style draws comparison to Martin in many ways.  It has the simple yet easy flowing prose, the sarcasm, the grittiness, the unpredictability.  Yet it has a depth of character that I find more reminiscent of Robin Hobb, (just much less sadistic, as any fan of Fitz might know) as it follows mainly one character as he grows and learns his trade.  If Martin and Hobb were to collaborate on a book about thieves, The Lies of Locke Lamora might be the outcome.     Not to say that Lynch pulls heavily from other authors.  This book is a breath of fresh air and very different from fantasy that's out there today.  Honestly, I normally wouldn't be entirely interested in a book about thieving, but I found this entertaining as hell.  It's loaded with action, numerous plot twists, flawed characters, sharp (and often times filthy) dialogue and plenty of moments where I laughed out loud and got strange looks from my wife.      Yet even with all of that, I think Lynch's greatest strength may be his world building.  Throughout the book there are interludes that flash back to Locke's past, as well as the past of other key characters -namely Jean- that provide a rich back story.  These interludes aren't intrusive at all, and work really well to propel the story as a whole.  It shows how the characters change and grew so much from the past to the present.  This is done wonderfully.  And then there's the world itself.  I can tell that the author put a lot of time into theenvironment.  I had no problem at all imagining the setting with the strange Elderglass buildings and Venice-like layout of islands and canals.        From the seedy underbelly to the rich towers of the nobility, Camorr is a city worth visiting; where the villains steal and murder and the heroes... well they steal and murder too.  I really have nothing negative to say about this book.  Although it's the first in a series, it is a complete story within itself.  The author simply uses his skill and devilishly addictive writing to ensure that you'll come back again anyways.  I recommend The Lies of Loche Lamora, and its author, whole heartedly.
055358202X|5.0|This book is fantastic. I think less than five stars is just being too harsh. Even with the cast Martin chose the book is still extremely entertaining. Like every other book in the series I read it through as quickly as possible, enjoying every plotline (although wishing I could see what Daenerys, Tyrion, etc are all up to as well). GRRM is a fantastic author who deserves continued praise for this classic series.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I am so excited to finally be the proud owner of the DVD showing my favorite movie of all time.  Awesome seller!  I think I received it in the mail about 30 seconds after I ordered it.  Very impressed!
0525950079|3.0|Reading \\"World Without End\\" has pointed out to me how astoundingly good \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is, because the former falls into constant traps that the latter could have, but didn't.    \\"World Without End\\" isn't a *bad* book, by any means.  It's just not an extraordinary one.  When the characters draw comparisons between themselves and their \\"legendary\\" ancestors to whom they could never compare, it hurts the reader's perception of the book because the reader, too, thinks these characters can't compare to their ancestors.    Standing on its own merits, \\"World Without End\\" tries to take on its main characters in too balanced a way.  Because they have SO MUCH life crammed in to the book, it suffers a bit from what I think of as \\"Tolkien syndrome,\\" where all of a sudden you get a page full of, \\"here are all of the great things that happened in the last twenty years while you were somewhere else being boring.\\"  As a result, many important characters never really get the fleshing-out they need to become *people* and instead just become a litany of \\"foil... set piece... point about feminism... point about Muslims... foil... foil... antagonist...\\" and so on.  Caris remains the most compelling and with a few small tweaks, Gwenda could be so also.    For me, as a reader, the issue is that Follett set himself an extraordinarily high bar in \\"Pillars.\\"  It's a book I've re-read several times in the past ten years or so and every time I find the arc compelling and the characters very real.  He didn't meet his own high standard the second time around, and so for anyone who's read both books the comparison hurts the second.  For anyone who hasn't read both, I'd recommend reading them out of order -- then you'll be able to appreciate each for what it is.
B000RW3VD4|5.0|Awesome seller!  I think I received the DVD in the mail about 30 seconds after I ordered it.  Very impressed!
B000P12LWY|4.0|My take on the historical accuracy debate is that this show should not be viewed as a historical drama. Rather, it is a pure entertainment program based on events in the life of Henry VIII. If you throw out your cares about time-lines, actual family trees, etc., what you're left with is a captivating costume drama with all sorts of backstabbing, romantic entanglements, and international conflicts. The epic scope of the material is handled well, with strong performances and beautiful costumes and sets. The language, which is generally clean, has a faux-Shakespearian style that helps set the mood, giving the show a classic feel.<br /><br />That's not to say the show is perfect. There are times when Meyers doesn't quite seem the right fit to play this king, and, though he's a very charismatic actor, he is often overmatched by the characters of Catherine, Anne, and Wolsey in their scenes together. He does, however, do a  particularly good job of showing his frustration as his attempts to nullify his marriage drag on.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in the show is its gratuitous sex scenes. As a Showtime show, it's no surprise, but I don't want to feel like I'm watching a porno when I'm really in it for the drama and intrigue. The series premiere is the worst offender in this regard, but every episode has its unnecessary moments. (Given the high amount of sex, though, I was pleasantly surprised at the relative lack of violence. I will say that given the choice between the two, it's better to have too much sex than too much violence - in dvds as in life.)<br /><br />The Tudors is at its best when the conflicts drive the story. Catherine's stoic resolve against Henry's attempts to divorce her; the scheming members of Henry's court in their attempts to gain power by any means; Wolsey's desperation as his plans go awry; and on and on. As history, forget about it. As drama, there's a lot here to sink your teeth into.
B0013O123Q|1.0|My roommate and I could only stand less than 5 minutes of this movie because the camera work made us seasick.  The camera lazily loops around and never actually settle in or focuses on anything.
B000002J1L|5.0|At the time of this album's release (1971), Genesis was still very much in its formative stages. The immediate predecessor of \\"Nursery Cryme\\", \\"Trespass\\" (1970), featured the first classic Genesis tune (\\"The Knife\\"), and showed us a band really starting to find its musical voice. However, several key personnel changes helped this band make the leap to a true prog-rock giant: the addition of Phil Collins on drums, as well as Steve Hackett on guitar. These were significant upgrades (both were master musicians), and the increased quality of the band's musicianship allowed the band to push the limits musically.<br />Nursery Cryme features several great progressive rock epics: \\"The Musical Box\\", \\"Fountains of Samalcis\\", and \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\". All of these songs exhibit what would eventually become the distinctive Genesis sound; long, brilliant chord progressions, layers of Tony Banks' keyboards  and Hackett's tasteful guitar lines, classically structured with numerous time changes and modal shifts. Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford provide a locked-in rhythmic foundation, effortlessly handling the changes in time and providing exceptional momentum to these fairly complex structures. And of course, Peter Gabriel adds his brilliantly dramatic, mythical and at times humorous vocals and lyrics to the proceedings to top things off.<br />This album has a few weaker short tracks on it, and for that reason it is not quite of the same overall quality as the follow-ups  \\"Foxtrot\\" (1972) and \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" (1973). However, the quality of the epics more than makes up for this minor shortcoming.<br />The recording quality is not up to the level of their later releases. In fact the source tape seems pretty limited. I don't think they had access to the best recording equipment available at this time, However this seems to work with the darker material present on this album, and I don't feel it detracts from the listening experience.<br />The remastering is good here, as good as it can be I think, and this 1994 Atlantic release also includes liner notes & lyrics. I am curious to see what the new Rhino 5.1 surround mixes will sound like, although I have heard some complaints about some of the other albums that have already been released for this edition(i.e. Trick of the Tail, Wind & Wuthering). I'll be OK with it if these aren't great, as I have enjoyed my current copy for nearly a decade and have no complaints with the relative sound quality.<br />Genesis was one of the leading bands of the 1970s English Progressive rock scene, along with Yes, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, ELP and King Crimson. Every fan of progressive rock should have a copy of this album (as well as the next 4 or 5 Genesis albums), as these guys were one of the greatest prog-rock acts ever. Highly recommended.

B00000JHAU|5.0|Detached, emotive, quiet, energetic, wistful, playful, folksy, and spiked with punkish enthusiasm, If You're Feeling Sinister is a thing of delirious beauty and hypnotic power. Its songs are full of irresistible hooks and languid poetry, with sumptuous, dreamy melodies unfurling beneath smartly delicate (and snidely decadent, although that part isn't as pronounced) vocals. The whole thing sounds like an uncanny cross-pollination of the Smiths and Simon & Garfunkel, shot through with strains of the Beach Boys and the Velvet Underground (think \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\"). It's a smokey, gentle record full of nervous majesty and two-faced poetry, a half-awake dream that rings with humor and warmth.    The opener,  \\"The Stars Of Track And Field,\\" sets the pace: It builds from a delicate acoustic strum to a whispered, introverted symphony, full of swaying melodies and strange imagery, before erupting into a truly volcanic crescendo. After that comes the lush, paranoid bedroom rock of \\"Seeing Other People\\" and the quirky generational anthem \\"Me And The Major.\\" \\"Get Me Away From Here\\" is a quiet pop gem, and the title track is a gorgeously rendered pseudo-epic with fantastic lyrics. There's also the muted exuberance of \\"Mayfly,\\" the pubescent drone of \\"The Boy Done Wrong Again,\\" and \\"Judy And The Dream Of Horses,\\" which mingles a bouncing rhythm with lyrics that are both unrelentingly sarcastic and genuinely affectionate. And let's not forget that atmospheric build of \\"Like Dylan And The Movies\\" or the haunted desperation of \\"Fox In The Snow.\\"    So, ten great songs from a very, very great band. Sounds like a great deal.

B000HEWEE4|2.0|Dear Sandra and Keanu,<br /><br />I'm writing to you from the year 2008. As you're reading this in 2004, I know that probably sounds stupid. Two hours ago I didn't realize quite how stupid, but then I saw a movie called \\"The Lake House\\" in which you star. I hope that title means nothing to you yet, and that's how I'd like to keep it. That's why I'm writing to you tonight.<br /><br />Some time in 2005, representatives of Warner Bros, or perhaps even the great Argentine director Alejandro Agresti himself, will approach you with the script. Adapted from a successful Korean film called \\"Siworae\\", it will have been penned by Tony-winning writer David Auburn. But don't let that fool you. Don't be drawn in by the romance - it will be squandered on the screen. Suppress the desire for World Cinema credibility - it will not be attained. Sandra, you will be given a nice haircut, but will be forced to mope around endlessly talking to yourself and will have to confess to loving the smell of a dog's feet. Keanu, you will be given poorly-written scenes of familial angst, made to wear turtlenecks, and shot to look doughy and white.<br /><br />Say NO! I'm begging you! Let this material find its true cast and natural form. Say no, and set it free. Let the script float around Hollywood for a few more years. Let Carrie Fisher doctor it into a comedy. Let Warners hire Penny Marshall to direct Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Greg Kinnear, while you guys go off and do what you do best - dramedies and speculative action/sci-fi - and wait for that serious, surprising film to come along that might finally take you to the Oscar podium. Because this certainly isn't it. Call the Coen brothers. Call Scorsese. At the very least, call Soderbergh or Clooney and see what Section Eight has on the slate - they always need quality ensembles and enjoy risky, against-type casting.<br /><br />I know this letter probably makes little sense. How can I change the past? Surely if I'm writing this, I saw the movie, which means you made it - heedless of my advice. But I'm hoping the idiotic time-shifting logic of the movie, in which actions in the future can change the bad things about the past without affecting any of the nice things in the present, will somehow hold. If I'm right, I'll be able to logon to Amazon tomorrow and find no trace of the DVD.<br /><br />Please take my advice. Please say no. Just let us all remember you together in \\"Speed\\", when you were both young and pretty and knew how to kiss.<br /><br />Fingers crossed,<br />Stevemy advice.

B000ZOXDG4|5.0|ELIZABETH:THE GOLDEN AGE is a great looking film and a must see for fans of British Royal history.  Sadly, with the death of HD-DVD, this disc may not get the widespread circulation it deserves.  Universal will probably re-release this title on Blu-ray, but no date is set yet.  Overall, this HD-DVD release is worth getting if you still have an HD-DVD player.

This is one of the best albums i have heard in a long time.  This band knows how to play great rock n roll.  If you like Nikki Sixx then you must buy this Album. Mr Sixx still can write some great lyrics and music.  I really like this album.  Go and buy Sixx A.M.it rocks!!!!!!

B000VBJEFK|5.0|It is clear why Blu-ray won the High-Res DVD battle. The color and resolution is stunning. Comparing with a live movie, animation seems to present exceptionally well in high resolution. It is probably because the original works were done in computers with super high resolution.     It is a great story to watch with a lot of fun and actions. Actually this is the first I noticed Linguini had goatee. I did not even notice that in the theatre. I guess that is why you want to watch everything in high-resolution.    Do not miss the additional material. The RIP deleted clips are hilarious.    Finally, I am happy to listen to any Shakespearean actors speak. Peter O'Toole's monologue near the end of the movie is marvelous.     Ratatouille is well deserved for the Oscar!
B000A6T1JU|4.0|Probably has attained a cult status since I first saw this film almost 30 years ago. For years, I couldn't understand the reason why I kept coming back to view this  apparent stinker.It finally dawned on me that the casting is superb. There seem to be no \\"actors\\" at all in this sea of hundreds. Practically everyone is youth/ gangland NYC circa 1980. The plot is childishly simple: the Warrios have supposedly killed Cyrus, the self appointed street leader of NYC, and every gang, along with the police,is after them in an all night chase back to Coney Island, the Warriors' home turf. The word finally gets out that the Warriors are not to blame, and true justice is administered on the sands of late autumn. The gang walks away, having lost 2 members, but regaining their domain,which is all that really matters to these future fathers of inner city pride. 1

B000PTYPAC|5.0|I agree Paramore never had a shot at winning the 'Best New Artist' Grammy, and for good reason. Their music style is very typical... you've heard it before from Evanescence, Avril Lavigne, and various emo bands. I recognized this as soon as I first listened to Paramore.    But this essentially doesn't matter at all, because the entire album simply sounds really, really good. If Kelly Clarkson made a Greatist Hits album 5 years from now, she could only hope to have compiled a collection  this good. Every single track on here is *very* catchy. Typical or not, I'd take this album over Amy Winehouse any day.    I have more respect for the lead singer Hayley Williams than for, say, Amy Lee... because this girl can actually sing. The album's high production quality doesn't hide any weakness in her vocal ability; hear them perform live and she's still pretty well in-tune. Not the strongest voice out there, but good vocal technique which fits the style quite well. You have to respect the musical talent here... they're all between 17 and 23 years old.    Is the album just another mainstream pop, wanna-be hard rock band singing about your standard, annoying teen angst issues? Some people seem to think so, but I'm too busy enjoying the super-catchy melodies and well-executed harmonies. Musically, this stuff is high-quality, and I love listening to it. Go ahead and listen to the \\"more original\\" Amy Winehouse if you want, but it probably won't be as fun.
3822856282|4.0|This large hardcover collection of erotic photography is one of the best books of erotica to come along in quite a while. The premise is simple, allow models to photograph themselves in the nude. The result is a memorable collection of unique and borderline voyeuristic images that are just as artistic as they are erotic.  The photographs have an amateur feel to them, you get the feeling you're looking thru the personal photo collections of each lovely young woman, and in a way... you are. The personalities of most of the women come shinning thru in their selected poses. For example, it was easy to see the naughty playfulness of a young blonde woman, who was laughing as she snapped a pantyless upskirt shot of herself. You could tell that she was thinking she might be going too far, but that people would freak when they saw the picture!    Some shots are artistic, some playful and some all-out erotic. Some are in black and white, some in color. Some of the models look like top fashion models, some look like amateurs, but all of the content in the book is top-quality. Full page photos on heavy stock paper makes up the book and it's a fair price for such a large amount of content.   This is my favorite erotic photography book since [[ASIN:3822825573 Roy Stuart, Vol. 4: The Fourth Body (Book & DVD)]] and I highly recommend it.
1400095204|5.0|The book started out slow. I thought this would be one thoughs womens books, that would boor me.  But the books characters over came that fear.  There trying to survive this civil war, maybe the first war of it kind to get attention in the west, due to old tribal hatrid and jealousy.  This has been followed by similiar conflicts between tribes in many other African countries. That westerner have no understanding of the conflict the human factors, of people trying to survive they african conflict. Especially middle and upper middle class families faced in these African conflict. The lost of loved ones, and losing all the material items, and ones values. Challeging the social and intellectal ideas they truely belive in. Then facing the awful reality humilation of losing the war.   One excuse I constantly see every time the price of oil increase is a threat of internal conflict in Nigeria. Both the politicans who lead the Nigerians and the Biafrians. are still active politically active today. Each have large followings and have run for president in recent elections, receiving large amounts of votes.  Even with over the lost of lives of over 1,000,000 people there is a chance of this conflict continuing in the future, especially with the oil wealth of the county.
0380001225|5.0|In less than one hundred pages, Helene Hanff has given her readers a rare and special gift. Here in this delightful little book are the notes she exchanged with the employees of Marks & Co., a used-book store in England. Being fond of the old-fashioned yet still highly personal act of letter writing, and being equally fond of old books and used-book stores, Hanff seemed to have compiled these letters just for me. I doubt there is anyone who can read this book without experiencing a wide range of emotions complete with laughter and tears.<br /><br />A lifelong letter writer, Helene Hanff studied playwriting at the Theatre Guild. She has written scripts for \\"The Hallmark Hall of Fame\\" and for \\"Ellery Queen.\\" Her other writings include several children's books as well as articles for Harpers and New Yorker magazines.<br /><br />Living and writing in New York City, Hanff finds herself unsuccessful in finding certain rare or out-of-print editions of books.<br /><br />\\"Gentlemen:<br />Your ad in the Saturday Review of Literature says that you specialize in out-of-print books. The phrase 'antiquarian booksellers' scares me somewhat, as I equate 'antique' with expensive. I am a poor writer with an antiquarian taste in books and all the things I want are impossible to get over here except in very expensive rare editions, or in Barnes & Noble's grimy, marked-up schoolboy copies.\\"<br /><br />So begins the opening letter dated October 5, 1949, and addressed to Marks & Co. at 84, Charing Cross Road in London. What follows on the pages of this book are the letters Hanff wrote to Marks & Co., and specifically to Frank P. Dole. Also included are the responses to her requests, mostly from Frank P. Dole. Through their twenty-year relationship, the two strangers become in some ways like family. Frank introduces his family to Helene in letters. She corresponds with the family as if they are her own. Knowing that in a time of rationing, certain items are not readily available to the residents of London, she takes great care to ship Christmas and Easter gifts to the store with plenty of eggs and meat for everyone there.<br /><br />The final entry, dated 1969, brings the relationship between the bookstore, Frank Dole and Hanff full circle. The twenty years between the first and last notes are fondly recalled on the pages of this book.<br /><br />These short notes, her requests for specific books, the monetary transactions that took place, and the solid relationships that developed allow the present day reader to glimpse a bit of the nostalgic... a gentler time when costs were lower, trust was higher, and people were more willing to be compassionate to complete strangers.<br /><br />This is a truly delightful little book that has captured my heart. And, by the way, the fact that I discovered it while browsing through my own favorite little used-book store lends a special sort of appeal to it.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|This album is seriously one of my favorite albums of all time.  This is excatly where I wanted Radiohead to go with their music, and this CD continues to impress me.  The band has moved away from moody melancholy music, and entered the realm of a sleepy, happy, and  rhythmic bliss.  This album could be enjoyed by anyone, Radiohead fan or not.  The guitar riffs and melodies are so well thought and loveable.  The lyrics are genuine and brilliant. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this album. It IS Radiohead's masterpiece.<br /><br />1. 15 steps 100% 5/5 A+ The opening track is by far arguably the best song on the cd.  The strings and electronic vibes are powerfully moving.<br /><br />2. Bodysnatchers- Not quite as moving as the first song, but still a great song that is the most energetic of the bunch.  Its about a 4.5/5<br /><br />3. Nude- Now this song has to be my favorite.  I've listened to it a million times. I like Radiohead's slower music and this is the slow song on the cd that sets such a powerful mood.  I love this song, and you will too.<br /><br />4. Weird Fishes/Arpeggi- I hate to say any of these tracks are second best, so I won't. All the tracks stand out on their own, and even though the lyrics kind of lose me on this track, this song is absolutely fantastic.  It is really hard to find something bad about this album.<br /><br />5. All I Need- Another great slow song with intelligent lyrics.  This track probably got the most listens.  Its one of the more durable tracks and it's one of my favorites.<br /><br />6. Reckoner- A song that didn't get my attention right of the bat. But now it's earned its place as one of the best parts of the album. I'm running out of good adjectives because every song is so amazing, but Reckoner is really unique and inspiring.<br /><br />7. Faust Arp- One of the two songs that aren't favorites. This song is still a great song, but not my favorite. \\"wakey wakey, rise an shine\\" always gets me goin though.<br /><br />8. House of Cards- Second of the two songs that don't get my absolute attention. But this album wouldn't be one of my favorites if all the songs weren't great. So this song is still a genius invention by Radiohead.<br /><br />9. Jigsaw Falling into Place- This song kinda stands out on its own. The music video is a little naseating, but the song is great.  The vocals and strings really make this track. As is the formula for the rest of the album. Guitars and vocals are the extreme concentration. Drums come in third to bring a good addition.<br /><br />10. Videotape- Too bad this Cd's really short. But anyway, this song is one of the best exiting tracks out there.  The piano totally makes the song and Thom Yorke really knows how to use his vocals as an instrument. The song has some interesting electronic percussion, but it doesn't really damper the song.  Videotape does its job to end the rollercoaster of In Rainbows.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This song is one of the greatest albums of all time.  If you like their sound or similar sounds like Interpol, please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this CD.  15 Steps, Nude, Weird Fishes, All I Need, Reckoner, and Videotape are all equally amazing songs that will not dissapoint you.  This album is proof to me that the world has not run out of unique and magnificent art.  No folks, we have a great future to look forward to, because Radiohead brought in the new year with a BANG!e attention. But this album wouldn't be one of my favorites if all the songs weren't great.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|This is the only Will Ferrell movie I like.  For all I know he's a great guy but I'm not his usual audience so this atypical movie found an atypical fan.  Worth buying even if you've sworn to kill the next date/nephew/son/grandson who insists on subjecting you to any other Will Ferrell movies.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Another Masterpiece production  both uplifting and superior quality  Service was excellent as well
B000OY8NII|5.0|I watched Season Two, most of it, on Hulu and was really surprised that I'd managed to miss this show.  It says a lot that my reaction was to buy the Season One DVD.    Now I need Season Two on DVD and, since the writer's strike is over, Season Three on the SCI-Fi channel and on Hulu.    Get busy guys!
B000002IWH|3.0|The music on this CD are from the original movie titled, 'The Crow.'  The music is dark and somewhat tells a story that seems to follow the mood of the movie rather closely.  On the soundtrack, I found that I personally like some of the songs more than others.  I do however, recommend this CD for anyone that enjoyed the movie, or that just likes a hint of darker sounding music.
B000HEVZ9O|1.0|Although all three movies are very fun and enjoyable, the package itself isn't worth paying extra money for.  Instead of buying this trilogy in one package, save yourself some cash and buy all three editions separately.  Without even taking sale prices and such into account, the MSRP on this is $8 higher than all three products individually!  Maybe they hoped nobody would notice...
B00000FCBC|3.0|Warning! This album is falsely labeled as explicit. The F word on \\"Am I Evil\\" is beeped out. It's an annoying censor of one of the best parts of the song.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I accidentally found this movie while searching for another. I am a Tom Selleck fan from Magnum PI reruns and his work on Friends. I figured, given the level of junk that passes for entertainment these days, I could risk a Tom Selleck movie. Man am I happy I did. I now own all 3 of the Jesse Stone movies and am ordering the 4th today. I do not want to ramble or rant, this is an excellent movie series.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|If you recently saw the brilliant,now in theatres,[[ASIN:B0012OX7EO The Kite Runner]],you were treated to another Marc Forester directed gem that intimately explores the hopes,dreams,longings and sadness of young boys who have been faced with early on tragedy.Well turn back the clock three years and Forester was exploring the identical themes through FINDING NEVERLAND, a semi-factual look at John Barrie, the author of \\"Peter Pan\\" and the influential woman and children that were the muses for his famous book on never growing up.Forester, in his very young career, has also triumphed with his [[ASIN:B000LXH0AE Stranger Than Fiction]] where a \\"boyish\\" Will Ferrell keeps hearing an author's voices in his head.Forester's style in his films is gentle,whimsical and playful,and FINDING NEVERLAND never becomes Splenda sweet.The film, though involving the magical world of Peter Pan as dreamed up by Barrie (Johnny Depp in ANOTHER Oscar nommed role...when will he win??!!) is fraught with real life drama and tragedy concerning the loss of parents and the disintegration of marriage.These elements serve to make the viewer long for the world where we \\"never grow old\\", and Forester knows how to get his viewers there.With supporting roles by Kate Winslet and the recently Oscar nommed Julie Christie ([[ASIN:B000RQDMWA Away From Her [Special Edition]]],this film highlights the younger Freddie Highmore,as the young Peter, who has had quite a year with [[ASIN:B00133KFGW August Rush]], [[ASIN:B00139W3NE The Golden Compass (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00005JPXR The Spiderwick Chronicles [Theatrical Release]]].Turn back the clock.Stop being an adult and revisit a film that charmed us all in 2004 and was nominated as BEST PICTURE.
B000RSKD6G|5.0|This book starts off slow, but, after the 3rd chapter, I was completely hooked. I never wanted to put the book down and stayed up much later than I wanted to a couple of nights in a row to finish the book. A must read for fans of fantasy.
B00012L786|5.0|The people who don't like this fine film are usu. caught up in some political 'ism'.Fuller said \\"What bull****! I had no intention of making a political statement in Pickup,none whatsoever.My yarn is a noir thriller about marginal people,nothing more, nothing less.\\"  For Fuller fans,the Criterion Eclipse Series has his first three films - out recently.Fuller's splendid autobiography is also a must read.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|In the style of Somewhere in time (Christopher Reave and Jane Seymore) lake house presents itself as a mini time machine with the house and Jack (the dog) as the mediums.<br />Does not have the impact or music score of Somewhere in time, but does have two (more) of my favorite acters (Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock).<br />The end the movie left me wanting for only one thing; Where the heck is Jack, and why was he not in the final scene?
B0002858YS|3.0|My first exposure to the Killers was through the song \\"All These Things I've Done,\\" which is probably the most perfect song I've heard in a long time. From the single, sign-of-life piano key at the beginning of the song to the pulsing drums at the end, the music and lyrics of \\"All These Things I've Done\\" inspire me to dream. Weird how a song can do that. The rest of the album is good, with lots of synthesizers and heavy guitar. There's one song where I could swear I'm listening to The Smiths, or at the very least, Morrissey. Overall, a great addition to any music collection that is rock-n-roll heavy. Enjoy.
B000P2A256|5.0|I love this album.  This is the first time I have brought a Maroon 5 album, but I liked the second song that they were playing on the tv.  I love this CD, its only 1 or 2 songs that I don't really care for, but they aren't that bad!  I would recommend this to someone who likes feel good music!
B000ONBWSW|5.0|I was so glad to find this out of print edition of the complete stories of Sherlock Holmes.  I had it when I was a boy and read it so often that it literally fell apart.  Now I have it again.<br />There are many other volumes that have some of the stories, and one particularly handsome book that has facsimiles of the original Strand Magazine stories, but this is, to my knowledge, the only book that contains every one of them, including the novels.  It also boasts an introduction by that renowned Sherlockian Scholar, Christopher Morely.  His obvious affection for Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creation makes for delightful reading in its own right, even as he ruminates on the inconsistencies in the texts:  Is Watson's first name John or James?  Was his wound in the shoulder or his leg? How many Mrs. Watson's were there?  These are questions the discussions of which shorten the evenings for true Holmes fans such as myself.<br />These stories are not reprints of the periodicals for which Doyle wrote, but rather the books that came later.  The stories are divided by the titles of those:  The Adventures, The Memoirs, The Return,  His Last Bow, and the Case Book.  Interspersed among them and in the order in which they were written are the novels:  A Study in Scarlet, (Holmes's first appearance) The Sign of Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Valley of Fear.<br />Because they are arranged chronologically, and because of the completeness of the collection, one can actually trace the development of the characters over a period of some thirty years.  The only defect in the book is its lack of the famous illustrations by Sidney Paget.  For those, one would have to buy a facsimile volume such as \\"The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes\\" which is still in print and reviewed elsewhere.
0783240287|2.0|This particular DVD had some sound troubles.   At times the volume would go down and it was hard to hear.   Then it would go up and be too loud.  I have another copy of this musical and it had no problems so I think I just got a faulty DVD.
0877180121|4.0|I keep this book and its sequel on my piano. Recently a friend came over with her 4 year-old daughter and started playing the lessons in the book. The two of them were able to make significant progress in about 30 minutes.<br /><br />I am using the activities to jump start my toddler's music exposure. She enjoys the cover, and the notes are simple enough to engage her. She is learning timing and correspondence between tone and piano key, and I am using the time to fine-tune my own understanding of piano playing.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a very good companion for your piano if you want to give guests and children the opportunity to play your piano and learn even with no previous lessons.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|Here's my two cents on the most recent radiohead release.  As a long time fan I've watched one of the most original and inspirational bands of the 90's stay both original and inspirational.. and at the same time lose me almost entirely as a fan.  The price you pay for changing styles is that you are going to alienate some of the long time fans.  That is what has happened with me.  I don't know what you want to call the new style of Radiohead but it's not the guitar driven \\"Paranoid Android\\" band I was crazy about all those years ago.. If you like the synth-pop direction they've embraced on Kid-A and Thom Yorks solo project.. the 5 star reviews on here are probably how you'll feel about this album. If you long for more of the Just/Paranoid Android days then save your money and look eslewhere.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|most reviews here are trying to place the voice - I say suzi quatro at her absolute best - \\"suicide\\", \\"if you can't give me love\\". etc....check it out....i hear they are sisters separated.
0142001104|5.0|The Art of Possibility is not a book you can read quickly.  It is a book that must be digested, like a succulent meal.  Each chapter presents a \\"practice.\\"  And, each chapter requires one to think and relate the practice to one's life.  The practice of giving everyone an A--that is, removing the competition and moving forward, requires thought and practice.  The practices of \\"being a contribution\\" or remembering \\"rule number 6,\\" require you to really access yourself and your view of the world.<br /><br />I loved reading the musical examples Ben gave us.  His experiences as a conductor with people in the world of art provided beautiful self-disclosure.  Both Ben and Rosamund helped unravel what seems so hard with clear, meaningful examples from their lives.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to my coaching clients, who are people full of possibility but are not sure how to tap it.<br /><br />This is a book that must be read more than once.  I can see it by my bedside table for years to come. Thank you for giving all of us the opportunity to create a life of possiblity where the downward spiral no longer exists.
1878424505|4.0|I'm glad that I found this book - it's a quick read that could easily be done in one sitting, and can (and should) be read over and over again.    \\"The Four Agreements' provides very useful advice.  True...it is common sense, but we easily forget the things that seem so basic and this leads to stress and problems.    The four basic pieces of advice from the book are: Be impeccable with your word, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and always do your best.  I tend to have a particularly hard time remembering to do the second two things (don't take anything personally and don't make assumptions), so these two chapters really resonated with me.   Great book - the author presents the four basic principles (or, agreements) in a way that makes a lot of sense.
0812550706|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book and did not realize it was so highly rated by Amazon, so perhaps that is why there are reader's reviews that are disappointed.   Pleasantly surprised and happily delighted; the story moves with a good pace, the characters are strong and the dilemma's faced are well thought out.  I thoroughly enjoyed this read and hope you do as well.  So, before reading, knock your expectations down a bit and give the book a better chance on its own.
0553293397|4.0|I have read many of the thousands of words on this book. Most people seem to have read and enjoyed it, as they should. So I won't add too many more - that ain't necessary. All I will say is that, overlooking the relative thinness of the characterizations, after reading the book (and its predecessor) you might very well go back to the J. Watson / R. Sherlock Holmes stories with an enhanced perception.
0553381687|5.0|If you're a fan of fantasy and haven't read this book yet, what are you doing?  This book is awesome.  The characters, the plot, the writing style are all superb.  This guy used to write for TV, so he doesn't waste time writing superfluous descriptions or unnecessary dialog (well, not in this book or it's sequel...the other's having gotten longer and longer). If you're looking for great writing, read this book!  If you're looking for a series you can complete, then I would wait till Martin is finished writing all of them.  It took him an extremely long time to write the last books.
0920236162|5.0|This is one of my \\"Top Ten\\" children's books. It was given to my daughter by her aunt when she was born, and it has become a favorite of mine to read to her at night (my daughter that is - I don't read to her aunt). A great story for instilling the idea in a young girl that fairytales don't always end up the way you may think they will. Interestingly enough, it was also the perfect book for me to send to my 30 year old cousin, who had just broken up with her \\"bum\\" of a fiance! Plenty of fish in that big, blue sea.<br />Peace.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Continuing Firefly, or rather crash landing it to a reasonable conclusion, Serenity continues Firefly's Wild-West without-Indians in-space adventure so  as to more than satisfy fans of the show, which I recommend watching first (it helps explain some of the emotions and interactions between characters in the film). Without having seen Firefly's one partial season the movie is still fascinating and informed viewers will enjoy the \\"[uni]verse\\" finally focusing on the possibly government mind-controlled River and the crews discovery of its cover-up and the downplay of the failed romance, and chemistry, between the Captian and Inara.<br /><br />In regards to the premise, a space western, if you where going to avoid this movie based on that, you're not reading this review anymore. In summary, the crew of the Firefly are much as Confederate veterans of the US civil war, having fought on the losing side and now witnessing exploitation at the hands of the new government worse than that they fought for or against. Though its missing the \\"unpleasant slavery associations\\" this seems a reasonable picture of the south and I would not worry, but the additional deletion of American Indian issues from the universe of Serenity is transforms the final message of the series and movie from the brilliant seemingly Foucault inspired insights Joss is capable of.<br /><br />One hopes Joss simply didn't realize he was depicting a racist's rosy-red vision of the south in which the North is the source of all bad and the only glory to be won is exploration and Indian killing. Perhaps the the mysterious \\"ravers\\" are not the Firefly/Serenity equivalent to Native Americans, as they are skin wearing soulless mass murderers who are the only danger along the \\"Frontier\\", and that Joss does not believe Indian people are \\"beyond madness\\".<br /><br />In my rosy-red vision the Reavers represent a portion of us each, each of us being oppressed by the US government, but some of have a harder time with it. Luckily, whatever Joss's intentions may have been he is rarely mistaken when it comes to individuals and characters and I have no complaint with the depiction of race within them. However, I still hope that before his next project Joss undertakes some research in Native American Studies and patches the spot of blaring ignorant Eurocentrism shown here and in the notorious \\"Thanksgiving episode\\" of Buffy. 4 STARS QUALITY. 5 STARS ENJOYABILITY.intentions may have been he is rarely mistaken when it comes to individuals and characters and I have no complaint with the depiction of race within them.

B000SNUMC0|2.0|Shaffer's head is too big. I listened to an interview with him and he actually ripped on bands like Helloween and Manowar, bands that have been around longer than his!  He seems to think his poo doesnt stink.  I love Iced Earth up until The Glorious Burden, where many of the songs are Iron Maiden rip offs.  The need Barlow back to get the band where is should be.  The Ripper guy is a good sinder, but he changed the whole dynamic of the band. This album is pretty boring and typical. Nothing new here to get you going.  BARLOW! BARLOW!  I did hear that Barlow is coming back!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!
B000H5TVKI|5.0|Every time I have had to upgrade my video format be it VHS to Laserdisc to DVD to now Blu-ray, First Blood has always been my Litmus test.This is in my top three all time favorite movies and it always seems to be available when a new format emerges.The Blu-ray has the best transfer so far out of all the previous ones and I am very picky when I say this.This is a film that was filmed darkly as far as films go and the Blu-ray version has the best contrast and detail yet.Please check for yourself, you will not be disappointed.The only gripe here is when will we ever see the footage from the TV version make it to the light of day.But anyways check out this version, you will not be disappointed.
B000062YAZ|5.0|First of all, to all the people with non-intelligent negative reviews, first read this (assuming you can actually read).   [...]    As Suicidal Tendencies ranted:  \\"Just cause you don't understand what's going on  don't mean it don't make no sense  And just cause you don't like it,  don't mean it ain't no good\\"    Not proper English but the message is still clear.    I was already a Slayer fan when this came out and it absolutely floored me. Keep in mind that members of Slayer have stated they were never just a metal band, they were a metal/punk/hardcore crossover, as evidenced in Undisputed Attitude. My common response to people who criticize music for 'just being fast' is \\"why is your music all slow\\"? Analyze many bands and you'll find most play within their own comfortable range of BPMs but don't exceed on either end of the spectrum.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I think this was a great way to show everyone how our system works but no one is listening. Which is a shame on us.This was a great documentary on our Health Care.
0439813786|4.0|I bought this for my seven year old son who asked for it knowing it was the most recent Caldecott Award winner (this is important to him).  We have gotten to the middle of the book and he has put it down and not asked to continue.  The illustrations are amazing and the storyline is very interesting... it is a VERY different kind of picture book.  The story and the characters are very deep.  The story includes/explains how the orphaned boy lost his father - he was locked in a room during a fire and couldn't escape.  Then the boy's alcoholic uncle took over care for the boy before he wandered off.  I think this is the part that is upsetting/confusing and a bit much for him.  However, it did win the Caldecott award and that makes it worth reading continuing and reading again.  I just won't do it until he asks.  I gave it four stars because I enjoyed the story, not because my son did.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|There really are some gems on this album.  A number of the songs come from the \\"The Cost\\", another album from Hansard, but when Hansard and Irglova sing together the combination can be absolutely outstanding (at times angelic with Irglova's voice).  The album's a home run and highly recommended.  (For my two cents, the best song on the album is \\"Once\\")
0060989157|5.0|This is a great book, the ones with the most struggle are Nikki Sixx and Vince Neil.  Another reviewer had it right Tommy is spoiled.  Mick Mars has just proven once again that he is a mystery that no one can crack. I would have like to have seen more from him, maybe with his memoirs (?).    When reading this you should really read Nikki Sixx's book The Heroin Diaries.  It gives a broader insight to the whole band and how far everyone, especially he had sunk.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt has done it again.  Not only that 1973 is the best year ever but also it is a beautiful song as well.  My favourite track on the album is \\"I Really Want You\\".  Blunt has a voice that is soothing and he keeps the musical instruments simple and you can't help but to just fall in love with the melody.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I am a huge fan of the first movie and have a special place for it in my heart. Unfortunately by the time Reloaded came around the Wachowskis lost their magic. The only way to fix this would be to come out with a 4th movie where neo comes back and destroys the entire matrix. Anyhow, The Matrix Reloaded can't stand toe to toe with The Matrix. Nice action scenes but the story is convoluted and the questions never get reconciled.at Zion has, why does it look like they are all in poverty?  Why does Morpheus need neo at all??  For all the time they had, and technology in Zion, didn't they realize that nuking the machines on the surface was their only choice in ending the war? Killing everyone in the matrix to shut it all down becomes the ONLY satisfactory option when the machines are dangerous to the small, surviving, population of Zion. The movie doesnt address this fact.    Neo had no single agenda, whether it be staying with Trinity, killing smith, or killing off the matrix.   If they had stuck to a single resolve many of my negative points and plot holes would not have arisen. But look what happened, they didnt. That makes for a poor, unemotional, hodge podge puppet show that cost millions of dollars to make.    The real viruses are the wachowski brothers for wasting my time and money on this series.
0060589469|5.0|I enjoyed this book in a way far greater than any book I have ever read before.  This story makes you think and ponder questions just as the main character is doing.  The story is told in the first person and you get a unique view into the mind of a man who is on the razor edge of genius and insanity.      I have read this book twice and enjoyed the second read even more than the first.  Many insights into the nature of things (don't want to spoil anything for first-time readers).    There are many small scenes of perhaps half a page that still stick with me and help me understand the nature of people.    I am a better person for having read this and I thank the author for sticking with this book and getting it published where other mere mortals would have given up.    The author has his own trials and tribulations and mentions these after the end of the story.    I will spend many years, I fear, searching for another book as insightful and enjoyable as this book has been for me.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|What an amazing show.  I havent laughed so hard and pulled so many one liners from a tv show in a long time.  If you were a fan of the show 'Friends' then I think you'll enjoy How I Met your Mother.  Watching the gag reel and listening to the commentary on the episodes makes this dvd a must own for HIMYM fans.<br /><br />You should purchase this dvd, watching just one episode will get you hooked.<br /><br />Its going to be legen... wait for it...
B000UBMWG4|4.0|Blade Runner is a five star movie.  So why have I given this box-set only 4 stars?  I won't go on about the merits of Ridley Scott's landmark movie as it's a classic, pure and simple.  Instead this review is based purely on the Blu-Ray presentation.    Now I had this set (the tin box version) on Standard DVD at Christmas and fell in love with it.  Everything about it was breathtaking.  From the box design right through to the actual content on the 5 discs.    However when we come to this Blu-Ray release there are problems.  Firstly the Final Cut has a fair amount of noise throughout the film.  The most apparent artifacting is seen early on during the scene when Deckard is interviewing Rachel: Tyrell's head completely breaks up into tiny white pixels!!!!!!!  Considering Warner's spent a fortune on a 4K digital clean up this is unacceptable.    Next Disc 3 (the other 3 versions Blade Runner) - Apart from the brilliant and seamless branching, this has even more noise, especially on the FX shots which now look horrid.    Disc 5: The Workprint - by far the worst picture quality you will ever see on a Blu-Ray release.  Imagine a filthy battered old VHS tape dragged though a desert dipped in oil and then transferred to a HD disc, that will give you some idea as to what you'll be looking at.  You've been warned.    Finally Disc's 2 & 4.  The only problem I have with these special features is that they are presented in Standard DVD.  This is a big issue I have.  If a studio isn't prepared to upscale special features to HD then forget it, I'd rather stick with the normal DVD release, it's far cheaper too.  Sure the content on these two discs are amazing, superb deleted scenes, featurette's and the best documentary you will ever see.    So a disappointing release on the new format.    My advice is to stick with the Standard DVD set as this is a real mixed bag and any problem with the prints are only highlighted on HD.
0765348276|4.0|At the age of 75, he goes to war and discovers that the universe is a lot stranger than it originally appeared. He meets his wife's second incarnation and falls in love again.  He becomes a hero.<br /><br />This is an amazing work of imagination that asks large questions. What does it mean to be human? What would one trade for a second chance at life?  The character of the protagonist is finely drawn: an old man given a young body with superhuman powers. Geeks will love the gee-whiz gadgets like Brain-Pal and philosophers will find plenty of ethical conundrums to chew on. This is the first book of a trilogy.  However it stands alone and is completely satisfying by itself.<br /><br />John Scalzi has postulated a rather depressing universe that is like human prehistory: endless tribal wars over territory.  This is either a failure to imagine beyond human limitations or stark probability; the good news is we don't know yet.

0307387151|3.0|Our book club of six discussed ATONEMENT after 5 of us read it and one saw the movie. 3 of us agreed that it was a little difficult to follow because of there being so many words; and it was a novel within a novel. I should have read more detailed reviews of the novel before reading it. We were trying to describe this type of literature among today's writings. \\"Wordy descriptions and loose connections\\" is what I concluded after our discussion. Even Part II, which moves better that Part I presumes connections that one misses unless one is wide awake! This is not a book to read when one is sleepy!
B000000W5P|5.0|After having produced five great albums in a row--Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Get Yer Ya-Yas Out (A concert album), Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Street--the Rolling Stones put out a series of lesser works.  Each had some excellent songs on them, but they were pretty uneven, certainly not up to the standards of the \\"Fab Five\\" that preceded them. \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" had songs like \\"Angie\\"; \\"It's Only Rock and Roll\\" had the title song; \\"Black and Blue\\" had some good cuts, too.  But nothing like those earlier albums mentioned above.<br /><br />And then \\"Some Girls\\" came out and, for an instant, it was the glory days of the Rolling Stones again.  Starting off with \\"Miss You,\\" the CD begins strongly.  Song after song appears, each strong and some \\"top of their game\\" songs. Among special cuts for me. . . .<br /><br />Their cover version of The Temptations' \\"Just My Imagination (Running away with Me)\\" is terrific.  The Stones have often done justice to the work of other songwriters and performers (e.g., many of the blues songs that they have covered over time compare well with blues greats who originated them), and this is another example.  The lascivious \\"Some Girls\\" offended (quite understandably) many listeners, but it is also fine rock and roll.<br /><br />Keith's obligatory solo, \\"Before They Make Me Run\\" is one of his better turns.  One reviewer many years ago referred to this as his \\"non-apology\\" for his lifestyle.  \\"Beast of Burden\\" is another terrific song.<br /><br />And the CD closes with the rip roaring \\"Shattered.\\" Compare with their earlier \\"Hot Stuff.\\"  The term \\"Shattered\\" recurs throughout this cut, illustrating their perceptions of New York.  One line:<br /><br />\\"Bite the Big Apple--don't mind the maggots.\\"<br /><br />Another: \\"Rats on the Westside, bedbugs uptown.\\"<br /><br />Hardly a Chamber of Commerce ad for New York City!  But the song has the kind of life that drips from the tracks of those great five albums in a row.  Great way to close the album!  Yep, this is a real deal Rolling Stones album.  Wish there were a lot more like this after its appearance in 1978, but most since then have featured a few terrific songs with a drop-off in excitement and quality after those (I have already reviewed one of the latter fine albums--\\"Bigger Bang\\" and I'll probably take a shot at a couple other choice efforts later on, too).Wish there were a lot more like this after its appearance in 1978, but most since then have featured a few terrific songs with a drop-off in excitement and quality after those (I have already reviewed one of the latter fine albums--\\"Bigger Bang\\" and I'll probably take a shot at a couple other choice efforts later on, too).

B00005OWEG|4.0|It's been about twenty years since I saw the original cut of \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" so I didn't know the film well enough to recognize the added scenes in the \\"Redux\\" version.  Watching it, though, I felt that it was too long and there were some sequences that just didn't seem to work.  It was also my impression that the overall film lacked the impact that my first viewing of it had, but I didn't know whether to blame that on changes in the film or changes in myself.  Reading the reviews here, I find that the scenes I didn't like were all among the additions.  The theft of Kilgore's board and meeting the Playboy Bunnies took situations that had just the right degree of absurdity and pushed them over the line into farce.  The French plantation scene was just plain slow, dull, and pedantic.  This remains an important and rewarding film, but next time I think I'll watch the original cut.

0810994739|4.0|This book is only about perfect. The art is simple but irresistable. The writing is simple but keeps you reading. What's better, the pictures often tell the story and the writing only alludes to it. It's in the first person, and that's been done, say on Nick's Doug. It was also done in Little Lulu comic books. But the first person journal (or diary) is an excellent way to write. The brilliant thing is to combine it with compelling drawing. Manny looks a bit like a character from Matt Groening's Life in Hell. The cover drawing is just about perfect. You can tell that Rodrick just pushed Greg, without the need for any action lines. The understated expressions yet perfectly convey their emotions. The cover even has glossy pieces of tape on the corners of the picture. And of course, it looks like a diary (which is what it is). It's not meant to be story strong or overdone like a graphic novel or stuffed into four tiny squares as the newspaper comics are these days. It's its own form, but nevertheless, doesn't hit you over the head with a moral, tie up into a too tidy ending, or get schmaltzy like \\"for kids\\" movies.<br /><br />I heard this comic started on the Internet. If so, the Internet just went up a couple points in my book. Here are reasons not to read this book. The book before it was number one on the New York Times Bestseller list. That's no reason to read a book (or the New York Times). The best selling non-fiction book of the entire decade of the '70s never once appeared on that list. And have you seen the books on there? Another bad reason is that it gets kids reading. Have you seen what gets passed off as kids' books these days? Let kids find good books to read (here's one).<br /><br />If a man lies in bed, let him do it for no reason at all, Chesterton wrote in an essay called-- ready?-- \\"On Lying in Bed\\". \\"Then he will get up a healthy man.\\" If a kid (of any age) reads this book. let him or her do it for the best reason-- no reason at all, and he or she will close the cover a healthy kid.ver a healthy kid.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|This is another instance where hype leads to disappointment. Saw was a big \\"word-of-mouth\\" film when it came out in theaters. It was supposedly \\"different\\". Not typical horror, more of a mix of twisted psychological horror, suspense, and whodunit. It wasn't a gore fest by any means (although it's pretty darn gruesome at times). And some people loathe it for that because they expected copious amounts of blood and gore, and Saw didn't really deliver that.<br /><br />Its story and devices smack of \\"The Abominable Doctor Phibes\\", or the serial killer movie \\"Se7en\\" ... even a scenario from \\"Suspiria\\" is borrowed. \\"Saw\\" plays with several genres including the detective story. It comes off at first viewing as engaging but truly it's not a fun movie by any means. Some horror movies are fun because they are truly scary and entertaining. Saw is not entertaining enough or truly scary; it's fairly suspenseful and feels tantalizing in its puzzles, but it needs more than that to succeed. But to be fair, when you consider that this was a low budget indy movie, its tremendous success is really impressive.<br /><br />I'm not going to describe the premise or plot too much. Too many reviews for Saw start by saying \\"These two guys wake up chained to a pipe in a disgusting bathroom...\\" and they begin to delve into a nutshell synopsis. You'll find out what it's about when you watch it.<br /><br />Saw doesn't really quite know what it is, or what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie? Some say yes, others deny it vehemently. Yes, it's stylish enough (but sometimes the silly sped-up cinematography gets too obvious, like the film is trying hard to be cool), and the twisted scenarios that the psycho has dreamed up are pretty disturbing. But there seems to be not really enough meat here. When it's finished we are left feeling a bit empty... like what we just experienced was just an exercise in sadism, and not much more. And the entire story falls apart when carefully scrutinized. It's a bit disappointing when you see so much potential at the start, and then witness the movie fizzling/struggling until its surprise ending.<br /><br />Bottom line: worth a look for horror buffs, but overall nothing to scream about.e so much potential at the start, and then witness the movie fizzling/struggling until its surprise ending.

B000XUUQQK|4.0|First and foremost, this movie was not a continuation of Boogeyman.  In some ways, I feel that it should have had it's own unique title to make this distinction more clear.  If you liked the first movie, do not go to this movie, expecting it to be more of the same.  No aspect of Boogeyman 2 bore resemblance to the first.      What I found to be curious were the slight similarities between Boogeyman 2 and some of the Saw movie traits.  Individuals were forced to face their fears in a fashion that ultimately threatened to destroy them.  In one instance, a tape recording is used to indicate the type of \\"therapy\\" that one man needed to conquer his phobia.  While the action taken to facilitate this so-called healing was a stretch, it did make a gory point.  How did this not have similarities to the Saw movies?  The individuals were not actually being tested or given a chance to save themselves.  They were simply placed in a situation and motivated to kill themselves with no hope of surviving.      I did not anticipate the plot twist in the end.  I think that, perhaps, what causes many people to be upset with this movie is the fact that the viewer is led to believe their assumptions are correct, only to then be shown that they were wrong.  It brings a sense of insecurity and almost insults the intelligence of the viewer.  Nevertheless, as an audience, we have already consented to be subject to these twists and turns.  Instead of being offended that we were fooled, it should instead be a delightful present to be surprised with the unexpected.  If you like gore, I encourage you to watch.  If you have a light stomach, find something else.

075640407X|5.0|All I ask from a fantasy book is that it have interesting and likable characters, decent writing, and a plot that is moving in some discernible direction.  It doesn't need to have breathtaking prose or astonishing originality; it just has to be enjoyable.  Unfortunately these three components are shockingly hard to find in many books.    The Name of the Wind had me cheering for the talented narrator, Kvothe, the whole way.  Sure, he's maybe a bit too perfect, and sometimes a little condescending towards the reader (with his too-frequent interjections telling us \\"you wouldn't understand...\\"), but the whole story is just so fun!  It's a story about the making of a hero, and although he may not be as big as his legend, he still has to be a bit larger than life.  If you enjoy the traditional somewhat cliche-ridden fantasy fare, but wish it could be told with a livelier voice and better writing, you will love this book just as much as I did.      I am only saddened that it will be so long until the next book comes out--that's what I get for reading a series that is still in progress.  I will never learn. :(
0452289963|3.0|I have mixed feelings about \\"A New Earth\\". While I thought some very good points were made, I didn't find it easy to read because the style of writing is so dense. Many of the ideas that Tolle presents are not original (e.g. how we interpret people or events is a result of our own thoughts or egos, we must strive to live in the present moment), but they are still well made and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Some parts of the book do get hard to follow.  While Tolle acknowledges this, he also tells us that if we find the book incomprehensible and meaningless, it means that we have not begun the process of awakening - i.e. any fault is with the reader, which strikes me as a cop out.  Tolle also implies that his view is the only correct way of viewing the world, with sentences like: \\"If you don't become speechless when looking out into space on a clear night, you are not really looking, not aware of the totality of what is there.\\"<br /><br />My main criticism of this book is that I didn't find it of much help in a practical sense. Tolle talks a lot about how you can effect change in yourself by bringing awareness to situations. This has not been my personal experience - while I agree it's the first step, I think sometimes we need a little more \\"how-to\\" guidance if we are to make real change.  Often when I was reading this book I'd think: \\"wow, that's such a great point he's just made\\", but then it would get kind of lost as the book moved on. And ultimately it comes across as being a bit selfish.  This idea that your spouse may leave you and your friends may drift away when you achieve spiritual growth, but that's all for the good.<br /><br />To get the most out of \\"A New Earth\\", you probably want to read it slowly and let each chapter sit with you for a while before moving onto the next. Even better, have someone to discuss it with as you go and help you to explore the apparent contradictions e.g. when Tolle says on one hand that you don't want to dwell on the future but stay in the present, and then on the other hand he says that you must have a goal or vision that you are working towards.  There is definitely a lot of interesting material in here, but I have found other books to be more accessible and useful.t, and then on the other hand he says that you must have a goal or vision that you are working towards.

B00005JPMZ|5.0|I just loved this film. I was so nostalgic that I watched it twice both with a big ol smile on my face. Though even if I hadn't been a fan as a child I would have still enjoyed this movie. It has character development, action, comedy, and a collective team orientation- even the foot soldiers joined the turtles to overcome the obstacle. I think its a great film for any age. I am also pleased that they will be another (based on how it ended.) The only thing that as a female bothered me is how they portray females even in animation. In this animation April and the leader of the foot soldiers were both sexy gals with tremendous curves- couldn't we get the average gals with the average physiques (I don't remember April being vuluptous and she def wasn't sexy besides she looks like a Teenager herself in this one and she should be atleast in the mid to late 20's.)
B0002S947K|5.0|I was just starting to believe I'd never be emotionally devastated by an album again. I kept listening to my old Joni Mitchell & Cat Stevens,   wondering why nothing recent or new was making me feel anything. I thought it meant I was getting old. I had come to dread shopping because of the piped in \\"music\\" - I can't bear it. I'd turn on the radio and shake my head in bewilderment. Anyway, it is a crime that few people have heard of Ray LaMontagne. It is a total fluke that I came to own this fantastic album - I saw a clip of Susan Tedeschi singing a song called, \\"Shelter\\" and I couldn't breathe. I had to know who wrote the song.     Long story later, this CD gets popped into my mailbox curtesy of Amazon. I put it on the stereo and everyone in the room fell silent. Even my kids, and they never shut up. This is a voice that comes along once in a generation - he reminds me a bit of Otis Redding; he has a nice rasp, as though his vocal chords are coated in dust. I can't say enough about him -  his singing gives me chills, his lyrics bring tears to my eyes. What joy this single human being has given me.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|How to say this.... I am a long time radiohead fan, i have bought each and everyone one of their albums as they have come out, and enjoyed nearly everyoe one of them (except pablo honey of course) but without a doubt there  greatest musical achievement was Kid A. I like the latter era of radioehad much more than the beginning, so all i could possibly think when this long over do album was coming out was \\"thank god, new radiohead, they can't possibly go wrong.\\" Well, they did. This record compltely lacks all the energy of their other recordings. The only two songs with any energy are the first two tracks, 15 step and bodysnatchers. from there on out it is soft musical ballads with little constrast, so right off the bat, the track listing is horrible. This album has some beautiful songs, but it just isn't radiohead, it is a mellowed down version of ok computer mixed with dave mathews (who sucks). Honestly, if you are into spending money, i suggest the discbox,it is a nice collectors item, but the second disc is riddled with songs about twice as good as anything on in Rainbows.

B0012QE4QC|4.0|King Henry VIII's (Eric Bana) growing tired of first wife, the Spanish Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) since she cannot bear him a son. The Duke of Norfolk (Morrissey) and Sir Thomas Boleyn (Rylance) offer young Anne Boleyn (Portman) a 'commission'.  If she becomes the King's mistress, she will both advance the family's interests and secure a ducal marriage for herself.     Anne's mother objects with the review's tagline and more, but Anne's intrigued.  Unfortunately, the men's advice on a hunt to 'ride strong' gets the King injured and ill-disposed to Anne, who showed herself a better rider than he.  When just-wed Mary (Scarlett Johansson) is sent to tend the King, he fancies her instead and sends for her to court.     Soon, Mary's husband is disposed of, and King and younger Boleyn girl are having a torrid affair.  When Mary lies in with Henry's child, the balance switches.  Anne is brought in \\"only to keep the King's interest on Mary.\\"     The following film details Henry's subsequent 'beguilement' by the older Boleyn sister, and Anne's rise and fall.  While the historical accuracy isn't there, it's an interesting tale.     Eric Bana would not have been my choice for Young Henry Tudor.  While he's handsome enough, he doesn't look the part.  Scarlett Johansson was the performer who I thought luminous in this tale of court intrigue.     I suspect this film will get the nod at the 2008 Oscars for Costuming. The garb was gorgeous and beautifully detailed. The film's a treat just for Ren Faire junkies just to see what everyone's wearing.     \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is based on the historical fiction of the same title by Philippa Gregory.

It is about growing in love and maturity through the life span.  I heard it the first time read aloud, after my children were grown. The story captures well the emotions and feelings in the parent-child relationship.  A must for every family's reading.

0451528956|4.0|A quick, enjoyable read, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde provides something of a reflection on the end of the spirit of alchemy which strove to connect the physical and the metaphysical through an almost-mystical mingling of the sciences with spirituality.  Without cutting into the deeper considerations of philosophical schools, it is without question that humanity exists as a combination of various good and wicked impulses, although the promptings of such impulses will forever be relegated to the reflections of theologians and philosophers.  In any case, the story of Henry Jekyll and his desire to remove from himself the inherent weakness of our somewhat duplicitous, multi-faced nature is the story of each member of humanity.  It is our combined quest to always aim higher and to overcome those weakness which chain us to the lower strata of the waking world.    However, Henry Jekyll's story is also that of each fallen man who often attempts to ameliorate his condition by using his own power.  It is also the story of a society which believes that it is within its collective power to create the world anew in holiness without the internal rectitude necessary to affect true change.  His isolated alchemical processes expose him to the dubious character of Edward Hyde, an apparition of his dark, untamed humanity, which arrives on the scene precisely as Jekyll attempts to create himself anew by his own strength alone.  The story of the good doctor's fall into a fancy for this darker side of himself is a fine example of the destruction of spirit which comes when the individual believes himself to be the sole master of his own amelioration.  His own individualistic tendencies and their ultimate end are a continuous warning to all of humanity, for the same character flaws which are expressed with such noble intentions in Dr. Jekyll's character are those same well-intentioned hopes of all humanity which often lead to our own power-derived slip into the bowels of hell.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|The movie starts has great pace with the early Beatle lyrics blended beautifully into the screen dialog.  About half way into the movie the songs get too somber and the pace gets too morbid.  Julie Taynor's puppet effects that were used in the Lion King slows the movie and it attempts to be too trippy and we get dragged through these boring drug sequences that were too long and gimmicky.  The Beatle music was sung at a pace that added new style and meaning.  I loved the Beatles and thank Julie Traynor for even a vain attempt.
0307346617|4.0|Perhaps I am unfair in giving Brooks' story between a 3.25 and a 3.75, for I did enjoy \\"World War Z\\" as I read it after receiving it as a Christmas gift from my younger sister.  Because of my overall like of dystopic narratives, this text fits very well with my overall likes and dislikes and was on the whole palatable.  Brooks' scope is global, while he does retain a specific focus on the West, particularly America.  In considering the global scope of the Zombie War, the author takes a temporally-driven approach which follows the infestation through its catastrophic spread to the final stands of humanity.      On the whole, the text attempts to be a political commentary fused with the zombie story, something that I suppose gives shudders to those who stand on the opposite side of the \\"political divide\\" (a rhetorical device which continues to ossify itself into a sad reality) from Mr. Brooks.  I will admit that I probably am in many ways far more conservative than Max is and would cordially disagree with his policies in this precise moment in time.  However, what makes his text enjoyable is the fact that he does not merely incarnate his political opinions in some sort of thriller genre.  Instead, he takes the opportunity to consider the questions raised both by and in the zombie war and what they mean for humanity's future.  He considers how the soul of humanity may be affected microscopically as well as macroscopically in such a conflict, how the shattered realities and lessons and memories of war would change the face of the globe.    It is in this regard that I am perhaps the most disappointed in the text, for I feel that it emphasizes to shallowly (if in a greater number of words nevertheless) the \\"microscopic\\", interpersonal dimension of growth of mankind in the conflict.  Too often the fictitious conversations do not seem as though they dig deeply enough into the disappointed and frustrated souls, particularly in the West which have come to realize the bitterness of the eclipse of a period of human history, a history which could have ended had humanity been but a bit more narcissistic.  The moments when depth could burst forth on each continent, it seems that bitter breadth is ultimately that which is expressed by the \\"interviewed\\" subjects.  Of course, perhaps that is the point of the author, that we even lack the depth to realize the depth of the questions which are before us today.    Although I was disappointed in the lack of introspective dialogue, I do highly recommend Brooks' work and still give it 4 / 5 stars even though it was disappointing only insofar as I truly feel that it was on the edge of something very great.
B000UX6THK|4.0|I am not writing about how great a show that Twin Peaks was because I am doubtful you will invest this kind of money based on \\"fan boy\\" reviews.  Now to the point:  There's only full screen, no wide screen.  That's perfectly all right.  It's TV, not cinema, they filmed it in full screen.  Some people experienced problems with the menus on discs 4 & 6.  I had no such problems on my inexpensive, late model Samsung.  The post cards included with the set are a unique touch.  But there's no booklet listing the contents of the discs.  If you like to have the paper, be forewarned.
B000JSI7AI|2.0|Many beautiful nature shots can't redeem this dull and overly long flick. There is no real chemistry between the two main characters. The one sex scene is dark, frantic, and anti-erotic. Other than for some rough housing, there is little to make one think these guys are attracted to one another. Too much time is spent on their separate lives. It would have been interesting to get a glimpse of their inner lives, perhaps their fantasies, given they were so adamant about getting together at Brokeback Mountain every year while they were married to women. This director clearly knows nothing about what attracts one person to another.
B000OVLBEO|1.0|When the screen isn't being filled with horrible CGI effects, the small amount of acting required is nothing short of awful. A twenty page comic book written over thirty years ago has more character depth! The \\"bad guys\\" look like something out of an episode of the TV series \\"Angel\\". Pathetic!    I've seen a lot of bad comic book adaptions in recent years, but this one pretty much takes the cake.    JM
B000HCO83Q|1.0|There's nothing wrong with a bit of mindless, escapist entertainment from time to time. But I've just about had it with today's crop of mind numbing, CGI infested, super hero stink-fests!    I thought the original X-Men movie was a decent, big budget \\"B-Movie\\". The second film was a typical sequel, and ended up being a step down from the original. This third installment is both poorly written and poorly directed. It's a simple \\"by the numbers\\" sequel that leaves a LOT to be desired. If all you're looking for is CGI effects, then maybe you'll enjoy this mess.    Don't expect to actually care about ANY of the characters in this film, because the script writers obviously didn't. It seems they were too busy thinking up mindless battle scenes. Also, whatever you do, don't actually THINK about the \\"powers\\" that some of the characters possess, or you'd soon realize that if they actually USED them, most of the action scenes wouldn't even last a few minutes.    I actually collected X-Men comics back in the late 70's and early 80's, and I can tell you that there was more character depth in the pages of each one those thin comics than in this entire film!    JM
B00104W8T6|5.0|I knew right at the opening of the film, Juno, that I would buy this soundtrack.  The music adds to the timbre and rhythm of the film. The soundtrack resonates with a wonderful sound.

I plan to keep JUNO in my sound library for quite a long while.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Based on a book by author Daniel Wallace, Tim Burton's Big Fish embodies many components of a typical Burton film--fantasy, odd characters, imagery, mystical settings--yet, in this instance, it does it with a Southern flavor. The film's main crux is a father-son struggle, and we see them struggle between what is a tall tale and what is truth, what is fact and what is fiction, and what is reality and what is exaggerated. The son, Will (Billy Crudup), has had to listen to his father's tall tales for years, and he believes that this has created a rift between he and his father for years, and that he doesn't know who his \\"real\\" father is behind all these fantastical tales. Edward Bloom, who reminisces into the past with tall tales, has many imaginative adventures, including a walk through supposedly haunted woods, an encounter with a witch and a giant man, joining a traveling circus, and trying to get the girl of his dreams.     Tim Burton's capacity to create symbolism, eccentric characters, colorful scenery and depth in this story help to make it an exceptional film. One of the more telling points of the film is when Bloom, as a youngster, goes through a dark path to find the town of Spector, a sort of Utopia, where everyone stays because they never want to leave. Bloom decides that it isn't right for him to be there, and, while leaving, he promises a young girl that he will come back to the town sometime in the future when he's \\"meant to\\" come back. While here, he also meets a struggling poet (Steve Buschemi), who he later winds up helping rob a bank. Later in the story, he realizes why he must come back to this town.     What I also enjoyed about this film is that there wasn't just an emphasis on plot and imagery; there is also some depth. Some life lessons that the son must learn are to appreciate those close to you and to have faith in something that seems far-fetched or implausible. When learning of his father's decline in health, the son attempts to tie those bonds that have kept them at a distance. He learns that truth and fantasy are closer than he thinks.     This is a unique film, with some beautiful scenery, exceptional casting, and interesting storytelling.
0790729733|5.0|The brilliance in this film's production is that, by the artful interweaving of historical footage with the dramatic scenes, the finished product seems like an insightful, revisionist documentary. This is the film's strength and weakness, because it is primarily historical fiction in that Jim Garrison's point of view is presented as incontrovertible fact. I would caution those viewing the film, who may have no familiarity with the Kennedy assasination, that its plot not only presents Jim Garrison (of whom I'd never heard before seeing \\"JFK\\") in quite a different light than any Google search would reveal, but even distorts actual individuals with whom the real Garrison had dealings.<br /><br />If one can detach oneself from the slanted version of the facts, it is a totally rivetting film. Kevin Costner heads a sterling cast - the acting is superb, and so believable that, despite the many familiar faces of fine actors whom one has seen in many roles, one nearly has the impression of having an inside look at 'real people' revealing secret dimensions to the evidence. For example, Ed Asner shows a shocking side to the attitudes towards the assasination which some in Dallas may have held (seeing the murderer as hero, where I'd always thought of Kennedy as an esteemed, well loved president), with a rough but convincing demeanour which is both deep and chilling. Joe Pesci gives a multi dimensional picture, both moving and puzzling, of the bizarre David Ferry.<br /><br />I've rarely seen a lengthy film (and one in which I recognised significant innacuracy in relation to history) which so totally held my interest.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|Visually, the series is amazing. But the audio balance between narration and music is terrible.

I am really disappointed in the audio quality of these DVDs.
0312360266|1.0|If you are looking for a book like the Goddess Series, you can forget it. This is a teenage novel for young adults. Nevertheless, I would not want my teenager to read it. It clearly bashes families, relegions, and institutions. Although all the references to the classics might pour abit of learning into their brains, the plot of the book clearly moves a sixteen year old who has differences with her family into a place where she is the chosen. What teenager wouldn't like that.    There is one scene which allows the publisher to add \\"sexy\\" to the cover, and it is unneeded and disgusting for a young adult novel. It really bothered me that teenagers will be reading this book.  I read alot of my teens books and they never were quite so anti-establishment.    I didn't even like the romance if you could call it that. This is just my opinion but if your teenager wants to read this, I would definitely read it first.

1572704764|3.0|This one is okay but there are a lot better Christie audiobooks out there, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles,\\" being at the top. I have read \\"Sad Cypress\\", listened to the audiobook, and viewed the David Suchet (as Poirot) DVD. They all rate about the same.<br /><br />The story focuses upon a young heiress, (a jilted woman), whom is accused, tried, and convicted of vengefully poisoning another lovely young gal, the perceived thief of the former's fiance. A bachelor physician, who falls in love with the convicted heiress, desperately enlists the aide of the renowned Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, to ferret out the real killer. Poirot is working against time because the unfortunate heiress is about to be hanged.<br /><br />Unlike many of Christie's better mysteries, this one lacks sub-plots and is thus a bit two-dimensional. Also, a key piece of evidence uncovered by Poirot seems a bit contrived. I found myself, at places in this book, sighing and taking time out to go get a glass of water -- in other words, the work is not really compelling.<br /><br />If you're working your way through Christie's works (about 80 mystery books, along with the \\"Mary Westmacott\\" novels), this one is inevitable. But if you just want to listen to and/or read some great Christie, go with the aforementioned title or possibly, \\"The Clocks,\\" which is a super late-period work of Christie's.<br /><br />Christie mentions in her autobiography that she doesn't even recall writing some of her books... I think that this might just be one of those titles. Mildly recommended for cosy murder fans.

B0012QE4QC|3.0|THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer entered the theater without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters.  The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.<br /><br />King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances.  The younger Mary beds him first, does produce a son, but falls out of favor leaving Anne to work her newly honed skills of feminism learned during her exile in France on the easily seduced King to become his queen, yet is able to only bear him a daughter, Elizabeth. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.<br /><br />The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period.  But then, the movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch... Justin Chadwick directs. Grady Harp, March 08collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch...

630460291X|4.0|\\"Robin Hood: Prince of Theives\\" is an action-packed redo of the familiar Sherwood Forest epic, with Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, a crusader returning from captivity in the Holy Land to find his father murdered and his lands confiscated by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman).  Robin, accompanied by a Moorish bodyguard (Morgan Freeman), flees into the forest, there to find the gang of outlaws of which he quickly becomes leader.<br /><br />Robin Hood won't be left alone in the forest.  When the Sheriff captures some of Robin's merry men, and kidnaps Maid Marion, Robin and his remaining men will have to storm the Sheriff's castle.  The action is good to the last sword thrust, and there is a nice surprise cameo at the end of the movie by Sean Connerly, perfectly cast.  This isn't quite the standard telling of the Robin Hood, but there is enough acting to make it solidly entertaining and recommended.
079073804X|5.0|Why has The Exorcist become one of the most well known, influential, and important horror films of all time? I'll tell you why......because it had a very healthy budget and pushed the envelope. Two things that usually don't co-exist together in film. When The Exorcist was screened in the seventies people were literally throwing up at the theatre. How many films can you say that about that come out now? None! Coincidence? I think not! People in the film business now have this notion that you cant be professional and have extreme elements at the same time, and that's exactly the problem. Nobody will finance films like this anymore, that's why the 70's kicked a** and why horror films stink now. The Exorcist is disturbing, evil, dark, extreme, and professional. It's everything a horror film should be, and nothing like the films made nowadays. The main theme here is good vs. evil, and even if you dont normally have any religous beliefs......you will while watching The Exorcist.

185984054X|5.0|Concise, powerful and (supported) argument against the teflon image of Mother Teresa held by most (including myself, prior to reading this).  As some reviewers have asked, \\"is nothing sacred?\\"  The answer should be absolutely - nothing should be above examination.  We must not fail to critically examine Mother Teresa's life and legacy.  As Hitchens notes, our reputations should be based on a truthful account of our actions - our actions should NOT be viewed through the prism of our reputations.    Worth it alone for the reprint of the letter to Mother Teresa from the prosecutor in the Keating Savings and Loan case.  Mother Teresa had an agenda that was very much political - and not simply alleviating the suffering of the poor.    Challenge yourself to read it with an open mind for the facts.

Not a word wasted in his prose, with every sentence advancing the action. In this one, Reacher teams up with his former crew to avenge the brutal murder of special forces team members. Perhaps it's the presence of other protagonists that dilutes Reacher's impact in this book, but Child's lesser efforts still make for a very good read.

Although there are some hard hitting tunes with great melodic riffs and catchy rythems such as \\"Scream and Critically acclaimed\\", this album left me a little flat.

If you have a really sharp high-school age Youth Group at your church or synagogue, this film would make perfect watching for the group, with a lively discussion to follow.  On a completely different level, watch for a young David MacCallum as one of the Naval officers, just two years before he created a sensation on TV's \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\"  Everyone in this film delivers a superb performance.

B0012QE4QC|3.0|After reading Philippa Gregory's novel \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and finding it a head and neck above the normal bodice ripping fare, I awaited the film of the same name, directed by Justin Chadwick with anticipation, expecting the same interplay of jealousy, connivance and sympathy between the two main characters as depicted in the book.  Instead Peter Morgan's screenplay cuts to the chase rather literally, boiling down the relationship between Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary to simply that motivated by a touch of the old green monster.<br /><br />The book begins in London where lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine of Aragon, Mary unwittingly and unintentionally catches the king's roving eye to the delight of her scheming upwardly mobile family.  Anne, a recent returnee to Tudor-ville via the French court acts as staunch backer and campaign strategist to help her sister maintain her rise in status.  Brother George simply adores his two siblings and moves heaven and earth to help his family accomplish their objective in this velvet-and-ermine-clad sexually permissive jungle that vaguely suggests a more somberly Desperate Housewives at their hair-pulling best. The trio works together as a mini-coven, understanding their fate and trying their best to elevate the Boleyn standing in the British realm at the expense of their own personal happiness through any means.  Even though a basic knowledge of history spoils the ending of this tale, Gregory does her best to keep the bombardment of all these plots and machinations at an understandable yet intriguing pace.<br /><br />Not so with the film, although the overall motivation and maneuvering of the film Team Boleyn is no different.  After the opening shots of the trio as children romping in an amber-hued countryside, the audience is rather quickly propelled forward to the task at hand--Queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry's wife has failed to give him the male heir he so frantically desires--the Boleyn solution?  Showcase one of the saucy sisters to solace the king in his yearning with a little adultery and thereby procure a Boleyn-Tudor son.  Simple.  Raise the family stakes up an earldom or two to secure the families future for all generations. Cut to a boardroom-type scene where the Boleyns wait at their family estate for the arrival of the king like an over-starved bunch of crocodiles awaiting a barge of tasty morsels gone aground. Uncle Howard, played to slimeball perfection by David Morrissey and dear old dad Thomas--Mark Rylance imbues this character with anxious looks and an almost prescient wretchedness--push first daughter Boleyn forward even though mother Boleyn, the ever sophisticated Kirsten Scott Thomas cries out like a pre-feminist Greek chorus that no good will come from using her children like chattel. Enter wily brunette teaser Natalie Portman slithering provocatively with dark eyes all a-sparkle in sideways looks like a brilliant green snake in a bejeweled stomacher--her plan to wow the king with her expert horsemanship backfiring when she one ups Henry's lesser equestrian ability.  On his royal back, he is nursed by Mary of the pout-y lips (Scarlett Johansson), the pinch hitter whose golden beauty, Rubinesque form and utter submissiveness seem far more appealing (and easier to conquer) than sister Anne of the thousand tongue-in-cheek flirtations.<br /><br />As in the novel, Eric Bana's positively vainglorious Henry enthralls the love-starved Mary. But even after the procurement of the desired male heir, sister Anne's agenda sheet still bears a golden crown above her entwined initials--why settle for illegitimate when a fully legitimized heir could concrete the Boleyn legacy in the annals of history for all time?<br /><br />And so the story moves forward at a rate that rivals the speed of light, urged on by a rousing soundtrack written by Paul Cantelon.  The five years that it takes Anne to achieve her endgame literally take place in a few moments.  The characters of Thomas Moore and Cardinal Wolsey might as well be non-existent.  The role of brother George, although `touched' upon is not given the extensive treatment Gregory bestows him in her novel.  But most of all the characters of Anne and Mary wallow in stereotype.  Anne epitomizes dark ambition--Portman's performance depicts a witch of a girl-woman bedazzled by court life yet angered and frustrated by her own failure.  Ultimately she realizes her plight, stumbling as she goes, over her own bravado and cunning.  As her foil, Mary shimmers in a soft light that showcases her Renaissance beauty--I can never fail to think of Scarlett Johansson as the model for Vermeer's `Girl With a Pearl Earring\\"--as the alternate other Boleyn girl, she symbolizes the milkmaid's existence--the simpler lifestyle fueled by the sun and outdoors that ebbs with the absence of light and abstract absolutes.  For her, love takes precedence over wealth and prestige.  Without the clever nuances of the novel, the film brands the two sisters as two-dimensional symbols of good and evil.  They stand apart as rivals rather than Boleyns working towards the same goal who ultimately love each other and their family more than they do anything else.  The insistence of the film to tell this tale at a quantum leap diminishes the multi-faceted qualities of its main protagonists.<br /><br />Not being knowledgeable regarding the actual ages of the historical figures, from my vantage point--and this I am afraid is definitely a sign of age--I felt the characters to be so overly and fragilely young.  William Stafford, Mary's love interest, may well need Clearasil--I could well imagine him in a junior varsity basketball uniform--all arms and legs--than in the velvet garb of Uncle Howard's page.  Likewise for Portman who, although resplendent in her verdant green gowns that show off her creamy skin and her downy profile, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute; to perfection, still appears sometimes frail and childish.  I can more easily imagine her stamping her feet like a willful brat than seducing and satisfying the likes of Eric Bana. Case in point--the beheading scene.  Portland reminds me of a high school Portia spouting off about the `quality of mercy' rather than a grown woman who had used her wiles to entertain and bamboozle the king of England.  In a more mature sense, Johansson appears way too many times striding or riding purposefully in and out of the castle.  Like an overprotective St. Bernard, her persona as nurturer and semi-saint seems overdone.<br /><br />Bottom line?  The 2008 film, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" concentrates on one aspect of the Gregory mega bestseller.  Pitting one Boleyn girl against the other, it succeeds in depicting a Tudor England of great intrigue--engineered by scheming families who did not play it safe and were literally willing to put their necks on the line.  The frenetic pace of the film offers only enough time to create outline caricatures of each of the main personalities rather than nuanced flesh and blood women who skewed the hypocritical rules professed by their faith to snare future family glory.  Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn gives an interesting performance as the doomed pseudo queen that needs more taming than a shrew by any other name. Is there any wonder as to why women carry with them the reputation of being manipulative and deceitful after viewing such degradation? The scene where Anne gives birth to Elizabeth especially seethes with poignancy; the sense of uselessness blatantly apparent--how dare you birth a female and not a male?  What a sad history we women share--enough to keep all the psychiatrists in the world busy until the next millennium with the theme of little self-esteem and worthlessness alone.  Gold diggers?  I guess one had little choice.  Voyeur that I am, I wish the five years Anne kept Henry at bay portrayed in the novel in much detail was given due diligence here.  Recommended to those who enjoy yet another telling of this Tudor soap opera with nary a qualm with regard to historical authenticity.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"l brat than seducing and satisfying the likes of Eric Bana.

0143058592|4.0|I loved listening to this book. It recounted the recording sessions from the early days until the end. Geoff was the recording engineer at Abbey Road who worked on many of the songs. The only think that would have made this better was if they were able to play the songs as he talked about them. A nice look at the inside of their history.
B000000OQF|5.0|Of course I gave this 5 stars.  This band was, is, and will always be my favorite.  I NEVER get sick of hearing any of their music from ANY of their albumns.  The talent is over the top, mindblowing, and completely fantastic.  This music is the best! Please, ignore all those foolish 1 star reviewers.  I mean, if you SERIOUSLY think that, you're a complete head-case, I laughed when I read them.  How could they expect to be taken seriously with opinions like that?!  Anyway, you should own this CD by now, you should have had to replace your worn out tape from the 80's with a CD by now.  If you haven't, what are you waiting for, DO IT!
B000S6LT42|5.0|Four DVDs for under thirty bucks...what can a Stones fan complain about!?<br /><br />This set chronicles the Stones' massive Bigger Bang Tour, which I believe started in 2005 and ended in 2007.  I was lucky enough to see it in one of the most rural stops the group's ever made---Missoula, Montana.  Despite the fact that these guys are senior citizens, they still rock harder than anybody half their age, and this DVD set proves it.<br /><br />There is a good selection of material, from their earliest hits through the Bigger Bang CD.  Most of the performances are excellent, especially when the Boys go south of the equator and play to packed and rowdy fans in Buenos Aires and Rio.  You can see the band feeding off the frenzied energy of the crowd and they really pull out all the stops.  The most energetic number may well be 'Satisfaction', played before a packed stadium in Buenos Aires, but there are many good moments throughout.<br /><br />The first two discs highlight specific concerts.  The third shows concerts from Sapporo, Tokyo, and Buenos Aires (I think).  The fourth has a documentary about the tour and the band.<br /><br />There are also bonus features such as duets with friends such as Bonnie Raitt and  Dave Matthews.  Lots of short clips and interviews of the Stones arriving at different places on the tour, and talking about the tour, the fans, and the joy of music.<br /><br />This was for sale at Best Buy for 29.99 when it came out.  I assume they still have it.  Looks to be a bit cheaper there than on Amazon, but Amazon is still a good place to find music, especially if you're not near a Best Buy.<br /><br />Pick it up, enjoy it.  I know I do.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|I think that this movie has an identity crisis. Is it a movie masquerading as an animated feature or an animated feature trying to be a movie. I love sci-fi and sword & sorcery. This show did neither well. The Christopher Lambert feature was a much better adaption of this myth, although it received a poor rating.
0810994739|5.0|I am writing a review for the 2nd book of the Wimpy Kid collection. I haven't read the book as of yet, my 11 yr old is in the process as of now. But I did read the 1st book and found it totally hilarious! I read about the 2nd book coming out and couldn't wait to get it! These are a fun read if you are an adult and your youngster will love it for the storyline plus all the super drawings. Don't miss out on 2 great books...so far, I hope there are many more to come!
B000MGTPSA|5.0|This is of course the album that was originally meant to be a Christmas seasonal album but is so good that it is played year round by Sarah fans. It my have caused a few infidels to convert as well. Sarah's voice has not deteriorated at all for smoothness and range even though she turned 40 this year. Voice is somewhat les pristine sounding than on her eary albums-not better or worse just a little different. The song River(Joni MItchell) has of been made famous by this album as well as John Lennons Happy Xmas and the cosmic Firsr Noel.This vinyl issue is a dramitic improvement over the digital disc -reproducing the highs much better and sounding much fuller and clearer in the mids. Sarah' Voice more than others just sounds radically better on vinyl. There is somewhat less dramitic difference with Alison Krauss my other favorite vocalist for example though vinyl certainly improves her high harmonics. I  guess it is the richness and complesity of Sarah's voice that matters so much.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I also had a chance to see this early, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I do not want to give any of the plot away but I didn't expect some of the twists. Even though I have already seen this, I am buying it. The only way they will continue to make these made for video movies is if we the fan buy them. So save SG1 and buy a copy!!
0439206472|5.0|[[ASIN:0439206472 The Bad Beginning - Book 1 of A Series of Unfortunate Events]]This book was a fantastic fantsy especially coming from somone who does not love reading. I really liked this book  because it made me want to read in a british accent as I imagined their names sounding very British to me like Klaus, Sunny, Violet and Count Olaf.  As I read, I was waiting for the next bad thing to happen as I could visualize every page in my mind because his words were very animated.  For example, I liked how perfect I could see Sunny in my head while reading the part when Sunny was dangling from the basket.  I could really see that in my head because of the descriptive words.  I felt like I was there watching.  Lastly, I enjoyed this book because two smart kids and a baby could always figure a way out of danger. I would recommend this book for children and adults as on everypage there is a surprise to be found.
B00006399Z|5.0|No words could describe how great \\"Sad And Deep As You\\" is with Chris Wood And Reebop Kwaku Baah (not to mention Dave Mason's amazing vocal).      The rest is also tremendous.  A no-brainer.  Get it.
0634089358|5.0|Ed did a great job with this one. Well thought out and presented, this book may be the only one you need to get you up and running in the Blues / Rock format. The play along songs and examples are first rate. If you already know how to hold a bass and tune up then this book will teach you some essential blues standards. There are enough full songs presented for a good set list. Two thumbs up! I would also reccomend the Hal Leonard R&B Bass by Glenn Letsch. Tab and notation.
061891868X|4.0|Richard Feynman is usually credited having said that \\"philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.\\"  This book seems to indicate that, given what string theorists are doing with and for science, maybe some of them are due a visit to the ornithologist...
0452289963|1.0|I found this book difficult to read and just plain boring.  I just didn't get it.
0790729407|5.0|Being a history buff I really enjoyed this movie. Definitely made me want to research more into the life of Michael Collins and the history of the IRA. Made me wonder what the difference was between him and the terrorists of today? Why revere him as a hero?
B000002IJL|4.0|Love the movie, love all the songs (certainly better then anything today), but why include only 10 nostalgic songs? The whole disc is only about 30 min. long. And some of the best songs from the movie are missing. Why couldn't they include:<br /><br />The Impalas - Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home)<br />Bobby Day - Rockin' Robin<br />The Monotones - Book of Love<br />The Fleetwoods - Come Softly To Me<br />The Mystics - Hushabye<br /><br />So this is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars.
0679642609|5.0|A good read.  I recommend it. I don't know what the adjective would be.  But it would be positive.
B00004TA41|5.0|The thing I get from this recording is that it is pure expression. It is what happens when you dive head first into the spaces between the notes, and go beyond the dialectic of style, genre, music theory, etc. Coltrane, unlike most who attempt such heculean feats, was not searching franticly with this (despite the intensity of much of the recording). He knew exactly what he was doing. The realm beyond was, for him, familiar territory where he felt at home.<br /><br />It can certainly be a challenge to listen to. But its worth it.
1416523359|2.0|I cannot tell you how many times over the past year I have picked this book up and started reading just to quickly lose interest in it and put the book away for awhile.  This book is 512 pages long and took a REALLY long time to get into the heart of the story. I was well over 200 pages into it before I finally started to get it.  Wow, is this a weird one. I know that's not saying much since this author is well known for his off-the wall stories but this one is more odd that usual. The story centers on Lisey, an author's widow, who is being hounded by a psychopath who is after the unpublished writings of her late husband. That goes okay enough. What gets goofy is that Scott (the late husband) is able to escape this world and go to another one. Lisey also has a sister who is borderline who seems to be able to do it too. The story is long and just plan crazy. If this is the stuff that floats in Stephen King's head at night, I don't know how he sleeps! Phrases like \\"smucking\\" and \\"SOWISA\\" are so frequently used in this book that you find yourself using them yourself in the end. I would not rate this among King's better books and probably wouldn't recommend even dies hard fans read it.
0452289963|5.0|It is not just a book on spiritual concepts it is 'A How To Do It Book.\\" If you are on the path of Spirituality, read the books and struggled with 'how' this is an excellent book on how to understand and change your thinking.  I learned about the ego in \\"The Course In Miracles\\" 30 years ago, but have struggled on how to change my thinking.  This books gives step by step instructions.  The same for the concepts about the dream, time and how to stay in the moment. I discovered 'the pain body' is the emotions and how to understand when that voice has entered the picture, and How To go beyond and discover the painful emotional thought that has ruled my life since I was a child and affected both my marriages and how I dealt with being a woman. I wish when I was in Overeaters Anonymous someone could have given me the steps on page 247 on how to deal with addictive behavior.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The Arcade Fire in a strange way became the sort of \\"go to\\" band for anyone craving anything indie. While other bands have had success, more talk and discussion were placed on this band to the point I was worried they were becoming a victim of overexposure; the band to \\"save us from the awfulness of rock\\" as it were. While there is a bit of overhyped feelings, it's hard not to see how good it felt to not see a band bogged down by MOR-ready sounds. Sounding unique yet strangely familiar, reminscent of other bands without ripping them off, Funeral is a good example of a debut album of a band confident right out of the gate.    The album starts with probably my favorite album opener in years, \\"Neighborhood # 1 (Tunnels)\\". Being part 1 of 4 parts, this starts out with a more steady beat and vocalist Win Butler's impassioned singing, the song seems to almost crescendo and build for the whole thing. Even though I can't sing, I can't help but sing the falsettos at the end and rock out. It's too bad part 2, called \\"Laika\\" followed it since it's a strong track with its harmonic-tinged guitar, and what sounds like a accordian or a musette, it's certainly unique and catchy but again, too bad Tunnels was played first.    Then of course we come to probably the most well-known track, part 3 entitled \\"Power Out\\" which is just energetic and propulsive. It may not be catchy in an radio sense and even on first listen, I didn't care much for it but it grew quite quickly. The last part, entitled \\"7 Kettles\\" is an acoustic track with some percussion thrown in and it almost feels like a pub song by way of a Celtic beat (though I might be off on that).     \\"Wake Up\\" is just as energetic as \\"Power Out\\" with big choir-esque parts and a catchy main riff, it's another album highlight and became a live favorite. Then we come down to \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" which continues the sound of having a steady beat and the song building as it progresses. My one complaint is the \\"liiees, liiies\\" hook during the chorus; I don't mind the hook, just the vocal used but still, it's quite a catchy song and could see why it was a single. The closer has co-vocalist and Butler's wife Regine Chassagne taking over the vocals. It still has the big guitar riffs, pianos, strings and whatnot but it's not as epic sounding has something like Tunnels or Wake Up which kind of helps with the album's title and subject matter. Not my favorite track but a decent closer.    The Arcade Fire is quickly becoming one of the more promising bands to me and if they keep it up, they can also be one of the new millennium's best. Hopefully they don't burn out too quickly though.
0380715430|1.0|Mr. Bryson's \\"The Mother Tongue\\" is an easy read, but unfortunately it contains many factual mistakes and, as one other reviewer put it so well, \\"sloppy scholarship\\".  I am a native speaker of German and I wish he would have gotten some help from a German linguist for his comparisons of English with German.<br /><br />My problem with the book started with the \\"Acknowledgments\\" where Mr Bryson writes \\"certain passages in this book originally appeared in somewhat altered form in TWA Ambassador and in the Canadian textbook Language in Action, and I wish to thank both organizations for permission to reproduce those excerpts here.\\"  My understanding of the word \\"to alter\\" in its form \\"altered\\" is that it refers to something that has been changed from its original form.  Bryson's sentence hence implies that the  chapters in question had been written initially for the book \\"The Mother Tongue\\" and were only later changed to be published in the TWA magazine.  I think this is hardly likely and, in fact, the altered versions of the original articles are in the book, not the other way around.  If somebody uses language incorrectly already in the acknowledgments section, my trust in the author's expertise about language is seriously impacted.<br /><br />I read about one third of this book, but I did not finish it, because I am afraid it may hurt my understanding of the English language more than it will help.  There are several mistakes obvious to me, so I am afraid other \\"facts\\" might by incorrect as well.  I simply cannot trust Bryson.
B00003CXRP|4.0|One can make a case that Cast Away was Robert Zemeckis' last great film. After the underrated Contact, he focused attention on making a story in which for a good chunk of the movie, there's no dialogue or score. Whereas nowadays he seems more concerned with testing his new expensive toys (CG technology) than combining it with a story which he always did so well. It's not exactly one of the best of his career and if it wasn't for the main performance, it probably wouldn't mean much but that being said, it's good for what they managed to pull off.    Chuck Noland is a FedEx employee obsessed with time and making sure packages are delivered in a speedy manner. With a girlfriend, Kelly, he's planning on marrying, life seems alright until a late Christmas delivery has to be made and while en route, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Entirely alone on an empty island, the once time-obsessed Chuck now has too much of it and has to learn how to survive.    Cast Away on my first viewing when it first came out was one of those movies that I liked but didn't necessarily love outright. But now and then, there's that desire to re-watch a movie again to refresh your memory or just to see how well it holds up. The film does hold up pretty well and you got to give it to the filmmakers for actually holding our attention for the whole film with no cinema conventions. And credit has to go to Tom Hanks who manages to hold our attention all on his own and even make the scenes where he pretends to talk to a volleyball not feel silly. Plus there's his dramatic weight loss he did to further add to the realism and his Oscar nom was well deserved.    If there's some scenes that bring the film down slightly are the non-island scenes where he's about to leave and when he returns home. It's necessary to show his life and daily activities before he gets stranded but you still feel slight cutting down was in order. The post-island scenes are also polarizing since they do feel different andalmost alien-feeling to the island but with the film at a relatively healthy 2 h 15 minutes sans credit, it feels like it does take awhile before we get to the ending though I like how it leaves on a slightly ambiguous note.    With a terrifying plane crash sequence, a compelling middle section though slightly inferior bookends, the film is good though because the film is better that doesn't make it amazing but considering what it could've been, I'm glad it's this way.

B000NA2776|5.0|This CD is awesome from begnning to end! I can't just sit and listen to most newly released CDs these days as they get boring and unexciting.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|The original series of Star Trek on HD is an excellent product.  The only reason I rate it four stars is due to the somewhat cheap packaging.<br /><br />Whoever did the work to remaster and touch up these episodes clearly had respect for the original material.  They have done a fine job.<br /><br />HD presentation is so rich and vivid that it feels like watching new episodes.  Overall I'm really enjoying watching such a great image.  The audio isn't the greatest and on most systems apparently the \\"TrueHD\\" audio track is far too quiet (even with my receiver cranked to maximum volume) but it sounds good on the 2 channel audio option.<br /><br />It's funny how some of the ship sets looked like \\"toys\\" on TV broadcasts but actually look better now that you can see the detail and clarity of some of those colored buttons.<br /><br />Certainly the cheap sets (textures and painted foam or cardboard or whatever) are still there.  But they are enjoyable with a new life due to the enhanced clarity of HD.<br /><br />At a $100 price I find HD Star Trek a good value (and who knows, soon you may be able to get it even cheaper as HD-DVDs get discounted further).<br /><br />Definitely check the firmware version of your player, the audio seems a lot more stable after updating the firmware.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|It was given to me as a gift. I guess I should be happy after looking at some of the other reviews. Mine actually lasted 6 months! that's a lot longer than some others! and I religiously followed the instructions for maintenance, battery charging, etc. After emailing the company, I can't tell you how many times, I just gave up. Now it sits in my closet. What a waste of money!!!

B00005JPSM|4.0|One might feel a bit disppointed if food and cooking are what they primarily look for in the film. Surprisingly, the film is more about the blossoming relations between the workalcholic Kate (Catherine Zeta Jones), Zoe (Abigal Breslin) and the upcoming Italian chef Nick (Aaron Eckhart). The scene stealer is Zoe. She is beautiful, young and a natural. Her mourning over her loss of her mom, pillow fight with aunt Kate, making pizza with Nick and her being tempted by Nick's homemade spaghetti were all shot wonderfully. Her tiny and intelligent face spoke it all. Catherine Zeta Jones was gorgeous but she didn't look like a top French Head Chef at 22 Bleecker. She, however, looks perfect as a loving aunt, an overworked career woman and will make any man fall for her. Aaron Eckhart is so convincing as a popular and passionate chef. No wonder people inside and outside the kitchen love him.    This film is so well-knit (perhaps because the German film Mostly Martha is such a success) that it is a delight to watch. I love the New York streets, the old apartment, staircase and natural lit corridor at Kate's apartment. The supporting cast look more French and in the restaurant business than Kate - the restaurant owner Paula (Patricia Clarkson), Kate's right hand chef Leah (Jenny Wade). Zoe's mom (Arija Bareikis, American Embassy) and Zoe actually have such similar facial features. She looks like a French Chef too. Having said that, Catherine Zeta Jones looks good in this role but this time (unlike Chicago) she cannot transform it into an exclusive Catherine Zeta Jones role only. Her therapist(Bob Balaban), with his quiet voice and rooftop clinic overlooking New York buildings, is fun to watch.    A warm, beautifully shot and well cast movie. Even the food lovers won't have much to complain in the end.
B00128O2SA|4.0|When my friend handed me a copy of Tremulent a few years back, he mentioned that this band was going to change everything. How right he was. The landscape of my music was forever shifted with each succeeding album and I was delighted.    Bedlam In Goliath was a much anticipated album for me and the release of the novel USB Stick whetted my appetite even more. I looked forward to The Mars Volta quirkiness to bleed through to this new medium.    Here, they did not fail. A Ouija board navigation leads to mp3s, webisodes, and so much more. Now I look forward to plugging in my USB stick on a monthly basis to see what gifts they have left me. This is the extra bang for you buck when purchasing this item over the album. (10/10 for this part!)    As for the music, I differ greatly from my other fanatical friends in viewing this album. While this album may be a little tighter than previous albums, I personally find this less appealing. The demonic variations of sounds had always allured me to The Mars Volta. Being able to have them on in the background while performing some other menial task only to be halted in deep reverence for the beautifully, chaotic sounds coming out of the speakers was something I yearn for and how I define The Mars Volta. This and nonsensical lyrics that seem to still mean something to me were two qualities to set The Mars Volta apart from the pack.    And to some degree they faded away from this. I have given the album several thorough listens before fully deciding this, although the inkling was there from the get go. This isn't to say that this is a \\"bad\\" album. Its just not the glorious continuation of perfect disharmony I so adore. The lyrics are somewhat transparent and repetitive.     In the end, this album has done what I never imagine anything could do. But it split The Mars Volta loyalists. And while most albums by The Mars Volta have scored 9s and 10s, I sadly give this album a 7 and look forward their next 10.
0061251305|5.0|Amidst the thousands of management books that are released each year, very few present fresh and new concepts that change the way we look at things.    Tribal Leadership is one of these books.      In their book, Logan, King, and Fischer-Wright provide a wonderful new perspective on the natural groups and dynamics that exist within organizations, and shed light on new approaches for leaders that seek to influence more effectively by taking advantage of these \\"tribes\\".    A definite must-read for 2008.    Manoj Pawar

B00102F5WK|4.0|I liked this movie. I don't think it got the recognition that it should have. This film is important for two reasons: one, it explains to people what really happens in terrorist groups, and two, it explains the government point of view. This is one of the most compelling stories I've ever watched on film. However, it is a little long, and some parts could have been kept out of it. But overall, a very moving screenplay, especially in today's world.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I love this album so much. i cannot stop playing it. This album has cutting edge material that puts her in a different league than the other divas on the block. This album is her first masterpiece. Never falling back on old moves, she has really crafted the finest disc of her short career. This album is the kind of music that builds longevity, and now there ain't no looking back. This album has been certified 3x Platinum.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Mnutes to Midnight is almost a completely differnt band from before as this album had some new styles. I would highly suggest you listen to a good amount of the songs before buying the album as the is now cursing in some of the songs. I still belive it's a good album just a new style.
B00119VMGK|2.0|\\"Dogville\\" is lost.  They tried to do a Broadway style or live acting play on the bigscreen.  Seeing this performance live might have worked for me as it's much easier to relate or engage with live on-stage actors.  However, put them on film without any adjustments to acting or style, including little editing, and it gets boring fast.    In contrast, a related movie with this style, the Hitchcock movie \\"Rope\\", was successful by using very good camera work and lighting, more props, and extremely pronounced acting - almost over-emphasizing words and actions - that all transfered well to film.  (Oh, the suspense helped engage the viewer too here.)    Dogville was an experiment in film making, it's minimalistic approach won't appeal to many, and they didn't get the stage acting to work well on film.  The film is lost between stage acting style and film media style.

1400049628|1.0|I'm going to go ahead and give away the only mildly amusing thing in the 247 unfunny pages of this book.  It takes itself seriously.  It's an *actual* guide to zombie survival.  There you go.  Personally, that made me dryly chuckle for the first 5 pages.  After that, it got annoying really, really fast.  If you liked this novel, don't forget to pick up Max Brooks' other fantastic offerings:<br /><br />- The Unicorn Husbandry Guide<br />- Trapping Leprechaun's for fun and profit<br />- Pixies vs Fairies; which side to take in the coming Global confrontation<br /><br />This book wasn't just bad, it was violently suckworthy.  Whenever I see the name Max Brooks again, I'll be reminded of the old adage that talent skips a generation.

B0006A9FMI|1.0|I love the original GITS and I like Stand Alone Complex, but the story in Innocence should not have made it into the GITS franchise. If Mamoru Oshii absolutely had to tell this story he should have done it through a new series without dragging all the GITS characters through the mud.<br /><br />If you are a self proclaimed intellectual, this movie may be right up your alley.  The plot is sadly lost in incessant spewing of western and biblical quotes.  Whole conversations consist of characters rambling off quotes to each other.  Then you are assaulted by scenes of character's e-brains getting hacked that are meant to make you question \\"What is real?\\"  And then there is the dog...I'm not going to bother commenting on that.<br /><br />Ironically, when Batou finally meets up with the Major and she starts spewing out random quotes, he actually comments that it was the wrong time to be poetic...<br /><br />The killer is at the end when a little girl, who presumably was locked up in a ghost dubbing machine for the whole movie, conveniently was consciences enough to thank her anticipated rescuer but also describe the real plot of the movie in uncanny detail. Up to that point in the movie, there were maybe 3 relevant scenes that actually advanced the plot.<br /><br />Visually the movie is stunning.  Sad to say that is the only thing stunning about it.
B00011F5DK|4.0|Blokus is an excellent family game that builds spatial mental acuity.  It's fun, easy to learn, demands problem solving, and planning strategies.  The pieces are either red, blue, green, or yellow.  Yellow is a difficult color to see.  A deep gold or amber might show up better.  I highly recommend this game for people of all ages.
B00136S0NE|5.0|...the movie is so genuine and endearing you cannot help but fall in love with it. The scene where \\"Guy\\" teaches \\"Girl\\" the notes of \\"Falling Slowly\\" is the most romantic duet in film history. But the romance is not the typical kind between a man and a woman. It's a shared love affair of the music.  \\"Once\\" manages to neatly disguise its true identity as a musical with a cloak of realism and credibility.  Characters tell each other the facts of their situations with dialogue (an ex-girlfriend who cheated on \\"Guy\\" and the distant,estranged husband of \\"girl\\").  But each choose to express how they FEEL about these circumstances through the lyrics of their songs.  Every track here should be cherished and experienced over and over to keep the emotion of the movie fresh in the mind.
0060872675|3.0|That is probably the question you are asking yourself if you are considering this book.  The question you should be asking is \\"do you love diskworld?\\"  This is sort of a storybook in the childrens' style, but isn't really fun for a child to be read to.  This book has the same audience as all of Terry's other Diskworld books.  But if you have children it will be even better.
B000AP04MO|4.0|Two for the Road is a 1967 comedy/drama about a marriage over a period of about 7 years (their first car has a Jan. 1960 sticker).  The chronological juxtaposition is something reminiscent of \\"A Man and a Woman\\" as well as other French new wave films of the time.  And the sophisticated take on marriage perhaps partially inspired by \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\".  Audrey Hepburn gets to wear about 50 or so outfits mostly straight off the Carnaby Street racks.  And it's interesting to see Albert Finney as the Alfie-type husband.<br /><br />  It's got some great comedy even if the recurring lost passport joke is too formulaic, and some highly sophisticated drama focusing on the problems of the marriage.  And of course Henry Mancini's great score.
0393061310|5.0|In 1532, in the Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca, a decisive moment took place during the greatest collision in modern history. A ragtag group of 168 Spanish soldiers, led by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, captured the Inca emperor Atahuallpa who was surrounded by his army of 80,000 soldiers in the heart of the Inca Empire. In \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", Jared Diamond, uses this dramatic episode of human history to trace a chain of causation starting with a set of proximate factors and leading to ultimate causes explaining this outcome and that of many similar collisions between colonizers and native peoples. Steel swords and armor, guns, horses, maritime technology, and writing systems used by the Spaniards, as well as diseases that arrived with the Europeans, and resulted in a power struggle dividing the Inca Empire, are the proximate factors that Diamond lumps in the term \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". He then goes into pursuit of the ultimate causes in the chain. He seeks the broad patterns of history that explain why the rise of complex human societies unfolded differently on different continents over the last 13,000 years, since the end of the last ice age known as the Pleistocene.  After extensive research and analysis on world history, geography, botany, zoology, archeology, linguistics, anthropology, and other fields, he concludes that differences in continental environments, not in human biology, led to the rise of complex human societies.       The ultimate factor according to Diamond concerns the rise of food production. This is influenced by several environmental factors such as the availability of domestic-able plants and animals. It is not sufficient to have Mediterranean-like climates which are the most suitable for growing crops. Such climates exist in California, Southeastern Australia, and Southern Africa. A large selection of plants and animals that are suitable for domestication is essential. The author conducts a detailed study based on the literature. A case that stands out is that of wheat vs. corn. Wheat's nutritional and cultivation characteristics provided an advantage to Fertile Crescent societies in their transition to food producing from hunting-gathering status. The Americas on the other hand had to make do with corn which had a longer evolutionary path from its original wild variety to the one eventually used as food by humans. Moreover, it is less nutritious than wheat, and is lower yielding as a crop. The Americas, Australia, and sub-Saharan Africa also suffered from a deficiency of animals that are good candidates for domestication. The Americas' lama is not as useful as a pack animal as is the horse of Eurasia. Africa's large mammals such as the zebra and the elephant had characteristics the author deals with in detail that prevented domestication by humans. Similarly, Australia lacked suitable plant and animal varieties to domesticate.      In addition to the availability of good starting plant and animal material, Diamond describes three other sets of environmental factors that affected the rise of food production throughout the world. A second set controlled the rate of diffusion within the continents and was mainly influenced by the orientation of the continent's axis. An East-West axis, such as in Eurasia, fostered easy movement and migration of plants and animals, as well as ideas and technology. A North-South axis as in the Americas and Africa provided obstacles to such diffusion due to the varying climates along longitudinal lines. The third set of factors affected the rate of diffusion between continents and was mainly caused by geographic isolation such as the case of Australia and the separation between the hemispheres. The fourth set of factors was the differences in area and population. Larger landmass and population density increases the number of potential innovators, the number of societies, and competition among them. Eurasia had the largest landmass and population. The Americas covered a large area but were fragmented by geography and ecology.      The four major sets of environmental differences among the continents thus resulted in significant variation in when societies transitioned from hunter-gatherers to farmers, and in whether that transition occurred at all. The onset of food production then starts a chain reaction, giving humans surplus food to increase their numbers and support specialists: soldiers, chiefs, scribes, and artisans. This in turn leads to developing technology including weapons and writing. Farming societies thus enjoy advantages in numbers, technology, and organization over hunter-gathering societies and are more likely to overcome them. Another by-product of farming societies are the germs caused by livestock that people in these societies develop immunity against.      Diamond subsequently goes around the world in five chapters for a tour of all the continents analyzing how environmental factors affected societal developments in them. He applies his reasoning and enforces it using evidence from the historic record, archeology, linguistics, and genetics. A striking example is that of Australia, New Guinea to its northeast, and Indonesia, an island group northwest of Australia. Diamond explains how geography, climate, availability of domestic-able plants and animals, degree of isolation from surrounding lands, among other factors contributed to the state of societal development in those three regions. The result was stone-age hunter gatherers in Australia, stone-age farmers in New Guinea, and iron-age farmers in Indonesia. In the chapter How Africa Became Black he describes the expansion of the black Bantu farmers from subequatorial West Africa into East and South Africa, engulfing the hunting gathering Pygmy and Khoisan peoples in the process. The case of Polynesia is a very telling natural experiment. The same people traveled by canoes starting from Asia and spread out widely into the south Pacific islands.Within a millennium, the Polynesian descendants reached highly varying states of development from a proto-state with intensive food production in Hawaii to hunting-gathering on the Chatham's. In the other continental chapters, Diamond delves into How China Became Chinese about the history of East Asia, and Hemispheres Colliding about the histories of Eurasia and the Americas.      Diamond asserts that the four major sets of environmental factors affecting the trajectories of human societies are undisputable quantifiable facts. For example, New Guinea is much smaller, has far fewer big animal species, and is more isolated than Eurasia. It seems obvious to conclude that the environment of those two places caused their differing levels of societal complexity. Yet such arguments invite strong criticisms of \\"geographic determinism\\" by historians. What troubles the critics is that human creativity is ostensibly discounted. Diamond points out that it is not. Human inventiveness still matters but it is dependent on the presence of favorable starting material and conditions to utilize its inventions.       In the Epilogue, Diamond further deals with other variables that tend to complicate the study of human history. For example, the factors involved in shorter time scales and smaller geographic scales that would help explain why it was people from Europe, not the Fertile Crescent or China, who colonized the new world. He also considers the case of cultural factors and individual influences that may act as wild cards making history unpredictable. But despite these variables he contends that it is the environmental factors that determine the broad pattern of history. As a case in point against the Great Man theory of the exceptional individual he reasons that although Alexander the Great probably changed the course of Western Eurasian states, he did not make Eurasia a place of literate, food-producing states with iron tools at a time Australia had only illiterate, hunter-gatherer tribes with non-metal tools. However to aid in the analysis of such problems with a large number of individual variables he suggests the study of human history as a science using scientific methodologies.      The question about the fates of human societies represents a very complex problem due to the number of individual variables involved but there is little doubt in this reader's mind that the environmental factors examined by Diamond are at the base of the broad historic pattern that set societies on different trajectories as he concludes. Diamond's thoughtful and thoroughly researched study of world history in the last 13,000 years leading to the modern world offers a convincing explanation full of examples and detailed research with extensive references. This is true even though at times some of his explanations do seem convenient or wishful thinking. However, acknowledging the causal effect of environment on human societies, the reader cannot help wondering about the second part of the author's thesis, that human biology is not a causal factor. This is potentially a minefield but wouldn't 13,000 years in separate and isolated environments result in biological differences due to evolving genetics? The resulting genetic differences would then become a causal factor though not the ultimate one. The author himself opines that New Guineans are on average smarter than Eurasians due to the need to survive in a harsh environment. In any case, the main gripe detractors have with the overall thesis is that it undermines the importance of human inventiveness. That seems to this reader as just another case of human arrogance, the belief that we are exceptional and have full control over our fates. Yes, it is part of the equation, but why would a human without a horse invent stirrups, or a plow with no large animal to pull it?       No matter what position one takes on its thesis, the book is worth reading for its wealth of information about the environmental condition of the continents. It is an enlightening, captivating, and highly readable book. This is definitely a must read for anyone interested in human history or seeking to understand the state of the modern world.
B0012QE4QC|3.0|As a standalone movie, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is okay....not great, but okay. However, as someone who is a die-hard fan of Philippa Gregory's novel, I wasn't at all impressed with this film adaptation.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that the script sucks, pure and simple. Obviously, the basic plot is the same as the book: The young Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson) is commissioned by her ambitious family to cast her husband aside and become the mistress of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) while her older sister, Anne (Natalie Portman), jealously looks on. Eventually Henry's eyes drift over to Anne, who replaces Mary as the favorite and embarks on a dangerous plan to replace Queen Katherine (Ana Torrent) on the throne of England.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie doesn't capture the energy and passion of Gregory's brilliant novel. The pacing is tediously slow, and so many details of the plot were changed for the film, for no apparent reason at all. The Boleyn girls grow up at court, so the way Mary and Henry initially meet was rewritten in the film. Mary had two children by Henry, but only the boy is shown in the movie. Lady Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) was reinvented for the screen and is portrayed as a woman who actually gives a crap about her children, but in the book she supports the use of her daughters as pawns in the family's quest for power. I didn't understand what happened to Mary's first husband in the movie...he just sort of wanders off-screen 15 minutes into the film and is never seen or heard from again. (In the book, he dies from the sweat, which is why Mary is later free to marry William Stafford.) What else? I was disappointed in the way the incest issue was handled in the film. I guess the producers assumed that it was too taboo of a topic for the movie, because they totally changed the way it was handled. Oh yes, and King Henry never raped Anne Boleyn in the novel, and he certainly didn't tire of her before he married her! That was so ridiculous.<br /><br />There are many more discrepancies between the book and the film that I don't even have time to list, and they completely ruined what could have been an excellent film. Another thing that bothered me is the way the pacing constantly shifted. At times things moved very slowly, but then the plot jolted forward at lightning speed, especially toward the end of the film. Major historical events were glossed over and only mentioned in a sentence or two of dialogue, such as Katherine's banishment and the establishment of the Church of England. If you blink while watching this movie, you'll definitely miss something important.<br /><br />This movie had all the makings of a hit. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. I especially loved all the brilliant costumes. Also, the performances by the actors were phenomenal. I was particularly enchanted by Portman's portrayal of Anne, which was completely on the mark. However, all of the actors were limited by a terrible script. It's such a shame.<br /><br />I am so incredibly bummed about how crappy this film turned out to be. Do yourself a favor and read the book BEFORE you see the movie so you know what you're missing (that is, if you even want to bother with the movie at all).here are many more discrepancies between the book and the film that I don't even have time to list, and they completely ruined what could have been an excellent film.

B00128O2SA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Mars Volta and I have to say this little USB stick is really cool.  I think this is a great item for long time TMV fans because you get the updates every month and it just looks frickin' sweet.  A collector's item that more bands should think about imitating.  Stop wasting your time with cd's and get more material on the USB stick.  As for the album, I'm really happy with the new music and very suprised by some new approaches the band has taken.  Cedric's vocals give the typical TMV fan a suprise throughout the album as he tries different styles and rhythmns.  Even some backup vocals by the band bring a fresh approach to the mix.  The drumming is sometimes a little over the top and seems a bit too much.  I can't help but think that Omar(guitars, producer) should have reined him in a little at times to give some sublety to the barrage of percussion the new drummer brings.  Also, I'm disappointed in the fact that the bass guitar is not as prominent here as on the previous album.  All in all, though, it's a really good album that any TMV fan should enjoy.
006135323X|4.0|As human beings, we want to see ourselves as rational creatures, possessed of an intelligence that trumps our emotional impulses. Au contraire, asserts Dan Ariely, the Alfred P. Sloan, Professor of Behavioral Economics at MIT. Not only are we irrational, he says, but predictably so. More often than not, our highly touted reason is trumped by passion and rationalization. We make the same foolish mistakes over and over again.    Ariely offers data from the emerging field of behavioral economics, which studies judgment and decision-making. Amassing data from numerous empirical tests, this academic discipline investigates what it is about life that motivates people and causes us to think and behave as we do.    Written in a highly accessible style, Predictably irrational possesses more scientific substance than most pop psychology books. Ariely delivers intriguing insights into phenomena such as the placebo effect, and he peppers the pages with arresting and amusing anecdotes.    Predictably Irrational is both instructive and fun to read.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|This movie is very entertaining.  It makes you realize how powerful words can be (or better still, how powerful lobbyists can be.)  Making a satirical movie is never easy, but this one pulls it off very, very nicely.  Highly recommended for people who like to think.  Not recommended for narrow-minded.  (Parents beware - certain scenes contain sexual innuendo.)
B00000I0XW|5.0|Great voice and great music.  Can't go wrong with that!!  Great collection of songs!!  Rare to get a cd with so many great songs!!  Highly recommend!!
B001453LX8|5.0|After about 3 listens to this album I can see myself coming home after a very long day and listening to this work.  I love this CD and the last one she put out the BEST of all of Ms. Badus work.  I know alot of people like the first three CDs but to me Ms. Badus work has improved greatly.  She is very talented and I love her choice of underground hip hop beat which is true hip hop.
B000Z6MIQS|4.0|Simple Plan's first album was 100% pop punk, with songs that portrayed stories about how miserable their lives were as teenagers, such as \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" and \\"The Worst Day Ever.\\" These songs were solid pop punk songs and were enjoyable to listen to. Simple Plan's second album showed that the band grew up from their first album with more mature lyrics. However, many of the song were still pessimistic like \\"Welcome to My Life\\" and \\"Jump.\\" I liked their first two albums and the new album \\"Simple Plan\\" is no exception. Of course, the genre of music on this new album has changed. Most of the songs on the first two albums were pop punk or punk rock, as well as just rock. This album mixes the elements of pop, rock, alternative, punk,hip hop and even electronica into one unique package. The songs on this album also show maturity from Simple Plan. Below is a list of ratings for each song on the album:    1)WHEN I'M GONE- The first single off the album, this song mixes electronic elements with their classic punk rock genre. Its a good starting single- 9/10    2)TAKE MY HAND- This song starts off sounding like a song from their old albums (punk rock) but when it enters the second verse, electronic elements are added for effects. I like this song, but its not my favorite on the album- 8/10.    3)THE END- This is a critical turning point song for Simple Plan. The first part of the song sounds like the beginning of a electronica/dance track. But once the song gets into the chorus, it switches to pop punk.  Its one of the better songs on the album- 9/10.    4)YOUR LOVE IS A LIE- This song sounds like a replica of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" from Green Day. Its pure punk rock with a little tweaking from producers; solid song- 8/10.    5)SAVE YOU- This is one of the best songs on the album and shows the maturity that Simple Plan has went through. Nice instrumentation and vocals- 10/10.    6)GENERATION- This song is not one of the better songs on the album. It starts out with a weird horn that doesn't sound like Simple Plan at all. At least when it reaches the chorus, it switches to a punk rock song- 6/10.     7)TIME TO SAY GOODBYE- This is one song that comes directly from the Still Not Getting Any era- totally pop punk/punk rock. I like it because it shows that Simple Plan could still make a solid punk rock song- 9/10.    8)I CAN WAIT FOREVER- Something totally different from Simple Plan, this song is actually one of the best songs on the album. Nice piano and instrumentation as well as vocals from Pierre and the others. Sounds like a wonderful pop ballad- 10/10.     9)HOLDING ON- This song is not bad, but it sounds too generic. Also, the verses sound like a Linkin Park song because one of the members (I heard it was Chuck Comeau) speaks like Mike Shinoda. Not a bad song, but not my favorite- 7/10.    10)NO LOVE- The very beginning sounds like \\"It's True\\" from the Backstreet Boy's Black and Blue album. Right after that, it sounds like the beginning of \\"Perfect\\" from Simple Plan's first album. And then the song turns into a solid pop/rock ballad.  Different, but a great sounding song-9/10    11)WHAT IF- A very long song (5:54) but unique in its production, vocal performances, and instrumentation. A nice solid punk rock song- 9/10.     CONCLUSION- Simple Plan makes a solid album which I think most loyal Simple Plan fans will find refreshing and more mature. I like their new direction and I hope others will appreciate it too.  I give this album a 4.3/5.
B0010ZR160|3.0|Overall, this film was mildly entertaining.  Casey Affleck was the best part, he's a decent actor, and this was his star making vehicle that brought him out of the woodwork.  I liked him in \\"To Die For\\", he was really young back then and his small part was at least memorable.  \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a good one time viewing movie, not enough to rewatch in my oppinion.  I thought Ed Harris overacted a bit, like he also wanted some oscar recognition.  I don't think this film was at all oscar calibur, but something semi-interesting to watch if ur bored.  I hated the ending, I did not like the message it conveyed.  I think Casey's character should have let the child stay with the couple, but what do I know, right?
B000Y0GX9I|5.0|Our 25 years of marriage have always included this little mouse as our \\"mascot\\".  This is my husband's favorite animation movie. The number of \\"firsts\\" done in this movie made history, and made moving forward in animation movie-making possible.  We have it in all of the forms it was made.  This is truely another of Disney\\"S Top Hits.  There is one in our bank safety deposit box, one in the RV, and two at the house. Only one of those is unwrapped.  The others are for the future!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|People, this is the authentic release of this film from the studio. It is not the Goodtimes Video release that is panned in many of the low rated reviews here. I have tried repeatedly to make Amazon understand that the low rated reviews are associated with Goodtimes Video's inferior copy. You will not be sorry you purchased this version.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This was a requested gift.  It arrived in a very timely manner and the nice \\"case\\" made it an even finer gift than imagined.  The men were delighted with it. The movie was fast paced, no time for boredom here. And the five adult men were very into the action. Ok, so the women kept sneeking peeks, too.  Great Movie at a great price.  Thank you for the speed in shipping and the care in packing.  Very Sincerely,   Theresa
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Brad Bird is a phenomenal director of animated movies.  Almost every frame and sound of this movie has been produced intentionally.  To get a better appreciation of all of the attention to detail, you should watch the interview on this DVD that features Brad Bird and Thomas Keller (of the French Laundry restaurant).
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Way too short as in condensed a bit, but captured the essentials of Jane Austen's \\"Northanger Abbey\\". I just finished re-reading \\"Northanger Abbey\\" due to viewing this version. Fine performances by actors portraying Henry Tilney (J.J. Field), Catherine Morland (Felicity Jones), Isabelle Thorpe and all the rest.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|LOVE THIS FILM and the soundtrack as well what a concept wish I'dthought of it!!!
0140557741|1.0|The book came in a very good condition and precisely at the time Amazon estimated. I was also satisfied with the careful packaging of the parcel. Well done!
B000BF0D9M|4.0|While I always enjoy Jessie Cook's work this 2-CD set has far too many selections from the Gravity and Tempest CDs.  If you have those two CDs then purchasing this set is kind of a waste.
1582406634|5.0|If you already have Frank Cho's sketchbook you'll probably doesn't need this book seen that all drawing inside it where originally published on these sketchbooks...If not and if you like Frank Cho, run out and buy it!
B0011ZRJ70|1.0|The Bee Movie has been cancelled for HD DVD Release...why does Amazon still have it available for pre-order?
0571202284|4.0|If you like normal animation and if you like 3d animation or if you like stop motion animation...you'll find all information needed and much more inside this unique book!
B000ZLFALI|4.0|A great recap of the era sure to tug at memories and heart strings for those that grew up in the era and sure to entertain and explain to those too young.  The use of all those rich Beatle-isms and songs to tell a story and dipict an era is too rich to miss.  A definite thumbs up!
0316067598|5.0|Meaning most libs will want to stay away since the book offers a perspective not typically characteristic of the left mindset-love/pride of Country, self-reliance, ruthlessness, realization of true evil/repudiation of moral relativism, vociferous expression of male aggression (feminists definitely stay away), and of course the destruction of-as opposed to having crackers and tea with-our enemies. There is a reason you don't see many-or most likely any-libs in SF-you have to be a Patriot to the bone to go through that training; and most that I have seen are proud of America for the \\"first time\\" because a black man is running for Pres. How would I ever imagine them putting their lives on the line for it?<br /><br />That said, Mr. Luttrell is a harder than iron and steel Hero of the highest order. I simply cannot express by mere words my admiration for him and EVERY SINGLE Special Forces operative who has ever served this country. His will to survive is utterly incomprehensible to me, an Army Vet with just a modicum of hardcore training.<br /><br />The book is an unfortunate indictment of American ROE as well as the poor judgment of military and civilian leaders who underestimated the threat and prematurely split the war into 2 fronts. The 3 dead heroes in the book should have been alive today-I wish they were-if not for the incompetence in conducting both wars. Leaving blame-names out of it, the Team should not have been in the position to have to decide whether to kill the goatherders or let them go.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Luttrell for sharing your experiences with us armchair quarterbacks, for only you and those who have been on the front lines are truly the ones who have the right to tell how it is and how it should be, and all we should do is nod. (Unless you're a clap-trap leftist of course, in which case I hope I've REALLY pissed you off)<br /><br />That said, this book is a powerful inspirational journal of an unbelievable story-if it weren't so true-soon tolight up the big-screen near you.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|As I'm a true fan of historical/period films I knew I'd own the DVD upon it's release.  I was impressed with the cast, and especially the story behind the creation of this well known song and William Wilberforce's life.
0618918248|3.0|(For the interests of full disclosure, I am a theist.)     In the The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins sets about to convert the great unwashed masses to the enlightened, scientific position of atheism.     When Dawkins sticks to the facts, the book is a wonderful read. When we read about the damage blind theism has done, about the wars between religious dogma and the cold harsh truth of reality, there is no argument -- this is the world as it happened, as it is happening. This is where his arguments are the strongest, and even my superstitious beliefs were put to the test; in these sections, it's inspiring, even gripping, reading. (And heaven help me if I use the word \\"gripping\\" to describe what amounts to a history textbook ever again.)     But in attempting to disprove theism, Dawkins adopts their language, their arguments. Every so often, in lieu of witty prose and bulletproof arguments, Dawkins descends into corrosive personal attacks and just-so assertions. The frequent use of \\"I won't go into\\" part of an opposing argument is quite similar to the theist way of arguing; \\"disprove\\" one part of an argument, and declare it sufficient for the entire. But if he opens the door and fails to go through it, then he opens the door for tens (or hundreds) of holes to be shot in his argument. In effect, if theism does not sufficiently explain Part A of a theorem, he will decide to declare theism incorrect and not look into parts B through E; the exact same as promotors of theism have done over the centuries. But the skeptical theist will proclaim \\"Ah, there was something there that Dawkins was afraid of!\\", and (likely without looking) will assume that these holes in his arguments prove their invalidity -- and the theist's own correctness, by default.     One of his worst offenses is to levy the charges at agnosticism as if it were his greatest enemy. But for the last few centuries, science has been shouting out to God, \\"Are you there?\\" Dawkins takes God's silence as proof of his non-existince and proclaims there is no God; agnostics take God's silence as just the result of another experiment and move on. Yet this is not enough for Dawkins, and some of his bitterest vitrol is reserved for these people. In doing so, has alienated many of his greatest supporters, bright minds who apply scientific reasoning to reality, for not having jumped to the same conclusion he has -- and after chapters of setting up the skeptical theist to regard the philosopher-scientest as some sort of superhuman hero, to see him fire salvos at his own bretheren strikes at the theist as disturbing, and dashes against the rocks all the goodwill he had built up before that point. In the words of Carl Sagan, \\"Really, it's okay to reserve judgement until the evidence is in.\\"     In the end, as a consciousness raising book, it's moderately useful, and modestly enjoyable if you skip over the just-so arguments and the disdainful treatment of all beliefs not sufficiently atheistic enough for him. But as a defense and proof of atheism, it's entirely bankrupt, and will just serve as fuel for some theist's hellfire.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Loved this film when I saw it in theatres in its initial release and couldn't wait for its DVD release.  The restored film and additional features did not disappoint.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|This film was recommended to me, and it took me a while to get to a store where I could rent it for the first time. Then shortly following the rental I felt I needed to buy it and watch it a hundred more times. I sat at my computer paying close attention to even the tiniest details. This film is all about precision (See the special features- 300 day documentary about the making).    First, this film is about two orphan boys living in a crumbling town called \\"Treasure Town.\\" The focus is all about perspective and how one views the world. While Kuro (Black) has a very dark possessive view of his home town, one that he thinks should never be changed, while Shiro (White) has an imagination and an eye for how the world really should be.    The two are endlessly dogged by the Yakuza who want want to change the town into an amusement park (among other things) and make a profit. Kuro fights to preserve \\"My Town\\" and keep it a place that he can always be the top of and see everything from. Like many other people he wants to keep a sense of security. The world turns upside down with its inner workings and everything in the real town seems so superficial that world and dreams of Shiro seem the most logical option for surviving.     The precise colors, time taken for each shot is clearly expressed, nothing in this film is ever missed, all the work is clear cut and every single scene has its meaning.    Kuro and Shiro share a lonely life living in broken down car and living off stolen money and goods. Although Kuro lives to care for his friend, he has his reservations about how care free Shiro is and that Shiro doesn't entirely like the way the town is developing. The conflicting feelings and various lenses that they see this world from is amazing.     I sat back after seeing this and thought it was an intense but completely necessary violent movie about two kids who just don't want their childhood world to be shattered by the adults. So many themes, ideas, and undertones play into this film that it's open to all viewers.     The time, effort, and thought put into this 111 minute film is clear. The sync of the musical score by Plaid and incredible ending sound by Asian Kung Fu Generation and the bizzare world by Mr. Arias makes me want to go be a director, he did an amazing adaptation of \\"Black and White\\" and transformed it into something else entirely with more graphic images and characters that you don't want to ever forget.    If you liked Akira, Steamboy, or like strange, abstract, but intricately woven films, this is the top of the list, and is good for a group of friends or personal viewing. This deserves a 10 out of 5!
0887307280|3.0|Planning to start my own business, I stopped by my local bookstore to do some research. I ran across this book and started reading it right there in the store. The beginning is fantastic, I felt like Gerber was speaking directly to me. The situations and examples he gave were exactly what I have experienced in past businesses. I felt totally connected with this book and was so excited! I read half the book in the store, bought it, took it home and finished it within a day...but I wasn't too happy with it towards the end. You see, in the beginning, Gerber makes it sound as if he TOTALLY understands what you, as a small business owner, has gone through, is going through, and will go through. So, you get caught up in the book, buy it just like I did, only to find out he only talks about how to franchise. For some businesses, such as healthcare, or consulting, businesses where you're not selling things like coffee, hamburgers or simple services, businesses that require professionals like doctors, chiropractors, dentists etc., this model is not practical and will not help. Granted, it is useful knowledge to understand the concept of franchises, but not all businesses can be franchised like how he discussed. But Gerber writes well, so well that even if it's not realistic to franchise your business, you're totally excited about franchising anyway. So, after you finish the chapters, you're completely eager to go franchise, so you even read pass the Epilogue and onto the Afterward (like I did) and THAT's where his true motive for writing the book comes out, which you can see if you're still thinking rationally-- his motive is for you to sign up with the E-Myth company to help you with your small business, to franchise, \\"a call to arms\\" as he puts in in the Epilogue. He wants you to \\"look at your business through your E-Myth eyes\\" he says, and \\"E-Myth Worldwide have assisted thousands...We would love to do the same for you. It begins with our invitation to take part in our free E-Myth experience...To take your first step, simply complete the form at the back of this book....\\" This is just like any other \\"free\\" marketing scheme, to get you in so that they can sell to you. Gerber is brilliant, the WHOLE book is a marketing ploy. It's not enough that you buy the book, you buy into the E-Myth Company. Wow, this book really is brilliant, it ALMOST sold me. And I give this book three stars because if someone does want to franchise, it is indeed worthwhile buying this book. Not for me, though. I wonder, can I still return this book?
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I have not yet viewed all the disks but this is a great collection for anyone interested in the Alien series.
0810994739|5.0|This book is super! Both the first and second books are well writtten and appeal strongly to several age groups.  I have a 4th. and 6th. grader. They search puplic and school libraries trying to find these books.  The books are extremely popular and very hard to find.  When children want to read and you can't find the book than how could you not run and buy it for them!  These books really give kids a desire to read.  If you have a child who dislikes reading this will make them rethink their stance.  These books have kids from 8-12 hopping to get their hands on them!
B000R5N1MC|5.0|Hi    Prefect item,will be something to treasure for years to come if you are in to this film in a big way.    Great way of displaying this HDDVD,and nice to have all the extras.
B000QXDED6|5.0|300 told a nice story and was really a great movie overall.  The appearance was very good, the characters were interesting, and the movie never failed to entertain me.  I can't say anything that hasn't already been said, so just watch this really good movie.
0345440900|5.0|Reading this book allows the writer to take you by the hand, tell you how to breathe calmly and approach a newborn with calm even if you feel like running out of the house screaming ;)    T.
0307120007|5.0|The perfect book for a pre-reader this is a classic that enthralls my toddler every single time we pick it up.  There's a reason why some things weather the test of time, this book is practically perfect in every way.    We got the spiral-bound version, I wouldn't recommend it.  Little kids are very hard on their books, get the hardcover if you can.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|The picture and sound quality of the concert is amazing.  I was pleased to discover that it didn't just consist of Celine Dion singing, but also incorporates an incredibly large amount of dancers brought in by the head of the Cirque de Soleil shows.   Stunning on all counts.    The special feature that is on the first of the 2 Blu-ray discs consists of Dion greeting fans in person from all over the world.  On the second disc, thee is a truly stunning special feature is one that runs two hours (longer than the concert on the first disc) and it is the entire Las Vegas show running on stage while we get a backstage view of all the technical and talent sides. Really fascinating!  There is also one more featurette called \\"Secrets.\\"  The special features are in high def, too, on the Blu-ray discs.    They fill this release with so much that you truly feel like you have been to an incredible dinner and ate everything in sight. A must-have Blu release.
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|The sound of this little guy is very good for what it is.  Goes from clean to a nice classic rock crunch.  What makes it a very good and recommended product is that it is very practical for quiet practice.  Plug into the guitar, plug in headphones, and you are free and mobile to play around.  The offset plug works in front angle sockets (Strat style) or end mounts (everything else), and the controls are readily available.  Seems solid but I have only had it a few weeks.  Right price for what it is.
B000002H7I|5.0|I was listening to Telling Stories earlier today and then went browsing through my Tracy discography and remembered how much I loved the songs on this album, and the album as a whole.  Tracy's mixture of seeing the world's sadness in a clear-eyed way and her determination to fight on with relentless optimism nonetheless makes me think of Barack's Presidential candidacy.  What a combination.  Listen to Crossroads, 100 Hundred Years, Material World, and, especially, All That You Have is Your Soul and be prepared to fight for justice.
0894803123|5.0|Ok I just love this book.  No only excellent recipes for ice cream but also for cookies.  I love the fact that it's not just some plan boring book with words printed on white paper but it's colorful and the little cartoons are cute.  One thing though??  Where is Caramel Sutra??
B00005R62N|5.0|Judas Priest are great.  This live disc is great.  But if you don't buy the disc then you have to buy the \\"Green Manalishi\\" download.  The live version of \\"Green Manalishi\\" is one of the greatest rock songs ever and I don't mean one of the greatest live songs ever but one of the greatest rock songs ever!  Do not buy the studio version of \\"Green Manalishi\\", it pales in comparison to the live version.
0060797509|4.0|There's a reason why the Little House books are considered American classics.  These books are a very simple look at frontier life through the eyes of a little girl.  Readers who enjoy a history lesson without a lecture will enjoy LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS as Laura Ingalls Wilder describes what life was like growing up in the wilderness of Wisconsin's \\"big woods\\" in the 1870's.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|Framing Armageddon is a concept album telling the story of the first humans on Earth as actually being aliens from another planet.  And because it's a concept album with many smaller \\"intros\\" to songs it's practically impossible to just pick out a track and listen to it.  Each song (and intro) flows right into the next one, so really, to get the most out of this album one almost has to listen to it straight through.<br /><br />My PC music player does not arrange the tracks by number in my Music Library so they're all out of order.  So picking just one and playing it just doesn't have the same impact as setting a playlist in the correct order and letting the entire album play through.<br /><br />This aspect may cause some folks to get a negative impression of this album.  I know, I was one of them.  But after listening to the whole album straight through at a good crankin' volume, this album is very enjoyable.  And that's even without following along with the lyrics.<br /><br />OK, now with that said, the music itself is more of what I call a \\"wall of sound\\" than your truely distinguishable melodic songs that differ greatly from one another.  That's why picking one song out of the 14 \\"real\\" songs doesn't make much sense.  Each song basically has the same feel, same galloping guitar riffs from Schaffer, same style of wailing from Ripper, but in this case, that's a good thing.  Because it maintains a sense of continuity.  And that's probably important in a concept album such as this.<br /><br />As others have said, the music in this album was written with Ripper on vocals in mind, so it sounds better.  Glorious Burden was written with Barlow in mind, as he even sang on it the first time through, before the whole thing was scrapped when Barlow just wasn't feeling it, and Ripper was brought in.  But anyhow, Barlow is back and will be vocalizing on the follow up of this epic sci-fi story.  So all is well in the Iced Earth world, or is it? ...as I somewhat wished that Jon would have kept the continuity in vocals within this 2-parter release.  But then again, I may be proven wrong once Part 2 comes out.ty in vocals within this 2-parter release.  But then again, I may be proven wrong once Part 2 comes out.
B0000041DF|5.0|I don't have anything to add to the other (positive) reviews of the music contained on this disc.  Even if it is not the best recording of the Rach 3 (I suspect it is) it is still an absolutely must-hear performance.    The only problem is that this disc uses copy protection.  If you wish to rip this to your hard drive (for legal purposes, of course) you simply may not be able to.  CD ripping software is prevented from accessing track information on the disc.    Good idea to prevent illegal piracy -- unfortunately it ruins it for any law-abiding consumer who just wants to listen to this on their iPod.  Be warned!
0785795294|1.0|Re This edition only [[ASIN:0785795294 The Grapes of Wrath (Pacemaker Classics)]]<br />I ordered this copy of the Grapes of Wrath thinking that it was the paperback edition with full text and criticism with a different binding. Should I have paid more attention to the note I discovered after the fact that the \\"Search Inside\\" referred to another edition of the novel? Yes. Should Amazon have marked the photo of the book cover with something akin to a scarlet letter like \\"A\\" for abridged? Yes. The words \\"Abridged\\" and \\"For ages 9-12\\" appearing prominently in the first line of the description would have stopped me in my tracks. The reviews and \\"Search Inside\\" for abridged books should not link to unabridged editions of the same work.
B00009MGGP|5.0|Francis Urquhart describes himself as \\"just a back room boy\\" in British politics, being Chief Whip of the political party presently in power. In reality, this man is manipulative, corrupt and ambitious , pretending to be a friend to his party colleagues, but with an overweening and ruthless ambition to have sole control of power in Britain. His schemes become machiavellian and he stops at nothing, even murder, to achieve his goals. He learns every detail,good and bad about his rivals in the run up to an election, and systematically forces them to resign, leaving him as the only contendor. Ian Richardson is sensationally brilliant as F U, as he is generally known, dominating every scene as he gives the viewer a chilling, heart racing performance as this political giant and master of evil. The series was made some time ago but the scenario hasn't faded or changed and makes heart stopping viewing.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|Yet another Rush album that fans of the band seem to rank all over the place.  This is a record that I really like, but I know some Rush fans who pretty much loath it.   Through much of the 80's synthesizers dominated many of Rush's tracks, but towards the end of the decade the band had begun to push the guitar back out front, and \\"Counterparts\\" is where Alex Leifson really comes back into the spotlight.  The songwriting on this disc is mainly about relationships between men and women as \\"counterparts\\".  Sounds silly, but Neal Peart pulls it off with some of the best lyrics of his career.  I still think \\"Cold Fire\\" is one of the best relationship songs he has ever written with line after line of great dialogue between the two main characters in the song.   Other highlights include the hit \\"Nobody's Hero\\", \\"Between The Sun And Moon\\", \\"The Speed Of Love\\", \\"Double Agent\\" with it's weird spoken word section by Geddy, \\"Everyday Glory\\" and the funky instrumental \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\".  Actually my two least favorite songs on the album are the two opening tracks \\"Animate\\" and \\"Stick It Out\\" both of which were released as singles.  After the massive \\"Counterparts\\" tour the band would go on hiatus for 3 years coming back with the so so \\"Test For Echo\\" album.  \\"Counterparts\\" remains the bands best album of the 90's.
0143038583|4.0|After reading reviews and the early sections of this book, I fully expected an anti-big business rant like others I have read.  Not to stereotype (but here I go...), the author IS a professor at Berkley.  And early on I did get just that; the author's first \\"industrial\\" meal from McDonalds is essentially deemed illegal, immoral, fattening, unsustainable, etc. etc.  (But his son did like the \\"improved\\" Chicken McNuggets.)  No surprises here, although the insights into large scale, monoculture agriculture were interesting and well written.    What I found much more fascinating were the chapters on organic farming, both large (\\"industrial organic\\") and small (Polyface Farms in Virginia).  The author draws together engaging details, pragmatic economics, history, personal philosophy and passions of the subjects, and the role of government regulation into a rich narrative that riveted me.  Great stuff!  And not what I expected.  Before reading this book I generally applied stereotypes to the organic farming movement; that is, that they are all political leftists.  Not true.  The primary owner of Polyface Farms, Joel Salatin, is a self-described \\"Christian-conservative-libertarian-environmentalist-lunatic farmer\\".  How cool is THAT???  I give the author a lot of credit for exposing the negative impact and large company bias of USDA regulations on Joel's business.    All in all, lots of good information and ideas to chew on (no pun intended).  And no simple ideas or solutions.  The economics get complicated very quickly when trying to compare organice farming to large scale, \\"industrial\\" farming.  I hope we can rely on free markets to work things out.  Personally, I do not want Joel Salatin's job, but I am pleased that he chooses to do what he does.

B000GFLE1S|5.0|I grew up during the times of musicals (and story lines) such as the \\"King and I\\", \\"Tommy\\", \\"Grease\\" and various others that have come out during the previous and this century.  I prefer movies that dipict either historical situations and persons (any kind), and possible ventures of what the future could bring or propose.<br /><br />\\"Kinky Boots\\" was a film that I never went to see at the movie theater, but saw it one day (nothing was on) TV. I had missed the first quarter of the movie, but watched to the end of the movie.  I then reviewed for when I could see it again in its entirety.  This is a kind of movie that is just what it is and should be accepted for what it is - good feeling entertainment, no matter what kind of movie you prefer.
B000ZK4466|5.0|Though the way I listen to an album now may not exactly be the same a year from now, I have to say I haven't been able to keep Bedlam out of my CD player and listening to almost the entire thing when it is playing.    I've had it since the day it came out (about a month now), and the only sign of the album wearing on me is that I only listen to it (in its entirety) an average of once a day, and occasionally put it on random to keep it interesting.    I can't remember The Mars Volta sounding this, I dare say, 'easy' to get into.  Frances had so many moments of ambience that it was hard to get into from the get go and Amputechture had me thinking that TMV was disintegrating (i don't think that now, I think both albums are great).  This is the first album since De-Loused that I have enjoyed from the very first listen.  I firmly believe that just about all of the \\"melodies\\" on this album can be accessible to anyone who loves music and wants something more interesting than today's pop scene.
0061127760|5.0|This hardback edition is a fantastic value; grab this over the paperback edition.  My four year-old daughter loved it.  It was her first \\"real\\" chapter book.  We'd read a series or two of the Rainbow Fairies and a Disney collection of princess stories, but this (along with Wind and the Willows, also superb) was the first classic.  She balked at first (complaining that there weren't enough pictures), but soon she was begging for \\"just one more chapter, please!\\"  The afterward is more geared towards adults, but is still a nice bonus.  Good stuff.
B000ZN8036|5.0|I own a used bookstore and I love to read so I picked up this book Into the Wild and decided the story sounded interesting.  I did not expect to feel that it would captivate me to such an extent that I actually changed some methods of my way of thinking about life and the way that I live it.<br /><br />I suddenly felt this book was now on my top 5 all time books so I knew that seeing this movie was a top priority on my list of things to do.  I checked the website for the movie daily listening to clips from the soundtrack.  After the release date I learned that it was not released in my area of NC and decided I might have to drive to another state to see it.  I was so upset that it was a limited release movie.  Finally after a month an AMC theatre picked it up in my hometown I gathered up a couple of friends from which I had hyped up the book to and had an experience like no other.<br />I was awestruck by this movie and I felt the words from the pages melt onto the screen.  After the movie my eyes still feeling the sting of such emotion I felt revitalized and rejuvinated.<br />Such a great movie and you need to read the book also to fill in any blanks or for parts you didn't understand.<br />5 stars from me,<br />You can't go wrong with this one.... CLASSIC best movie of 2007!

Cage is more interested in meeting the woman who he had a vision of. She is the only vision he's ever had that's more than 2 minutes into the future. He uses his weird ability to charm her and keep ahead of the FBI. The people who stole the bomb are also after Cage to kill him.    I think someone had the idea of a guy who had a limited ability to tell the future but obviously didn't know where to go with the premise. This story doesn't work. The love story between Cage and Biel is dull and unbelievable and to top it all, no explanation is given for why he saw her so far in advance. The bomb story line is just poorly thought out. The bad guys are indistinct and uninteresting and no reason is given for why or how they stole the nuke. The ending is stupid and left me asking, \\"Is that it?\\" Next has an intrigueing premise but they had no idea what to do with it.
B00005JPSM|4.0|This is a satisfying low-key Saturday night flick to watch while enjoying a good (and big) meal -- the very opening, a discussion about preparing quail for the table, will make you extremely hungry, thus you want to be eating when it begins.  The story is good, and believable, and it contains no trashy language or contrivances... a real break from the usual Hollywood fare.  For once, the DVD cover did not deceitfully imply this is a comedy, as has been done with many other movies merely to lure renters/buyers.  It does have light moments, but it is substantially a soap-opera chick-flick, but not a bad one.  Suitable for the entire family; enjoy.
B0010ZR160|5.0|A well acted, powerful story. But (1) in the scene where the serial child killer is discovered, the detective should not have executed him but handcuffed him to suffer what prosecuters and in jail fellow inmates would do to a child killer--a short tortured life.  (2) In considering the care of the child, the mail character should have considered the true consequences of turning the child back to the mother, that a social worker would have come and determined the mother unfit and put the child in foster care, not apt to be anywhere as caring as that of the former policeman and his wife, which would have made the final choice really one of leaving the child there and not resulting in splitting up with the woman who cared for him.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|I'll admit, I came into this series with high expectations. After all, the reviews on this site for Dexter are nothing short of glowing - five star after five star. In addition, this show originally aired on Showtime, and while it's true they're no HBO, the quality of their programming has been increasing in recent years; Dexter - at least, as the magazine critics would have it - continued this trend. And if that weren't enough, the lead actor on Dexter played a prominent role in Six Feet Under, one of the most acclaimed shows in recent memory. So it was with a great deal of excitement that I began season one. But I gotta admit, now that it's over, I came away pretty disappointed.     Don't get me wrong, Dexter makes great throwaway entertainment. The love story between Dexter and his rape-victim girlfriend is interesting. Dexter's killing of fellow murderers satisfies some primal need in us to see violent criminals get what's theirs. And there are also some funny bits spread throughout the script. Although there are also many times the writers get carried away with how wry and incisive they think they are; the lame voiceovers Dexter provides being a prime example (when he is shopping for a Halloween costume, his voice echoes in, telling us he loves the holiday because it is the only time of year \\"everyone has to wear a mask, not just me\\". I wanted to vomit).     However, I believe the claim that this show offers some original insight into the nature of crime or the mind of a serial killer is complete nonsense. Dexter doesn't do anything that superhero series such as Batman hasn't been doing for many, many years - namely, examining a normal person taking the law into his own hands while presenting a more acceptable face to the surrounding society. Toss in a dash of the increased violence we've already seen in similarly themed movies such as The Boondock Saints, and voila, we have Dexter!    I think the constraints placed on Dexter by his detective father - that he must only kill \\"bad people\\" - make the show much, much less compelling. Imagine how spine-chilling it would be to see Dexter attempt to live a normal life by day, while by night he stalked and killed innocent victims on the streets. Now that would be realistic. Now that would be horrifying. Now that would be original. Instead, what we have is in essence a superhero series without tights. It's decent, but don't expect too much.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|This film was awesome!!!! Great storyline and action. The special effects were spectacular and chillling! The characters were great especially Sonny. It had a good twist toward the end. I love movies with robots! Will Smith was great!!!

0385338724|5.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books (those under the pen name Kinsella, and a couple of hers under her given name, Madeleine Wickham) and for those who are avid fans of the Shopaholic series and any of Kinsella's other novels, this one does not disappoint. The only disappointment that I have is that the book isn't twice as long!!! It truly left me wanting more at the end.    I don't generally consider myself a \\"chick lit\\" (or Brit chick lit) reader, but Sophie Kinsella has a way of immersing her readers fully into her characters.    After reading one of the prior reviews, I would say that a reader who is not familiar with Kinsella's writing may not like this as much as the Shopaholic books, but if you are able to separate your expectations from the character of Becky Bloomwood, this one is definitely a must-read. Lexi is just as endearing (and in less of a shopaholic way) as Becky.    Wish there would be a sequel!!! I don't know what it would be about, though. :)
B00062RCBW|5.0|This set was given to my 82 yr old Father who loves The Next Generation. It is a wonderful set.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I admit it, I'm a 34 year old and yes, I listen to pop music.  I have all of Britney's albums and this is by far the best - proving that yes, Britney can sing and excellent producers are key to a good album.<br /><br />Along with the rest of the world, I was pleasantly surprised when she revealed her debut track, \\"Gimme More,\\" which will remain in rotation in the club scene for a long time to come.  \\"Piece of Me\\" is fascinating, catchy and all of us on Team Britney appreciate the @#$% off to the paps.  While most of the songs are bubble gum and fruity, they're all solid and stand on their own.<br /><br />\\"Oh, oh Baby\\" is sexy cool and shows off Britney's talent as a singer (something that she's not even known for these days).  \\"Hot as Ice\\" is an enjoyable play on words and Britney pulls it off with heaps full of sass.  \\"Toy Soldier\\" is another that should be given kudos.<br /><br />It's an all around great album to work out to, dance to, and clean the house to.  Upbeat, flirty, and kind of bratty.  Besides the \\"It's Britney Bitch\\" in the beginning, it's pretty kid friendly - and Brit's matured (as life's been rough) since her freshman album which seems like a hundred years ago now.<br /><br />I could do without the K-Fed rip, \\"Why Should I be Sad\\" but I can't complain when all but one song on the album are what I call repeaters (can listen to more than once in a car trip).<br /><br />Like Madonna, Britney has proven that she may be down - but she's far from out.  This album is awesome.
0440236738|5.0|This book is another reason that Harlan Coben remains my favorite author.  This book was thrilling roller coaster ride of twists and turns.  It grabbed me on the first page and held my undivided attention until the very last sentence.  I will not go into a synopsis of the storyline since it has been related by other reviewers, but I will say that this is a book that you can not skim over paragraphs and you must read the last page to put it all together.  Coben wraps everything up on the last 2 pages and left me with an A-HA moment.
0525950079|3.0|As I read \\"Pillars\\" (both times), I felt totally immersed in the lives of the medieval inhabitants of Kingsbridge. Pillars of the Earth expressed an authenticity which remained riveting from the first page through the last. Sadly, I can't say the same about its' sequel, World Without End.  WWE feels very contrived: from the juvenile descriptions of rampant sex, to the one-dimensional characterizations, to Follett's obvious disdain for religious life. I had the distinct feeling as I turned the pages that his editor insisted this book be \\"sexed up\\" for the twenty-first century.  It just didn't ring true, which was too bad. I guess publishers are just like television producers. They think they need to titillate in order to sell their wares to the public. I couldn't shake that feeling as I disappointedly finished Follett's latest.
6305144176|5.0|Good Morning, Vietnam stars Robin Williams in the type of role he plays best, as the hilarious, irreverent, and nonconformist military disc jockey Adrian Cronauer. Based (extremely) loosely on a true story, the movie takes place in 1965, where Cronauer injects life and humor into the hellish existence of GIs fighting the Vietnam War. To the enjoyment of the troops and the fury of his superiors, he fills the airwaves with rapid-fire hilarity, mocks Nixon, plays rock music, and defies the overzealous military censors with \\"unofficial\\" news reports. Williams' performance is brilliant, and as he would later demonstrate again with films like Dead Poets Society and Patch Adams, the role suits him perfectly.<br /><br />The movie is so effective because it combines humor with poignancy as Cronauer's spirited humanity clashes with the regimented military life, the horrors of war, and the dehumanizing effects of conflict. He forges relationships with the Vietnamese people he comes into contact with, but heartbreakingly comes up against the barriers of cultural differences and political divides.<br /><br />In one of the most unforgettable scenes, he dedicates Louis Armstrong's \\"What a Wonderful World\\" to one of the young GIs headed off to the nightmare of battle. With painful irony, the song mingles with images of the brutal reality of the war. In a sense, the scene encapsulates the discord between Cronauer's insistence on maintaining his humanity and the inhuman world that surrounds him.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I'm not even going to attempt to compete with the stellar reviews here.  I just love this movie.  It's got everything - action, love, fantasy, quirky characters, brilliant performances, drama, fun and laughter.  It's a winner.<br /><br />Make sure you reserve lots of time for this one - it's a long one.  Don't be turned off by the semi-slow build in the beginning - it's well worth it.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000M4RG42|3.0|Overall one of the best films about the war in the Pacific since TORA,TORA,TORA.  Loosely based on the James Bradley book of the same name, Clint Eastwood's direction rescues the Pacific War genre from more recent failed attempts such as THE THIN RED LINE and WINDTALKERS.<br /><br />The film primarily concentrates on the lives of the three surviving second flag raisers on Mount Suribachi.  The famous photograph was the second of two flags raised on the collapsed volcanic rim on Iwo Jima with the names of the first flag raisers almost virtually forgotten except for history books.  The movie does a great job in clearly resolving the lore regarding the two flags.<br /><br />Great CGI effects of the US fleet pounding the basalt and sulpherous island. The island assault sequences were lensed in the same style as PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS with washed out color and a lot of hand held camera activity.<br /><br />As for opportunities this film becomes annoying with constant flashbacks and flash-forwards from the embattled volcanic isle.  Flashbacks worked well at the beginning and conclusion of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but it is a distraction in FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS.  Unlike the companion film, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, which is more or less a sequential story with occasional flahsbacks, FLAGS is chock full of them.  The best continuous sequence of the film is the IWO landing sequence and struggle to move inland.<br /><br />Despite the well depicted story of two Marines and Navy Corpsman struggling through the war bond tour, the whole post Iwo drama pales in comparison to the action on island.  No doubt the island combat flashbacks were inserted to maintain the intensity of the film.  Quite frankly I would have enjoyed a whole film revolving around these characters and their experiences on Iwo Jima alone.  Much as I did actually enjoy this movie and LETTERS, there is a signficant opportunity to create yet a third hybrid version of the Iwo battle combining the best elements of both stand-alone movies.<br /><br />Eastwood captured the look and mood of 1945 America and the bond tour.  The only aspect that is overplayed is that of the United States being almost bankrupt and the heavy sales burden placed on the returning heroes.  These guys are wined and dined across the United States and forced into roles they never asked for.  Toward the end of the film one cannot help but feel sorry for the well known story of poor Ira Hayes and his inability to adjust to his celebrity status and ultimate decline.<br /><br />FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a very good movie, but loses some of its power on a small television screen.  In the movies theater I was impressed by the end credits and the ominous end title music with actual photos of the Iwo Jima struggle projected alongside the film's credits.  I could not bring myself to leave the theater until the credits concluded. FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is another film where theater audience exited in total silence during the end credits.<br /><br />Eastwood filmed in a variety of locations.  The production crew did an outstanding job filming many of the Iwo Jima scene in Iceland.  The Icelandic beaches and inshore volcanic terrain are very similar to the basaltic and tuffa volcanic isle.Eastwood captured the look and mood of 1945 America and the bond tour.

B000JY8F22|5.0|This movie is not your typical love story but it is a love story. It shows the complexity behind our relationships and what makes some work and some not. Honesty, even when painful, is depicted as the key ingredient as well as fearless love in the face of rejection and being willing to fight for someone rather than walk away. It has so many great lines..Natalie's charactor gets the majority of them. Like when she tells her cheating boyfriend who tries to say he couldn't help it that there is always a moment when you can draw the line and you choose to or you choose not to...it is one of my favorite movies...other favorites include French Kiss and Pulp Fiction...if you share that taste...good chance you'll appreciate this movie, too. It is at least original unlike all the remakes Hollywood has taken to putting out and has the beauty of being written with those fabulous smart witty lines that the old movies always had.
B000WGX8HY|4.0|The Black Parade pulls from MCR's most epochal influences.  Sadly many will overlook this and brand it as another \\"emo\\" album.  However if one would listen to the music, a myriad of genres mesh together and create a truly great rock album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A great combo of various genre's.  A little bit western, a little sci-fi, a little comedy, a little drama and the list goes on.  Not the same old same old.  The series should never have ended.
0765316889|3.0|I really enjoyed Elantris, Mistborn: the Final Empire and was happy to finally read a sequel to one of Mr. Sanderson's books. While I found the read to be entertaining, I was ultimately disappointed by the book. I really want to say that Well of Ascension was a great book for me to read, but it didn't live up to my expectations.    There are many good things about Well of Ascension. First, it has the same great world that was in The Final Empire. Second, more is revealed about Allomancy. Third, there are some great action scenes. Fourth, Brandon's writing is usually clear and enjoyable to read. Fifth, Vin is still a fascinating character to read about.    What ruined the book for me were essentially three details:     First, there is a fair amount of graphic violence in the book. While the Hong Kong martial-arts film inspired action scenes can be thrilling, there are a number of gory depictions I could have done without. In fact, it seems that most of the characters become a little sociopathic during this book.     Second, the character of Elend faltered for me. He changes from a loveable bookworm and idealist to an often merciless egotist by the end of the book. Elend receives far more attention in Well of Ascension than he received in Final Empire, but his grandiose involvement in Well of Ascension seems contrived.     Third, I was disappointed in the ending which seemed to be a forced cliff-hanger included just to make sure a third book in the series could be written. Worst of all, the ending left me with a feeling that reading the book was a waste of my time because everything that happened doesn't really matter anyways.    I'll probably read the final book in the Mistborn series, because I know Brandon tries to be a good person. So I'm trusting he'll redeem his story-line and his characters in the last book.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|I hated this movie.  It was 91 minutes of excruciating agony to watch three self-absorbed, small-minded jerks ride on a train. There is no message or deeper meaning to this movie, except perhaps to avoid films set on trains, films about Americans in India, and, above all, films by Wes Anderson. If you are looking for a vastly superior movie about three brothers and their bonding rituals, try any of those starring Larry, Curly, and Moe.
B000003TAB|3.0|Okay, so I love Nirvana. But even they were not perfect, although some would highly debate that one. The studio albums were all pretty good, two of three amazing ones at that. The bulk of the material on \\"Incesticide\\" was left off of the albums for a very good reason: It doesn't live up to what they do as a band on the records. There are some pretty good moments though: While the session version of \\"Aneurysm\\" isn't that different from the original (on the \\"SLTS\\" single) it is still fairly amusing to hear Kurt sing lines like, \\"Come on over and do the twist,\\" and there's some nice enough riffs on the track as well. I really enjoy the cover of the Vaselines' \\"Molly's Lips,\\" a group he highly championed. But one great thing about Kurt getting the success is on top of putting my choice of music on the map, he often would also put many of the underground bands who inspired him on the map. That's one example. Also, there's childhood stuff that's mentioned both more as reflective (\\"Sliver\\") and rather humorous (\\"Been a Son\\"). I like the sort of change in pace on \\"(New Wave) Polly,\\" but recommend the [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] version tenfold over this.    There are quite a few clunkers though. For one the record goes for a lot longer than it needs to as well, and some of the well intentioned stuff is pretty boring. \\"Beeswax\\" and \\"Hairspray Queen\\" are some of the group's worst songs, neither of redeeming value. I like the concept of \\"Aero Zeppelin\\" but not even that one's very memorable. I like Devo quite a bit but the \\"Turnaround\\" cover is a real failure. Putting \\"Downer\\" which is already on [[ASIN:B0000035E7 Bleach]] was a pretty pointless inclusion as well. It's pretty mediocre for them. The first half is a lot better than the second half, if you ask me.    Time has not treated this as kindly as other Nirvana releases, and I pretty much recommend anything else over this. But, I recommend it if you want to get more into Nirvana. Just don't expect any real brilliance inthis collection, as it's far and few on this release. Also, the actual albums are more dynamic which I by default prefer to this release. It's usually sold cheap and is interesting at least for a few listens.

0385341067|4.0|Proclaims adult aged Matilda as she begins her story about Tom Christian Watts, the only remaining white person living (p 18, 19) \\"in a village population of less than sixty\\" on the remote island of Bouganville [part of the Solomon Islands], who introduces about twenty kids ranging in age from seven to fifteen to one Charles Dickens by way of his novel Great Expectations. Having (p 4) \\"grown up believing white to be the color of all the important thing,\\" heightens the children's feelings of intrigue about Mr. Watts, a \\"source of mystery.\\" The story takes place the time of civil war [a secessionist leader declared the island independent from Papua New Guinea after a blockade was imposed] during late 1991 and on into 1992. Mr. Watts, nicknamed Pop Eye because of his eyes' bulging prominence and known for his eccentric habit of pulling his wife, a heavyset recluse native of the island, along in a trolley while wearing a clown nose, seems an unlikely choice for a teacher. As he starts his short-lived tenure, he tells them (p 18), \\"The truest thing I can tell you is that whatever we have between us is all we've got.\\"  Student Matilda, almost fourteen, is being raised by her mother, her father having left on a mining plane when she was eleven. Upon learning that the new teacher is not a man of God, her mother, wary of his teachings, tries to prevent his pupils from going astray when she (along with other villagers at various times) is invited to share her knowledge with the class. The story of Pip becomes a bit of an obsession for students and their parents alike. After all, as Mr. Watts professes (p 155), \\"A person entranced by a book simply forgets to breathe.\\" Recitation of the novel ends. Soldiers arrive. A misunderstanding occurs. And all you-know-what breaks loose. Author Lloyd Jones has produced a unique book with a well thought out plot. Another great classic / contemporary combo: Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf (read first) and The Hours by Michael Cunningham.

B00008GKEG|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan, this is a must have!  Starting from the very beginning, all the way to the present, this is the story of how the Beatles came to be, what they were, and how they still are today.  With interviews with Paul, George and Ringo (and footage of interviews with John), it really gives a personal point of view to go along with photos, images and footage of the fab four. I especially enjoyed the first couple episodes, which focuses on their early career. Well worth the money, something every Beatle fan should own!

If you take a mixture of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Princess Bride, Aladdin, Oliver, and Rothfuss' own originality, stir it up, make it for adults; then you are left with an amazing, fantastic story ir a super interesting world.

0316113506|5.0|This book has a fascinating chapter about anxiety.  Dr. Ratey says that a peptide secreted by the heart muscle when we exercise regulates stress and anxiety (atrial natriuretic peptide, p. 102).  Who knew a heart valve needs to get pumping for us to feel calm, cool, and collected?     Dr. Ratey's chapter on addiction has tons of fascinating research on how exercise produces chemicals which help us experience pleasure in life's simple things, reducing urges to seek pleasure in self-destructive ways.      I recommend this book for anyone who has kids - especially the chapters on learning and ADHD.  It is so interesting to learn how our bodies can improve our brain :-)

The pace is fast, the tension builds swiftly, and the characters, both two-footed and four-footed are charming and compelling.  You can't turn the pages fast enough, and you certainly cannot put it down.  The plot twists and turns, and you have to know what comes next.  The device of teaching Einstien to read is truly unique.  This is a truly an excellent, extraordinary, entertaining read.<br /><br />And Einstein can come live with me...anytime.

I learned alot of medicine, clergy but as a spinner, dyer and weaver I really enjoyed the textilian tales the most. Frustrating at times but in the end all comes round and makes a great tale - thanks Ken Follett for this book!
B000WTNCQS|3.0|I'm sure that this product will be worth something in years to come but it's not all that brilliant. the prints are lovely but are images you've bound to have seen before. The DVD of the live action on the Joshua Tree tour is really good. There's nothing much special about the B sides if you already own a copy of the 'Where the Streets have no name' single! The presentation box is wonderful and the book is cute. This product has potential to be of value as the years go by - it is nice to add to the collection. But don't expect too much because your'll be disappointed!
B000XCZGV8|5.0|A terrific 2007 film, that was overlooked by many but is as good a thriller that you will find.  David Fincher is once again in top form as he meticulously recreates the era when the Zodiac killer was haunting the Bay Area.  Great performances by the actors throughout the film and the story is very involving even for those who know it well.  If you are looking for car chases and shootouts this is not the film for you.  This is a psychological thriller that follows the investigation of the infamous killer.  The special edition has several very in depth docs about the case that the bare bones initial DVD did not have.  I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in top notch suspense.
B00104W8T6|4.0|The music is what made Juno stand out for me, so I was curious to see how true the soundtrack was to the music I heard on film, and it doesn't disappoint.  It's very refreshing to hear songs that are totally different from what's out there with most movies of this genre.  My wife is about to go crazy from hearing Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches, but I can't get enough of it!
B0010X8NF0|5.0|The first Wes Anderson movie I saw was \\"Rushmore,\\" and it has always been my favorite--perhaps because it was the first I saw. I have enjoyed all of Anderson's other films, but \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is, like [[ASIN:B00003Q42P Rushmore - Criterion Collection]] a special favorite.<br /><br />\\"Darjeeling\\" has the elements we have come to expect from Anderson: eccentric characters, exploration of family (and family-like) relationships, beautiful visuals and settings, interesting music. etc. And, of course, it features some of the familiar family of actors who have appeared in previous films, including Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray.<br /><br />This is not to say that Anderson's films are all the same. Each is a unique journey, but the writer/director has put his stamp on them to make each a \\"Wes Anderson\\" film, as surely as other great directors have done. Where but in a Wes Anderson film could a train get lost and go off course?<br /><br />If you have enjoyed other Anderson films, you will definitely want to see \\"Darjeeling.\\" If you have not seen any of his previous films, you might start with this one and/or \\"Rushmore.\\" In many ways, these two films may be his most accessible.<br /><br />Although the movie is wonderful, the DVD is somewhat disappointing. The packaging is very plain and the only extras are the \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" short and a making-of documentary. No commentary track or other extras. Guess we have to wait for the Criterion Collection DVD for those.

1401300529|5.0|As other reviewers have noted, this is not a comprehensive history of the Korean War. However as in most good historical works, the author is  highly selective in the material he chooses to present. That material supports the author's main theme: the political failures that lead to the war, the personal failures that resulted in the creation of a debacle, and the failure to learn any lessons from the war that resulted in a repetition of the failures, even to this day.    The book draws to a rather abrupt, and for me disappointing, conclusion immediately after the events of Chipyongni with about 2 years left to go in the war. But on reflection I think the unsatisfying conclusion to the book simply mirrors the unsatisfying conclusion to the war itself.    The nugget of gold in this book is found at the end in the section called \\"The Consequences\\", and in the epilogue.  A lot of food for thought there. And some interesting conclusions as to the consequences of the war for the rest of the century and beyond.    I came away with a much better understanding of this war, its causes and consequences. And it was an excellent read by a good author.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Great to get a collection from the series that allows you to catch up in a few seatings.  DVD (used) was in very good condition and arrived before the new season started.
0743298039|1.0|I can't believe there are SO many positive reviews for this book!  Am I reading the same book as everyone else?  Blah, blah, blah - This story seems to drag on forever and not in a good way! Soooooo Very BORING.
B000UR9T82|5.0|If you liked the movies, buy them on blu ray.  Worth the fifty bucks, they don't disapoint!  See Kirsten Dunst in all her wet glory!! And the action looks great too...
6301334345|5.0|Gene Hackman is probably the most underrated actor in Hollywood.  To every role he brings passion, humanity and believability. I can't imagine any other actor playing the role of \\"Mr. Anderson\\" (I can hear Willem Dafoe saying it) as effectively as he does.    As noted, the film is based on an actual event, the murders of Mickey Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Cheney, young civil rights activists trying to register blacks to vote.  From what I know about the South in those days, it is a pretty accurate depiction. The hatred, the refusal to change (integrate), the two separate societies was all there. Little Rock, Univ. of Alabama, Central High School, these horrors could be watched on TV.   The Southern racists in the movie are so beneath contempt that they risk becoming straw men, a possible weaknesses.    Certainly Mr. Anderson was right that the malefactors could never be charged with murder in a state court and be found guilty (unless somehow they obtained a change of venue, an unlikely event).  Do the ends justify the means?  When the FBI agents try to find the murderers the old-fashioned way, they meet solid walls of opposition: blacks afraid of retribution if they tell what they know, and whites who button up to protect themselves. So the DaFoe character finally takes Mr. Anderson's advice to \\"do whatever it takes\\" to put the murderers behind bars. Is Pauline Kael correct to dismiss this as \\"vigilantism\\"? Well, it is a legitimate objection (the DaFoe character  reminds Mr. Anderson that the coerced confession he just obtained from the town's mayor violated his civil rights and will be inadmissible in court! Hot damn!).  Mr. Anderson observes \\"These people crawled out of the gutter! Maybe it's time we got in there with them!\\" Well, they have more tricks up their sleeves, and obtain other evidence against them.    It is a wonderful script, with taut, exciting dialogue, and the conflict between Hackman and DaFoe is the stuff of powerful drama. This is a gut-wrenching film, not for the timid, with wonderful performances by all involved. I never tire of watching it.
B000HIVOI2|3.0|I was a little bummed by the transfer to hi def...  Was hoping for the same awe as when I first watched the newest blu ray version of Blade Runner.  Fans of that movie should NOT miss it!  Really anxious to see how they treat \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" in blu ray.  Anyway, Stargate is still a very good movie, but I'd stick with whataver version you have on dvd already and be happy with the up-convert on your HD tv.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|The story of Rodrigo  Diaz de Vivar comes alive in this tremendous epic film featuring Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren.  The re mastered DVD is awesome in its sound and definition quality.  El Cid is a clear example of grand scale epic film that is not done any longer.  The unification of Spain during the early Medieval times presents the religious struggles between Christian kingdoms and the invading Moors.  This religious war continues today in our world and the film presents an unique perspective as how to solve cultural and theological differences  between arabs and christians.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B000SBUCEA|5.0|This box is so cool. Been a fan of ELP's since the mid 70's and I own most of their stuff. For this reviewer this box, \\"From The Beginnig\\" far supasses 1993's \\"The Return Of The Manticore\\" on several accounts. The live versions of \\"The Barbarian\\", \\"Knife-Edge\\" and \\"Rondo\\" are very exciting. These three selections are from the Lyceum, London, Dec. 1970. Even in these early days, these guys put on one hell of a show. Carl's drumming on \\"Rondo\\" is spectacular, spectacular. \\"Oh, My Father\\" is a wonderful song, finally getting released on this box. \\"Hoedown\\" (live from 1973), \\"Jerusalem\\" and \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" (both in the first mix) are virtually indentical to the original release. However \\"When The Apples Blossoms\\"  the B-Side version, is really nice. \\"C'est La Vie\\" and \\"I Believe In Father Christmas\\" are both in an early version and are significantly different from the original. The interview segment from Aaron Copeland is interesting as well to start disc 4. \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Touch and Go\\" are live versions.    The only songs that from me are rather suspect are \\"Mars - The Bringer Of War\\" from Emerson, Lake & Powell and \\"DesedeLa Vida/La Vista/Sangre De Toro\\" from the group 3. Emerson, Palmer and somebody else. They are of minor interest. But it's kinda nice to have a song represented from these almost ELP groups of the mid/late 80's.     Finally, disc 5. Wow. Live at Mar Y Sol Festival, Puerto Rico, January 1972! Very Cool. Yes, \\"Hoedown\\", \\"Tarkus\\", \\"Take A Pebble\\", \\"Lucky Man\\" and \\"Rondo\\" have been repeated from earlier in the box, but these are different versions. Actually, with the exception of \\"Lucky Man\\" the entire concert is previously unreleased.    The DVD is rather disappointing. I had to play it in my computer, as it would not play in my DVD player since it's a European PAL disc. I thought the DVD would show previously unreleased concert footage from 1973. And yes, they do, briefly, in short clips. Not one song is played in it's entirety. The majority of the DVD shows preconcert footage/setting up/rehearsals etc. Clips of archival film footage of interviews, Emerson skeet shooting, Lake fishing, Palmer getting a massage after a show. Some of the clips are from the much better DVD \\"Beyond The Beginng\\". But I didn't buy this box set for the DVD alone. I bought it mostly for the excellent music. And excellent it is indeed.    The booklet is large with many outstanding photos throughout their ELP history. Also included is a nice long interview that is quite interesting covering the inception of the band to it's breakup. Although, according to Palmer, they haven't actually broken up.     The design of the box itself is not the best I've seen. The booklet slides out virtually everytime the box is opened up. Ah, C'est la vie. Even though I had the lion's share of this box set, I feel it was positively worth it.
B000ZN8036|5.0|This movie is amazing on every level.  The characters are so well developed and the cinematography is gorgeous.  Many scenes have touched me and stayed with me long after seeing the film.
B000002L7Y|5.0|If you call yourself a music fan, whether of general music, or specifically 80s music, this is a must own.  Although 2 songs on here were big on USA radio for a while, the rest of the songs are excellent.  Nice mix of pop rock, and more soft pop songs.  Very addicting songs, excellent melodies and just a great album in general, you will not be disappointed.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band's 2007 effort \\"Magic\\" is an immensely enjoyable project. Springsteen dubbed this release a \\"pop\\" album, and while upon first listen it musically doesn't seem any more \\"pop\\" than the band's previous effort, 2002's [[ASIN:B000069HKH The Rising]], it's clear that the mindset was different in the making of this record. Where [[ASIN:B000069HKH The Rising]] was full of inspirational songwriting and post-9/11 sentiments, \\"Magic\\"'s songs focus again on love and personal struggles. The product is an album that is every bit as genius as its predecessor.<br /><br />Springsteen continues to progress as an artist and a songwriter. The tunes on \\"Magic\\" range from rugged hard rock to softer folksy material to catchy ballads. What remains a constant is a certain nostalgia to most of the tracks; the majority sound somewhat similar, and often startlingly so, to a Springsteen song from 20 years ago. Bruce's verses are frequently poetic, thoughtful, and artistic. He lets loose social and political statements in a metaphoric fashion. Longtime fans might notice a change in his vocal sound, as he tends to incorporate a little more vibrato or airiness into his usually gruff delivery, and his verses are not as repetitive. The result is another excellent composition from the greatest rock performer of our time.<br /><br />The band also sounds fantastic. Clarence Clemons' sax is as aggressively smooth and powerful as ever, and Little Stevie Van Zandt seems only to get better with age. The multi-talented Soozie Tyrell provides invaluable contributions on the violin and background vocals. What might take getting used to for fans is the production. Some studio elements are incorporated to make a balance and sometimes an echo effect that might turn some off at first. However, I find the sound to be clean and polished.<br /><br />The album opens with an instant classic, the driving arena rock of \\"Radio Nowhere.\\" Following a wonderful guitar line, Bruce delivers perfect verses despairing about the current state of mainstream media, complete with a Clemons solo. This song catches Bruce and the band at their absolute finest. \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" and the somewhat political \\"Livin' in the Future\\" are both rich arrangements, the former an artistic somber number and the latter a seemingly joyful rocker. \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" sounds phenomenal, and the lyrics are thought-provoking. Bruce's harmonica opens \\"Gypsy Biker,\\" a creative and memorable number, and the unforgettable \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" provides a true highlight, musically and lyrically perfect. Roy Bittan's piano on the great \\"I'll Work for Your Love\\" recalls his performances on [[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]], and it turns into a catchy and endearing love song. The title track is a subdued and deep effort that would be at home on [[ASIN:B0007WF1WS Devils & Dust]]. \\"Last to Die\\" is frenetic and meaningful, and while \\"Long Walk Home\\" feels familiar, it is nonetheless enjoyable. The most ambitious song is \\"Devil's Arcade.\\" Structurally, the best comparison I can make would be to \\"Bittersweet Symphony,\\" and it's a really impressive song. The album closes with \\"Terry's Song,\\" a heartfelt highlight dedicated to his late friend Terry Magovern.<br /><br />\\"Magic\\" is yet another wonderful composition to add to the Springsteen legacy. Both the man and the band are in top form, and this album shines from a performance and artistic standpoint. As with any of Bruce's music, it is best enjoyed live, and should you get the chance to enjoy the \\"Magic\\" tour, you will not be disappointed. However, the fans who can't make it to catch the tour will be satisfied for the time being with this excellent album from rock music's greatest visionary.ing about the current state of mainstream media, complete with a Clemons solo.

B00006EXDM|5.0|This is some of the best rock and roll music ever made and it is all you need if you want to hear The Rolling Stones' greatest music.<br /><br />This is music made when they were a great band and not obscenely rich corporate shills that rock out for aging, middle class and yuppie baby boomers --while sticking it to the people with absurdly high ticket prices, all for the glory of their lost youth and Budweiser or whoever the corporate god is to whom they pay tribute on that particular tour.
0743298039|5.0|This is a well written book with a riveting plot. I couldn't put it down.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|Great sending, with a not so important delay. Just a little disappointment: a plastic corner has been broken...  IMPORTANT: I haven't been awared of the importation taxes (I'm in France) which are about 11 = $15,85 for 2 seasons!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I heard all the hypes, watched all the ads, previews, had my doubts, and almost wrote off this one as another CSI type drama series, and vigilanti? that's such a turn off to me. But I always make an effort to give things a few try no matter how bad my impression of them are. Yeah, I end up wasted countless hours watching movies, tv shows. But once a while, there comes something like Dexter, just makes all my effort worthwhile. And truly, all those previews don't do justice to this show at all. Thanks to the enormous talents of Michael C. Hall, Dexter gives us one of the most fascinating characters on screen ever. See it for yourself.
B000006TRV|3.0|There is no doubt that The Wall has been a huge success since it was released in 1979.But I have never been able to  consider this a true Pink Floyd album.This is a Waters project,with pink floyd as session musicians. Its boring,depressing,and sloppy. The biggest draw back for me is waters nasal and whiney vocals.Is it any surprise that the biggest hits are the ones Gilmour sang? Its also extremly long and I cant sit through two cds of waters singing. If it wasn't for Gilmour this  might be what Dark Side would have sounded like.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I have several friends who are Pink Floyd fans yet they're unfamiliar with most of the solo recordings of Roger Waters. Sadly, I think that's the case with a lot of people. After all, none of his solo songs were ever huge radio hits and it's amazing if you hear any of them on the radio at all anymore.<br /><br />And there's something wrong with that. Roger has put out some amazing music since his days in Pink Floyd and it's a shame that his solo works aren't better known than they actually are.<br /><br />A great case in point is THE PROS AND CONS OF HITCH HIKING album. This one is probably my favorite of all his albums. The music and lyrics on here are incredible. I also love all of the dialogue you can hear in the background of the songs. Thankfully both the lyrics and dialogue are included in the liner notes of the cd. Being able to read some of the things that are a little hard to hear clearly while listening to the cd defintely adds to the overall experience of appreciating this album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on here are...well, it's hard to narrow it down. As other reviewers have stated, it's almost like you're listening to one very long song with several different parts to it. That being said, the title track (which was the closest thing to a hit from this album) is always a lot of fun to hear. It's a great rock song.<br /><br />Eric Clapton's guitar work on this album is great, as is the playing of all the other musicians involved. As for Roger, his voice is fantastic. He sings with a LOT of passion throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />If you're a Pink Floyd fan and you're not familiar with this album, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this one. It's a unique sounding album and it may take a few listens for it to grow on you, but give it a chance. If you do, chances are very good that you'll end up loving it.
B00008BXJF|5.0|This has been one of my favorite releases of the past four years.I must have listened to this a hundred times by now.The whole album is superb,but my favorites are the instrumentals.Level Five,electrik,and dangerous curves are extremely addictive.And man can these old guys get heavy when they want to.Fripp and Belew's guitar performances are nothing short of amazing.Im only really a fan of the Thrak,Construction Of Light,and Power to Believe Crimson.This is definitely not for everybody as Crimson are a very abstract and difficult band to understand.
B000004286|5.0|This is THE best of Mr. Horner's score! He captured the heart and soul of the film and what the film was about. It was not a usual epic film score. It was a score written and based upon the heart of William Wallace and the courage of the Scots. There was not a track I didn't like. Every minute of it is just enrapturing and even addictive.    Even if you don't like Mr. Horner, this score can be enjoyed. It is so original and inspirational. You MUST own this music!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Having seen this Celion Dion show in Vegas, this DVD puts me right back there.  It's outstanding and the \\"full access\\" portion of it is the most entertaining thing I've ever watched.  My entire family viewed it and can't believe how great it is.  It's well worth buying and watching over and over again!
B000002OR4|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal. Breathtaking. The most original of Mr. Williams' works and definitely one of his best. Even by itself,one can feel the many dark emotions involved with the Holocaust. I seriously think that this review is one of the worst written simply because I'm not the greatest with words. But I just hope you've caught my drift on how good this score is....:)
B000002MTR|5.0|I think this is a great album.not there best but there most rocking!so i give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.the only song i cant stand is pea,why bother putting a song like that on an album?I say this album is half rock and half funk.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Not only is the Prisoner of Azkaban probably the best of the films thus far but so is the score. Ever since I first heard 'Buckbeak's Flight', I was in love with this score.    Mr. Williams let loose his wisdom,talent and magic into this score and didn't stop. Every theme and almost every track in this album is just amazing! Even the zany, chaotic \\" Knight Bus\\" piece is entertaining to listen to! The best part of this score is the midieval blood in it. The whole score is centered around the midieval-style music, taaking you into the world of Harry Potter. This is definitely a must-have for Harry Potter fans and for anyone else who enjoys a good film score.
1932100660|5.0|I am a registered dietitian and this is the most profound, important book on health and the food we eat that I have ever read. It is based on the largest study of nutrition ever conducted, but includes much more nutrition research findings than even what the China Study revealed. T. Colin Campbell (no relation to me) is one of the most knowledgeable, respected nutrition researchers of our time and very engagingly shares a wake-up call for us all. I could not put this book down. If you are interested in food or good nutrition, please read this book. If you are interested in good health, have a serious health problem or want to avoid one, please read this book. If you prepare meals for people you love, please read this book. If you eat, please read this book. It could change your life -- it certainly did change mine.
B00000ILDE|5.0|The first movie in this series generated scares and some thrills; this sequel generates thrills and some scares. The restored footage fleshes out Ripley's character and provides some background on what happened at the colony before the relief party gets there. You can enjoy the movie without this information, but it is helpful, rounds out the narrative, and is good to see, at long last. I am not the best authority on technical details, but I think the image and sound are good on this DVD. There is only a little collateral information, but the effects stuff is interesting, especially as a window into the past, where a big snazzy sci-fi movie like this could be made (and made to look good) for less than $20M. And I particularly like the technology in this movie: it all looks used and usable--a minor thing, perhaps, but it adds to the believability of the movie's world and it is fun to watch people in the future ply their trades like they know what they are doing and are not just pretending.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study by T. Colin Campbell and Thomas M. Campbell 11 was compelling reading because it provided reports of sound research showing the links between diet and health.  Although reporting on scientific data I found the text readily understandable by a layman.  I appreciated the openness and honesty of the authors in addressing the reasons for the confusion surrounding dietary information.  I am persuaded in the value of a vegan diet and have confidently shared this book with many of my friends and family.
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|What a disappointment. My wife and I sat through an hour of this sad excuse for a comedy and didn't laught once. If your idea of hilarity includes the wrong coffin being delivered to a funeral, an old man in a wheelchair using the f-word, or accidental ingestion of halucinogenic drugs, knock yourself out. My recommendation: don't bother. You have much better things to do with a couple of hours.

0143038419|2.0|I agree with some others - I thought it was a self indulgent trip with lots of money for a book that was to be written ( and a movie somewhere in the works).  I did not like her political \\"anti-president\\" comments - very obvious she was a far left liberal.  I have a friend that always asks - \\"what book are you reading now?\\" and i say - still, the book that wouldn't end.  I wanted to get through it - thinking that there must be something wonderful in it - I\\"m just not there yet.  Well, I'm done with the book and it never happened.

B00000K0DQ|5.0|Let me start about by saying that I can see why Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn won awards for best actress in a leading role and best actor in a leading roll.<br /><br />Dead Man Walking a film by Tim Robbins is based on actual events. Susan Sarandon portrays Sister Helen Prejean a nun who is in prison ministry and becomes pen-pals with a condemned inmate Matthew Poncelet. Sister Helen went to the prison just to talk with him and get him to accept Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior before he was scheduled to be executed.<br /><br />Sean Penn portrays Matthew Poncelet a man who was convicted of killing two teenagers and sentenced to die. I would also like to add that Sean's portrayal of Matthew Poncelet (this is not the real life name of the actual person that this movie was based on.) was very moving so much so that it actually made me cry.<br /><br />What I loved about this movie was that it raised a lot of questions on the issue of capital punishment. The Bible says \\"Thou Shall Not Kill\\" but, The Bible also says \\"An Eye for an Eye\\" As you watch this film you will see how the victims family and rightfully so want Matthew Poncelet to die. They feel that this is the right thing to do. However, Sister Helen brings up some startling points like just because someone committed a horrible crime does that mean that he or she does not deserve to hear about God's love and His forgiveness and to be treated like a human being during their last days? This film after you watch it will make you ask these questions. (At least it did for me)<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought this film because it does truly make you wonder what is truly the right and wrong way to handle situations like in the case of Matthew Poncelet.<br /><br />The only thing I was really disappointed with was the ending because the ending in the movie differs from the actual events that had taken place which I don't understand but, other than that I have no complaints and I really do think that anyone who is torn on the issue of capital punishment or lean to one side over the other should see this film because it does not only show the victim's families point of view but, you also get to see things through the eyes of someone who is convicted of a crime. So this is why I love this film because it doesn't just focus on one point of view but, both points of view.an to one side over the other should see this film because it does not only show the victim's families point of view but, you also get to see things through the eyes of someone who is convicted of a crime.

B0011KQSZ4|3.0|This is a droll English comedy. It is not fast pace,but has subtle wit.  It takes awhile to get into it.  Think BBC comedy and you will get the picture. There is a running pill bottle gag that is cute and serves to wrap up the movie.  Humor is found in stuffing a coffin with a dwarf, particularly the placement of the dwarf is funny.  The nude drugged barrister is a familiar face.  He was the pilot in the si-fi tv show FIREFLY.  There is one thing that I shoild mention and that is the bathroom scene.  You would think that since this is English it would have some taste when comes to physical humor.  Excuse me that was very bad choice of words.  Lets just say this scene is on a par or worse than AMERICAN PIE and leave it at that.  Truth is you have to love Englsih comedies to sit through this one.  It is a short 90 minutes but it does seem longer at times.  It is cute and not a bad time wasteter[is that a word?]
B00006AW2P|4.0|Yes, even the Rolling Stones were once young and hungry. Released in 1964, the group's U.S. debut (and the counterpart to their self-titled U.K. LP) is an urgent slab of hardcore blueswailing from the soon-to-be Greatest Rock and Roll Band In The World. This was made in the days when Mick Jagger and Keith Richards hadn't yet come into their own as songwriters. Indeed, only three of these songs are group originals. And I'm using the word \\"original\\" in a very liberal sense here: \\"Now I've Got A Witness\\" is basically an instrumental version of a Motown tune by the name of \\"Can I Get A Witness\\" (a version of which appears toward the end of this album), while \\"Little By Little\\" is- let's face it- a very derivative uptown R&B/blues shuffle. Finally, \\"Tell Me\\" has Phil Spector's fingerprints all over it, with its teen-drama lyrics and swooning melody. The funny thing is, these aren't really bad songs: \\"Little By Little\\" is full of bemused attitude, with plenty of gin-joint instrumentation and a great drawling vocal from Jagger, with a wild guitar solo thrown in the middle. \\"Tell Me\\" may be derivative, but it shows that the 'Stones knew how to maximize the effect of their favorite cliches: It's an incredibly catchy song, with a soulful chorus and a totally freakin' sweet guitar part. It also proves that even when Mick was mewling and pleading for his girl to take him back, he still sounded way cooler than anybody you'll ever meet. And have I mentioned the guitars? \\"Now I've Got A Witness\\" is, well, actually pretty boring. They can't all be winners, I guess.    No, these 'Stones were not known for their songwriting. What made their music, self-penned or otherwise, worthwhile were the performances. And they really were amazing performers: Guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones (who, in the absence of a dominating creative voice within the group, was actually seen as the head Stone) was an absolute beast of a musician, attacking his instrument(s) with prodigious insanity and plenty of raw attitude. Richards, meanwhile, was just about the only guitarist who could make a suitable partner; the two bounced off of each other brilliantly, intertwining rhythms and leads with dizzying virtuosity. Like any self-respecting rhythm section, Charlie Watts (drums) and Bill Wyman (bass) were completely brilliant despite a virtual lack of recognition. They lent a certain primal umph(!) to the proceedings, giving these songs a salivating swing that shimmed its way from one end of the record to the  other without ever letting up. And then there was that Mick fellow...    Anyway, the songs. The ones I haven't already mentioned, anyway: The opener is a cover of Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away,\\" and it's incredible; it drips with animal fury and gutter sexuality, and it's also hypnotic and ferocious and a little bit scary. It's the kind of thing I wouldn't want my girlfriend to hear, because she'd realize that compared to the people in the song, I'm not a real man. There's also a wild, wild cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Carol,\\" and an unbelievably cool version of \\"Route 66.\\" Lots of cool blues tunes, too- Jimmy Reed's \\"Honest I Do\\" is pure caveman seduction, and \\"I'm A King Bee\\" has some stinging leads (I didn't want to make that joke, but I really couldn't think of another way to describe the guitars on it). There's also a totally outta-hand rip through \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You.\\"     The album ain't perfect- the aforementioned \\"Now I've Got A Witness\\" is one strike against it, and the uninspiring \\"You Can Make It If You Try\\" is another. \\"Walking The Dog\\" is sleazy and fun, but so is the rest of the album, so this one doesn't really stand out as such. Plus, those whooping, whistling noises in the chorus are really annoying. The rendition of \\"Can I Get A Witness,\\" while not as bad as some people say, isn't terribly exciting either.     But it's great, for the most part. It's fun, it's raw, and it rocks really hard. Plus, the cover art is really cool.The 'Stones were really good at sneering.

B0010YPTGU|5.0|This is a DVD of the July 2007 PBS concert done in his hometown.  Bocelli continues to be unconventional and, well, just be Andrea.    This concert features frequent co-performer Heather Headley and even more frequent co-performer Sarah Brightman, singing Canto Della Terra for the first time together, which is a true highlight.  Also, Andrea gets into a breath capacity contest with trumpeter Chris Botti at the end of \\"Italia\\".  Super-legendary producer (and pal) David Foster dutifully tries to communicate in Italian-being successful enough at it to please the audience.    Songs on the enclosed CD are great, too.  It has, not only select moments from this concert, but newer songs in studio, like \\"Domani\\"-which has become one of my favorite songs.    You had to love \\"Dare to Live\\", being performed with singer Laura Pausini.  When his verse comes up, he swings around and gets on one  knee.  Something going on with those two...?  Wonderful, nevertheless!    Yes, Virginia.  Bocellimania continues!  You have to wonder what other frontier he will conquer.  I would, personally, love to hear him perform one of Kiss' songs-specifically \\"Shandi\\".  He could do that.  And people would love him more (tend to blue sky a lot.  Sorry)    Get it! Live it! Love it!.    Review by Gary Daniel Bryant
B0002S947K|5.0|While this CD is not a new release, it is a definite must have for any collection. I feel certain it is Ray's finest, but it also happens to be one of my all-time favorite CD's! Every time I have this playing, someone asks who the artist is...what the song is...if it's a new CD... His throaty/husky voice stands in contrast to the gentle, flowing melodies, and the tracks all have the feel of a personal and private living room performance. The most wonderful part of it is that EVERY TRACK IS GREAT.

Just when it seemed that everything that could be written about the subject had been, Logan et al, have come along with a new concept so powerful and so obvious that I wonder how we could have missed it before.

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|*Mild Spoilers*  In this gorgeously made film, we take a deep look into the Boleyn intrigue through the eyes of a young woman often overlooked in the tangle: Mary, Anne Boleyn's sister. A shadowed fact in history is that Henry XVIII made love to and fathered two children with Mary Boleyn before he moved on to Anne. This brilliantly woven tale, first an intricate novel by Philippa Gregory, reveals not only Mary's traumatic tale, but some of the deepest folds of the Boleyn family's saga.  It's well known that Mary and Anne's parents were ambitious to a fault and offered their children up for royal barter whenever King Henry smiled upon them. Mary, newly wedded, was offered before Anne and remained a pawn and an assistant to her family's schemes long after Anne and Henry married. What this amazing movie and its parent novel focus on is the Boleyn scandal, the decay of Henry's two first marriages, the deadly consequences of reckless ambition, and Mary's own desperate loyalties and love for her family: all caught and tangled in the threads of Henry's swaying favor.  The only reason I docked one star is the omission and alteration of certain important historical facts. For one thing, Mary had two children, a daughter first and a son second, with Henry. In this movie (not the book), Mary's daughter is completely omitted and her son is scarcely mentioned. Movie editing aside, the existence of Mary's children was an important fact in history and not one to be overlooked. Secondly, the movie added a ridiculous scene in which Henry promised Anne that he would never sleep with his wife or speak to her sister again if she only promised to consider accepting him (right in the middle of Mary's child labor!) This is flat-out ridiculous: no king with an ounce of pride would make such a promise, much less Henry XVIII! The result of his words was equally ridiculous: Anne accepted his promise, and when the midwife called to him that he had a son, he simply looked over at Mary and walked away without a second glance! Please; the one thing that Henry never did was turn his back on a son and his desire for one proved, over and over, to trump his lust for a woman.  Lastly, and most offensively, there was a disgusting scene in which Henry raped Anne from behind in a rage, before they were even married. This is flat-out preposterous Hollywood soap opera: from all historical accounts, Henry was nothing but desperate for Anne before their marriage and it was not until after Elizabeth's birth that he began to lose patience and show anger towards her. The idea that he would rape her, especially before their marriage, is nonsensical in every extreme.  Luckily, the second half of the film made up for any earlier faults. The two main actresses, Johansen and Portman, were simply phenomenal: Johansen perfectly captures Mary's gentler but strong spirit, while Portman really came into her own showing Anne's increasing despair and desperation for her life. The scenes with Mary's quiet fire and Anne's pacing around the room, black hair swinging like a silk cape in her frantic energy, are unforgettable and trademarks of amazing acting. What truly won the movie in my eyes was the heartbreaking and eye-opening truth that the film and the book both revealed: the ultimate and utter tragedy of placing ambition before love, greed before caution, and reward before family. I couldn't be happier that I watched this stunningly beautiful film and, inspite of certain omissions, I think it deserves a place of honor right up there with the book. I recommend this film to everyone; you'll never forget the tragedy of the Boleyn family and what they reveal of humankind.
006135323X|4.0|This book starts strong but weakens on substance.  As the book moves past the half-way point it has little to offer that is not already very common knowledge.  Writing for the masses should not result in less substance simply to produce acceptable length.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I was fortunate in that I brought no expectations to this film.  I didn't know it was from the \\"Matrix\\" crowd, a film I very much enjoyed.  If anything I thought it was one of those dumb Batman, Spiderman super-hero movies that offer light entertainment - the artistic equivalent of cotton candy.  What I found instead was that rarest of all creatures, a blockbuster film with wonderful production values that entertains and actually engages the mind by posing interesting and difficult questions.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving does more with his voice and movements than most actors do with their entire toolkit; he was perfectly cast as the man behind the mask.  Natalie Portman is excellent as the reluctant co-conspirator, drawn into V's world.  Stephen Rea is downright great as Chief Inspector Finch, our \\"everyman\\" figure who must sort through the rubble to dislodge truth.  John Hurt seems to be channeling William Smith from 1984, with a soupcon of Hitler, his frenzy and fury are thoroughly convincing.<br /><br />What makes the film so brave and unusual is that, in our nervous age, it actually casts a terrorist as hero.  This is heady stuff and reminds us that, \\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.\\"  V presents an interesting blend of instant karma, righteous vengeance, and social idealism.  Though his motives are personal, he does understand them in a larger context.  His handoff to Portman at the finish recalls the desire of Generals to create a world where their children can study philosophy.<br /><br />V is unlike many movies in that it has a superb 2nd act.  Portman's time in the faux prison, and the powerful epistolary relationship with the unseen individual one cell over, provide this film with a compelling underlying humanity.  Political references abound in V, as do film references, and they all serve to reinforce the core idea that governments really are created to serve people, not vice versa, and when that ceases to be the case, something must be done.  Perhaps the discomfort surrounding this film would be diminished if we all recalled that's precisely what our beloved founding fathers did.fort surrounding this film would be diminished if we all recalled that's precisely what our beloved founding fathers did.

B000IKHNT8|3.0|I had a chance to watch the Star Wars disc from this supposedly unaltered set and was bummed out that even these are not the version that were in theaters back when I saw them.  I know this because when I was 8 I got to watch a bootleg Beta Max version of the first film nearly 50 times at a friends house.  I had also seen it the year before in theaters in 1977.    This disc is missing 3 items that were in the original theatrical release.  I will list all three.    1.  When they are all in the control center(in the death star), C3P0 points and tells Kenobi where to release the tractor beam in 3 different points at the same location.  (This was not on the DVD)    2.  This one is the most obviuos ommission.  When Luke and Leia are at the Chasm before Luke throws the grappling Hook to swing across.  In the theater version , he puts the grappling hook in his gun and fires it at the ceiling so it will hook on.  Unfortunately it misses for them and it falls down.  Luke then needs to coil the whole cord up again with the hook and this time he tosses it and it catches.  If you watch any version of the film you will see a really poor edit of Luke pulling up the cord from his belt multiple times as if it had fallen once.  But Lucas couldn't just shorten the scene because it would have thrown off the music so he copied and pasted Luke pulling up the cord 2 times.  For what ever reason, he felt the first time using a gun was not needed to be left in.      3.  This one is minor but when they get through the blast door in the death star to avoid Vader, you can hear the Storm troopers tell the door operator (somewhere) to \\"Close the blast Doors\\" and then after it closes, you hear someone say \\"open the blast doors\\".  In all the versions since the movie came out in theaters the \\"Close the blast Doors\\" line has been edited out.  It is possible it is still on the non THX version of the Laser Disc.    There is also a shortened scene in the Return of the Jedi but that is for another day.George shortened that as well.    George if you are reading this (And I know you are not) Why don't you actually put the \\"REAL\\" theatrical version on DVD and not this Psuedo version of Theatrical.  All these DVDS are is of a transfer from the THX Laser Disc Version.  I think the original Laser Disc version might have a little more in them, but I am not sure.    BTW, George even did this with Episode III as well.  He took out a 15 second scene of General Grevious climbing out side of the crashing ship as it was going down at the beginning of the film. he deleted it because he later realized that General Grevious could not breath outside in space.  We know he breathes because of his coughing all through out the film.   Those 15 seconds never made it to the DVD or the deleted scene section.  Woops ;o)    I don't knwo why he does this to all of his films.    I wish my friend still has his Beta Max copy but it has been long gone for 20 years.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|As a long time Metheny fan, I recommend \\"Stil Life\\" as his best work to date. He excels in both virtuosity and composing abilities in this album. \\"Minuano\\", \\"Last Train Home\\" and \\"Third Wind\\" are real masterpieces.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This video does more than deliver the expected \\"nature shots\\".  Every moment is packed with facts illustrated in such a manner as to first activate and then feed the imagery planes of your mind.  I found myself in the water, climbing the great Red Woods, scaling mountains and diving caves.  This video stays with you long after the player is turned off.  This production allows you to live supernaturally in places you will never go in the natural.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|I have been a fan of this duo from the beginning. I fell immediately in love with the mellow, ethereal, alpine sounds of their debut, Felt Mountain, but happily went along with the change toward a more electro-glammy sound on Black Cherry. Then, when Supernature was released, I felt they had reached their fullest potential and created an absolutely perfect dance-pop masterpiece. That said, I knew they would never follow up Supernature with another Supernature. But I was nonetheless disappointed when I read we were in for a supposed folk-inspired album featuring acoustic guitars. And then when I finally heard the new album for the first time, my fears were confirmed. This was not the Goldfrapp I wanted. I wanted another Supernature, dammit!    Man, I was an idiot. There was something about this album that was slowly, subtly drawing me in. Something made me want to listen more. And more. Before long I was completely addicted. This album is freakin' awesome. Like a drug you don't want to like, but can't help but adore. Screw the ultra-catchy beats, electro stabs, and lusty lyrics of Supernature. This stuff is so pure and beautiful and touching. If Supernature was a big joyous sexual romp, Seventh Tree is that amazing peaceful feeling that floods your body post-orgasm. It's somewhat reminiscent of Felt Mountain (mostly in atmosphere), but is more folk and less lounge. \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" could easily have been yanked from their debut, while \\"Little Bird\\" and \\"Happiness\\" sound surprisingly like the Beatles, \\"Monster Love\\" like AIR, and first single \\"A&E\\" like early Sarah McLachlan. So there's some variety here, but it's also very cohesive. The album is sheer beauty from beginning to end, but my favorites are probably \\"Clowns,\\" \\"Happiness,\\" \\"Road to Somewhere,\\" and especially \\"Eat Yourself\\" and \\"A&E,\\" which I admittedly didn't like at first (maybe because it was just so different), but has since become one of my favorite Goldfrapp songs ever, if not my favorite. I don't know if I can say much more to express my love for Seventh Tree. Just trust me... It's addictively beautiful.    If you're a big fan and/or a collector, the special edition is definitely worth the small extra cost. The textured box is really nice, and the hand-written lyrics booklet is interesting (I wouldn't have guessed \\"Clowns\\" was about fake breasts - \\"Only clowns would play with those balloons/what do ya wanna look like Barbie for?\\"). The dvd doesn't have a ton of content, but it's kinda cool. I love the \\"A&E\\" video, so it's nice to have. The ten-minute short film contains Alison and Will talking vaguely about the album over some nice-looking grainy imagery of woodland and countryside interspersed with Alison in various costumes. I really, really like the visual identity they went with for this album - pastoral meets pagan in a world both beautiful and eerie. Very reminiscent of, say, the original \\"Wicker Man.\\" They really know how to create a wonderful brand identity.
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|This movie is for me, to be rated in lots of ways.  It's an action film, a suspense film, a Thriller film, an adventure film all rolled into one film.  This movie was way better than the first movie.  It's a very intelligent kind of movie.  The main character, Bourne, is very intelligent himself also.  This movie moves at a good pace and holds your interest intently.  I almost liked it better than a James Bond Movie.  I am very glad I added this movie to my collection of movies.  You've got to buy this one.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|This is a film soundtrack! Taken out of the context of the film it is okay but not brilliant.  The performances are all by the actual actors in the movie which may help explain why these reviewers who haven't seen the film are completely clueless as to the context to view this recording.  As the Beatles well knew (although some of their fans don't seem to get) a song is not just about the singer - there's also this little thing called music.  The arrangements of several of the songs here are fantastic.  If you don't listen to music on the level in which you notice the interplay of the instruments and appreciate the use of space then your really don't understand the Beatles to begin with.  The idea behind this movie was brilliant, Paul and Ringo have both given it high praise and there is little doubt that George and John would have loved it.  You only grow old in life when you take the art of your youth and put it on a pedestal.  These bad reviewers are the very same type of people who would have complained about the Beatles 40 years ago, stating that their music is some pop-drenched white boy bastardization of American blues.  We haven't really advanced much as a culture - the ignorant people just cling to different ideas and waste away the now by reexamining the fragments from the best years of their life!
B000062XGG|5.0|Independence Day is by far the best Sci-fi movie that they have come out with in a long time.  I can watch it repeatedly without getting board.  The director did an excellent job of keeping your interest and moving the movie along at a good pace.  The movie just flys by for me.  It's also not a highly gross or graphically intense movie.  It's not a scary movie at all.  I would recommend this movie to all fans of movies in general, not just the sci fi crowd.  This is a must see.
B000001ZSF|4.0|Similar to \\"Oxygene\\" in a good way, this album is a bit more polished; definitely ground breaking stuff in its time, it is still relevant in both composition and execution. The music retains the musician's touch rather than the stuccato of generic sampled techno grooves, which makes it more ergonomic and more expressive too. Its pretty \\"spacey\\" stuff but seems to appeal over a wide range of listeners, from my experience, you will find you like it because it is done so well, and because it is very original.
B000UX6THK|4.0|I would give it 5 stars, as that's what the show deserves, but this set loses points as it doesn't quite match up to the fantastic seasion 1 special edition that was released in the UK.    I'm a little disappointed with the picture quality.  It's slightly grainy and not crystal clear like the season 1 dvd.  It's not in widescreen which is really essential these days to look good on our huge widescreen TV sets.  It probably wasn't filmed in widescreen so I'll let that one go.    The audio seems a little quiet.  I have to turn the volume right up but the sound quality is fine and I can hear the dialogue perfectly as long as the volume is up.    The packaging isn't great.  It looks cheap and there's no booklet included plus my set didn't contain the postcards.  However, attention to detail has gone into the menus and they're almost as good as the season 1 set.    I haven't watched the extras yet, but from what I've read I'm sure they'll be great and it's nice to finally get some decent extras with a Twin Peaks release.    I'm in the UK and have had to order this from the US as there has been no official release of season 2 or this box set over here, which is a real shame.  If any other UK fans are planning on ordering this from the US then please be aware of the £15 customs charge you will have to pay when it arrives.  Region 2 sets are available from other European countries.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|This blu ray concert recording has an excellect video quality.  The picture quality is much cleaner, clearer and more colorful than the DVD counterpart.  The sound recording is super with the Dolby Digital 5.1.  The dics only has a PCM bitstream 2.0 and that is the only draw back.  If you are a Celine Dion fan, this is the disc that you would want for your collection.  The behind the scene disc is also amazing.  You have to watch this disc to fully appreciate the work that was put in to get the concert to this level.  Overall, this is an excellent all around collection.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|Without question, Tift Merritt is one of the finer female artists to have come down the pike in the last ten years.  She made an Americana splash with her 2002 debut album BRAMBLE ROSE, then injected Southern soul into her 2004 album TAMBOURINE.  And now comes ANOTHER COUNTRY, and another great album, making it three fine albums in a row for this North Carolina-based lady.    Getting great assistance from her former Carbines drummer Zeke Hutchins, Americana musician great Charlie Sexton, and her TAMBOURINE producer George Drakoulias, who also mans the controls here as well, Tift once again shows a great songwriting intelligence and spunk that makes her out as a truly authentic talent.  There is the use of R&B-style horn sections on \\"Tell Me Something True\\"; and songs such as \\"Something To Me\\", \\"Tender Branch\\", and \\"Broken\\", like much of her debut album, see her meld the influences of legendary country-rock icons Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris into her own brew.  She even indulges in a little French on \\"Mille Tendresses\\", inspired by her experiences in Paris.    Thus far, Tift has been largely a critics' and fans' favorite, though she did get a Grammy nod for TAMBOURINE.  But with her songwriting gift and her talent so on display here, there is reason to believe that true stardom is within her reach now.  There is also reason to believe that should that stardom come, Tift won't let it go to her head.  She clearly loves what she does, and that kind of enthusiasm is very much in evidence on ANOTHER COUNTRY, definitely a winner.

A good collection for concert collectors.

B000WAEJZ0|5.0|There is no doubt that she is the best.  However, I find it very difficult to listen to her songs because I reminisce on who she used to be, and what her voice was once capable of doing, and then I have to come to terms with what life with Bobby Brown and drugs have done to her and her voice.  She can no longer reach the high notes that she used to.  She is physically no longer who she used to be, and by this I am not referring in any way to her age.  And sadly this influences the way I view her music.  She has completely ruined the image of the black woman and she has disrespected herself and the rest of us.  Her last album MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE, in my opinion, marked the beginning of the end in my eyes.  Although I have the album, and listen to it, it still brings to my mind the tragedy that Whitney Houston is.  I don't know if the rest of you will agree with me on the view of her music, but I will say... She is and always will be there greatest vocalist of all times, but the worst example for black women and every other woman on the face of the planet.

B000T97SXY|5.0|In a year that produced a few disappointing metal releases, Primal Fear did not let the fans down and delivered an album that not only lived up to expectations but (in my opinion) was the best metal album of 2007.  Primal Fear have always been subject to comparisons with metal Gods Judas Priest due to the style of power metal they play and vocalist Ralf Scheepers' voice sounding much like Rob Halford.  This has turned some people away from their music, but Primal Fear are not a Judas Priest clone.  Yes, there are similarities but Primal Fear has developed a sound all their own, and have continued to outdo each album they have released.  Not many bands have been able to do this.  \\"Nuclear Fire\\" was good, \\"Devils Ground\\" was better, and then \\"Seven Seals\\" was better again.  In fact I didn't think they would be able to trump \\"Seven Seals\\" but they have done it with \\"New Religion\\".<br />The album opens with a full blasting metal assault in the track \\"Sign Of Fear\\".  High pitched vocals, pounding drums, and that dual guitar onslaught; it's a great opening track.<br />Track 2 \\"Face The Emptiness\\" has a subtle orchestral backing, more melodic sound and great chorus.  I think it is definitely one of the best tracks on the album.<br />\\"Every Time It Rains\\" follows, and opens with Epica's female vocalist Simone Simons and an orchestral arrangement reminiscent of the title track to their previous album.  Scheepers and Simons trade verses and combine during the choruses, and their vocals complement each other perfectly.  This is the most commercial sounding song on the album, a great song and the obvious choice for a single.  It is followed by a typical Primal Fear power rocker in the title track \\"New Religion\\".  Nothing special about this one, but a good song none the less.<br />Next comes the highlight of the album, and possibly the best song of the year in \\"Fighting The Darkness\\".  The song is broken into three parts recorded onto the album as three individual tracks: \\"Fighting The Darkness\\", \\"The Darkness\\" and \\"Reprise\\".  I can only guess that it was done this way so that the first part could be released as a single on its own, as the three parts together make this song almost nine minutes long in total.  However, the three tracks musically follow on from each other perfectly so the listener is unaffected by the breaks.  \\"The Darkness\\" is a great instrumental piece, before the chorus returns again in \\"Reprise\\".  This song has a fabulous chorus and I think it is worth buying the album for this song alone.<br />As for the rest of the album, \\"Blood On Your Hands\\" is another typical Primal Fear power rocker like \\"New Religion\\", nothing special but still a good song.<br />To be critical, it is the next two tracks \\"The Curse Of Sharon\\" and \\"Too Much Time\\" which are the least likeable tracks in my opinion.  The former is ok, but just average really, and the latter is a song about someone playing violent computer games so much they become immune to seeing the violence and look to go to the next level - reality.  This song just does nothing for me at all, but it is followed by \\"Psycho\\" which has a great head banging riff and beat, plus another great chorus which ends with Scheepers screaming the title.  This is another of my favourite songs from the album.<br />\\"World On Fire\\" is another pretty good track, faster paced yet melodic, with a slow break in the middle which then builds up before the guitar solo kicks in and the pace picks up again.  \\"The Man (That I Don't Know)\\" is another of the albums best songs.  It is a slow song, but no mushy lyrics and it is too powerful to be called a ballad.  It has acoustic guitars, a great chorus, and builds in intensity.  Scheepers sounds terrific on this one, and it is the perfect song to close an album with.<br />Overall, \\"New Religion\\" is a very consistent album of quality power metal with some moments of brilliance.  The production is first class (as you would expect after their previous albums) butfor me the two things which make this album better than their previous albums and the best album of 2007 are the quality of the song writing and Scheepers' vocal performance.  I thoroughly recommend this album.<br />I got the digi-pack version with the two bonus film clips \\"Fighting The Darkness\\" and \\"Sign Of Fear\\".  I always try to get a digi-pack version, and the film clips aren't bad either.h make this album better than their previous albums and the best album of 2007 are the quality of the song writing and Scheepers' vocal performance.

It is a play by Aaron Leichter and David Fishelson based on a dramatization of the novel by Max Brod.  If you think you are buying the book by Kafka, you will find you are mistaken.  I am not commenting on the play itself; I'm just letting you know that this is NOT the novel. It is misrepresented.  Its actual title is \\"Franz Kafka's The Castle,\\" which was obviously not written by Franz Kafka in this form.

0452289963|5.0|I highly recommend reading this one.  It is by far the most useful book I have ever read.  So simple, so powerful and a fun read.  He's nailed it!
0452289963|5.0|Excellent material.   Makes you think about what is truly important.  Interesting material to help change the way we think and see ourselves.
0452289963|5.0|A NEW EARTH by Tolle is LIFE changing, life enhancing and created an awakening in me that I will forever be thankful for!  I would love to see this book put on the manditory reading list for all young adults in the school system! What a great start that would be for our youngsters!  For me at 53 years old, I now feel half my age and so excited to start living my Life's purpose, NOW!after reading this fantastic book! Eckhart's writing style and content makes for an excellent read!  I've just started reading it for the second time and again picking up such great insights! Thanks Eckhart! With great appreciation, Tina
0307237702|5.0|I havent read this book but I have listened to the audiobook which to me is much better because Barack is the one narrating his own book with his voice.  Alot of valid points stated and well vell open minded person.  I wont get into a whole detail since alot people placed their own positive opinions, but you dont really need to read theirs if you already like the candidate.  Barack is my hero!
B00006ZXSK|3.0|Yet again another Cinderella story, but  has some zest to it because it was a little  different. A tomboy Cinderella who is not  afraid to speak her mind-even to a prince.  Anjelica Huston keeps the beat moving as the  annoying and sly step-mother. I enjoyed it.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is about Clark Kent, who is destined to become Superman, in his high school days.  One thing that this series does really well is that it gives Clark a sense of vulnerability which he doesn't really have as an adult.  This vulnerability is not only physical, as Clark discovers the powers he has, but also psychological.  To add to the psychological dimension of this series, Lex Luthor turns out to be Clark's best friend in Smallville.  Each episode will leave you looking for any clues of Lex and Clark's future relationship.  How long can the friendship last?  In addition to problems of friendship, Clark must also deal with two different love triangles in this first season.    DC characters are know for being iconic, almost godlike figures.  This series introduces some of the Marvel type of human drama into the life of a young Superman.  While Clark's problems don't really seem as serious as a young Peter Parker, it's nice to see that Superman actually has a human side as well.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|This is mostly a history of science and technology with a little math history and anthropology thrown in.  The main information is in the audio with the video being illustrations.  It is at the high school level.  When it deals with things 5000 or more years ago it is less accurate.  Partly because that period is mostly conjecture and also because of more modern discoveries.  One example is that DNA measurements of Neandertal \\"man\\" shows it is not related to modern people.    This program is the inverse of Civilization by Clark which is really an art appreciation course (in spite of its broader title) where the main information is in the video of famous works of art and the audio is a nontechnical description at the middle school level.
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|I saw this movie on a reccomendation from a friend.  It was boring, predictable, and the jokes were just trite.  Slapstick comedy in the worst way, and there was not an ounce of wit to the script whatsoever.  It presented filler situations such as a drug trip, some crass old man in a wheelchair, etc...and tried to pass it off as humor.      I expected a witty British comedy, but what you have is a poorly done American comedy disguised as a British comedy.  Do not waste your time.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Okay to continue where I left off.   The first episode Broken Bow  Is very important it shows the Vulcans and Human relation after the movie first contact. And humanity first start exploring deeper parts of space.     If you want know what each episode contains read (Ted Merriman review) I'll write down the more important ones and where they tie into the later series; Original, TNG, DS9 and so on.    Strange New World   Some of the crew land on an uninhabited planet. When they start to feeling strange and that they are being watched. This planet is also meantioned by Commander Ryker on the TNG episode Yesterday's Enterprise.    All the other episodes in this season do tie into each other as you will hear the crew talk about what happened to them in the past in season 2 through 4.     I really enjoy watching the first season. Like I meantioned earlier it's a huge story and it's all linked together. Well on to season two:)
0321544080|3.0|I read this book and found it interesting, although somewhat limiting in its practical application for mere enthusiasts. This is a great photographer no doubt, but I found that the book is 80% about lighting for magazine shoots (think expensive). And unless you're a professional photographer with a large budget, you will never own the lighting gear he uses for those shoots. Since my focus is mainly on nature photography, I found only sporadic tidits of useful advice here. The rest is intriguing in its own right (hey, it was cool to learn how he rented and lit a circus elephant for a studio shoot), but it's not something I can use. I like my books to be more pragmatic. This one is for highly paid pros.
B00078XGRO|5.0|I watched the original episodes and watched most of TNG and when they ended. I felt DS9, Voyager and Enterprise were nothing but a bunch of spin off meaning the title (star trek being used in each of them). I didn't understand DS9 and Voyager at the time and didn't follow Enterprise.     It wasn't until later when I've collected them all! Every single star trek episode and movie to date that I realized it's telling one big story.           Which bring me to this movie. I now consider this film being the first episode in the story I mean. I'm sure a lot of you have seen it already if you haven't you won't understand the series Enterprise. I HOPE THIS GRABS YOUR GUYS ATTENTION!! I'll continue with my review on Enterprise season one
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the best album you will ever own.  It is pure genius.  The arrangement of the music, the lyrics, the timing, just everything will blow your mind.  Don't listen to the bad reviews, those people must have an awful taste in music.
B00006LETU|5.0|If you have not heard this record in DVD-Audio, go out right now and by a DVD-Audio player, buy this recording in the DVD-Audio format, and listen to the best surround-sound music mix ever done. When released on CD, \\"The Nightfly\\" became one of the most respected recordings ever done, period. In DVD-Audio, it is the Holy Grail. Great songs, great arrangements. great playing, great recording. In a world full of mediocrity, it's good to have Donald Fagen and \\"The Nightfly\\" in DVD-Audio to restore your faith in humankind.
B000Y8GFY8|2.0|Let me say straight out that I love Goldfrapp and Alison's voice and her creativity. She's unique and an extremely talented composer and performer. I've got all her albums and her DVD and I enjoy them a great deal. I guess I am a fan.<br /><br />However! I have had this new album for about four weeks now and I am perplexed and a little worried by it. It is a beautiful album - the first track, \\"Clowns\\", is a lovely song and there are a number of other very enchanting songs. Well, they sound enchanting and they have nice tunes. If anyone else had recorded this album, I would have been very pleasantly surprised. It does rather have the \\"Summery\\" feel of a 1960s French film soundtrack. There are acoustic guitars, strings and piano featured. Not much obvious electronica and none of the colourful \\"squelchy\\" synthesizer lines we have come to know and love on virtually all of Ms Goldfrapp's other albums. \\"Seventh Tree\\" is a beautiful album and it is very atmospheric, and quite tuneful and poignant in many places ...... but....<br /><br />I listened to Charlotte Gainsbourg's \\"5:55\\" album straight after \\"Seventh Tree\\" one afternoon and I was a little alarmed at their similarity. I was even more alarmed by the fact that although I am very much aware of the fact that Alison Goldfrapp is a better singer than Ms Gainsbourg, \\"5:55\\" is apparently a better album and I am pretty confident that I will return to it more often that I return to \\"Seventh Tree\\" in future. This disappoints me because I am vastly more of a fan of Goldfrapp than I am of Charlotte Gainsbourg.<br /><br />Okay, I will listen to \\"Seventh Tree\\" for another few weeks and if I change my mind, I will change this review.<br /><br />A very unhappy two and half stars for me.
B000VR824S|5.0|this is a wonderful, rare glimpse at the undisputed living master of the electric blues with his friends and fellow musicians. watch clapton's face as some of the young phenoms (like derrick trucks) play. the air of self-confidence born of years of playing is unmistakeable. he has no need to one-up them, and gives them plenty of space on his stage. how often can you see this kind of assemblage on stage, all playing in one day? this is a gem. sure, some slow spots and faults, but i defy anybody to come up with a better compilation of modern blues musicians. and the sound quality is terrific. if you have a good sound system with your t.v., turn it up and enjoy. it doesn't get any better than this.
B000EGCITQ|5.0|I was rocked by this P!nk album!!  This is her best work so far!!    Her soulful voice and lyrics capture me every time I listen to the CD.  The album has great love songs along with rockin' dance tunes.  It is great for people of all ages.  I'm Not Dead has been my favorite album for almost a year now, and I still listen daily!!  What a great buy!
B000Y7U98W|5.0|THE MOVIE: Although I am not the biggest science fiction fan, Sunshine looked intriguing to me.  I decided to rent the film from Netflix (my first Blu-ray rental) and I was blown away.  Apart from the visuals, this is a smart, intense, and intellectually stimulating film.  Directed by the brilliant Danny Boyle (28 Days Later), the film explores the plight of eight astronauts determined to reignite the dying sun in order to preserve life on Earth.  Complications arise and tensions surmount.  There is some brilliant writing, acting, and directing here.  I particularly enjoyed the balance the film makes between action and moral dilemma.  5/5    THE DISC: This is a stunning Blu-ray disc.  The visuals are absolutely amazing.  Each shot is so clear and clean.  After watching this film I turned on regular television and could not believe how awful the channels looked compared to this movie!  This is definitely a great purchase to show off your HDTV.
B00008MJ8H|5.0|This music is wonderful and reaching into your soul.  I highly recommend this cd.  If you haven't seen the movie, you should.  DeNiro is awesome.
B000UR9T7I|3.0|THE MOVIE: Spider-Man 3 suffers from too many stray plot lines, too many villains, too many tears, and too much cockiness.  While I appreciated the screenwriters' attempt to continue the well-drawn character development that the Spider-Man 2 initiated, this film fails to maintain an intriguing plot while the lead characters go through some troublesome times.  One of the big mistakes of this film was having three, well technically four, villains battling Spider-Man (none of which get the screen time he deserves).  There are some fantastic action sequences but they cannot make up for an overall disappointing story.  The Movie: 3/5    THE DISC: This is a stunning Blu-ray disc.  The visuals and sound are top-notch.  There are many action sequences that are breath-taking, for instance, the crane scene where Spider-Man rescues Gwen, the opening battle between Harry and Spider-Man, and the final battle with the Sandman.  Top-notch transfer.  No complaints on the look sound of the disc.    Overall, if you enjoyed the first Spider-Man films, you will probably like this movie, but be disappointed.  However, if you are aiming to show off your new HDTV, Spider-Man 3 would be a great purchase to help you do so.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|The album is great but when I purchased it, I was told that this disc had 8 bonus tracks which it didn't. Then when I went to check the item page, it had been changed between when I bought it and when I received it.
B000UBMZ4S|3.0|Amazon did a great job of shipping this item on time.  It arrived quickly!! However, after reading all of the movie's reviews, I was a little dissapointed.  Not as thrilling as I had hoped.
B00005JPXY|4.0|A farewell party in New York is interrupted by distant explosions, heralding the arrival of a giant monster of unknown origin that devastates the city while shaking off carnivorous parasites.  After receiving a terrified cell phone call from an injured friend, four of the partygoers move deeper into the city on a rescue mission.  They capture the whole thing on video.    I had a great time at this movie.  Some detractors have knocked it for having pretensions of artiness, but I had just the opposite impression.  This is a stripped down, no-frills monster movie.  I appreciated the device of seeing the action from the perspective of the man in the street.  We don't know where the monster came from, and we don't care.  I was also undisturbed by the shakiness of the camera; in fact, I hardly even noticed it.  Unsteady camerawork makes sense in this \\"found footage\\" sub-genre, adding a sheen of realism to a fantastic situation.  I agree that there were a number of times when any normal person would have set the camera down or abandoned it entirely, but the rewards of the film made it worthwhile for me to suspend my disbelief in this regard.
006054094X|5.0|This meticulously researched book opens up a whole new chapter on the great voyages of discovery and how history needs to be rewritten. The great European voyages by Columbus, Drake, Cook, etc were really follow up voyages to those previously undertaken by the Chinese. In these days of climate change hysteria it is also interesting to read that the Chinese junks sailed completely around Greenland and then travelled home across the top of Russia - something that still can't be done today.
B000PKG6TE|2.0|Queens of the Stone Age - Era Vulgaris (release date: June 12, 2007)<br /><br />straight to the point ---><br /><br />This album is, unfortunately, pretty monotonous, not very melodic and it doesn't rock nearly as much as this band is capable of. It's not horrible, but it really doesn't do anything for me. And \\"Make It Witchu\\" sounds like a failed attempt at a pop single and sticks out from the rest of the album like a sore thumb. I've heard some great rock from this band, but I don't think I'll ever bother putting on ERA VULGARIS again.<br /><br />UPDATE (12-13-13): well, I did put it on again and you know what? Yes, it may sound like monotonous, bone-headed stoner rock, but there's something about the repetition that gets my head nodding...What I'm really into now is their latest - ...LIKE CLOCKWORK which is light years better than ERA VULGARIS....but I think I might find myself turning ERA VULGARIS on again in the future....
B00005JPTK|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater last year, and didn't know what to expect. I hadn't read the book (at the time) and didn't know what the movie was about. After seeing the trailer, I thought that it was something like Jumanji with all the animals running amok.             I admit that the CGI in I Am Legend is amazing. However, the \\"zombie\\" appears somewhat cartoonish, like a tall Gollum but wearing modern clothing. The enviroment looks great with all the overgrown plants and semi-demolished buildings. The bombing of the Brooklyn Bridge was sweet, also.             Now the story. It was okay, nothing like the book at all.     (Spoiler). Basically Neville walks around the city for a three years with his dog, \\"Sam\\" and basically hunts zombies with his assault rifle. His dog got bitten, got infected, he killed it, he got mad the zombies, started mowing them down with his car, topples over, than gets saved by a woman. The woman lives with him in the house, it gets raided by zombies, Neville found the cure at that exact moment, and blows himself up.(End of spoiler)             Pretty much, the story adds more beef to itself by adding irrelevant scenes. For example, the shrek scene took about 5 minutes. Neville wandering around at the video store talking to mannequiens, him playing golf, and chasing deer around. The story ended with a bad ending, finding the cure at the very last minute and blowing himself up and the zombies to let the girl get away. In short, the story was considerably weak.             Here are the things that make no sense.  1. Neville is immune to the disease but doesn't do anything about it.  2. The girl dresses up and is pretty hot but this is a time of crisis.  3. No corpses on the street?  4. Nevile fond the cure at the last minute.  5. It's New York, there are other ways to leave the city.  6. Unlike most epidemic movies, they simply destroythe bridge instead of nuking the place.  7. Male zombies wear shorts only but females were that andbras. Wow, zombies have dress codes?  8. Neville killed himself when he could have chucked the grenade to the zombies and then run away.                I thought Will Smith was a great actor and the dog did pretty well too. But the director probably only read the first chapter of the book. The movie ended so abruptly, you'd think the directors said \\"Okay people, that's the budget, let's go home.\\"                This movie is worth a rent but definetely not a classic.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|The White Stripes - Icky Thump (2007)<br /><br />This is their best, most creative, most off-the-hook album yet (and I hope to see more one day...)! And that's really saying something, because all their albums are really good. Ignore the haters, they're just jealous! \\"Rag and Bone\\" alone makes the thing worth buying twice over. But every single track features stunning creativity and mind-blowing versatility. Beyond cool!
0440133688|4.0|This book will stir a variety of emotions. If you are in a health care profession then you will probably relate to it's content. I would not recommend this book to someone who has an ill love one. The reality can be kind of harsh even for those of us who are in this world of medicine daily. I have spoke with MD's who lived through this era and say that the book is a good replica of what med school was like back then. Younger docs say that is not exactly like this now but the long hours and no sleep still persist. There are still the occasional doc in the closet with the nurse having sex but health care has improve some since the 60's. Reading the book shows you how frustrating it is to give health care to some people and how sometimes it does not matter what you do you can not heal some people and on the other hand some people just won't die even if they want to. In the end I felt very sorry for most of the characters and strangely enough understood their crazy coping mechanisms.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is a great movie  Even the kids can watch this movie, without having to listen  to all the vulgar language, or watch any sex scenes.  A good family entertaining movie.
B000N6U0E2|1.0|OK I suffer from deppression.  I kept watching hoping it would get better and it only got worse.  I watch movies for entertainment not to end up at the bottom of the world.  I am so surprised there are so many good reviews.  The only time it ever got better was thirty seconds before it ended.  So if movies tend to have this result...don't watch it.  A few of my friends came to me with the same thoughts about it that i had.  So don't rent this for a pregnant woman, recently pregnant, or someone with depression.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Pandora picked it right! Now that I have DSL I can listen to Pandora internet radio at home, and my favorite \\"channel\\" is my SRV one. All Blues, all the time.  Up comes Joe Bonamassa's \\"Blues Deluxe\\" album, and I'd never heard him before.  Made me come to a complete STOP and go into a trance. This guy really has it. I wish I could go to a live concert with him and Stevie Ray Vaughn - it would be the ultimate blues show.<br />Had to come out of my trance just to do this review! SOLD!
B000WS4P1K|5.0|This is one of those albums an artist puts out and you wonder how they'll ever top it.    Not ONE bad song on this bad boy!    My favorite is \\"Gravity\\"!    peace!
B000BNGMJ4|4.0|This book was in good shape slightly worn, but no rips or writing. It came on promised date with no problems. Thank you
B0011NVC9I|3.0|While I don't consider myself to be a fan of this technology of transforming and enhancing real life into animation, I have to admit I enjoyed the '07 re-imagining of the mythic tale of `Beowulf'. What made it meaningful and ultimately worthwhile from my perspective was the fact that the filmmakers didn't settle for just another sword and sorcery action adventure, they reached for something deeper.<br /><br />That something deeper was an insightful exploration of wealth, power, lust and man's innate desire to attain some level of immortality. Adding further dimension and texture to this secondary theme was the use of mythological monsters and demons as participants and co-creators in the history of mankind on a variety of levels; as combatants, as love partners and empire builders.<br /><br />`Beowulf' is magnificent at times and somewhat plodding at others. However I think the storyline has enough subtly and intelligence to keep the majority of its audience focused until the end.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 ½ Stars-.
0802130208|1.0|I bought this thing on the recommendation of a friend (who is one no longer) to read while traveling. I never finished it because it was so bad. It reads like very, very bad Vonnegut. It is not funny in the slightest. This is another example of things that are popular for no apparent reason.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I am convinced the only reason Marillion is not the biggest band in the world is the fact that most music listeners suffer from ADD.  If you crave instant gratification and fast food for the ears, Marillion is not the band for you.    Most real music fans I know recogize their all-time favorite music, music that truly touches their soul, is music they might not have \\"gotten\\" upon their first listen.    Being a Marillion fan since their very first album, I recognized Marbles as yet another Masterpiece.  If you enjoy music that will take you places no other music can, dedicate the amount of time to \\"get\\" Marillion.    People from over 30 different countries traveled to Holland in 2007 to witness Marillion Weekend.  What other band can warrant such devotion.
0743496736|4.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult novel I've read, which I picked up because my wife is such a fan. I read the Kindle version and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't read much contemporary fiction -- usually preferring journalistic nonfiction -- but I would eagerly pick up another Picoult novel.  The plotting is dynamic and well-paced, and the characters (except for the prosecuting attorney, whose side of the story remains virtually untold) are well-developed and realistic. I was impressed by the level of research that had to go into a story like this.  And I was surprised at the skill involved in the storytelling. This is no black-and-white story, and Picoult deserves major kudos for telling a potentially prejudicial tale with balance, finesse, and even, at times, haunting beauty.  Being a 46-year-old male, I'm probably not the main target reader for this, but Picoult absolutely won me over. You owe it to yourself to pick this up.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|\\"Ratatouille\\" is a technical tour de force, as one would expect from Pixar.  On top of that, the characters are well-drawn (pun intended) and interesting, and the story is engaging - hallmarks of Disney animation.  And, of course, this is a funny movie.  This film is billed as a comedy, and it does not disappoint on that front.<br /><br />However, \\"Ratatouille\\" has pacing problems, and one villain too many.  The first segment of the movie lasts way too long for the amount of exposition it provides, and could have been left out altogether.  Indeed, it's interesting to watch the deleted scenes and see how Brad Bird initially planned to start the movie in Paris - a choice that probably would have benefitted the movie.  And with two villains, there comes a point 20+ minutes from the end when you abruptly think the movie must be over - but it just keeps coming because there's one more villain to deal with.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Ratatouille\\" will entertain both adults and children, as Disney films always do, and is at least worth a rent.
B00104QSOM|4.0|There are so many amazing things about this movie that it is hard to criticize it. Just saw it in the theater: waited long after its initial release and the unceasing promotion, at least on radio. It was one of those movies that you get sick of before you see it because of all the promotion about how great it was and how great Daniel Day-Lewis was. And, they have to be disappointed that they didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture, although Lewis deservedly won for Best Actor.    I would put Lewis' performance was in the same category as Robert DeNiro's Jake LaMotta. He gave every ounce of himself in this performance, just as DeNiro did. This is one of the greatest movie acting performances I've ever seen, but it is not surprising because you could say that about nearly everything Lewis has done, even as Cecil in A Room With a View. However, oddly, I could sort of see the argument that some have made that he's actually miscast in this role. Is Daniel Day-Lewis really ever believable as an tough, wild, entrepreneurial oilman? I guess if he was believable as a Mohegan, he can be believable here.     Though the story is effectively told, it is a backdrop to a more fascinating father-son, brother-brother, Biblical kind of storytelling. And for that, Daniel Day-Lewis is very well cast. This is what makes this movie one for the ages, perhaps living up to the hype. The movie is kind of too self-consciously channeling John Ford, John Huston, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, etc. I love those movies and so in a way it was thrilling to watch something that aspired to that kind of ageless greatness, but there's a fine line, and this movie sometimes feels a little too aware of itself and the legacy it is trying to leave.    The music score is rather good, but often it is too loud and too much of a presence. It became annoying, frankly. Perhaps that was part of the effect the movie makers were trying to achieve: trying to keep the audience at a certain level, or state of annoyance atall times. The music was extremely interesting and all, but just too much. During some scenes, you just wished it would go away.    In the end, I couldn't help but think with some deft editing and ratcheting down the music to make the movie tighter, it might've been great on the scale of these other greats. The story of oil discovery in this country has not been told well enough, despite how important and telling it is to the whole history of the U.S.A. And, blending it with the story of the preacher is also great. But was there ever really a Paul? I guess I need to read the book. In the end, is it success in others that Daniel Plainview can't stand, or is it failure and weakness? Who is the real preacher or ascetic in this story? Once the preacher admits his weakness, well....    Anyway, this movie should not be missed - there's my hype. But it is a few tweaks away from being truly great.
B000T9QF8S|1.0|In honor of the 10th anniversary of Solti's death, the company for which he recorded for decades decides to do something special for him. They re-release his Chicago Beethoven cycle from the 1970s. It is a strong, traditional cycle but not as perceptive as many were in that day, primarily the great Karajan.<br /><br />I've always liked the 9th by Solti in this cycle, obviously modeled on Furtwangler but without the spiritual rapture of that conductor. I already owned this Solti set in an earlier incarnation and now it's advertised as being remastered with newly improved sound! Yeah, great!<br /><br />So I buy it since I'm an audiophile always of search of perfection and what do I hear when I compare this \\"remastering\\" to the prior release which has been around for nearly two decades? Absolutely no difference whatsoever. Trust me on this, I have a great ear for this kind of thing. I listen on headphones in great detail. The sound is absolutely the same.<br /><br />Looking through the liner notes, there is no mention of a date for the new remastering, there is no mention of a new technological method used, like 24-bit for instance. There is nothing. It is the same release, dressed up and slapped with a cover sticker on it that says \\"newly remastered with improved sound\\". BALONEY!<br /><br />If you're never owned this cycle before and want to hear Solti in Beethoven, this boxed set is your ticket. These are good, not great performances, except for the 9th which is very, very good. The sound was always fine but I purchased this with the expectation that it would be improved because there is plenty of room for improvement. The people at Decca are liars and false advertisers. This product gets one star as a consumer warning. As for the performances, it's a three star cycle.<br /><br />P.S. An extra CD in the box has Solti in a 50 minute interview about the symphonies. It's worth listening to once, not worth the purchase price of this unremastered cycle. Go to hell, DECCA!
B000WMFZNS|5.0|The obviously digitally remastered DVD is just great. It's even better than the original...the sound and clarity are terrific. Heston is still Heston - but seeing Sophia as she was in her 20's makes the cost of the DVD seem trivial. This is a wonderful fairy tale version of the story of Spain's champion. Great entertainment!
0143038419|2.0|First off, you have to be in the right \\"mood\\" to read this book. If you're not up for reading about one neurotic woman's self-absorbed, \\"spiritual\\" journey to find her \\"self\\", then don't. Oftentimes, I feel like I'm listening to a self-pitying girlfriend talk endlessly about her life, which can get on anyone's nerves, no?    However, I can see how many people can identify with her also. At some point in everyone's life, one always seeks out the spiritual. I like that Gilbert doesn't get preachy about her quest and is quite self-deprecating. But, I do think that this book is way overrated and not suitable for everyone. If you want to live vicariously through a woman who was lucky enough to be able to spend a whole year seeking for \\"betterment\\", this is the book for you. It might also be a good vacation read.
B000063DIH|3.0|Back in 1989, Adrian Smith left the band and Janick Gers replaced, and in 1990, Maiden released the tad dissapointing but enjoyable nonetheless \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" which got a backlash from the fans.<br /><br />1992, Maiden released \\"Fear of the Dark\\". Ths is the second album minus Smith, and still got backlashed from the fans. Personally, I think No Prayer grows on you after 2 listens, this takes many.<br /><br />BE QUICK OR BE DEAD: THe fast paced opener, very awesome and borderline Speed-metal.<br />FROM HERE TO ETERNITY: Not bad, but kind of an ACDC ripoff.<br />AFRAID TO SHOOT STRANGERS: An amazing song that starts off slow then gets fast then ends slow.<br />FEAR IS THE KEY- lol wut?<br />CHILDHOOD'S END- Classic Maiden track.<br />WASTING LOVE- Pretty good by Maiden ballad standards. I never have been a fan of their ballads, but for ballads, this takes the cake. Not a fan of the \\"Chilliwack Guitar\\", though.<br />THE FUGITIVE- Meh.<br />CHAINS OF MISERY- Another one to be tossed.<br />THE APPARITION- Most Maiden fans hate this, while I think it's not bad. It's not \\"Aces High\\" or \\"Mother Russia\\", but it's good. Sounds more like Savatage (a band I REALLY hate) than Maiden though.<br />JUDAS BE MY GUIDE- Wow, return of the stinkers!!!!!!<br />WEEKEND WARRIOR- Okay, people who suck Golden Yars and Synth Maiden's pen0r, why do you hate this? It's not a typicalMaiden song, but it has meaning. I like it, and you can't take that away from me.<br />FEAR OF THE DARK- The must play at concerts. Great song, sounds amazing live though.<br /><br />This is not bad, only reccomended for die hards though. Reccomended if you're a fan, though!
B000WCBMA8|3.0|The new Hives album is quite good, but very different from their other albums. The songs are catchy, bordering on pop - Hey Little World and Try It Again are something you could dance to. Giddy Up and Puppet on a String are barely recognizable as the Hives. They tried something entirely new, and I would say they succeeded in producing a good album with some great songs. Personally, I prefer the old, garage rock Hives, but the Black and White album is definitely fun to listen to.
B00005JKJA|5.0|When I first began watching Mulholland Drive almost a 11 months ago, I had no David Lynch experience, so I really didn't know what to expect. What I got 147 minutes later was a mix of depression, confusion, amazement, fright, disturbia, trippiness, and the feeling that I had watched something I never seen before! I was a bit confused, but 3 days later, I watched it and finally got it.<br /><br />Mulholland Drive is a great movie on all levels. It's multi-facted, multi-layered, and very mind-challenging.<br /><br />So in the beginning we see a bunch of people dancing, and a shot of a pillow, we hear swing music in the dancing scene and someone heavily breathing in the pillow shot. We dissolve and come back out to a woman riding a limo. Who is she? Why is she on Mulholland Drive? We see that the two drivers are hitmen, and will kill her if she doesn't come out of the car. Then the car crashes, and this woman survives.<br /><br />So to the plot: In one world, a woman wakes up with no memory from the night before, and a woman named Betty comes to the house she wakes up in to look after it. Betty meets this woman, who calls herself Rita after a poster she sees. They try to uncover her identity.<br /><br />Now another world: Depressed Diane Selwyn is having a horrible life. Her lesbian(?) lover Camilla Rhodes is cheating on her with the director of a movie she's in, and Diane wants Camilla dead.<br /><br />MD is a very great movie, with a somwehat very deep meaning and is very frightening, hot, thrilling, and if you look into it: fun.<br /><br />Watch this movie, and have a blast!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Aside from one short scene that was a little difficult to swallow (Wilbur singing to members of Parliament), the movie was compelling.       The film condenses a long period of history into just under 2 hours and was thus forced to merge/skip some details.  However, the personalities presented, especially those of the lead characters, appeared historically accurate and emotionally engaging.  While viewing the movie, the audience is brought to care deply, not just about the outcome of events, but about the individual players as well.  Wilberforce's personal weaknesses are not glossed over, nor is the role of his wife in helping to add new strength to his efforts at a critical point in his career.     John Newton's influence on the cause is clearly shown, along with the implied change that the gospel of Christ had affected in his life.    Overall, an inspiring and enjoyable film.  I highly recommend it.
1400063515|4.0|I found the book to be quirky, informative, and very entertaining. Yet, Mr. Taleb seems to fall into the trap of what he himself calls, epistemic arrogance and confirmation bias, especially when it comes to his vehement rejection of the causal aspect of history. Plus, though I haven't read his earlier works, I found his scope for randomness in this book to be very large.    As far as style, Mr. Taleb, who calls himself NNT in the book, has a definite personal voice in his writing, and I think he is obsessive compulsive with regards to the book's structure; with his elaborate, detailed table of contents, his frequent references to later chapters, and his redundant anecdotes/parables (a bit of narrative fallacy there). But I think that this all adds to the charm and humor of the book, and makes it a fun read even for a non-economist, non-trader, non-expert, non-scalable mediocristani like myself. I could imagine meeting him a party. Chatting with him would, no doubt, be fun and maybe a little annoying. Then I would move on to, say, a psychologist who is really into Karl Jung.
1595141715|5.0|I've read a lot of books in the past couple years. The stories tend to blend together and not very many of them stand out. But this book does. From the first page I could not put it down. The words are so true and beautiful and it makes you think.<br />As someone who tried to commit suicide before, I remember writing \\"the letter\\" and thinking these are my last words. I need to make them right. It was terrifying. But I wanted everyone to know why.<br />This book was so powerful and moving and creative and I don't know what to say to convince you, but you must read it. You wont regret it.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|The Next Generation is freaking awesome. I hope that if you are interested in purchasing this set that you make sure you have enough time for it. Currently i am watching 2 episodes a day, 1 on the train and one on the tredmill. I suggest this set for anyone who enjoys a storyline that continues from episode to episode.     Watching it from beginning to end is the only way to do so.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This album is so good I can't just stop listening. I love the songs, the rythm, the music. I totally recommend. It' worth to buy this version instead of the one-disc-version.
B000KN9G3E|4.0|Comes with two disks, a CD (which has the album's 11 original multi-channel and two-channel SACD tracks) and a DVD with the extra tracks, video footage, etc. Multi-channel SACD recording is phenomenal, but DVD is in PAL, not NTSC format, so make sure your dvd player is region-free before buying this (my PS3 plays DVDs, but only those with N American region NTSC format, so with this disk I get a \\"does not support PAL playback\\" error message). In retrospect, this should have been obvious to me as it is a UK import, but it's still disappointing! Maybe Amazon can add \\"PAL video format - European region DVD playback only\\" or something to the description.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I purchased this one a few years ago when it was first released and fell in love with it! It has a great mix of songs from club bangers to some Classic Mariah ballads. Of course WE BELONG TOGETHER was great & a timeless song no one could ever forget! Other standout tracks are ONE AND ONLY, I WISH YOU KNEW, MINE AGAIN, STAY THE NIGHT, JOY RIDE...and of course DONT FORGET ABOUT US was great. I highly recommend this one to anyone who does not already have it, it's hott!
0143038419|5.0|Reading Eat Pray Love was like being with the \\"in\\" girls at a private slumber party where you got to be right in the middle of all the \\"juicy stuff\\"--eating delicious treats while divulging secrets that anyone would feel privileged to know! Wonderfully written with exquisite detail, Elizabeth Gilbert's experiences take you on a magical journey of wonder, joy, and self-realization where through her insights, we discover that God's breath and our own are one and the same.<br /><br />As a clairvoyant speaker and author ([[ASIN:1601451326 Forgiveness: The Divine Connection]]), which happened as an indirect result after changing my attitude and incorporating forgiveness, I found Elizabeth's descriptions of God, Heaven, Hell, and our Higher Consciousness perception extremely accurate and well-defined. Having pursued an almost insatiable search to quench my own spiritual thirst over the past 10 years, I agree that God/Love/Christ Consciousness/The Universal Knowledge is a wonderful elixir of potential, joy and reverence that exists in us all, either as a voice, thought or observation. Whatever we call it, it's with us all the time; and taking the time to pray or acknowledge this Divine Connection just makes this awareness more obvious!<br /><br />Bravo Elizabeth! Thank you for sharing your travels, insights and precious inner thoughts, and for making this journey such a fun, hilarious, and enlightening read! We will all truly benefit from your grace for many years to come!
0972169504|5.0|the first of Cham's oh-so-true chronicles of the lives of graduate students in America.  I have given this book as a gift to many of my friends as we struggle through our own advanced degrees.  They love it every time.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Movie from my area by Kevin Smith. It is a personal favorite and is a cult classic.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I listened to this album for the first time about 2 weeks ago and now I can't stop listening to it, specially now that I just lost someone, Ok, nobody cares about my personal life I know, but hey, this album is helping to make up my mind, the songs are so beautiful, it's been a long time since I haven't heard something so incredible good, Brandi Carlile and her partners musicians and songwriters are very talented, if you apreciate good quality music you must agree with me, and ih you haven't listened, well do it, you won't regret it, thank you miss Carlile, your voice, your feeling, your songs are really apreciated, thank you for this beautiful album.
B000RMQH30|5.0|I ABSOULTLEY LOVE THIS C.D. I HEAR THE INFLUENCE OF AL GREEN AND HINTS OF THE GREAT BOB DYLAN.  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS C.D. BRINGS A MODERN SONG WITH A CLASSIC FEEL...I JUST LOVE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
B0000027RL|3.0|Remember what happened when Pearl Jam hit the music scene in the early 90's?  At first, we all liked the new sound and style.  Alternative rock that was melodic enough for adults, and rocked convincingly enough for kids and teens.  A rather large age group was able to appreciate this new influential sound and we all quickly became fans and thanked our lucky stars the hair metal movement was finally coming to an end.      What happened after a few years went by?  Bands like Creed starting appearing, and then other bands with a similar sound would appear after them, and more and more.  Even to this day, over 15 years later, we are *still* hearing the influence of this Pearl Jam album from other bands.  I say- *enough is enough*.  This style was good when Pearl Jam did it, because they were the first, or one of the first, to do so.  Also, this album contains enough good songs for me to give it a fair rating.      But the negative influence these guys had on the music scene is something that's hard for me to forgive.  I can't forgive them for all those boring, copycat bands that never came close to matching the enjoyment I got from Pearl Jam.  Unfortunately those bands also are making it very hard to come back and appreciate the band and album that did it first.  That explains my average rating for this album.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this more than I expected.    I originally thought it would be the same length as a two-part SG1 episode but was pleased to see it had a running length of something like 1 hour 43 minutes.    The whole thing was well done and exciting.    My only complaint is why wasn't it released on Blu-Ray?
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a really remarkable movie. It really points out how one should pursue their life's loves no matter what others say or think. I love how it delves into the development of inner self and awareness. It was a delight to watch. I will see it over and over and over again!!!!!!!
0439813786|5.0|This book is a wonderful, creative read, well deserving of the Caldecott medal it won for 2007.  Both my 13-year old son and I thoroughly enjoyed it and finished it in short order. The drawings are amazing and really are an integral part to the telling of the story.
6304712936|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie. It is captivating to learn the level of his abilities as a musician. My son who is studying music got so much from the movie. My son was also able to explain to me how a lot of the metal music is rooted in classical music and why.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|If \\"The X-Files\\", \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Queer as Folk\\" had a lovechild then it would be \\"Torchwood\\"!    The show is about the Cardiff operation of Torchwood, called Torchwood-3 lead by enigmatic, flamboyant and openly bisexual Captain Jack Harkness played brilliantly by John Barrowman. His small team of experts and him monitor the space-time rift that goes through Cardiff whcih leads to all sorts of encounters with aliens, space time disruptions, dark fairies etc.    Torchwood is written with an adult audience in mind, which means that the camp is toned down quite a bit compared to some episodes of \\"Doctor Who\\" and the stories are neither for prudish people nor for the faint of heart (\\"Countrycyde\\" is a real horror movie in a one hour format) The production is high-end and features the same wonderful score that Doctor Who has since Murray Gold is also in charge here.    Regarding the first series: Don't expect a perfect first series. There are very, very few series that can actually claim of having had a perfect first season and I can think of only \\"Battlestar Galactica\\". It is very clear that Torchwood is still trying to find its footing and that leads to a few duds now and then (especially \\"Cyberwoman\\") but overall the first series already has quite a few wonderful episodes to offer (\\"Small Worlds\\", \\"Countrycyde\\" \\"Captain Jack Harrtigan\\" etc) . The real reason to forgive the duds is the wonderful cast and the fulfilled promise that it will get MUCH better in series two.    Buy the box and tune in. You won't regret it.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|Danny Archer is a Zimbabwean ex-pat who grew up up in South Africa and fought with the legendary SADF 32 Battalion in the Angolan War, as witnessed by the tattoo of a Buffalo head on his arm.  Despite his Zimbabwean birth, Danny's accent is that of an English speaking Johannesburger, and his attitude and demeanor throughout the movie are decidedly South African. He's like a thousand other guys in the South African army and for this authentic portrayal alone he deserves an Oscar.    The movie itself is interesting enough and portrayals of the violence are about as accurate as can be, but the story is a little contrived in places. The attempts at a romantic involvement thrown in are a little off-balance with the movie, but it's generally a good watch.    The ending was almost expected but after the carnage and violence, it could have done with a little more upliftment.
0312323859|5.0|I absolutely loved these books! I really have to be into a book in order to read it everyday and not want to put it down. That is how I was with Something Borrowed and Something Blue. A friend let me borrow the first book and I had it read within 3 days. I was anxious to see where the second book took our characters, so I started reading Something Blue soon after. I have to admit, I hated Darcy in the first book. Even though Rachel was the one to cheat with her best friends' fiancée, I still felt that Darcy was the villain. The second book made me think otherwise. After she loses everything, Darcy finally becomes the person we all wanted her to be- a good mother and a faithful wife. I couldn't put either book down and I recommend them to everyone and anyone!!
0811826848|5.0|This is an excelent book, it is the Beatles story told by them, the book quality is amazing, clear pictures, hardcover is the way to go with this book.  The only problem I see in this book is the size, it would be almost impossible to carry it in a bag, it is heavy and big to carry, it is a book to read confortably in your bed drinking a Margarita and imagining the adventures of the most succesful band in the history of music.
B000088E6D|5.0|I have several of Bubles' albums and this one along with his other releases are fresh and smooth.  If his music was a ice cream flavor it would be Butter Brickle.  His Vancouver, BC roots coupled with his almost innate interpretation of standards has lit every bulb on Broadway, or at least inside of me.  I have never been a real fan of Sinatra but Bulbe' has shown me the way.  I don't even really give much stock to vocalists singing someone else's work but he has shown he can stand on his own two feet with his own compositions and lyrics.
0452289963|5.0|So far I love the book and have signed up for the online class which will be taught by Oprah Winfrey and Eckhart Tolle. If one is ready to go inward to solve problems, this is the book for you. It is a relief to read.
B00111YM5G|5.0|This has to be one of the best straight to video releases I have ever seen. The question is why why was it straight to video? The acting was excellent the cinematography was amazing it almost looked like Sin city or Underworld. I loved this film, and it was a very intelligent film. It made so much sense  especially into todays world. Eventually the world will not see light again if we continue on the path we are going. This movie was deep and it just goes to show that the US isn't ready for an intelligent box office hit. I could have seen this any day in the theater over some of this stuff that we waste time to put out. Look at the box office movies now and tell me if you see anything on the level of this on there ? I bet you won't just a bunch of garbage ! How did \\"THE EYE\\" get released before this ?
B00092ZMDY|5.0|everything I thought it would be.  Brings back memories.  Excellent color and clarity.
B000002KB8|5.0|While Led Zeppelin may get credit for the birth of heavy metal, i'd have to argue about that. Black Sabbath brought the darkness into metal and its been there every since. This debut album is one of the finest metal recordings ever put on tape. You can listen to it straight thru without skipping a song. Highly recommend this album to fans of real metal.
B000ZINGIK|4.0|The Scarecrow is definitely worth buying, if you are already into power metal. It doesn't have the same feel as the metal opera, but that's okay. Many of the tracks on this album are quite superb. Devil in the Belfry is easily my favorite off the album. What kind of Love is an excellent ballad, and Lost in Space is a little Bon Jovi esk, but that's fine as it is still a fun song to listen to, even if it is a little poppy.  4/5 stars.
B000002KHH|5.0|While you can list the top ten metal albums of all time, this cd would always be in the top five.  The title track, Iron Man, and War Pigs are some of the greatest metal songs of all time. Highly recommend this cd.
B000006YXV|5.0|Any lover of Motown, Marvin Gaye, or soulful music has to have this CD compilation. The recording and sound transfer does justice to Gaye's clear vocals. Besides having all the essential hits \\"What's Going on?\\", \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevines\\", etc. it has two additional gems that you won't find anywhere else. There is a beautiful rendition of \\"You Are Everything\\" that Marvin did with Diana Ross and a very rare Marvin Gaye cover of \\"Abraham & Martin & John\\" which is the best version of the song I have ever heard. Even if you have all of Marvin Gaye's hits on other collections, buy this disc if only for those two inclusions. Just wonderful!
B00062IDCO|5.0|Voyager definately one of the best sci-fi series ever. Completed the colledtion with this one.
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Let me say first up, I love this film. Other superhero films have a tendency to be subject to the whims of their filmmakers (I'm looking at you, Tim Burton). As a result, I feel they don't totally embrace their comic book roots. That's not the case here.     The film borrows heavily from the Denny O'Neil era only adds to its appeal, as this was my favourite perios of the Batman comics. This is also the first live-action Batman film where Ra's Al Ghul is the main villain. It's delightful to finally see such accomplished filmmakers pay tribute to one of Batman's greatest enemies.     And now onto the DVD itself. I bought the Special Edition which consists of two discs. The first disc contains the film. My untrained eye makes me the worst person to judge film transfer quality, but it looks pretty good to me. The biggest dissapointment is the lack of a commentary track from director Christopher Nolan, or the other main cast members.     The 2nd disc contains documentaries on different aspects of making the film. Unfortunately, the docos are buried within a rather lackluster comic book. My suggestion? Just scroll to the very end and click on the page icon. You'll get a list of all the documentaries, which is much easier to navigate through. The docos don't quite reach the heights of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions, but they still make for interesting and informative viewing.    In summary, if you loved Batman Begins then I strongly recommend buying this Special Edition. I'm taking one star off for the ridiculous comic book on the 2nd Disc. But this disc is worth buying based purely on the film alone.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This Blu ray version of This wonderful New Christmas Classic reveals all the details that were so painstakingly built into every frame of this film.  The story will renew your belief in Santa if it has faltered.  The animation makes all the characters seem so realistic.  This is a movie that you will enjoy again and again.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Now THIS DVD is a much more entertaining version of [[ASIN:0451527402 Beowulf]] than the one we were forced to read in high school! Then again, I only read the [[ASIN:0764585800 Cliffs Notes]], so I guess that I can't really speak first hand...but Director Robert Zemekcis probably can and does in the DVD extras.<br /><br />Blood. Evisceration. Decapitation. Sex. Oh...the horror! I watched the unrated version of the film, and I can only imagine what they had to chop out of this excellent movie in order to get a PG-13 for the theaters.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise Beowulf (unrated) was on several fronts.<br /><br />First, as we sat down to watch, I had no idea that Zemeckis was at it again with live action/motion capture-animation (as he did with [[ASIN:B000AGTPUK The Polar Express]]). The technology for Beowulf is even better than it was for The Polar Express, because it was often hard to tell that you were seeing animation. The pleasant surprise here was how much I still enjoyed this 'cartoon' of sorts.<br /><br />Second, this movie was genuinely frightening at times. The story starts in 500-something AD with the hideous monster Grendel attacking a small Danish kingdom gathering hall. Did I say attacking? I meant *violently* attacking. And remember, this looks very real at times...not like a 'cartoon' at all. The first scene drove my youngest out of the room on her own will not to return; my middle guy often shielded his eyes; and my 9 year old thought it was 'wicked'. The rest of the story is that of Beowulf's quest to rid the kingdom of the cursed monster, its mother and the consequences (and rewards) of failure to do so (correctly...or should I say ethically).<br /><br />Finally, well, it was just a great movie!<br /><br />The cast includes animation over computer generated images of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn, and Crispin Glover (among some other notables that I've neglected to note). I rarely watch extras on a DVD, but the 23-minute 'making of' for Beowulf is worth it; you get to see some of the cast in their \\"computer suits\\" and you also get some amazing looks at just how Beowulf was put together.<br /><br />Fans of fantasy and folklore should not pass on this DVD. Did you like [[ASIN:B00005JPLW 300]]? Are you looking forward to the 2010 re-make of [[ASIN:B00005JKO7 Clash of the Titans]]? Yes on both accounts? Then you'll love Beowulf.r Beowulf is worth it; you get to see some of the cast in their \\"computer suits\\" and you also get some amazing looks at just how Beowulf was put together.

B000Z27HLS|4.0|I enjoyed watching this remake. I liked the actors alot and felt the differences in this version verses the other is well worth watching.   I felt the characters had more depth and I got to know them a little better than the other version.   I tried to find information on the actors and got very little information. I liked the actors playing Henry & Eleanor Tilney  as well as Catherine Morland.
0452289963|5.0|I have been studying many books that revolve around the subject of our thoughts, how we create our reality, and awakening for the past 3 years.  This book was the pinacle for me...to shift what I had been learning from shear knowledge to actual awakening these truths within me and my life.  And this was only after one initial reading!  I am signed up for the online study class for this book and can't wait to see now delving into it even deeper will change my life.

0938045695|5.0|I like Pavel's works! All of his stuff is on the expensive side though... Also for a work out program, it is not clear what you have to do.  You can find many work out programs and support, etc. on his web site though. I just started with kettlebells. I really like them and am starting to see a real change in my health, and strength! I'm 47 and let myself go. I started out with this book and one kettlebell. If you stick to your exercises you will become stronger! I am soon to apply a low carb diet and have as my goal to watch this tire that is wrapped around my waist go away! Presently,with no diet, my core is getting stronger, and my arms, shoulders,fore arms, legs etc are transforming into muscle! The flab is disappearing!

B000NA2BEU|3.0|First let me say that the service I received from the seller was stellar. My Veronica Mars boxed set arrived in just a few days and was in perfect condition. No complaints there. The season itself was quite disappointing. The first two seasons of Veronica Mars each had a major case that tied together the season as a whole. Not the case in season three. What you think is going to be the big case (the campus rapes) is solved by episode 9 & the other big case (the dean's murder)is solved by episode 15. Beyond the fact that Veronica & the gang have entered college, nothing else really changes. The characters never evolve beyond their season 2 personas, and the Veronica/Logan thing gets old pretty quickly. The writers attempt to give Roni a new love interest in Piz, but the two have absolutely NO chemistry. You hardly see Wallace, Mac, or Weevil at all this season, which is disappointing. And seriously, Keith loses the sheriff election for the 3rd time?! That's just pathetic. To top it all off, the season (& the series, mind you) ends at episode 20 (not at the usual #22) with no resolution. I'm talking total anti-climax. And then, there's this weird twenty minute, sneak peak that shows what direction the show would have gone in had there been a 4th season. Basically, the show would have jumped ahead in time, bypassing Veronica's four years of college (maybe three, considering her above average intelligence) plus however many years it takes to graduate from the FBI Acadamy, to her first day as an FBI agent. My reaction to this was, \\"Wha tha fuh?!\\" After watching this mini-episode, I was glad that they cancelled the show when they did. It peaked with it's first season.   All in all, it wasn't great, but I've sat through worse. And Kristen Bell's performance was engaging as always. If you're a Veronica Mars fan, it's worth having just to complete the set. If you're a casual watcher who will only view the episodes once, just rent it on Netflix.

Unfortunately our mutant brain has developed an inventive skill and a dexterity at toolmaking into the rampant exploitation of that environment.  We have become a murderous, forest-burning, ocean-fouling, sky-polluting cancer on the earth. Shubin points out that 99 percent of all the species that have ever lived have become extinct.

0316113506|5.0|Spark is a luminous and visionary book. John Ratey and Eric Hagerman have done a terrific job of bringing the neuroscience of exercise and the brain to the mainstream in an intelligent, inspiring and practical book.      Once I started reading Spark, I couldn't put it down. The writing is smart, effortless and heartfelt. John Ratey is on a crusade to spread the message that exercise can transform people's lives from the inside out--and he presents this case convincingly. His enthusiasm is contagious. Spark will definitely persuade and motivate readers from all walks of life to make exercise something that they seek most days of the week.     Spark is packed with tons of really valuable scientific information and case studies, but it is never a heavy read. Ratey mixes in personal anecdotes, other people's experiences and practical advice to bring the pages to life. He also manages to maintain a friendly and down-to-earth voice even when discussing potentially mind-numbingly dry neuro-science. His conversational, upbeat tone keeps the eyes from glazing over and the pages turning...The science in this book is thorough and cutting-edge without ever being stodgy or overly complicated.    Huge thanks to John Ratey and Eric Hagerman for this timely, accessible and inspiring contribution to the field of Exercise and the Brain. Reading Spark will improve your life. I highly recommend this book.     Christopher Bergland
6305263248|4.0|John Frankenheimer's 1999 \\"Ronin\\" could easily have been another forgetable action movie.  Instead, Frankenheimer manages to invest the plot with real tension and the characters with significant depth.  The result, a loose riff on a Japanese legend about 47 masterless samurai, is an atmospheric thriller.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro stars as a ostensibly out-of-work covert operative who answers a job interview in Nice, France, for an unidentified project on behalf of an unnamed sponsor.  The mission, as described by the nominal leader (played with silky Irish menance by Natscha McElhone), is to steal a suitcase containing a sensitive cargo.<br /><br />DeNiro and his fellow operatives, notably Sean Bean as an alleged former SAS member, Jean Reno as a former French operative, and Stellan Skarsgard as a former KGB computer expert, put together and execute an ambush, only to lose the suitcase to another covert operation.  The stage is set for a series of thrilling car chases, betrayals, and a final confrontation with the real leader of the theft operation.  The loyalties of the various operatives are suspect right up to the finish.<br /><br />The movie was filmed on location in and around Nice and Paris.  The dialogue is usually first-rate.  The interaction between DeNiro and his ally of the moment Reno is priceless, as two professionals do their job while trying to ferret out the real alligences of the other.  This movie is highly recommended to fans of Robert DeNiro and of the spy genre.
B000O599WG|5.0|If you are thinking about buying this movie you already know it is arguably the best western ever made, so I'm going to tell about why you should buy this edition over previous ones.  This edition provided more than I expected, aside from the usual extras included in the DVD's. I'm referring particularly to the collector's photographs that come in this edition and that took me by surprise. They are great production shots of H. Hawks, J. Wayne, Dean Martin, and the crew of the film.  If you love this movie, you'll love what this two-disc special edition brings... a lot of stuff that takes you closer and deeper into the movie than anytime before.    Buy it and enjoy...
B00005OAA6|4.0|I first came across Victoria's solo work thru Youtube and I decided to check out some of her tracks. Let me just say that, whoever thought that Victoria couldn't sing and was just the girl in the Spice Girls' that wore short dresses is seriously mistaken. This girl actually has talent and gave a decent vocal range and songs that females could relate to.   Her first two singles \\"Not Such An Innocent Girl\\" and \\"A Mind of Its Own\\" are very poppy songs with good videos to accompany them. Then there \\"Like That \\" where Victoria is telling women not to accept & make excuses for behavior from their no- good men. \\"I.O.U.\\" is dedicated to David of her professing her love to him. \\"Girlfriend\\" is involving Victoria meeting a guy at the club and his woman finding her number in his pocket & telling her to back off of her & handle her man. \\"Every Part of Me\\" is dedicated to her son, Brooklyn and how much is existence has changed her for the better. \\" Whatchu Talkin Bout\\" is clearly about Geri leaving the group and you finally get to hear how she really felt about her.  While there are many good tracks on the album, there are a few that could've been left off the album like the bland \\"Unconditional Love\\" and \\"No, Trix, No Games\\" otherwise everything is satisfactory or better.  Spice Girls fans wouldn't be disappointed and pop fans could appreciate it also. And if you get a hold of her other two unreleased albums \\"OPen YOur Eyes\\" and \\"Come Together\\" you wouldn't be disappointed.    p.s. You can find her second unreleased album \\"Open Your Eyes\\" on [...]

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Could be I'm so enthralled b/c I'm a leftover fan of the Beatles, but being a musician myself, I was amazed at how well the songs sequed into the acting/speaking parts of the movie.  I'd give it a 10+ for a rating!  If you're from my generation, this is a MUST SEE.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|This review was originally posted for the DVD. The accolades for that serve here as well.    Frankly, I had never been a strong fan of Bruce Springsteen's during his more raucous Rock and Roll career.  I like Rock and Roll very much but most of his work seemed to my ear a little off kilter.  However, with an acoustic recording in 2005 and now a folky recording of some works made famous by the legendary folksinger and folk traditionalist Pete Seeger Springsteen has come back home. This session produced interesting versions of some common American songs like Eire, John Henry and Shenendoah that are done with so much retexturing (Springsteen's term) that Bruce has now created a niche for himself in the folk pantheon. Who would have thought?    This is a short documentary about the making of the sessions album but it gives real insight into the way Sprngsteen `feels' the song, gears up, and then goes out and performs it in that gravelling voice that I like in male singers. For my money his version of Shenandoah is one of the most hauntingly moving I have ever heard. And I do not even usually like the song. All this plus his gang of musicians were obviously having a good time. And it shows. I am going out to buy the album, pronto.
0810993139|5.0|If you haven't had a good laugh lately, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is your source for timeless humor.<br /><br />There's a particular goofiness about boys in middle school that drives parents crazy but has to delight when considered from a distance such as through reading Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Jeff Kinney captured that goofiness with a tongue-in-cheek irreverence that will amuse anyone reading this book.<br /><br />This is a graphic novel, but not the slick sort that you see from Japan. Instead, Mr. Kinney imitates the style that a middle school boy with good printing skills might use in displaying this simulated diary in the form of Greg Heffley's journal.<br /><br />Greg is a middle child as well as a middle schooler. His older brother Rodrick can't be bothered with Greg except when the temptation to torture occurs to Rodrick. His younger brother Manny is the apple of his parents' eyes and is spoiled rotten.<br /><br />Greg has a few, simple needs to satisfy: Avoiding touching the cheese that's been on blacktop since the prior spring, not getting beaten up by bigger kids, playing his favorite video games (which his parents don't approve of), avoiding embarrassment, and getting credit for doing something right. Parents, teachers, fellow students, and fate conspire to thwart Greg.  But Greg has one ace in the hole . . . his friend Rowley is even more of a loser than Greg is. And Greg exploits Rowley for all he's worth. The gags are often based on the results not turning out as Greg anticipated.<br /><br />The book has many funny parts that will have you laughing out loud. Occasionally, Mr. Kinney goes over the top and employs too much self-satire. But the story is quickly rescued by going back into straight satire.<br /><br />I derived special pleasure from the book by recounting the adventures of one of my sons and his best friend at this same age.  That gave me many more things to laugh about.
B000MRA5EM|2.0|We have several Imax DVDs including a few underwater features, which we love.  This one seems to be shot after shot of big fish eating smaller fish.  Pretty boring watching sea animals eat each other for 40 minutes.      The narration is not great either.  Depp and Winslet take turns narrating.  It seems like they are narrating for 2 different movies.  There is no continuity.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Authors are fond of saying that the written word can take people anywhere, thinking no doubt of the intense relationship that a reader can have with an engaging author's writing. 84 Charing Cross Road explores a different dimension of how the written word travels: the role of correspondence, a virtually lost art today. The movie deftly displays how you can share your heart with someone you've never met.<br /><br />The movie is based on 20 years of actual correspondence between New York author Helene Hanff and Frank Doel, the manager of a small London book store. Hanff's in-your-face New York energy and candor are what make the exchange meaningful to viewers. Hanff is a $40 a week script reader as the movie begins but has an affection for British nonfiction that leaves her frustrated with a lack of out-of-print titles in New York. Seeing a small advertisement in The Saturday Review, she writes to Marks & Co. in London (located at 84 Charing Cross Road) asking with trepidation for used books that cost less than $5 each and requesting specific titles.<br /><br />The movie handles this distance relationship by alternating between receiving and sending correspondence and revealing little bits of the daily lives of those involved. At the core, however, is always a shared passion for books and good writing. The two styles of communicating could not be more different: Hanff doesn't edit her inner thoughts when writing, and Doel is proper and reticent.<br /><br />The correspondence and relationship take an unexpected turn when Hanff learns how little fresh food English people are allowed during post-war rationing but how cheap it is to send some from Denmark. With a good heart, she sends off a first package . . . and then fears she may offend by having sent a ham to people who keep kosher.<br /><br />A film like this obviously depends on some pretty special acting. Anne Bancroft does a wonderful job of being breezy, but intense, in her performance. I loved the scenes where a cigarette dangles precariously from her mouth as she pounds away with two fingers on an old manual typewriter. The role of the reserved Doel is more of a challenge, but Anthony Hopkins manages to capture the interest and delight that a reserved man might enjoy in lighthearted correspondence. Judi Dench plays Doel's wife in a role that shows versatility from the roles that you know her better for.<br /><br />Unlike many films, this one has a heart. The actors are turned loose to play their roles in extreme ways (especially Bancroft) and the sentimentality works. Some of the most fun moments are when she turns to the camera and addresses the audience with a sparkle in her eyes.<br /><br />As I watched the film, I was reminded of the idea that relationships are more important than issues. Even when Hanff was angry about something, she would still be solicitous about the people at 84 Charing Cross Road she cared for.sly from her mouth as she pounds away with two fingers on an old manual typewriter.

B000XA5K48|4.0|\\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" ranks up there with \\"Crank\\" in the terms of style over substance.  The difference between the two is that \\"Shoot 'Em Up's\\" style IS the substance.    The film opens up with Clive Owen getting in the middle of a gunfight between a pregnant woman and some bad guys.  From there, it just takes off into a violent, well, shoot em up film, full of stylistic gun fights culled from the likes of John Woo and probably owes more than a good share to the Hong Kong action film scene, complete with fun one-liners and rather unusual uses for carrots.    Just don't expect much of a plot.  There is one, but it plays secondary to the way this film is shot.  The film seems based on a sort of gag or rather oddball situation: a very well trained fighter good with guns is trying to protect a baby.  The violence and gunplay throughout the film is like watching a very wicked cartoon.    Clive Owen's character does all sorts of fun stuff.  This is why you're watching the movie.  The favorie of the film makers seems to be Owen sliding through many scenes while shooting his assailants.  This includes sliding through across the floor, under bathroom stalls,and oh from out of a car into a van.      Owen's character is the fun sorta anti hero.  He's something of a drifter.  We don't have much of his history.  We just know he has a penchant for carrots, is really good with guns, and has some rather colorful connections, including Monica Belluici as a prostitute.    The film is not about the plot.  In fact, we don't really learn the nature of the story until about halfway through, and even then, we are given a couple of lines to clue us in to what's going on.  This film is about action.  It has the kinetic energy of a video game.  The humor is offbeat and a little dark.  It's not your regular action movie.  Perhaps the irony in the end is that the film seems to have an anti gun message.  But without them saying it overtly, you couldn't tell throughout the 90 minute duration.  Whatever the message, it's all in good fun.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|You can look at the director's name and cover artwork on the CD and know what you're in for.  Still, it had it's entertaining moments, but only in a juvenile male sort of way.  Zoe Bell was a horrendous actress even though the special features touted her as an upcoming novelty star.  Some memorable scenes, but probably only watched it because I was stuck at home sick with a cold.  This one might be better with alcohol and some rowdy friends.

B0011HOEY4|3.0|but not for other more casual film goers...I enjoyed the film but do not believe it to be amongst Scott's best works.  The acting was fine, direction fine, dialogue OK...but the story tried to encompass too much...a big storyline arc has worked for Scott in other films (Gladiator) but not here...we get to see too little of Frank Lucas's interaction with his family and the Harlem community and we see too little of Crowe's characters interaction with his fellow police officers...in both cases THESE are the most interesting parts of the film...not the chase of Lucas by the drug squad...That said...the last 1/2 hour of the film is EXCELLENT...once the drugs are found in the coffins and the warrant is issued for Lucas's arrest the pace picks up and we get to see the interaction between Washington and Crowe on screen which makes the film worth viewing for that alone...
0142004235|5.0|I am reading this masterpiece for the 2nd time; and the messages in the readings, are really remarkable; because even though the characters live in a simple time; it's that purity and simpleness in the wording, that helped me grasp a spectrum of human thoughts and ideals.  I find myself just stopping to think and digest sentences and paragraphs, because I felt really moved in my spirit; and delighted by unexpected epiphanies revealed throughout.      It is timeless, it could be a 1100 years from now, and still one could relate.  I feel the time period, although long past into history, is still fresh and alive because of the timeless concepts that make humans, humans.

0765348276|4.0|This has Starship Troopers and Heinlein written all over it but, similarities aside, it's still a very enjoyable book. How can you not like the idea of a 75 year old person getting a new/improved body with the *only* hitch being that they have to serve 10 years in the Colonial Defense Force (CDF)?     The book follows John Perry who does just that. We follow him from \\"draft day\\", to meeting new friends, to getting new a new body, \\"experimenting\\" with his new body, boot camp, and then combat and moving up through the ranks. We might has well have named him J. Rico but instead of just one enemy we have several different alien races, all of whom want to make humans part of their diet. And again, like Starship Troopers, we see him lose his old friends one by one. I didn't see as much political commentary as in Heinlein's works but there was more than a bit of the light-hearted fare.    The book was thoroughly enjoyable. My only gripe was that the main idea of having a 75 year old mind with 75 years worth of experiences in a 20-something year old super body wasn't really developed. It felt like it was just a hook to get someone to pick up the book but, accomplishing that, was pretty much dropped. After the first part of the book, I never got the sense that we were actually dealing with individuals with a lifetime of experience. But the book would have been good even without that hook.

0452289963|4.0|Good book although somewhat in the mystical/etheral sense. Having read many books discussing the powers of attraction, I can appreciate the idea Mr. Tolle is trying to get us to see. It's a bit over the top in some aspects, way too deep for just the casual reader if their head isn't in the right place, which is OUT of the box...a few of my friends just couldn't grasp the jest of it all.  Too bad, for there have been many AH HA moments for me along the way amongst the pages.  Can't wait to hear what the class is all about!  And what a great happening it would be if we all could change our world to the better?
B000P12LWY|1.0|I kept hearing how this series was so \\"highly rated,\\" and being the history lover I am, I decided to check it out. Having watched it, my theory is this: ratings are decided by number of viewers, not viewer opinions, so I wonder how many viewers, if asked, would say they kept watching the series just because they couldn't believe anything could keep being so breathtakingly, astoundingly bad?     There are so many historical errors others have touched on that I won't even go into that. My question is much simpler. I understand that everyone involved in the production is not going to be an expert on the period, but seriously, could they not have gone online for 5 minutes and looked at portraits of the people before doing the casting? Let's review:     Henry VIII: (Real) Broad, brawny, athletic build, reddish hair vs. (Theirs) Short, wiry, dark-complected     Anne Boleyn: (Real) Dark eyes, oval face, medium complexion vs. (Theirs) Shocking blue eyes, heart-shaped face, fair skin     Catherine of Aragon: (Real) Auburn hair vs. (Theirs) Coal-black hair     Thomas Tallis: (Real) Wavy hair, neatly trimmed beard and mustache vs. (Theirs) Emo, lute-smashing waif who never saw a comb     I mean, who are they going to get to play Anne of Cleves, Poppy Montgomery? The mind boggles! In any case, I must admit Showtime need not worry about their \\"ratings\\" going down; between those who don't know their history and just want a soap, and those who watch every episode just so they can criticize and lampoon the whole thing, their numbers aren't going down. The fact that it's such a parody of itself makes it fun enough to watch that I give it a star. For any other reason, though, it's minus 5. I just pray they don't decide to do a hatchet job on my beloved Stuarts!

B000N6TYLW|5.0|The seventh and final season of Gilmore Girls for me, answered and addressed all the questions and hidden wishes I had of the show. This was the perfect ending. I was one of the people who had secretly wished Lorelai and Christopher would get together and this season not only fulfilled that wish but also showed the ugly reality of the relationship when it came to fruition. Needless to say it was not a pretty picture.     As for Rory and Logan, if Rory had accepted Logan's proposal it would've been disappointing. Hence the ending was perfect. It was also brilliant how the writers brought some hard hitting reality into Rory's world which threw her into a whirlwind of emotions from agony to exhilaration; hope to despair; from the thrill of being offered a job to the heartache of knowing nothing will ever be the same again. My favorite line throughout the season was when Rory said to her mother \\"Mom you've given me everything I need\\". And the same could be said about this season - the writers and actors have given everything we needed to say goodbye to this unforgettable and brilliant show.     As someone who has had the same best friend for 17 years I really appreciated the very personal nod to Lane and Rory's friendship. I loved all their \\"special talks\\" this season and Rory returning to her home town - her blood vein Stars Hallow could only be welcomed with a sigh of contentment and satisfaction.     Luke. I fell in love with Luke all over again. I loved him in this season and I finally \\"got him\\" because to be honest there were times I just didn't get the \\"Luke thing\\" but this season just seeing Luke smile really warmed my heart!    The final and crucial element that contributed to the perfect ending to this season is the much needed exploitation of all the Stars Hallow goof balls - Ms Patty; Babette and Maurie (the partner); Kirk and Lou Lou and the Dragon Fly characters Sookie, Jackson and of course Michelle. Last but not least is a toast to Paris and Lloyd, without them life would just be too conventional!     It is with great satisfaction and of course regrettable sadness that we say goodbye to Gilmore Girls!
0609610570|3.0|Got this book from the library, and after reviewing Ram's comments about J&J it was clear to me he did not know what he was talking about.  Being Employed in the medical industy for 18 years I am well aware of this story.  First he states that J&J developed the stent technology.  They didn't develop squat, it was developed by Cordis, who was acquired in a hostile take over.  I have also had the opportunity of meeting a retired engineer who worked a Cordis during the time of the takeover.  According to my engineer friend they striped Cordis of all projects and replaced them with their own completely disrupting the product pipe line.    Last of all they did a wonderful Job of irritating every a great number of Doctors.  Since the were the only ones with a stent at the time they saw no need to reduced the price of the stent no matter the size of the customer.  The one doctor I talked to said even if someone could provide an equal stent at the same price they would buy it rather then J&J.  No wonder they lost over 90% market share in less then a month.    In summary I find this as a case a shear stupidity and arrogance on the part of J&J and have a hard time seeing any relationship to execution.  It also compromises the authors credibility.

B000NA28I4|1.0|I felt so very sad when i saw this movie. I loved the books, and the movie ruined the whole spirit of the book, the spesial relationship between Eragon and Saphira, and that was totaly wrong in the movie. He said to her \\" I am the dragonrider and you are the dragon, and we do what I tell you\\" like she is his slave. 3 part stupid, 1 part lucky, is 4 part annoying and booring, and it seemed to me like he was more 4 part stupid. He was way to lucky, i keept hoping he would die, so he at least had to suffer the consiquenses of his actoins, but noo, he keept living and learnd nothing. That movie was a shame, because the books are so much better. There he has to suffer the consiquenses of his bad choises.
B000P12LWY|3.0|In order for you to enjoy this if you are a Tudor fanatic (as I am), you must forget all you know.    The writers seem to have made up their own alternate universe. They stick to the stereotypes of these fascinating historical characters, and perpetuate falsehoods.    I sat and watched with some impressionable friends of mine, whose only knowledge of the period came from Phillipa Gregory books. They spouted half-truths as Gospel, and had no idea what was real or fake from this show. I do not like how the sullying of the Tudor name seems to be taking place; we will see in later seasons, I suppose.    That aside, it can be enjoyed on a purely objective level. The acting is great, the costumes are wonderful, and the dialogue is quick and done well.    Do I think it is historically accurate? No. Do I care that it isn't? I sure do. Am I excitedly and anxiously awaiting the second season? Absolutely!     The show is fun. Just be prepared to stand up for your favorite royal family...it is frustrating when people think YOU'RE wrong because this show fed them false information!    That all being said, I think there is too much pointless sex. I am not for censoring at all, but this does not add to the plot in any possible or conceivable way.    If you like gratuitous sex, then you will enjoy this movie. If you don't, just be prepared for plenty of overtly sexual scenes.    All in all, it is well done.

0375758992|4.0|This family is composed mainly of fighters, people who decided to forsake the clotted cream comfort of their native England for the thorny bush country of, what was then known as, Rhodesia.<br /><br />In poetic prose that the reader occasionally stumbles over, Fuller takes us on a dense tour of her life in Africa, thesaurus in hand, and describes the stunning beauty and hopeless squalor of the land with a series of adjectives and adverbs that occasionally seem shoehorned in but rarely off-the-mark. This makes for an occasionally jarring, though still beautiful, journey, much like what the young author must have experienced perched on the spare tire of her family's bucking Land Rover. Some of Fuller's descriptive metaphors, however, are quite luminous; they stay with you.<br /><br />Still, she hits home with her prose more often than not, and produces a thoroughly readable if somewhat detached report on the life of her family, and how they bear up as trauma eclipses joy after a series of dismal events, including the deaths of small children and runs for the border of several African nations as things (i.e., the political landscape, war) shift and change.  These things would loom large in anyone's life, and they are told here with an air of inevitability and acceptance . . . even excitement.<br /><br />Here's a family who thrives on adventure.<br /><br />There were several times Fuller had me right there in the back of the Land Rover with her.  I was unsettled and awed by what we saw together.  She's an amazing writer when she gets going.<br /><br />Great read.

B00003CXDD|5.0|In a time of swords and sorcery, the powerful and evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) has overtaken the land with her army and a prophecy has stated that a female child would be born to become very sacred and put an end to the reign of the queen. She has almost murdered every pregeant woman in the village except for one which has the very special baby princess which has been taken to a village of little people called Nelwyns. Kind-hearted farmer Willow Urfgood (Warwick Davis) has found the child near a river and raises it but after an unfortune incident in his village, he has to return the child back to her people. A renegade swordswinging rebel named Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) teams up with Willow and a couple of small folk called brownies especially a sorceress named Raziel (Patrica Hayes) to stop Bavmorda's evil once and for all.<br /><br />An entertaining and mesermzing fantasy comedy adventure from executive producer George Lucas and director Ron Howard is one fantasy cinema's greatest achievements. Co-starring gorgeous Joanne Whalley as Madmartigan's love interest, Phil Fondacaro and Billy Barty, The film is influenced by medieval mythology, J.R.R. Tolkein, and even The Ten Commandments with a majestic music score by James Horner and awesome special effects like that memorable morphing sequence that set the standard for CGI for years to come in this must see fantasy favorite.<br /><br />This DVD has fantastic picture and sound with good extras like audio commentary, Trailers and Teasers, TV Spots, original 1988 making of Featurette and \\"Morf to Morphing: The Dawn of the Digital age\\" featurette.
B0010ZR160|3.0|...deeply unsatisfying.  Two reasons: the last 1/3 of the film implodes under way too many implausibilities (and I can't really discuss them without giving away the plot), and the lead character's moral pigheadedness (or principledness, depending on your point of view) was equally implausible and extremely hard to accept.<br /><br />It's a shame, because this film could've been at a whole other level in the hands of a more subtle and experienced filmmaker.  Ben Affleck is plenty competent in the technical department: he's gotten together a strong cast and script, has diligently gotten all the local South Boston settings and flavors just right, knows how to handle the camera and keep the film moving along at an engaging pace, etc.<br /><br />But he can't quite close the deal.  There is no strong or coherent subtext, no \\"bigger picture\\" framing this picture, no irony or ambiguity.  It feels like simply an extraordinarily well-crafted but small, made-for-HBO film, or an earnest, straightforward film-school project following pretty much an Aristotle-by-the-numbers structure.<br /><br />In short, mostly quite absorbing and enjoyable to watch, certainly of a higher quality than the standard Hollywood dreck, but not a film I'd be in any hurry to sit through again.<br /><br />Should stimulate lots of lively debate though, gotta give it that much.  Would be good material for a moral philosophy class probably, or if you watch it with some people that you like to argue with.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.

0618918248|4.0|Obviously it is impossible to say anything about Richard Dawkins' \\"The God Delusion\\" that has not already been said in one of the 1100+ reviews here on Amazon, or in the many discussions elsewhere about the book. After all, the debate about the existence of god already was a hot topic in the days of ancient Athens, and probably even before that. But I nevertheless want to add my own view to the pile.<br /><br />For a convinced naturalist like me, the main question is precisely how to approach the subject matter. After all, to make a philosophical critique of arguments for the existence of god is not quite the same as making a critique of organized religion in practice, or of the idea of theism as an explanation of the world, or of religious morality. In this book, Dawkins opts to do all of the above, each in a chapter of its own, while adding rebuttals of common criticisms and questions about the atheist worldview as well. In order, he addresses the issue of whether religion should be respected, the position of theism as a hypothesis about the natural world, the philosophical arguments for god's existence (mainly those of Aquinas and Swinburne), the probability of god's existence given what we know of the universe, why religion as a phenomenon exists, how morality comes into being, the moral status of the Bible, critiques of religious organizations and behavior, religion and children, and finally whether religion is not necessary for our emotional well-being.<br /><br />All of this is argued succinctly and effectively in most cases. Dawkins is of course particularly strong on the side of the physical sciences, showing how the argument from design is completely untenable, how increasing knowledge of the nature of the universe's physical structure makes god more and more a 'god of the gaps', as well as decisively and clearly refuting many common mistakes about probability and chance as they relate to the questions of evolution and physics. Like any person with higher academic training, he has no trouble whatsoever in dealing with the supposed arguments or proofs from god's existence of a philosophical kind either, though he wisely does not spend particularly much time refuting all of them (for a book specifically good at doing just that, read John Mackie's [[ASIN:019824682X The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God]]). The entirety of the silly reasonings of 'intelligent design' are demolished with gusto, and the same happens to the vague appeals of the likes of C.S. Lewis (whose reputation as an effective apologetic I have never understood).<br /><br />Dawkins is less strong when it comes to religion as a social phenomenon, however. The chapter on the origins of religion as such, which of course require explaining once we reject theism, is very tentative and mostly lists a variety of different proposals by current-day popular science writers. Dawkins himself here proposes his theory of 'memetics' and cultural evolution, but fairly admits that it is controversial and as yet unproven. It is somewhat of an odd intermezzo in an otherwise effective polemic to insert a chapter that never goes beyond the level of vague and tentative suggestions; perhaps this is better suited at the end of the book, before the final chapter, rather than in the middle.<br /><br />Equally, Dawkins has a tendency to go on tangents that get tiresome after a while, in particular when he discusses \\"what is wrong with religion\\"; he spends a lot of time giving examples of religious fanaticism, which non-fanatics will not identify themselves with in the first place, and which fanatics will not care about. Similarly, the many pages he spends discussing the matter of whether Hitler and Stalin were atheists and therefore atheism is evil is far more than such an inane proposition deserves. Fortunately, he admits as much at several points, and a lot is compensated for by Dawkins' good sense of humor and excellent rhetorical skill.<br /><br />Finally, I find it disappointing that his analysis of religious behavior and religious morality as a social phenomenon is so weak - there is absolutely no discussion of socio-economic structures and their relation to religion. There is no recognition that if religion is a phenomenon that requires an evolutionary answer, then surely the historically persistent presence of atheism is such a phenomenon too! Trying to judge what the Bible's text says by modern moral standards and trying to remark on the cruelty of God may be effective for people already strongly wavering in their religious belief, but is not a very germane topic for the question where religion comes from in the first place. After all, as Mormonism and Scientology have shown, anyone can come and create a new religion with a new holy book even in modern times, and this turns out to be effective in Akron circa 2000 just as much as in Jerusalem circa 30. What requires answering is why religion attracts certain people more than others, and why some become fanatics and others 'moderates', and so forth; and \\"The God Delusion\\" does not tell us much about this. It must be said though that that is not a major criticism, as after all the book is not a discussion of sociology of religion, but a polemic against considering religious belief a good or sane idea.<br /><br />Overall, Dawkins' book is very well-structured, well-argued and rhetorically effective. Almost every common argument for religion or against atheism is addressed at least in passing, and he even goes out of his way to go into the more 'human' issues of whether we can be consoled without religion, and whether beauty and morality would not suffer without it. Dawkins rightly recognizes these as serious issues, more so than many other atheist polemicists do. After all, religion is rarely a rational decision, so addressing it at the emotional level is at least as important as addressing it philosophically. My criticisms above do not detract from the overall power this book has as the premier atheist manifesto of today, and one that I wholeheartedly support for the vast majority of its content. It is indeed of vital importance that everyone capable of reading reads at least the first chapters, the ones on the relation between theism on the one hand and probability, evolution, chance, and physics on the other hand, since this would take away a host of misunderstandings and misconceptions popularly held. Only a pity that Dawkins is a better biologist than he is a sociologist.t his analysis of religious behavior and religious morality as a social phenomenon is so weak - there is absolutely no discussion of socio-economic structures and their relation to religion.

B00000BKI4|2.0|[2017 Update:<br /><br />&#34;Stay away from this album. Far, far away.&#34; Bit extreme, eh, Comps?<br /><br />I was driving around today listening to Yerself Is Steam, and thinking about how much I loved this band (first three albums anyway). I then remembered the below review I carelessly wrote almost ten years ago, and how it's still up on the interwebs, saying mean things. That's kind of unnecessary. I hope my harsh words (which were born more from bewildered frustration at critical and public praise than the music itself, which I mentioned wasn't bad, but merely... there) haven't steered even a single person from this great band. I'm apparently in the minority with my feelings on Deserter's Songs, so by all means, give it a whirl, you might love it. But if you're not impressed, be sure to try going backwards in the catalog before giving up entirely on the band.<br /><br />I also listened to this again recently, and it's better than I remembered. Only took me 18 years or so to come around. Leaving original review below intact for posterity's sake.<br /><br />End 2017 Update.]<br /><br />What is going on here? Why is this album praised to the ends of the earth? Is it a grand conspiracy? Are people just afraid to disagree with the consensus? Is the world filled with people who just simply have awful taste when it comes to music?<br /><br />This record isn't terrible. But it's so utterly forgettable in every way that a.) I'm confounded at how it's _still_ lauded as Mercury Rev's &#34;artistic peak&#34; by the masses, and b.) I'm outraged that it's even considered marginally acceptable when compared to Rev's previous three albums: the brilliant debut Yerself is Steam, the good but slight misstep Boces, and finally, the glorious magnum opus, See You on the Other Side. All flawed, but still inspiring, creative, uplifting, and above all, interesting listens. Deserter's Songs is none of these things.<br /><br />I actually have no idea if Mercury Rev recovered from this dull expose, as I was so disappointed, I lost all interest in what had previously been one of my favorite bands, and haven't heard any of their subsequent material.<br /><br />Stay away from this album. Far, far away.

B000OZ28IS|4.0|William Boyd's \\"Restless\\" is an unusual spy novel.  The protagonist is a woman, Eva Delectorskaya, a multi-lingual Russian émigré recruited for the British Secret Service at the start of the Second World War in Europe in 1939.  Through several changes of identity, she has become Sally Gilmarten, a widow living in an out-of-the-way cottage near a small English village called Middle Ashton.     The book opens in the voice of Ruth, Sally's twenty-eight-year-old daughter, a single mother raising a bright little boy named Jochen.  The year is 1976, and in alternating chapters, the reader learns of Ruth's life and loves as an Oxford University graduate student earning a livelihood tutoring various foreign businesspeople in English as a second language.    The alternate chapters are the chapters of a memoir written by Sally in a third-person narrative, \\"The Story of Eva Delectorskaya.\\"  These chapters tell of Eva's recruitment after the murder of her brother, Kolia, also a British spy, her training in the craft of espionage, her early assignments and escapes from danger, and her posting to the United States, assigned to manipulate the media and build sentiment for the entry of the U. S. into the war as a British ally.  Her final assignment involves a close brush with death, and the remaining chapters of the book deal with the circumstances of that encounter and the involvement of Ruth in the resolution of the mystery surrounding that incident.    Like all good spy stories, \\"Restless\\" is replete with unexpected twists and turns, duplicitous motivations, a dangerous love affair, and a mystery that is not solved until the final chapter.  What makes Restless unusual as a spy story is the intervening drama of Ruth's life as a single-mother graduate student in the 1970s.  Boyd inhabits his female characters so well that these chapters seem more like a contemporary romance novel than a spy thriller - an uncommon mix.  But he captures the spirit of the times, the newly liberatedwoman, the left-wing demonstrations of the seventies, even though he leaves many of the strands of this story unresolved, the reader sometimes wondering what purpose it served.  He does an admirable job of portraying the intrigue of war and international politics of the early years of the Second World War, but the resolution of the final mystery is fuzzy in places and does not evoke that final \\"aha!\\" from the reader, the ultimate goal of the very best spy novels.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|I was highly impressed with this documentary film and would strongly recommend it to those who are interested in history, the Cold War, warfare, government policy, and philosophy. It is extremely broad and has considerable depth of concept. It certainly well deserved the Academy Award for Best Documentary.    The eleven lessons acted as an armature that allowed Robert McNamara to cover a broad range of topics including the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the fire bombing of Japan, the initiation of the war in Vietnam (which McNamara orchestrated) and the escalation of the war in Vietnam (which McNamara resisted).    Those who would view this film seeking to find a guilty McNamara who confesses to some feelings of guilt should look elsewhere. For as the film explains so well, the vast number of unknown forces and decision makers create an atmosphere which he calls the 'fog of war' where the best possible decisions are made at the time even though intelligence is poor, information and data is lacking, and perspective and reflection is not obtainable. McNamara also reminds us of the Cold War mentality that influenced every piece of information, every diplomatic conversation, and every military consideration.  McNamara tells of his growing misgivings as the death tolls reached 25,000 and a clear conceptualization of the war had not yet been formulated outside of Cold War domino theory rhetoric. This theory did not fit the intense purpose of the North Vietnamese or the corrupt military government in South Vietnam. McNamara clearly indicates that Lyndon Johnson's political instincts and unwillingness to become vulnerable resulted in escalation of the war, all of which just made him more politically vulnerable. McNamara tells of his resignation which many felt was actually a forced termination by President Johnson. The war continues to escalate until 58,000 Americans die and President Johnson decides not to run for re-election in the face of a growing national storm against this failed, confused, and unclear mission.    The eleven lessons evoked certain themes which I will explore next:    Empathy and the ability to empathize with the enemy is critical to having a full perspective on the competition or conflict. This means trying to see the nature of the conflict from the perspective of your opponent. McNamara says we never were able to fully comprehend the perspective of the North Vietnamese. We saw the war as a chapter in the larger Cold War, a war with Communism. North Vietnam seemed to be an agent of the Communists. They on the other hand saw the USA as simply an imperial power that had decided to dominate Vietnam in the future as France had dominated Vietnam in the past. Both perspectives were tragically flawed. The Vietnamese saw themselves as engaging in a Civil War for national unification and they saw themselves as highly independent from the Russians and especially the Chinese, with whom they had fought for over 1000 years.    McNamara also points out that rationality will not save you from human error and failure. He illustrates how following a completely rational string of conclusions can be faulty as more and more erroneous information or stereotypical thinking enters the mix. Here he offers an interesting story about the Cuban Missile Crisis. As this crisis quickly escalated, the White House received two messages from the Kremlin. The first was soft and philosophical and appeared to come from Khrushchev. It asks for reflection and consideration before both sides pull the strings so tight that a knot develops that can not be untied. Then soon afterward another message arrives that appears to come from the top hard line military leaders which is hostile and threatening.  Many in the White House advised President Kennedy to respond to the second with equal force. However Tommy Thompson, the former US ambassador in Russia, urged Kennedy to find a way for Khrushchev to save face. The way to allow him to save face would be for the Russians to remove their warheads but to be able to say to the world that Russia saved Cuba from destruction by the USA.  McNamara also points out that despite rationality, human error in any system may bring about unwanted and terrible results.    McNamara also stresses efficiency as a guiding principle. Of course he was a whiz kid who became the first person other than a Ford family member to be the President of Ford Motors. McNamara links efficiency to the fire bombing of Japan's cities. This was a fascinating and frightening portion of this film.  McNamara tells of the highly effective fire bombing of 67 Japanese cities, destroying 50 to 90 percent of these cities. These were major cities the size of Cleveland, Memphis, Nashville, Birmingham, Mobile, Charleston, Miami.  The fact that the Japanese government would not surrender in the face of such death and destruction was amazing. McNamara tells of General Curtis LeMay's willingness to inflict great damage on the enemy using the most efficient means at his disposal. It sounds terrible and cruel but in fact may have shortened the war and thus brought an end to all the death. This discussion overlays McNamara's other point that sometimes to do good, one must do evil. He tells of the manner in which Curtis LeMay made decisions and related back to the burning of Atlanta by General Sherman.      McNamara points out that there are really no rules of war and that the losing side is frequently charged with war crimes but not the winning side. He relates that the fire bombing of Japan and the atomic bombs could have been viewed as war crimes if the Japanese had won the war. War crime is highly dependent on whether you are a winner or loser. However McNamara indicates that in conflict there should be some sense of proportionality that helps guide decision making and guide the extent of strike and retaliation.     McNamara points out that data is essential but then gives examples where seeing and believing were both wrong even when leadership thought they had the data they needed for decision making. This leads to a discussion regarding the need for correct information and clear objectives upon entering into warfare. In this regard the film certainly is relevant to the neo-conservatives that lead the US into the current war in Iraq.     McNamara urges flexibility of thought which he expresses as re-examination of your reasoning and a willingness to change course of action rather than stubbornly moving forward despite evidence that things are not working as expected.     Unfortunately wisdom is a result of painful error and is far different from knowledge. It is the nature of the human condition that we are only blessed with a limited number of painful events on which to build wisdom and often we pass away before applying that wisdom in the world. The story of McNamara is larger that the Cold War or the Vietnamese War. It is the story of the limitations of the human condition.
B000009HF2|5.0|If you were a teenager in the late 70's this record was issued to you.  It permeated that entire era. A must have. Bought it on cd a while ago and really enjoyed listening to all of it again. Frampton was really at the top of his game here. Memories.

B000Y8GFY8|3.0|I was so very excited to see there was a new Goldfrapp cd. But, when i first put it on....well,  was kind of a let down. after there last release, which was to say a great cd, this one seemed kinda like a warmed over dinner from last week. By far A&E is the best song, and that is why it is the first single. Dont get me wrong, Goldfrapp is a wonderful band, but there are just too many slow songs. They really need to do a remixx ep....i would by that in a heart beat. Other songs on this cd that are outstanding, Little bird, Happiness, Cologne cerrone houdini and Caravan Girl, with out these songs, this cd would be a huge miss. So Goldfrapp.....how about a remixx. I love this group......but please give me something i can dance too. ps....i hated Clowns....zzzzzz.
B000W1MV2W|4.0|I was given this set as a gift and I just finished listening to it in the car on the long commute to and from work. It was great to hear the entire book and not some abridged version! If you haven't read this, you need to read it or hear it, as the movie versions are shorter and leave some interesting bits out.<br /><br />My only complaint (and the reason it did not get that last star) is that the last couple of chapters on the fifth disk were nothing but static. A pity. I wanted to hear about Marianne's illness and how Willoughby came to call at Cleveland...
B0007TKH66|5.0|Great show!Think it would have run longer on different network.The additional features really lets you see a different side to the actors and thier characters.Something for the whole family.
B00000K3G8|3.0|I love the movie \\"Stop Making Sense\\" and was always frustrated that so little of the music was available on the soundtrack album.  When I saw this CD on Amazon, my heart soared.  After listening to it a half dozen times or so, I have to say it is somewhat of a disappointment.  The music is far inferior to the that in the movie.  The remastering has stripped a lot of the soul out of the music.  Today  I watched and listened to my old VHS tape of the movie and was blown away by how much better the music is on the tape than on this CD.  The \\"digital remastering\\" of this soundtrack has definitely watered down the music.  If you don't believe me, listen to the original version through  a good stereo.  Also, many of the songs on the CD are edited down, to the detriment of the music.  Ultimately though, these are quibbles because it is still a good album. It just could have been a lot better if it had been true to the music in the original movie.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|To be honest, I didn't like Kelly Clarkson at all prior to this CD. The first time I heard \\"Never Again\\" sold me as a fan. When the CD came out, I was never happier I bought it. Every song is good and \\"Sober\\" is probably one of my favorite songs in the world. I heard little to nothing on the radio from this album which is disappointing considering how good it is. Definately a refreshing change from the same R&B crap that plays over and over again. I now am going to have to buy another copy of the CD because the one I have is scratched and worn from listening to it too much. Buy the CD!!!
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Persuasion is the story of a second chance at love.  The two main characters are meeting again years after a painful breakup. Much of the dramatic appeal comes from the fact that the friends and family surrounding them seem oblivious to the pain each is suffering. This BBC production is only an hour and a half long, which obviously means it has to leave some details from the book out (and actually changes a couple of points).      I own three different versions of Persuasion and I love this one because of the passion shown between the two characters, but it is the one farthest from the actual classic novel by Jane Austen.  However, it is definitely worth the money for the high entertainment value.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I wish I could give this release five stars.   Unfortunately, Disney decided this was a movie on-par with the other bargain films that is made up of mostly their disastrous 70s films.    Anchor Bay did a much better job with the release of this film.   Their version had nicer menus, cover art that was pulled from the original theatrical poster, and even a card inside of the unedited theatrical poster.  The big drawback was that it was not a 16×9 transfer (Disney had such little faith in DVD back then that they licensed a lot of films out to Anchor Bay for release and forced their distaste in 16×9 transfers onto the third-party companies).    Here, we get the Fairuza Balk introduction and interview and TV spots from the Anchor Bay release.   In addition, we get  a 16×9 transfer this time.    This film, though, is VERY dirty.   It's in need of some TLC.   Dusts and scratches are everywhere.  Maybe we'll get the love it deserves on a Blu-Ray release - if such a thing ever happens.  On top of that, there are some making-of documentaries from the film's release that could easily have been added without too much more work.  Seeing how they fit somebody into Tik-Tok and Dorothy & Friends sliding down those tracks during the filming of their escape from Mombi are some of my earliest memories of TV watching as a child.    Now, for the movie.   It is based more on what Oz is than the MGM film.  Oz was a fairyland, but it was a bit gruesome at times.  They gave us a real Oz.    Fairuza Balk is, so far, my favorite Dorothy -- one of the few to be the right age for Dorothy, too.      However, the big complaint I have are elements that forced people to compare it to the MGM film.   Three major elements invented for that musical return to Oz:  people and elements in Kansas appear as characters in Oz, Ruby slippers, and ending up all being a dream.    While it's fine for people and elements in Kansas to parallel Oz, the other points are too big of a change when you try to do things faithfully.  Just take [[ASIN:B00005JO4H The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]] for example.   People in Kansas returned as people in Oz.  But they stayed true with the Silver Slippers and ending it as a real place and not a dream.    In a way, trying to bring the elements of two books doesn't do much better for the knowledge of the books.  Mombi is actually a lot more of Princess Langwidere with only a few elements of Mombi left intact.  Tik-Tok has a bit of Omby Amby thrown in to make him the Royal Army of Oz.  Probably for simplicity, Ozma is never Tip.    Still, I love this film as it is the best example of Oz on film yet.  Especially since things such as Tim Burton's Oz television series  keep getting lost forever.    I'd love to see somebody that cared for the books to take the time to translate the 14 Baum Oz books into film faithfully...   however, I'm sure nobody will ever try it in the foreseeable future.
B000068FUS|3.0|Good concept double disc. Personally dont think it is as good as some of their other stuff, which is great.
0143038419|2.0|Yes, this is a memoir. Yes, she's a good writer. But the book is irritating because I find very little in it to inspire the reader. I, like several others, see in the writing a self-consciousness in the trip that ties back to the book advance. Many times I wanted to just shake her and tell her to grow up and take responsibility for her life and seek some satisfaction and meaning by moving beyond herself. But perhaps, I already have the quiet mind that she mentions, and don't need to spend a year pursuing it.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I finally was ready to upgrade my VHS copies of the trilogy.  I found the DVD collection at Amazon.com, and the price/delivery charges were perfect.  I spent less, with price and shipping, than I would pay at any store.  The Amazon \\"free shipping\\" is a great deal, and I was finally able to take advantage of it.  I had the product about a week after ordering.
B000P0J0G0|4.0|Overall, this show is very enjoyable.  Some sketches are really silly and so absured (Derek Nippl-e, anyone?!), that you laugh quite hard watching them.  My favourite parts of the show were the musical numbers with Hugh Laurie, and the endings of the last two series with Stephen Fry mixing up cocktails and dancing hilariously as Laurie plays the piano.    As far as my ratings go:  Even though I'm a huge fan of British comedy, and that's basically all I buy in way of DVD collections, I found this one a bit hard to understand being a Yank and all.  This show was on air when I was about six years old as well, so I'm not sure if it's a cultural or time-lapse difference that makes certain sketches go over my head.      For a collection of four DVDs, the price is quite heafty as well.  For about the same price, you can find the 8-disk Jeeves & Wooster series in Amazon's \\"new & used\\" section.  What would have made the boxed set worth the price would have been a collection packed with extras (left-over sketches, bloopers, behind-the-scenes stuff, etc).  Though, the one extra this set did have was the Cambridge University Footlights Review Special that aired on the BBC featuring early works by Fry & Laurie.  This special is quite hilarious, and Stephen Fry shines, in my opinion, during a seven-minute monologue simply titled, \\"The Letter\\".  Very witty stuff, indeed!
B000YENUI6|4.0|**** 2007. Directed by David Cronenberg. One nomination for the Oscars (Viggo Mortensen) and three nominations for the Golden Globes. A nurse discovers the world of the Russian mob in London when she starts to read the diary of a dead 14 years old prostitute. The description of the peculiar world of the Russian mobsters and the characters played by Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel should lead you to see this very violent film of the Canadian master. Recommended.

1594489505|5.0|I've read a lot of books in my lifetime, and this is definitely up there as one of my favorites.  Hands down, i thought this book was a lot better than Hussein's first book, \\"The Kite Runner\\".  This book keeps your attention from beginning to end, and you honestly don't want to put it down.  I didn't want it to end, and I was sad when it did!  The book has everything, war, love, women's rights, communism, ethnic struggles, poverty, etc.  In other words, all the makings of an interesting read.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|its hard not to love this movie, the twist in this story is so marvelous, you are sitting and watching the life of a man be ruined for 15 years. the ultimate revenge, and then not only is he forced to find who has caused him so much pain, but he is also forced to find out why. its a mind twisting and mind bottling experience!
0800177363|5.0|I have not seen this movie in years but when i did see it i think i saw it on hbo. This is such a great movie it is great for the whole family to enjoy and also it is based on a real life story. This is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!! GREAT MOVIE EASY FIVE STAR!!!!!!!!
0920236162|5.0|Really, who could complain about this book?  My only problem is that it isn't longer!  I was happy to buy this book for my daughter, as a reminder that looking good and being good aren't at all the same thing.  We have enough books to tell our daughters to sit back and wait for a prince to come and rescue them.  I have nothing against princes in general, but sometimes, even princes are bums.      Elizabeth knows this and teaches our daughters about their own power.  Hurrah, Elizabeth - you are a princess of the highest order, singed hair and all!
B000TEUSJU|3.0|I remember watching Caligula in the movies many, many years ago and falling in love with the actress that portrays Drusilla, Caligula's sister - Teresa Ann Savoy. The movie, I dare say, is somewhat linear in a bad way. By that I mean, there is no crescendo. No high before the fall. It's just sick humor followed by grotesque deaths, surrounded by sex. In a nutshell, the plot is about this ordinary guy, loosely related to royalty, that suddenly becomes ruler of the known world. Caius Caligula, the adopted son of the Emperor Tiberius Ceaser, fearing he is to be killed by the man who killed his family, strikes first and becomes the new Ceaser in one swift stroke. Young and cocky, he plays with his new power by first taunting, later humulating the Senate and the army in a series of ludricous acts. When his sister Drusilla, the only voice of reason he is willing to listen to dies, he really cuts loose. Seen as having gone mad, Caligula, his wife and child are inevitably killed by roman soldiers in a conspiracy lead by the Senate.<br /><br />The Imprial Edition is a 3 DVD set that offers two versions of the movie, the normal comercial release and another that would have a corrected editing (text inside comments that the original movie was edited out of what should have been the correct order). There's little difference between the two. There is also an assortment of extra material, including various outtakes, picture galleries and some very intresting interviews both filmed at the time of shooting the movie and recent.<br /><br />My thoughts regarding the movie is that it fails in it's attempt to portray pagen Rome as it states. I have no problems with the sex and orgies. Sex is part of what we are as people. Part of our way of life, like eating or defecating. Such hang-ups do not distract me. But filming people working naked, mallot in hand breaking rocks is not reality. It's just for show (or shock). This is not real life, simply put. Watching Bob Guccione stating in interview that the main concern was accuracy in portraying paegan Rome is a joke.<br /><br />It could be suggested, that the movie would probably be less controversal, less sex-explicit and more directed to the story, if Guccione was not involved. Having said that, the movie would certainly not have the sets and costumes, let alone the great actors, without Guccione's financial involvment either. One can only wonder how the real movie, as conceived by either the screenwriter or director could have been. The finished product is neither.<br /><br />It is probably clear to you by now that this is not a movie directed towards family entertainment. Though I wouldn't call it porn (it fails on that too), it most certainly is adult entertainment, much in the same way as Emmanuele or Story of O.<br /><br />I would suggest this movie for students of the art of film making. The sets and costumes are gorgeous and very well put together. The filming itself is very well done (choise of angles/camera positioning, lighting, contrasts). Some may find that the image and sound may not be top for today's standards but they are very good just the same. And the main reason why a movie that fails on so many levels is still topic of discussion in a serious way. This movie contains excelent acting!<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell is brilhant! He is completly convincing and has my utmost admiration for pulling off a very difficult acting part that done wrong, would make the movie fall flat on it's face. He is the main reason why Caligula isn't just a bad porn flick. Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud are as good as you would expect them to be, though they take part only of the first third of the movie. Helen Mirren, so young and so sexy is a treat. She, along with John Steiner who plays Longinus, help Malcom carry the movie the rest of the way. And then there is Teresa Ann Savoy. When she is on the screen, it's hard to notice anything else. She may not be a great actress, but she is convincing enough.And she is just soooo beautiful in this picture!!! A first class boner with a face of an angel and a figure of a Goddess. Pity there is no interview with her included. I hear she is happily married and a mom nowadays. Good for her.<br /><br />To be truely complete, this so called Imperial Edition should have included Gore Vidal's original screenplay and Tinto Brass' italian edition of the movie (that's right, there's still another version out there hidden somewhere in Italy), which is said to be considerably different from the one that was screened in theatres around the world. I know I for one would be curious to see this Italian version.e!!! A first class boner with a face of an angel and a figure of a Goddess. Pity there is no interview with her included.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|In I AM LEGEND, New York City is a barren, apocalyptic landscape that has reverted to a wild and natural landscape where only one man, Robert Neville (Will Smith) hunts and lives. Years earlier a cure for cancer was developed by changing the structure of a virus. The cure was heralded throughout the world until the virus begins to mutate and begins a plague. New York City is quarantined, but Neville stays behind in an attempt to find a cure. Years later, except for his faithful dog, he is still alone. He spends his days hunting for survivors, gathering supplies, and trying to find a cure. But that's only during the day. Before evening, he returns to his home and barricades himself in for the night. For at night, the people that have been infected by the plague and are still alive come out of hiding, seeking for flesh to eat and blood to drink. These mutated zombie-vampires are hungry and not only want to find Neville to eat him, but to seek vengeance for what they have become. As the movie unfolds, it becomes a cat and mouse race as Neville attempts to outwit the creatures and find a cure before they find his home and destroy humanity's only hope.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND is loosely based upon the classic vampire short story of the same name by Richard Matheson. Other than the main character's name and the general exposition of the plot, I AM LEGEND is unlike the original story. Fans of the story (myself included) might be disappointed by the adaptation. Yet, despite straying from the source material, I AM LEGEND works really well as movie in its own right. The ending of the film does seem rushed and is very different from the ending of the story, yet the overall spirit of the book is intact and the ending of the film makes it clear that Robert Neville is a hero to be admired, a legend.<br /><br />I enjoyed I AM LEGEND. Will Smith is a very talented actor and I usually enjoy watching him on screen. I really liked Richard Matheson's original story, and though I was disappointed by certain aspects of the book's latest adaptation, I thought the filmmakers did a great job in making a good and solid movie that stays true to the spirit of the original story. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the film that was composed of almost entirely Bob Marley music.<br /><br />Recommended for Will Smith fans, people who like vampire and zombie movies, and anyone who just likes a good dramatic-adventure/sci-fi movie.appointed by certain aspects of the book's latest adaptation, I thought the filmmakers did a great job in making a good and solid movie that stays true to the spirit of the original story.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Once in a while, a film comes along, totally unexpectedly, and reveals itself as not just a great film but one that renews your faith in cinema and stays with you long after it has ended. One that shows that film can be the most worthy art form and one which makes you realise this is what the best of cinema really is - intelligent, substantial and made with integrity without employing silly melodramatic contrivances. The Lives of Others is such a film, undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen in the last decade, an intelligent study of a cold, emotionally stern man who undergoes an emotional awakening and humanizing effect by slowly becoming aware of the richness of life that is eluding his own austere existence.     The man in question is Gerd Weisler, a Stasi officer in East Germany in the mid 1980's. He's distrusting and quietly imposing, stands by the socialist ideals of his government and is determined to uncover political dissent wherever possible. He is simply a cog in the regime. There is nothing to warm to, no personality, individuality or life in him. He's a robot worker and nothing else. That is until he is called upon to spy on an artist couple in their apartment who may or may not be up to something. We first see Wiesler's distrust of the writer in an early scene, a distrust based on nothing more than a gut feeling - or perhaps from a twang of jealousy of this man's obvious contentment and fulfillment. To Wiesler, he is simply \\"arrogant\\" and so must be a cause for concern. I don't need to go into any more detail about the plot here but needless to say it paves the way for some moments of high tension and clever plot devices.      However, it's what happens to Wiesler's character throughout that really pushes the buttons and makes for such a lasting impression. His transformation from perpetrator to defector, from hunter to protector. During his surveillance mission, he hears everything the couple say and do, mechanically jotting down every last detail in a notebook and then typing up reports. And so he begins to experience the couple's life vicariously and slowly starts to realise that he wants, needs what they have and that he doesn't - friends, love, beauty, fulfillment. We see him start to change, to restrain himself in situations where he would usually impose himself, we see wonderful key moments where he displays acts of kindness and reveals emotions we didn't think he would be capable of. He ends up surprising us, redeeming himself by risking his career and life for the artists, by calmly deflecting the suspicions of his wily superiors about his integrity to the cause, protecting the inevitably tragic couple from above like some personal guardian angel completely unbeknownst to them, who have no idea they are even under surveillance.    Such a character study would be nothing without a great actor and Ulrich Mühe plays the role perfectly, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing it (what a real shame he passed away recently). His role recalls that of Billy Bob Thornton's in The Man Who Wasn't There, someone who hardly says two words but expresses everything beautifully through his body language and facial expressions. We see him in many different states during the course of the film; from a sometimes menacing and ice cold authoritative instructor and interrogator for the Stasi through to a simple menial state postal worker, allowing time to pass him by as he plods along on his route. He is always believable and an interesting character to watch unfold. The rest of the acting is also first rate, especially from Wiesler's Stasi superiors.    Despite the obvious differences, I would sum up The Lives of Others as a The Shawshank Redemption for this decade because of its significant emotional arc. It has a beautifully controlled, unrushed poetic approach and you get the feeling that the filmmaker (also a debut) has put all he has into it, has fashioned it with a lot of care and attention. You could also say that like Shawshank, it follows a man's escape from an oppressive and dehumanising regime to become human once again. Also, the happy ending is perfectly understated and although Wiesler doesn't exactly end up finding happiness, he's afforded a sort of standing ovation at the end and his final words in the film will certainly bring a lump to your throat. You'll want to pat him on the back and shake his hand. An unsung hero given and appreciating the recognition he deserves.
B0012BTBQU|3.0|Like many others, I came to this this book because the author has been selected to complete the Wheel of Time series following the death of Robert Jordan. Based on all the 5-star reviews I read here at Amazon, I expected a lot more. In fact, I had to stretch to reach 3 stars for my rating. The ending saved the book for me. Up until then it was not one I could recommend.     The real questions, as always, are whether I will recommend this to friends (yes, with caveats) and whether I'll follow up by reading the second book in the series (haven't decided yet).     PROS:  - a creative new world of magic  - a satisfying ending with unexpected plot twists    CONS:  - Vin and Sazed are the only two characters who are even remotely interesting, and it takes 200 pages or so for them to start being developed.  - the plot is amateurish for the first 450 or so pages.  - the dialogue and the character interactions don't pass the reality test, a fault which he shares with most other authors.    Of course, I can't help comparing Mr. Sanderson to Robert Jordan, and that's unfair to a young man writing only his 2nd book. Hopefully his experience in trying to get into the mind and mold of Jordan will enhance his own writing skills.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|First, I think people need to refine their review tactics. Many people freely give movies 4 or 5 stars. That should not be. 4 or 5 star movies should only be movies of superb quality. Rotten Tomatoes awards this movie with a 94%. The end result, for me, was a very disappointing and misleading review.    This movie is not the worst movie in the world but for the sole reason of it being dull and boring, it deserves 1 or 2 stars. I thought the acting in the movie was horrible. There were hardly any emotions in the movie. One guy, Jasper, gets shot 3 times before he dies. Each time he gets shot he says \\"pull my finger.\\" Most people would be in pain, but that is just me. Additionally, the movie itself was just dragged out. It does not help that hardly anything was explained. A town world full of terrorism and infertility? Well how did this occur and why?     I was also disappointed, as some indicated, that this plot was very straight forward and did not go into the direction many \\"1 star reviewers\\" wanted it to go. In fact, this movie was almost a rip off of Escape from New York. Escape from New York reserved Manhattan for prisoners. In return, a lot of chaos and destruction occurred there. The story then focuses on the president being held hostage by prisoners and will only release him if all of the prisoners are pardonend. In other words they are trying to get out.     Children of Men starts off with a corrupted city. Perhaps they did not want to talk about it in depth because it would become reminiscent to Escape from New York. However, it is similar in that a lady has a baby, something no other woman can have. Likewise, a particular group is aware of this and wants to steal the baby for politcal gain. The same concept that they, too, want to escape the hell hole.     Finally, at the end of the movie all of the terrorism briefly stops as the woman with her child walks through the town. A good ending? I think it is contradicting. Everyone would potentially want that baby so they, too, could better their lives. I doubt they would stare in amazement. Also their is a point where Clive Owen and several other invididuals are wanted for killing officers. At one point they are being transported on a bus. The police sees all of them but does nothing. However, later one, a landlord recognizes them and attempts to turn them in. How could the police totally miss them? A major flaw. Especially with the updated technology they have in the movie.    I would recommend Escape from New York instead. Just imagine the president being a woman with a baby, and you have seen this movie.
B000XCZGV8|4.0|David Fincher should make movies more often. Whatever the reason for the wait, we cannot afford to wait 5 or 6 years between projects for a director who is one of the guys who gets it, one of the guys who understands the intrinsic nature of storytelling with film, one of the guys who is not afraid to use that understanding in the service of bold and original filmmaking. Not that Zodiac is quite the masterpiece that people will claim Seven and Fight Club to be, but it is still pretty damn good.      Because he so dilligently follows the facts of the case, there is less opportunity for the serial-killer intensity of his earlier work. Zodiac is certainly a docu-drama, but one made with an attention to detail and narrative pacing that are characteristic of Mr. Fincher. But here he focuses more on the procedures of both the police and the journalists who track the killer, so that the violence, though powerfully presented, never overwhelms the piece. The acting is uniformly excellent, but the spotlight lands mostly on Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey, Jr., and Mark Ruffalo, as the three most involved or obsessed with Zodiac.      Because of the script's fealty to the reality of the case, in that no suspect was ever charged with any of the murders, the ending will seem to many anti-climactic. The facts do not provide the capture, trial or killing of the criminal the way good fiction might, with a juicy, satisfying climax, but if it is indeed the path and not the destination, then Zodiac provides a rich, fascinating journey for the viewer.

B00104QSOM|5.0|Loosely based upon the novel OIL by Upton Sinclair, writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a portion of Sinclair's original story and makes it his own in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, a movie about greed, oil, power, and duplicity.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the life of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis).  For the first fifteen minutes of the movie, not a word is spoken.  The audience watches as Plainview seems to be mining for gold, but is instead ultimately looking for oil.  He slowly continues digging for black gold, eventually pulling it out from the ground one bucket at the time.  Time progresses and a small crew is added.  Tragedy strikes the crew and the baby of one of the workers is left orphaned.  Plainview takes the child and adopts the boy as his own to use as a prop as he travels across the country asking people to let him mine their oil for them.<br /><br />Years later in 1911, Plainview is approached by a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano).  Sunday is from a small community called Little Boston and he tells Plainview that there is so much oil in his hometown that it seeps out of the ground when it rains.  In exchange for some money, he shows Plainview the location of the land and disappears from the story.  Plainview and H.W.(Dillon Freasier), his son, investigate the land and discover that what Paul said was indeed true.  Without mentioning Paul, Plainview befriends the Sunday family and impresses upon them what he wants to do and how important it is.  At first the family isn't impressed, particularly Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), but after listening to Plainview's eloquent speech and being satisfied that the new industry will benefit not only the town but Eli's church, the family agrees and promises to get the other townspeople together for a meeting.  As the drilling for the oil commences, so, too, does the power struggle between Eli and Daniel.  They both are greedy and hunger for power, but use very different means and arenas to obtain it.<br /><br />The final portion of the film fastforwards to 1927, allows the audience to see what has become of the majors characters, and gives the story an incomplete coda.  Daniel is wealthy beyond one's imagination, but is so eaten up by suspicion, hatred, and greed that he disowns H.W.  Meanwhile, Eli has become an internationally known preacher, but has almost become as corrupt as Daniel.<br /><br />The acting in THERE WILL BE BLOOD is astonishing.  Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game, which is saying a lot for a man who sometimes takes years to study for a role and immerse himself into the character.  Day-Lewis offered the strongest performance of the year and well deserved the Best Actor Oscar he received.  Paul Dano also gives a wonderful performance, and even though he was overlooked by the Academy, he should have at least been nominated for a Supporting Actor award.  Day-Lewis had over a year to study for his role, but Dano was cast as Eli Sunday after shooting on the film had already begun.<br /><br />Another component of THERE WILL BE BLOOD that I really enjoyed was the score by Johnny Greenwood.  The music in the film is full of dissonance, which reflects the inner turmoil of the characters beneath the cool exteriors and posing relationships they have with each other.  The music screeches and shrieks, yet like the Sirens' call there is something mysteriously enchanting about it.<br /><br />THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a dark and sometimes disturbing drama about greed, power, duplicity, and ultimately murder.  Cinematically the film is comparable the CITIZEN KANE, but the two movies are very different.  KANE offers the story of a man corrupted by power who had some redeeming characteristics, but THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the story of a man consumed by evil with no redeeming characteristics.  I am reminded of Macbeth and the story told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Though it might not signify anything, even an idiotic story can be an entertaining one.

B000JJSRNY|5.0|This rather amazing outdoor concert area near Berlin was the site for this marvelous  DVD of Anna Neyrebko, Rolando Villazon, and Placido Domingo singing well known  opera arias. I gave it 5 stars.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|I greatly enjoyed Perfume.  It was well cast, well acted, well written and the sets were astounding.  But what really won me over was the fantastic subtext that developed as the story went on.    Sure, there's a \\"to catch a killer\\" aspect to the film which, on it's own is enjoyable to see played out.  But there is so much more being said in this film.  Paris is depicted as a city of two classes.  One, a filth-ridden cesspool of poverty.  The other, a wealthy exclusive minority who at once co-exist with the filthy poor and at the same time pretend they don't exist.      The rich can't help but see AND smell how awful conditions are for the poor masses, but cannot be bothered to consider the injustice of it while living their lives of excess and privelige.  Perfume, very much a staple of upper class fashion, is a vehicle for this social denial in the film.  A luxury available only to the wealthy, perfume is a way to \\"cover up\\" the unpleasant social truth that exists all around the them.    One of the invisible poor is the main character of the film.  Gifted with a special talent, he becomes determined, (in his twisted way) to break through his purgatory of invisibility and capture the distilled olfactory essence of human beauty itself.  His mission leads him naturally to target, infiltrate and affect the world of the wealthy.  He doesn't do this by pretending to be one of them though. Instead he uses his invisibility to his advantage, much the way a virus might infiltrate a body undetected, then make it sick.  There is a social class subtext at work here that should not be missed.    Toward the end of the film, the plot takes an unexpected turn.  Not a gimmicky M. Night turn, but a fascinating one that transcends even noble social commentary.  It offers a messianic connotation that actually adds further depth to the story and leaves you with much to discuss and consider.  Overall, a great watch.  But if you just view this film as a period serial killer tale, you've missed a lot.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Most people will have a knee-jerk reaction to Shortbus within about a minute of hitting 'play'. There are scenes of unsimulated sex & similarly awkward references to homosexuality, drugs, etc. that a lot of people just aren't really comfortable with.    However, if you can overcome that (and hopefully, as adults, most people can) and appreciate the movie for what it is, you'll find that Shortbus is, at its core, a funny, endearing, clever, entertaining, and innovative movie. It's definitely not for the kids, but neither are most action or adult comedy movies.    I felt a little uncomfortable watching this movie in the living room while my male roommates could hear and see some of what was going on, and wasn't sure how I felt about the movie. As I re-watched it though I realized that what I'd bought was really worth the money -- a unique and truly entertaining movie ripe with all the elements you'd look for in any other good film.     There is a lot of sex, and it's supposed to be unsimulated, but it's not ALL sex, and it's not porn. The comedy, drama, and philosophy are somehow interwoven into those scenes just as they are with the others, and after a viewing or two you'll be able to watch the movie from end to end without flinching, 'cos you'll understand what the movie is really about.    If you can get past seeing some naked people and aren't a gay-hater, then give this movie a shot, because it really is worth seeing.
B00003CXFV|4.0|Erin Brockovich is an exciting, motivating, movie for all people who might need a confidence boost. This is a movie about a young average woman searching for jobs to help raise her family. It has both physical and mental thoughts. If you are looking for a genuine movie, this is a great movie for you to watch as Erin works as a lawyer helping people sue a poisoning water company.    As the movie begins we watch as Erin Brockovich begins searching hopelessly but excited for jobs. The first job interviewer does not say anything to her after her interview, that's probably a no. As the movie continues Erin begins searching even for more jobs, as for one day she gets hit by a car and gets a lawyer. Of course the defendants' lawyer has to try and annoy Erin to get the truth out of her. Erin ends up not winning and because of her loss she demands her lawyer for a job. At first he says no but then he gives her a chance and that's when Erin's job search finally ends. As her first case she investigates about a contaminated water company PG & E. At first no one believes her when she tells them that the water they drink, bathe in, and  swim in, is contaminated with an illegal chemical chromium 6. Later on all of her clients start coming to her with information and things that have been happening to their families. Finally they start believing that it is not just for the money.    Later   on watching the movie it disappoints me how it never shows much scenes of Erin in Trial with the company. For example, it shows a scene with a judge but then it goes to another scene immediately. It was pointless when the movie took  me from one place to another. For example, when Erin was done arguing with one of her clients about how all she is trying to do is help , it skips all the way back to her job scene. Another thing I disliked was that the ending was practically clichéd it was as if...\\"and they lived happily ever after\\". For example, the ending was that something good happens and thenit just shows how how she keeps on going to other towns solving cases about the PG & E company.    Obviously between all these scenes, I did enjoy how this movie was unique, it did not copy of other stories or have its crazy ups and downs scenes. Also this is a very realistic/inspiring movie, (its based on a true story). This can happen again anywhere in the world. For example, there could be another lawyer or person investigating about something that is harming and affecting humans and getting paid for it. Another thing is that I loved whenever she had something negative come by, she still didn't give up and stop the case.    If you are looking for a good heart felt movie, this is the movie for you. It is filled with good confidence thoughts and messages. It had many real life objectives. Erin Brockovich is a genuine movie.
1416524800|5.0|Compared to Browns more famous ones, this is a more traditional book. However, it is a book that really stands out. I spent several hours on the beaches of Cuba reading this, and my plan of bringing a book that would last the entire vacation failed. It was a boring flight home...
0609610570|4.0|This book is worthwhile for Fortune 500 CEO types, but is less applicable to the average person trying to get the most of his or her day. When I picked up this book I was hoping that it addressed the everyday execution that small companies/law firms, etc struggle with in today's business world. But that is not the case. This book is from CEO types for CEO types with little useful information regarding the individual's struggle to get anything done in his or her hectic life. If that's what you're looking for, this is not the book for you. The book is not bad, it is just that few of us help operate large multinational public corporations in which much of the strategies suggested in this book relate to.
0156012197|1.0|The original Katherine Woods translation of this book is wonderful. This new translation by Richard Howard doesn't come close. Look for the original translation in used book stores or veiw it online. Some things should never be redone. This redo is the literary equivalent of the Michael Bolton version of Percy Sledge's \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\". If, by reading this review, just one person ends up reading the Katherine Woods translation instead of the one by Richard Howard, I will consider the time it took to write it well spent.
6305736650|5.0|We watched this for the first time, and I must say, it exceeded our expectations.  It had many twists and turns, and the ending was just genius!  Well shot, acted and written.  A great one to add to any colllection.  Wish they still made them like that. (It was filmed during WWII, and the story takes place during the same period.  Thought it was interesting to watch a moving depicting real time events.)
B00005R2IS|4.0|At this point Mad Max is simply a post apocalyptic classic film.  While some people may not enjoy the movie through and through, I don't think that statement is very much contested.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fairly old film from today's perspective and its filming style shows that.  I think in perspective this movie was pretty on point for what people were thinking about at that time.  I mean when you think about it, the Cold War was still going strong and each country was trying to out power the other in terms of military might.  So the greatest concern at that time was a nuclear war and \\"Mad Max's\\" setting takes place shortly after such a catastrophic event.<br /><br />It's pretty interesting to watch because it gives a pretty interesting \\"what if\\" scenario if technology and development stopped in the late 1970's.  So you never had the internet boom and the age of the computer in the 90's.  It's kind of cool when you try to picture this scenario.  The places it's most apparently are in the hospital and the kinds of cars they are using.  Despite this downfall it seems like everyone has custom vehicles and most are designed with a sports car in mind.  In the hospital scenes it reminds me of the film version of \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" because the hospital areas just seemed too archaic by today's standards.<br /><br />In Mad Max the world is still trying to hold on to the small vestiges of society that it can.  Lawlessness is at a whole new level and it seems that the court systems run amok similar to our current ones.  Basically the main premise for the film is that Mel Gibson plays a cop named Max who is effectively terrorized by a biker gang indirectly at first, but then very directly as the movie moves on.  The gang has this bizarre spiritually violent ethos, where the main member Nightrider was a key messenger of this philosophy... or at least that's how I'm interpreting his role.  The police sort of have a hand in this man's death so another member of the gang, Toecutter, comes after them.  Nightrider's death is what sparks the turmoil and brings the gang into town to wreak their havoc.<br /><br />It's really kind of a tragic tale when you think of it as a whole, but that's kind of the point.  Max is a tragic character that gets pushed to the absolute extreme on every end.  However, I think during this film they didn't truly know what direction they wanted to bring Mel's character and I feel that direction was finally found in \\"The Road Warrior.\\"  However, \\"Mad Max\\" is still fairly essential in order to get into Max's background and why he is so angry.  There is a slight discontinuity between the two films though, because at the end of this one he still has contact with some semblance of civilization and in \\"Road Warrior\\" it's all wastelands.<br /><br />While \\"Mad Max\\" can seem a bit dry at times because it's mostly cars racing around on highways, it does set the stage for a very influential film (I feel at least) in the future.  While authors were setting the stage for post apocalyptic worlds, \\"Mad Max\\" set the stage for a lawless and harsh reality, unlike \\"1984\\" where the war pushed society to much stricter controls.  I think this is the type of movie people should at least see once, at the very least for nostalgic purposes, because it does not have nearly the same re-watch value as the sequel.after them.

While most Singh books can seem a bit boring when you read the synopsis (can a book about codes really be interesting??), this is not the case. He has a wonderfull way of explaining complicated things in an understandable way. I will also highly recommend \\"Fermat's enigma\\" and \\"Big bang\\".
B000WMFZNS|5.0|A long time hard to find classic movie now available for western markets, previously released at Asia, and Spain.  I agree with Maltin, one of the finest performances of Charlton Heston. It`s a shame that in the time of producton of the movie was not recorded in Ancient Spanish, the only one civilized way to listen to it, or at least spoken in spanish of Spain, NOT the latinamerican spanish, that will not work for this particular movie. BUT the movie by itself, it`s magnificent, the extra features of the DVD well produced, the package of the Deluxe Collector`s Edition beautufully done, lobby cards included.  Based upon \\"EL CANTAR DEL MIO CID\\" the oldest literary work in spanish language, written in ancient spanish on the left page, and in modern spanish on the right page,  an obligatory reading book in high school, for any spanish born speaker.   \\"EL CID\\" Starring the legendary Charlton Heston as Don Ruy (Rodrigo) Díaz de Vivar, and Sophia Loren as Doña Ximena.

B0009SS00A|4.0|I would give this book a five star rating had it not been that I have to compare it to Dan Brown's other book. In itself, I found this really exciting, but with the expectations set high after reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Deamons\\" it did not meet the grade. However, this might be an unfair comparison, and I would highly recommend it.    As a little twist, I recommend reading Simon Singh's \\"The Code Book\\" first. This is an even better book, and will give you a deeper understanding of Brown's book. Not that you need a deep understanding of a book like this...

All PE teachers should purchase this book and give it to their administrators and school board members.
032147404X|5.0|Like the title says, it was very helpful. Lots of useful tips of the trade and I really enjoyed how it was written. Each page is a new tip and written like you were out on a shoot with him and were asking questions. He lays things out as if he were just telling you how to do it, not necessarily going into details about how it works, but what steps to take to get the shot. Great book for beginners, I highly recommend it.

Albee's witty and profound dialoge is perfectly paired with brilliant performances.      Where do we draw the line?  When do dreams and reality collide?  When does one take over the other?      Well worth the price, a film you will want to approach with care and thought.

She has wonderful advice that is structured but not strict and she takes into account different parent and child personalities.  She has a charming writing style that makes you feel like you are getting advice from the sweetest mother possible who has successfully raised an entire school of children!  I highly recommend this book and its companion for infants to every mom.  Just ask my friends!
0452289963|2.0|This book and philosophy may have some merits and could even be life changing for individuals who buy into it's advice. I think that there are many chapters that have practical applications for those that are open to them. The problem that I have is with the assumption that this attempts to have a degree of sway on the earth and world culture as a whole especially with Ophra power and the web series. The primary gobblers of this material are American's and I guess Europeans. In order for Tolle's theories to work regarding enemies and war in particular, he should peddle his wares in the middle east first (not going to happen) and get those folks to change which would be a feat in and of itself. I swear that as soon as Tolle get's the Islamo Facists to let go of their ego's and give up thier arms against the west that I to will let my guard down and embrace the rest of the world. If the people on my block follow the advice in this book, well that's great but if the people protecting the country buy in as O would have them do, well then we are in for scary ride. I hope that this book inspires people from sea to shining sea but much of the hyped awaking and classes are a waste unless they can get the bad people to buy in first! Take it for what it is worth as a self help book and please do not try to apply it beyond it's capabilities of possibly helping the wounded western individual.

B000ZLFALI|2.0|As a musical theatre junkie, as well as a Beatles fan, I expected to fawn all over this dvd.    I was bitter by the time this was over.    There is something off with the sound quality; every time they open thier mouths to sing, it sounds fake and dubbed to the extreme.    The story is poorly sewn together, all in all I found this movie uninteresting and inorganic.      A movie about hippies should feel natural.    The musical numbers were well-produced, but all in all this movie is worth passing up.    You want a good musical about the 60s?  Try \\"Hair\\".    [[ASIN:0792841638 Hair]]
B00005JPLW|3.0|You really have to go into this film with the mindset that the story is being told from the Spartan viewpoint.  I will give it 3 stars for some of the battle sequences, but it's hard to get passed how poorly the Persian Empire was portrayed.  I see a lot of people dismissing this as \\"just entertainment\\" and such, but's there was certainly an agenda being force fed to the audience here.  The Persians were shown as mutants who lured in a traitor with the promise of sex and riches...while the Spartans are always depicted as fierce warriors in the name of \\"freedom.\\"  I can't pan it with 1 star simply due to the nice screenplay, however, the political agenda was laughably easy to detect.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|I first noticed Kanye from Late Registration, well let me go further back than that. When he had the accident and did \\"All Fall Down\\". Then my daughter kept playing Big Brother, and I had to finally ask look, who is that? and she told me, I finally sat down and listened to the cd myself and I am impressed. Kanye has a good album and I love \\"Welcome to the Good Life\\",#6 \\"You Can't Tell Me Nothing\\",\\"Flashing Lights\\"(like Katrina with no FEMA, like Martin with no Gena, like a flight with no visa etc)#10 \\"Everything I Am\\",#11(the title escapes me), and the last and certainly best \\"Big Brother\\" to his mentor Jay Z.Folks may say what they will, but the fact that he just took home a couple of Grammys say that the brother has talent.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|I find it surprising that no one can hear the concept in the record that the band made with Syd. It starts with outer space bleeps and ends with infant-like duckcall sounds very much back on earth. For me the first seven trax on \\"Piper\\" are all variations on the descending riff ideas bookended by \\"Astronomy\\" and \\"Interstellar\\" and shows Syd and gang exhausting the limits of British psychedelia. The last four numbers continue the ego subversion with bucolic metaphors and metaphysics and a special whimsical humor, but all indicate acceptance and retreat and a kind of fragile humanity. The Syd story is all right here encapsulated!

0452289963|3.0|I love attempts towards world peace, but to attack fundamental, life-furthering attributes of the individual is not the way to get there.    Ego is often mistaken as sociopathological. As I differentiate, proper ego is to value oneself, versus a Social Ego, which is intended to impress others. Seeking to impress as a primary driver is certainly a neurotic pursuit; it's a dependency.    Nature offers us many patterns to assure consistent, independent moral action. Awareness of them is all that's needed; and if we're using them and benefiting, we'll be proud of our every action as we deserve to be.     I say STOP trying to wipe out the individual. No matter how beautiful the words flow, its method is slaughter. It wasn't the answer in Midieval times, and it isn't the answer now.
B00005JPOO|5.0|Penelope has finally found its opening weekend and my review is as simple as this: Go SEE it in the theatre because it is a rare, wonderful, sharply comedic and quick-moving film. Support a movie in a theatre that uses great set designs which includes art by [[ASIN:0974803200 Joe Sorren: In Celebration of Balance & Opposable Thumbs]] and includes music by Sigur R&oacute;s [[ASIN:B000AJJNPY Takk...]]. Chase scenes are not predictable. Penelope covers, in a few comical moments, what else would a person do who was confined to one house their entire life? I enjoyed the \\"who's real\\" and \\"who's fake\\" process of elimination and how one copes when you only find the latter. The characters are well-crafted and played by some of my favorite people, obviously Christina Ricci, but also minor characters played by Burn Gorman ([[ASIN:B000VWE5OY Torchwood - The Complete First Season]]), Nick Frost ([[ASIN:B000VNMMWA Hot Fuzz (3-Disc Collector's Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]]), and the ever-watchable (getting all the laughs when I saw the movie) Peter Dinklage which you've seen in [[ASIN:B0001WTWDI The Station Agent]] and [[ASIN:B0011KQSZ4 Death at a Funeral]], plus Marianne Faithfull is in it (uncredited) and she really is as great looking as I remember her from the brief appearance she made in BBC's [[ASIN:B000UNYPGM Absolutely Fabulous - Absolutely Everything]]. The story's moral is powerful: embrace individuality. It's as simple as that and I would love a poster of this phrase on every street corner to remind those people that forget to do it.
B00006I53S|5.0|This is the \\"kit\\" lens I got with my 40D. I've found that this is a great lens to use for most general purposes, especially for portrait and other \\"people taking\\" opportunities.  As everyone else has mentioned the quality, optics, etc of the lens is great and the IS feature really does work surprisingly well.  On a less than full frame sensor camera you'll may miss the wider angles provided by the other \\"kit\\" lenses (18-55mm or 17-85mm) if you're a Realtor or need to take a lot of wide angle shots (even so, 17mm times the crop factor isn't that wide), but I think this lens more than makes up for this in its utility at the telephoto end.
0778321606|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  I enjoyed reading the hobby of knitting and the friendships ; that were formed.
1594489505|5.0|I devoured this book in a weekend.  I really enjoyed The Kite Runner, but I think I preferred A Thousand Splendid Suns because the author does a better job of placing the characters within the historical context as Afghanistan goes through so many changes from the 70s to 2002.  The story begins by following the stories of two separate Afghan women, and really picks up speed when their lives intersect.  Their stories are rich and detailed, and we see how Afghan womens' lives changed from the time of the Soviets in Afghanistan, to the mujahideen fighting in the early 90s, to the takeover by the Taliban, to the fall of the Taliban following the US invasion.  The only thing missing is what has happened since the book ended as the Taliban has regained much control.  I highly recommend this book.

What is prominent about the book \\"Good to Great\\" is that it doesn't attribute corporate success to a single set of factor. Instead, it makes you think differently about the conventional wisdoms and rules of thumbs which are frequently (and falsely) associated with prominent organizations.    Collins encourages to lead with questions, not answers; to engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion; to conduct autopsies without blame; and to build red flag mechanisms that turn information into information that cannot be ignored. The concept of making tough questions was first embraced by Ronald Heifetz in his book \\"Leadership Without Easy Answers\\", but it is more focused to individuals, while \\"Good to Great\\" mostly spotlights an organization as a whole.    There is another prominent book about great companies: \\"Leading the Revolution\\" by Gary Hamel. While Hamel mostly draws attention to technology accelerators, Collins, in contrast, cautions that technology should not be regarded as a potential panacea for all that ails a company. The folly of this kind of thinking was revealed in the aftermath of the crash of the tech bubble in the early 2000s. Collins contends that the good-to-great companies approach the prospect of new and emerging technologies with the same prudence and careful deliberation that characterizes all of their other business decisions.
B000002KLG|5.0|i was 9yrs old when this album came out. all i listened to was \\"give me the night\\" and \\"love x love\\". then when i started djing i played \\"dinorah dinorah\\". so one day i found my old lp that was in so-so condition. that's when i discovered the rest. this is a timeless piece of work for george. oh, last but not least you can't overlook the awsome production work of quincy jones. still can't believe this came out in 1980.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|At my boyfriend's mom's house yesterday I finally saw the movie \\"Stranger than Fiction\\", which I wanted to see as soon as I first saw an ad for it.  I was right to want to see it, I found it to be amazing.<br /><br />The story being narrated sounded like a really good story and the way the character tries to find out what kind of a story he is in is funny and interesting.  My boyfriend's mom thought the character of the writer, played by Emma Thompson, was too strange to comprehend.  To me she seemed familiar.  The weird ways in which she tries to understand her writing and the torture of a ten-year writer's block all seems comfortable and normal to me.  I recognize myself in her as well as other writers I have known.<br /><br />The most amazing part is the idea that her character is a real person, existing in the same world that she does.  If you have not written fiction then I can probably never explain to you the feeling that the characters you are writing about are real people.  Most people, though, have at least tried writing, so maybe you do know what I mean.  They come to me almost fully formed, asking me to tell their story, to share their story with others.  I often feel on the very edge of sanity as these imaginary people speak to me and share their lives with me.  Any failing in my writing is through my own ability and not because of them.  Even if they do not exist in the same sense that you and I do, they are still real. This movie understands that.<br /><br />It also explores the interesting idea of what price artistic integrity might come at.  Is the story more important than everything else?<br /><br />I doubt that people who have never had the urge to write fiction will like this movie.  And it should be noted that this is not the typical Will Ferrel movie.  He won't be zany and weird as he is in so many other films, but he will also play his more serious role a lot better than he did in Bewitched.
B000063UR2|3.0|This was a popular 1980s fantasy film, albeit an untidy release, that went through a number of alternative cuts for the theatre and television. There seems to be a fan base that is divided over the director's cut and the US version. Both are available through this DVD release.<br /><br />Legend is fantasy. There is lots of magic and adventure. The cast constitutes mostly mythical creatures, likes elves and demons. The story is standard good versus evil, light versus darkness, that revolves around the execution of a unicorn that will end the world of light. Jack (Tom Cruise) with his magical friends must save the world and the kidnapped princess before it is too late.<br /><br />The production values move between excellent and looking staged but given the amount of fantasy on display it still manages to be a convincing world. There are not too many fantasy films so eventually everyone gets around to watching Legend. Probably the main reason to watch it is because it is a Ridley Scott production, although not one of his best. Tim Curry as the devil puts on a good performance and the makeup effects here are nothing short of stunning. There is one good horn ramming sequence that stands out.<br /><br />The film does seem to be unsure of itself at the best of times. Is it a film for children? Or is it a film for adults? It appears that even some teenagers may have trouble with this film because it does get dark at times. Parental viewing may be necessary.
0452289963|5.0|This book is not a book. It is a part of the journey from your soul that brought you and I to this work. Echart Tolle shows each and every one of us...how magnificent we truly are...free from ego.     Without the ego...every moment is magic. Every effort is precious. Every mindfulness practise is well worth the taking. The human journey for each one is a wow... WHEN you don't say so in your head.    Every chapter brought me to be more observant at how the Ego in me and the world really cunningly functions to create a pollutant and unfulfilled world that creates the little to the huge suffering....a suffering that I admit, I was enjoying....until just recent.    I am still on the journey towards true freedom. But boy... is it a wonderful journey. I'd rather the journey than the destination.
0340898917|2.0|This guy is a straight hustler, ala the carpetbaggers of the old West. Christians beware: Paul clearly warns us in 2 Timothy 3 to steer clear of nonsense like this. Just like we have to endure the ease and pleasure in this life, sometimes we may have to endure the pain and hardness as well. No one can truly predict when it will happen. But it is through endurance that we'll find salvation and strength. If you are a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ don't be hoodwinked by this New Age wordplay, you'll mess around and lose more than you stand to gain.

Before this show a very small precentage of the US even knew about him, but after Monterey he became a household name. One of the best live recordings ever. Jimi's attitude is very carefree and his personality really shines through. As a guitar player he had no equal in 1967 and this DVD proves the point well.
0452287588|1.0|I can see why a walking ego like Oprah would be drawn to a book that talks so much about the ego.  I think she should examine her inner self and try to find out how to rid it of the god complex she has.  Anyway, this has to be some of the most boring mumbo jumbo I've ever read.  The writer clearly likes to hear himself talk, or read, or whatever.  I can't believe he actually got this book published.  There must be alot of lost people out there.
1400062756|5.0|As an executive coach, I've been a fan of Carol Dweck's work for a couple decades -- it was pretty obvious she wasn't just talking about children.  Now she's finally written a book I can recommend to all my clients.  The bottom line here is that your approach to life and learning -- whether you assume one's own (and hence everyone else's) capacity for learning is fixed and permanent or fluid and expandable -- makes all the difference in both your own success and that of the people who work for and with you (not to mention the ones you raise or educate).      I've called those mindsets \\"performer\\" (focus on doing well and appearing to have no flaws) and \\"learner\\" (curiosity-driven, not concerned with how one appears to others.)  She calls them \\"fixed-ability mindset\\" and \\"growth mindset.\\"  What she's done is explore their impact in nearly every domain of life -- failure and success, education, sports, business, leadership, and relationships -- and then explore how to change from a performer to a learner.  Based on current neuroscience and her own experiences, this is one of the most practical and powerful pieces of work I've seen in a long time.
B0000256VK|4.0|Roxy Music-Avalon ****1/2<br /><br />Avalon was my first real introduction to Roxy Music. I had heard them before but never a whole album and what I heard was very early Roxy Music while Brian Eno was still in the band. Released in 1982 Avalon was one of the bands biggest albums and remains so to this day. The production work on the album is seriously breathtaking. It sounds better and more clear then most of todays albums to. On one hand you can really tell this was made during the early 1980's but on the other hand this albums sounds so fresh it could have been recorded last year.<br /><br />This collection of mostly love songs is just fantastic. 'Idia' and the albums closer 'Tara' are intrumentals but they are two of the best instrumentals ever made. Especially 'Tara' the saxophone work Andy Mackay is amazing, it really is a wonderful way to end the album. But as previously stated Avalon is a album made mostly of love songs. The albums opener 'More Than This' and 'The Space Between' show of some of Brian Ferry's most focused lyrics he had ever written. The same can be said for the albums title track 'Avalon' but whats more amazing about the song is Ferry's vocals. They are smooth as butter. The man has one of the sexiest voices in rock n' roll. 'While My Heart Is Still Beating' 'The Main Thing' and 'Take A Chance With Me' all sort of go hand in hand. They are best to be played in album form back to back to back. 'To Turn You On' contains some of Brian Ferry's best keyboard work as does 'True To Life' which had 'Tara' not been included on the album it would have made a great album closer, though I think they made a wiser deccision using 'Tara.'<br /><br />As cliche as it sounds Ferry sounds like he really means what he is singing about. You can really hear him ripping his heart to pieces over some of the tracks. As an introduction into Roxy Music I would highly reccomend Avalon especially as an introduction into the Brian Ferry dominated Roxy Music.

0765318741|1.0|If you see this BEFORE you purchase (wish I had done some checking before I purchased...) be advised the \\"I am Legend\\" story encompasses about half the boook's size...the remainder is a series of very (VERY) short stories that are completely and totally unrelated to the title of the \\"book\\", as well as to each other.  I learned after the fact that I was not the only one to be completely confused while my brain was trying to make the leap from the main story to what I had waded into after finishing \\"I am Legend.\\"  The title story itself was ok, however, had I realized I was paying for such a tiny little read I would have left it on the shelf.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I am shocked to find that a few (obviously clueless) people gave this epic a rating of 1 or 2 stars. If you didn't like this one why were you watching a western in the first place. McMurtry translates so well to the film that it appears that he only dropped the \\"he said and she saids\\". I have seen/read all of the Series with the exception of Dead Man's Walk of which I only read the book but I am ordering it now on DVD. Duvall and TLJ sum up the essence of Call and McCrae.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce Springsteen & The E. Street Band-Magic *****<br /><br />When you get right down to it, the bare basic rock n' roll, strip all the country leanings, the ol' dixie influence of albums past, the self-indulgent pop that went against everything you set out to do, and you have Magic, Springsteens most honest and true to form albums in years. Magic might be the very best album Springsteen ever released, rivaling that of even U.S.A., Darkness On The Edge Of Town, and even the legendary Born To Run. While it might not be as theme concious as those albums it does do something remarkable. Magic is a career spanning album, it has something from all that fasits of his career. Lour Arena rockers, Politicaly charged anthems, country hinged melodys, Bob Dylan meets Jack Kerouack lyrics, and a backing of one of Americas greatest rock bands, The E. Street Band.<br /><br />Opening with one of their all time greatest songs, 'Radio Nowhere' comes across as a plea by way of a neutron bomb. Homming some of his best lyrics and some of the E. Street Bands best grooves. 'You'll Be Coming Down' is what they wish they would have accomplished with The Rising.'Livin' In The Future' would have fit perfectly with The River, and gives vision to what everyone wishes they could say sometimes, \\"We're living in the future, and none of this has happened yet.\\" 'Girls In Their Summer Clothes' is one of the best songs the band has ever recorded reminding us of early Springsteen. 'Last To Die' is easily the best anti-war-in-Iraq song to ever come along. While the 'Long Walk Home' may just be the best to come along in the last ten years from anyone, one that truly has to be heard to fully appreciate.<br /><br />Magic is the album we have all been waiting for, one that we almost got with The Rising, but just came up short. Magic is easily the best Springsteen album since U.S.A., and maybe of their entire career.

B0012K1ILW|4.0|I think this album picks up where \\"Worldwide Underground\\" left off. Out of all the tracks on the album, only about 3 get me going. I say that because for the most part, this project seems to be just that...an art project, just barely finished. It's too raw and too out there to just sit and enjoy.  In one song, she talks about smoking too many trees. I think the song is \\"Me\\" and I have to say that I might need to be right there with her to smoke said trees in order to really 'get' what she's talking about. It's like I get it, but I don't. Where's the structure?<br /><br />Still, with that said, that's about my only complaint. It seeming to not be finished and not be complete and coherent for the average listener, is a small part... Overall, the album is so all over the place creatively, that I have to give props. She is so inventive and creative. It's worth having for canon's sake. I own everything she's done. I'm afraid that this one, much like \\"Worldwide\\" won't get as much play as \\"Baduizm\\" and \\"Mama's Gun\\".
B0012K1ILW|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because I LOVE Ms. Badu but I must admit...this CD is totally different from any of her other CDs.  I guess I need to listen to this one about 10 more times before I can fully understand where she is coming from with this one.  I love the song \\"Honey\\" but the rest of the CD has to grow on me.  I still love her and I already have my ticket to see her this month in Dallas.  PEACE!
B0000AI45P|5.0|Television-Marquee Moon *****<br /><br />One of those rare albums that just absolutley changed everything. Released 1977, the year punk really broke, was the album along with Patti Smith's horses and The Ramones self-titled debut album that really started the buzz about punk, even though at that time it was not called that yet. Released to instant critical aclaim but to almost no record sales Marquee Moon would go on to be one of the most important and greatest albums in all of rock n' roll history. Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd play the tag-team here where as the great Richard Hell had just left the band right before the recording of this album becuase Verlaine refused to let any of his songs on the album even turning down his soon to be classic 'Blank Generation.'<br /><br />This is an album of attitude and literary genius, opening with the odd 'See No Evil' followed by the wanna-be touching 'Venus.' Friction' may be the best song on the album, it is truly a tour de force with very typical punk lyrics of the time, and not to mention the breath taking guitar work. 'Elevation' and 'Guiding Light' open the second half of the album and well but with more soft side, a more tendor side if you will full of poetic prose, and even greater guitar. 'Prove It' is the strongest song on the second half of the album but the lyrics are a little hard to follow. 'Torn Curtain' closes the album and wonderfully. Nice and dark and slow leaving you wanting more, just what a good closer sould do.<br /><br />But perhaps the focal point of the album is it's center peice, the albums title track 'Marquee Moon' and almost ten minute song filled with Verlaines best vocals and lyrics of the entire album, and his best guitar work that he would ever record. The song is a classic and concidered to be one of the very best songs of the period along with 'Friction.'<br /><br />Now many copies of Marquee Moon come with several bonus tracks. Most of these are just demos and alternate versions of 'Marquee Moon' 'Friction' and 'See No Evil' which are all very cool to own but what is even cooler are the other bonus tracks. The inclusion of a Untitled Instrumental is incredible. One of the best instrumentals ever recorded. Also is the bands first single, one that they released before the album was released and clocking in at way over ten minutes and which originally took up both sides of the .45rpm. 'Little Johnny Jewel (parts 1&2)' is a interesting find, and one from when Hell was still in the band which makes it even cooler of a find.<br /><br />While it was looped in with the whole Punk movement, Television is much more alternative then punk, though the lyrics are often revolutionary. The jazzy leanings and use of guitar solos almost make this hard to place with punk but it is no doubt one of the very best albums of the 1970's and as time has gone on it has become one of the greatest albums of all time.No Evil' which are all very cool to own but what is even cooler are the other bonus tracks.

B0000669JL|5.0|What can I say? I just recently started listening to more and more reggae. I find that reggae at least is cool and soothing to the mind, no reggae music more so than Bob Marley and the Wailers. Legend is an outstanding cd with a collection of the master and his group at work! Again I really just started listening to reggae, and I highly recommend that this cd becomes part of your collection!
B000003TAL|4.0|Sonic Youth-Daydream Nation ****1/2<br /><br />Before my first listen to Daydream Nation was over I was wondering what they hell is going on here? This was somewhere around the song 'Candle' that I began to ask myself that. I was thinking this is one of the most intellegent and revolutionary albums  I have ever heard, but I was also thinking this is one of the strangest albums of all time, which I guess is why they call a band like Sonic Youth alternative. You see I always liked Sonic Youth, well most of their songs anyway, but I couldn't totally appreciate them at first, which to some may seem frustraiting knowing a band is great and not being able to understand why, while for me I loved that and found it highly rewarding when I finally did get it.<br /><br />Songs like that almost hit single, and album opener 'Teen Age Riot' leave no wonder as to what it is that is so amazing about Sonic Youth. This is perhaps the most commercially exceptable song that I have ever heard Sonic Youth record and yet there is still nothing commercially exceptable about it. 'The Sprawl' and 'Kissability' pure Kim Gorden songs done in that almost spoken word form that she would later become known for. 'Erics Trip' might be the best song on the album as it offers everything presented in all the other songs on the album just wrapped into one. 'Total Crash' follows 'Erics Trip' as that hardest rocker on the album full of great sound collages and guitar work from Thursten as well as some of his most impressive lyrics. 'Candle' still to this day blows me away at how amazing it is. A song that must be heard to appreciate. While it is not the best song on the album it may be the most inspired. Closing the album is 'Trilogy' a three part song starting with 'a) The Wonder' is a rocking soud collage of feeling while 'b)Hyperstation' is a socially commited-melow-dramatic cinama of a song with 'c)Eliminator Jr.' as conclusion to an essay recycling everything in the album already into one final closing statement by Kim Gorden.<br /><br />Every noise, every word, basically everything heard on Daydream Nation is ment to symbolize something in America during the time of this albums release in 1988 when the country was still Reagan Nation. This genius piece of music deserves only the highest of praise. Daydream Nation was the first album to really put Sonic Youth on the map and earn them the massive cult following that they now have.

B000002ADT|5.0|The muscians:  This CD features not only the best in the business at the time (Paul Chambers on bass, Jimmy Cobb on drums, Cannonball Adderly on alto sax, and master blues man Wynton Kelly playing piano on Freddie Freeloader), but some of the best ever (Miles Davis on trumpet, John Coletrain on tenor sax, and Bill Evans on piano).  Though Evans had already stopped touring with the group, Davis brough him back for this project because of Evans' impeccable qualifications and experience with the type of music planned for this recording.<br />The songs:  The songs include some of the most popular modal jazz standards, such as the iconic So What? (that was so novel that the types of chords used are still called \\"So What\\" chords), and the straight-ahead blues number Freddie Freeloader, featuring one of the best blues pianists ever, Wynton Kelly.  The other blues number, All Blues, follows a more experimental course that laid the groundwork for Oliver Nelson's classic Blues and the Abstract Truth (also featuring Bill Evans and Paul Chambers).<br />The recording:  the recordings are of excellent quality, with pioneering use of artificial reverb that was almost unheard of in jazz at the time.  The piano sound is a bit grainy, but not so much as to ruin the recording.  There was relatively little rehearsal or planning, other than intros, heads and roadmaps.  By all accounts, the muscians had the kind of great day that happens often in live settings, but not so much in the studio.<br />This CD laid the groundwork for years, and even decades, to follow.  Many say that this CD is a great \\"first introduction\\" to jazz.  I'd put it in the top five first CD's to buy, but not at the very top, because it lacks any jazz adaptations of familiar tunes.  Buy Kinda Blue and meet the giants on whose shoulders today's best jazz musicians stand.

0143038419|3.0|I had to read this for a book club discussion. But I had already bought this book because it sounded so good. What is there not to like about traveling around the world? If I can't get on a plane, then by golly, I'll read about someone else's journeys. This book sounded like it would fit the bill.    Not quite. Don't get me wrong, it is a good read and I have found myself chuckling in spots, but it is not the best book I have read. Gilbert is a good writer, there's no doubt. But it is nothing more than a me-me memoir and that is disappointing in itself.    The book is split up in four ways. The first part is when she is going through a divorce and heartbreak from breaking up with her boyfriend, whom she met while going through a divorce from her husband. Have been there and done that. There's nothing special about her divorce or heartbreak ~~ just about everyone I know has gone through that, including me. That section almost turned me off completely from reading the rest of the book. The second part is about Italy. I loved loved that section. It was fun. It was breezy. It was casual. It was about food and wine and light in Italy. It is probably the saving grace of this entire book.     Then the third part is about India. I have never been so bored in my entire life reading about India. There was nothing redeemable about her stay in India. I am highly disappointed about that. Then the fourth part is about Indonesia, and that one perked up a little bit for me as a reader. It is funny and sassy and she was not so self-involved with finding her way to God as she was in India.     So, it's too late for me. I bought this book. I wish I hadn't because it really should be a book borrowed from the library. But I bought this book before I imposed this \\"No More Buying Books\\" rule on my finances. I will lend it to as many people as I can. Just because I didn't think it was all that great (which really is a disappointment because I did have high hopes for this book!), it doesn'tmean that others may not find it so. I have a friend who thinks this book is wonderful.    It'll be interesting to hear what the others have to say in book club.     3/3/08
B00005JNS0|4.0|As much as I try to like this movie, I find very hard making any kind of connection with the car characters. I doubt too many people have ever looked at their vehicle as something with a life of its own, unlike with their toys (or even bugs for that matter). I also can't avoid noticing the similarity to another movie, Doc Hollywood, which by the way, was truly mediocre.  That said, the Pixar excelence is present here and there's is no denying they got the most out of this story. I just don't think it was that good a premise to begin with.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|There Will Be Blood, starring Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is a powerfully realized, beautifully acted, written, and directed film. Adapted from the novel Oil by Upton Sinclair, \\"Blood\\" tells the story of Daniel Plainview, who is a silver miner in California in the late 1800s when he first strikes oil. From there, he becomes an oilman, skilled at going into communities and appealing to their sense of family and community, bringing his young son in tow to add to his allure.<br /><br />Plainview's character comes more and more into focus as he is alerted to a possible oil site in arid farmland. Taking his son with him, he investigates and decides to start buying property all around the area. But he comes in constant conflict with the twin brother of the young man who alerted him to the oil, a would-be faith-healer and preacher who has amassed a sizeable following in the town.<br /><br />What follows is fascinating, hearbreaking, and compelling, as Plainview singlemindedly pursues wealth and success without much regard to anything or anyone, even himself. By the end of the film, he is a broken man who could not have ended up any other way.<br /><br />To say that Day-Lewis' performance is a tour-de-force is an understatement. His Plainview is arrogant, contemptible, hateful, but at the same time tender and compassionate in his own way. He was more than deserving on an Oscar, and this film had the poor fortune to be released at the same time that the wonderful \\"No Country For Old Men\\" was released. Otherwise, Anderson would have won for Best Director and the film probably would have won Best Picture.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood serves as many things, but above all, it is a masterful piece of filmmaking and acting.
B00005JPLW|3.0|Only bought this because of Amazon's incredible low price during the black friday sale of 2007 and it didn't dissappoint me, the battle scenes are pretty good and the look of the film is obviously one of a kind. Still, no point comparing it to other truly great films of similar themes such as GLADIATOR and BRAVEHEART which are in another class entirely.  I doubt I'll be giving 300 repeated viewings but I'm glad I saw it.

The story line is great, the men are handsome and there is a bit of a love thing going on too.  Matthew MCConaughay was almost unrecongnizable !  I would have like the plot to be developed out a bit more.  I wanted the movie to be longer.  But its a cool concept and definately not cheezy CGI.  I like !
0393324818|5.0|For a former baseball player Billy Beane is a rare bird as a baseball GM.  He used real baseball statistics, the kind the sabermetricians use to make great trade and bring a strong team back to Oakland.  He had a great advantage over other GMs because he took advantage of their ignorance and tendencies to rely on the somewhat biased eyes of basebll scouts.  What Michael Lewis did with this book was to show the world of baseball how Billy Beane did it and now I am sure that other GMs like Brian Cashman at New York and Theo Epstein in Boston are catching on.  I don't know how much Steve Phillips put into action when he was the Mets GM.  His lack of great success there indicates that he [robably didn't follow it enough.  But now as an ESPN commentator he definitely mentions it.  This book si so good that the term moneyball now means the strategy that Billy Beane used.  So the title of this book became a baseball term! This book is a must for managers, general managers and owners of professional baseball teams.  It is also great for the fans and the fantasy baseball enthusiasts.<br /><br />Along with Mike Schell's books and the ones like \\"Curve Ball\\" written by Albert and Bennett this is one of the most thoughtful and scientific books on the game of baseball, how to win at it and how to build a successful team.  The other books I mentioned were written by professional statisticians.  It is the great success of the statistical science of sports, sabermetrics that we are now witnessing a scientific and statistical approach to baseball and other sports that had been lacking for many years.  What Beane proved with regard to money was that a small market team like Oakland without the big money of a Steinbrenner could build a great team through smart trades and drafts based on looking at the right statistics on the players, the statistics that determine value in terms of run production for offense and run prevention for pitchers and defense.<br /><br />The amazon reviews of this book are almost unanymous in their praise of Lewis' book.

1594489505|5.0|I got this book at the library with the extremely high recommendation of my Sister-in-Law.  I hemmed and hawed over reading it and it sat on my dresser for two weeks before I decided to 'get it over with'- beings it is not the type of fiction I am drawn to. The first part of the book was slow-going for me. It left me with a depressed feeling each time I made myself pick it up! But....and there is a big but....the second half of the book just slammed me! I could not put it down. I read until after midnight (and I get up with my husband to see him off to work at 4am!!!), but I had to finish it! I fell in love with the characters.  They were so wonderfully developed that I had to make sure I was reading fiction.  The writing brought the vivid scenes to life in my mind. It educated me on the Mid-Eastern culture. It was an emotionally powerful story that left me on my knees thanking God that I am an American! Do yourself a favor and step out of your 'comfort zone' if this is not the type of fiction you normally read. You will not be sorry!
0618918248|3.0|I read this book to challenge myself. Did I believe in God as I was convinced I did? Or was I proclaiming a belief in God because of ideas instilled in me as a child and I was clinging to them like a security blanket or out of some kind of loyalty to my upbringing, or out of plain guilt? This book was like a spring-cleaning of the mind, tossing some things and retaining others, but in the end I remained in the same house that was spring-cleaned.    Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned scientist. His love of science is infectious and made me write a list of books he recommends to learn more. With his astounding knowledge, how could I challenge any of his scientific reasoning? I can't. Only someone who approaches or matches him in scientific knowledge can challenge him without being intellectually swatted. In my additional reading I found a Time magazine interview between Professor Dawkins and Francis Collins, Director of the National Human Genome  and a Christian (and someone that Professor Dawkins describes as a \\"subject of amused bafflement\\" in The God Delusion, where the forum is all his, but refrains from such scoffing when he is face to face with him because Dr. Collins can answer back). The interview is an invigorating debate and although I instinctively agreed with Dr. Collins' belief that God is outside nature, outside time and space, the consciousness-raising nature of The God Delusion also immediately forced me to counter-argue that this explanation is insufficient. Something of God has to be part of nature, of time, and of space, because we are of nature. He has to have some connection to us humans. If He is completely separate from our human world, then even if He exists He is irrelevant to us. But such philosophical arguments can go on forever. Professor Dawkins makes his same arguments in the interview as he does in The God Delusion and it's his concluding remark that leaves a lasting impression and that I agree with whole-heartedly: \\"If there is a God,it's going to be a whole lot bigger and a whole lot more incomprehensible than anything that any theologian of any religion has ever proposed.\\" My intuition after finishing The God Delusion continues to be that God exists in a way that we humans, even the brilliant Professor Dawkins, cannot understand. I have this idea of God smiling because of The God Delusion. He gave us brains to think with and He wants us to think about the world and His existence instead of only passively accepting what theologians or world-renowned scientists say.    One final thought-- I think many atheists have reasons other than rationality for their atheism. Many of them have posted reviews sneering at religious believers, in the same tone that Professor Dawkins uses throughout The God Delusion. Professor Dawkins cites a study that found religion negatively correlated with education. Everyone has a concept of themselves, and it appears to me that many self-professed atheists are enamored of the idea that they belong to a clever group that is superior to those laughably irrational people (like me) who believe in an invisible deity. I have my own self-concept: I am a rational person who understands that science cannot explain everything.
B000QXDED6|3.0|\\"300\\" is a movie based on the legendary exploits of Spartan King Leonidas and Persian King Xerxes.    Xerxes organized a Million Man March and then threatened the Greek states with plunder and subjugation; only Leonidas and his 300 guards stood in  the way of Spartan annihilation.    This is not the first adaptation of this tale to the screen. Forty five years ago, David Egan and Ralph Richardson acted in the forgettable \\"300 Spartans.\\"    \\"300\\" is a new adaptation directed by Zack Snyder and based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller.    There are multiple ways to view 300. It could be taken a promotional video for the US Army or as an ad campaign for Bowflex. The reviewer prefers to see it as a plain action flick.    Without doubt, this is one of the more beautiful films that have graced the screen.The subdued hues, the period costumes (or the lack of it) and ragged terrain are lovely to behold. When the Spartans observe the Persians fleet swallowed in the tumult, as the rain glides on Leonidas's shield, the shot resembles a painting worthy of the Louvre.    The battle scenes and phalanx were choreographed with attention to detail. And then there was the gore. What wondrous fountains of gushing red fluid, what perverse amputations and beheadings.     Despite the critical consensus, 300 is terribly flawed.    Snyder has gotten a pass for reworking Miller's novel onscreen. However, 10 minutes into the movie, the question has to be asked: Why did Leonidas need to go to war? And if he did, why take only 300 men? Some excuses were alluded to, but these were rendered in lackluster fashion as to be made inconsequential to the plot.    Moreover, the pacing was off. Initially, the back story was rushed to make way for the blood-soaked spectacle. Then we were assaulted with barrage upon barrage of Persian suicide fighters.    Following the first contact between the armies, each battle scene became a more brazen attempt to intoxicate the audience with slow motion and quick editing.  By the end, the experience was underwhelming. There was no climax.    300 is visually appealing, but not much more. Without a coherent plot or the tiniest bit of social commentary, it is an imperfect, albeit enjoyable film by a talented director whose best days are ahead of him.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|DH got this for me as a gift since I love watching stuff like this, definitely a must-have for your collection of National Geographic, Animal Planet type stuff.  My kids like to watch it with me and I really enjoy that they take the time to show the guys and gals who are handling taking pictures and showing us such beautiful rare moments that we could only wish to see up close in person.  I hope they are getting paid a lot of money to do such camera work, I sympathize their long hours of waiting for the right moment to capture just for us to view in the comfort of our homes! :)
B000063DFN|5.0|In my opinion the defining moment of metal in the 80s.Yes there certainly are a number of great bands from that era of metal but I believe Maiden not only peaked as a band on this effort but topped the genre.This is an immaculate product for that time,way ahead of its time and still to this day as good,if not better than anything that has followed by any hard rock or metal band.Musically precise and artistically genius.Need I mention Dickinson's vocal performance on this effort.A flawless 5 Star across the board.Call me nostalgic but when this was first released in 84'I purchased it on audio cassette and knew at that time that history was made....

0380789019|3.0|Otherworld slip mystery.      A young man not particularly going anywhere finds himself losing touch a bit more with the garden variety normal world, and slowly begins to realise there is more around him than he realises.    Thanks to a meeting he is drawn into this other society and out of his shell by way of this mendicant supernatural society.    While the ordinary world was a bit dull, this one is full of danger and weird that he has to negotiate, whether friends, or new enemies.
0060558121|2.0|I grew up on New Wave sci-fi, and have seen this type of story before. It uses characters and plots we 'know' in disguise. The pleasure from such stories comes from two places - first, the magical 'aha' moment when we unravel their identities. Next, the finale, where the author reveals new twists on a familiar archetype.<br /><br />Unfortunately, American Gods is bland. It lacks the crackle of Harlan Ellison, the startling brevity of Roger Zelazny, or the unsettling button-pushing of Jos&eacute; Farmer. It felt 'done before'. I got bored and couldn't finish it.
006074815X|3.0|Mama bear v spy.      In this case, not a story I bought into, as a mother and child get in the way of an enemy agent's plans, and must fight to survive.    There's also a movie, which in this case I actually thought was better, something that is pretty rare.    This is passable enough, but that is about it.      3 out of 5
B000JIHP88|4.0|We bought this and our baby loved it, but the leaves would slow down considerably when they were going up and down, almost to stopping.  We thought it was broken so we exchanged it for a new one, and the second one did the same thing, so we just figured we had to live with it that way.  With some more use though it seems to be doing better.<br />The music is great- it calms the baby down.  He also likes the motion- keeps him from getting too restless in his crib while I read or sing to him.  You can turn the motion or the nightlight on and off, and the music can be loud, soft, or off, so you can create any combination you want (including all 3).  Some people have said it's too quiet, but I think it's the perfect volume, even with the white noise playing in our son's room, he seems to be able to hear it just fine, and the quieter setting is perfect for helping him doze off.<br />Overall a great mobile, we're very happy with it, and glad the slow motion didn't prove to be a chronic problem, as that was annoying.
0684833395|4.0|Stop changing the rules.      That is what the title refers to - that fact that you need to successfully complete a number of missions to get out of the war, but when you get close, the nasty people in charge keep upping the number.    This is a black comedy that follows our protagonist as he tries to get by while stuck in this ugly war situation with a bunch of crazy and going crazy fellow military, locals and other whacky people around the place.    Both funny and bleak at once.    Definitely worth reading.
0375704027|4.0|I have lived in Japan for nearly a decade, during which time I have read dozens of books ON Japan but very little Japanese Literature. The main reason was that having encountered many incidents of shoddy translation I was waiting to read Japanese Literature in Japanese. Unknowing of this wish, my girlfriend kindly sent me this Vintage edition translated by Jay Rubin and as both a 'courtesy' to her and a way to understand her better I decided to give it a read. What I could not have imagined soon became crystal clear, firstly the translation is EXCELLENT, Rubin has done an outstanding job, and secondly, Murakami, as story teller of the first degree. Sure, this simple narrative is neither original or outstanding structurally, but it is in other numerous regards. Murakami's strength as a story-teller is his ability to suck you in and hold you there - front row seats all the way. As the plot unravels before your eyes you feel you know these characters he has drawn, that you know them far beyond the surface of which you have been told, that you know their inner core and their deepest hopes and fears. Because the writing is not unnecessarily uncomplicated, the pages just race by and this fluidity means you can finish this in three good sittings. All this leaves you feeling with a strange sense, of actually having know these characters - who could forget the lasting images of Storm-trooper, Midori et al., and in the end, a sense of loss when the final page comes around. All in all, an excellent novel and one worth reading whether you have an interest in Japan or not - actually that's an interesting disparity worth highlighting, the fact that people often read 'Asian' literature because they have an interest in Asia, but seldom read American Literature because the have an interest in America... Finally as an addendum, it should be pointed out that the late '60s backdrop that this is 'supposedly' set against, is no more than a piece of cloth hung from the ceiling to obscure the mess behind - this reads as absolute contemporary literature and with the exception of the odd 'Peace' or 'Right-on' it has no visible setting, nor leaves no particular after-taste.the mess behind - this reads as absolute contemporary literature and with the exception of the odd 'Peace' or 'Right-on' it has no visible setting, nor leaves no particular after-taste.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The \\"almost\\" refers to David Fincher refusing to have anything to do with this boxset. Still, there is more than enough bonus features to satisfy even the most ardent fan of the \\"Alien\\" series. (It must be said, however, that \\"Alien Resurrection\\" is still a disappointment.)

0937381888|4.0|Palmer's online guide ([...]) is legendary among homebrewers, but it is definitely nice to have a tangible copy.  Much of the initial stuff is information you could get from a 10 minute conversation at a local homebrew shop (I am fortunate to have several in the area), so don't buy it if you just want to dabble and get a couple decent batches.  However, the later information on how the brewing actually happens (e.g. the relative roles of malt, hops, and yeast) is very interesting and critical if you ever hope to take brewing from the kits to actual \\"creation\\".  The sections on partial mash and all-grain brewing are great for understanding how many different ways there are to brew, and the pros and cons to each.  It's essentially what strategy guides are to video games: the only real way to get better is to practice, but it will make you feel a little more like you know what you're doing (and convince others that you know what you're doing).
B000WCBPOG|5.0|the songs are amazing, but some from the movie that i wanted were not there.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|There really aren't enough stars to give this a proper recomendation. I'm a recent radiohead fan and this is- no joke- the best album to come about in the last 8 years. The people who don't like this album are people who simply can't appreciate beauty and brilliance- people who think that that Panic at the Disco is god's gift to music. Even if you've never heard Radiohead before this is the perfect place to start. You do have to give it a couple listens to fully appreciate it, though.
0452287588|5.0|Mr. Tolle's discourse on 'flowers' revealed to me a world I had never considered, and we have Oprah to thank for sharing this masterpiece of spiritual discovery with us.  His broad generalizations accurately reflect the broad, general nature of true existence in the 'now'.  I have truly begun to feel my old 'self' being replaced by a new, more enlightened 'self'.  Not since Augustine or Shakespeare, whom I suggest for later additions to Ms. Winfrey's pantheon, has there been such a profound and sometimes troubling examination of the human psyche been attempted.  Primary religious texts are often obscure and difficult to read, and I'm glad we have someone like Mr. Tolle to distill their essence for us.  Hopefully Ms. Winfrey can get Mr. Tolstoy for her next series of classes, I have a number of questions for them regarding his haunting masterpiece!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I too love this version with Sally Hawkins, and I too would love to know where I can get the musical soundtrack of this movie.  The music made the scenes so moving and you feel the sense of despair and love that Anne was feeling. How about the kiss.  Soo romantic..
B00005JPNY|5.0|I thought it would be childish or preachy. It was neither. A good action fantasy that can be enjoyed by adults and all but the youngest children. I give many thanks to the Catholic church and other critics for bringing this film and the trilogy it was based on to my attention. I might not have given it any notice without their attempts at censoring the film.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Ok, we get it! This show isn't historically accurate. Who cares! It was aired on Showtime, not the History Channel. \\"The Tudors\\" is insanely addictive. I watched all 10 episodes in less than 24 hours. I was very happy to see that Henry didn't go through 3 wives in the first season but only one. I've very excited that this series has the ability to last at least 5 seasons at this rate. Don't let people scare you away by saying that it's not accurate. Who cares? This show is simply awesome! By the way I was able to get it for only $19 at Best Buy so hopefully you can too.
0691131511|4.0|Good overview of this complex empire. I have only two negative comments  Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic Church are not reunited as some might think if all they did was read this text.  The Turks are not as hospitable to the remaing Orthodox Christians as the author might lead you to believe.  Evidence: the refusal to allow the Orthodox church to rebuilt its school/monastery for priests in Constantinople/Istabul.  This building burned in the 1970s and is still not repaired due to the fact that The Turks won't allow it.
0452289963|1.0|Life has potential, certainly, but truly has no meaning in a broad sense. We are born, we live, and then we die. Our entire existence is a blink in the eye of eternity. Today, a million people will perish from starvation and preventable disease. How are they to wake up to their \\"life's meaning?\\" Books like this require at least a modicum of critical thinking. Consider the task of writing a book, sitting hour upon hour scribbling away a pile of words for public consumption and adulation. Is that not an act of egoism?     The author encourages \\"present day living\\" which is antithetical to survival. To survive, you must be looking ahead, at the next step, the next crop, tomorrow's weather, the enemies' next move, etc. Observe the creatures of the earth - animals, birds, insects - all foraging, moving,  planning, building, thinking ahead. It is survival. To do otherwise is to relish in one's leisure, letting others do all the working for you, which a luxury of a very few on this planet. While this author wallows in his new-age perspective, others are making sure his lights turn on and his toilet flushes. They're stocking grocery store shelves in anticipation of his daily consumption. Farmers are worrying about their next crop so that people like him can eat. Roads are being planned and ditches dug so his backyard doesn't flood in the next rainstorm. Meanwhile, he's writing a book in the comfort of his living room.    How can anyone accept this, keeping in mind the mother in Africa watching her children starve? Or the millions of orphaned children who wander the countryside because their parents have died from disease and the ravages of civil war? Think of all the people on this planet who die before they reach the age of twelve. Where is THEIR present day fulfillment? How has their egoism prevented their enlightenment? This is shameful, to me.
