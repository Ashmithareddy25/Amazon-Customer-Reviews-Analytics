0316098337|4.0|I found myself constantly shaking my head while I was reading this book.  Obviously, there is the hopelessness of trying to wrap one's head around the idea of being locked away for seven years, but when that is addition to the concept of a 5-year old child having never been out of a small room even once during his lifetime, it seems too much to bear.<br /><br />My heart broke for Jack and his mother.  While I shook my head in awe of her strength - her ability to shield Jack from all that he was missing in the world, I was also in awe of Jack.  Of his amazingly realistic voice, of his healthy 5-year old spirit despite only interacting with one other human being during all of those 5 years, of his intelligence and yet of his utter 5-year old-ness.<br /><br />As much as I wanted Jack and his mother to escape, and escape fast, I found myself startled at how fast the book moves.  I know that sounds ridiculous when one considers that it involves a woman that has been imprisoned for seven years...but once events start to happen, they happen fast.  I found myself expecting the worst, and while I was certainly not disappointed, I was...surprised at the turn of events.<br /><br />Once the truth is revealed, bit by bit, to this little boy, it seems too much to take in.<br /><br />\\"Listen.  What we see on TV is...it's pictures of real things.\\"  That's the most astonishing thing I ever heard.\\"<br /><br />I kept expecting Jack to have more time to react to the facts regarding his small world...which would be awful, true, but it seemed a necessary part of the story.  But he and the reader are not given that time.<br /><br />\\"I'm not in Room.  Am I still me?\\"<br /><br />This is a lovely story, a heartbreaking story, and one with one of the truest child voices I've ever read.  The reader is allowed to see through the eyes of a woman ripped from the world she knew as well as through the eyes of a child seeing that world for the very first time.  In the end, it's hard to say whose eyes see things more clearly.<br /><br />\\"In Room me and Ma had time for everything.  I guess the time gets spread very thin like butter all over the world, the roads and houses and playgrounds and stores, so there's only a little smear of time on each place, then everyone has to hurry on to the next bit.\\"e for everything.

B003XMUFGQ|1.0|Let's start by saying Eric is my favorite of all time.  I am 55 and have seen him live at least 15 times. In my opinion,  1 of the top guitar players ever. The problem is, he doesn't think  so anymore. At this point in his life he has the right to record  any type of album he wants. the problem is, he hasn't recorded a GUITAR  album in centuries. I wouldn't have even minded an album like Santana  just did of covers. At least he wailed on those covers. Eric just doesn't  get it anymore, or doesn't want to. My 17 year old son complains I still  live in the 60's. This album shows him why.
B003INBOEM|5.0|I like martial arts movies and so I was not surprised that I liked this one. The story is good and is only made better by it being a story about a real person. What is surprising is that my wife liked it too. She will tolerate a martial arts movie but she did not expect to like this one very much. At the end she said she wanted to see it again. She will give no higher praise.

B000001F2E|3.0|Having owned the original vinyl LP and the CD before, I know for a fact that there were THREE black and white photos in the sleeve. Each photo of the band members. Neil Peart's photo is missing in this CD sleeve so I feel like I got gypped there. No problem with the CD, sound quality is fine.    Additionally, from a photographic point of view, each photo of Geddy, Alex and Neil are done in a \\"multi-exposure\\" method which you don't see often so to lack Neil's photo was a bummer!

B000060OFT|4.0|When I first watched this movie I agreed with all the one star reviews. This movie seemed like crap, but now that I've grown out of my teens and got over the fact that Claire Danes isn't naked I think this is a good movie.<br /><br />It is really a movie you have to go in and watch and give it a chance. For me at least the first time was awful, but now every time I watch it grows on me into the classic it was meant to be. Still they base it off the classic. I would still like to see a pure remake using modern day terminology vs. the classic speech.<br /><br />Either way it is worth a watch. If you don't like it on the first watch wait a day and watch it again. It is one of those movies that really has to grow on you. It's not great, but you watch it... you watch again... and again. Next thing you know you are like wow this is pretty good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My friend is in a book club and she recommended that I read this book. I am so glad. I loved the characters-they became so real to me. Katniss is believable as a teenager torn between trying to stay alive and trying do the right thing for her fellow human beings. Peeta is so lovable as the boy who loves her and will do anything to keep her alive. I read this on my Kindle and brought it everywhere with me--work, appointments, the gym while on the treadmill. I was able to walk for hours while reading all 3 books. I am glad I was able to read them all one right after the other and not wait for months until the next one came out. These books really shook me up and got me thinking. I highly recommend all 3.

You will be thinking about it for weeks after you finish it and you will know that, someday, you must read it again.

Then, there is the extraordinarily talented cast of Emma Thompson as Elinor Dashwood, Kate Winslet as Marianne Dashwood, Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, Hugh Grant as Edward Ferrars, and Harriet Walter as Fanny Ferrars Dashwood and many others, led by the cinematically inspired direction of Ang Lee.  This film has everything to like.  A wonderful viewing experience that can be repeated as many times as you wish.

031236198X|4.0|I've been doing this \\"work\\" thing long enough to know that when a boss suggests a particular book to read, you may want to pay attention and pick up a copy.  That's how the book Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions by John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber ended up on my radar screen.  Granted, I probably would have been inclined to read it anyway, as it's on a topic that seems to define my life.  Written in a style that brings to mind Who Moved My Cheese?, Iceberg is a quick read that uses a fable to make its point about how to be open to changes in all areas of your life.<br /><br />The authors use a waddle of penguins (yes, I had to look that up!) to tell a story about change.  One penguin who goes by the name of Fred is an observant sort, and starts to realize that the iceberg they live on is in danger of collapsing.  When he tries to bring that to the attention of others, he's written off as alarmist, strange, or just plain wrong.  He finally gets someone in the leadership pack to see and understand the situation, and together they have to convince the others that there 1) is a problem, and 2) is a need to change in order to survive.  As you might expect, the waddle goes through all the typical behaviors such as denial, acceptance, resistance, and so forth.  But though hard work and careful choices, they learn to change and adapt to a different (and perhaps better) way of life.<br /><br />Kotter structures the story around his eight step process for successful change:<br />Set the Stage<br />1. Create a Sense of Urgency<br />2. Pull Together the Guiding Team<br />Decide What to Do<br />3. Develop the Change Vision and Strategy<br />Make it Happen<br />4. Communicate for Understanding<br />5. Empower Others to Act<br />6. Produce Short-Term Wins<br />7. Don't Let up<br />Make It Stick<br />8. Create a New Culture<br /><br />Admittedly, the story used to present the process is simple and perhaps overly cute.  But it's a whole lot more memorable and easier to apply than just having the eight steps written out so you can read and memorize them.  For many readers who are facing change that they didn't necessarily choose, this would be a good choice.  They can get their minds wrapped around the change process, and perhaps identify with the different characters in order to help them navigate the path ahead.  Personally, I think Our Iceberg Is Melting is one of the more approachable books on change for the average person trying to make sense of it all.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedut so you can read and memorize them.

B00004U8P9|1.0|I first saw this movie with a group of friends back in high school at the Midnight Movies in the mid-80s. Back then I remember it being a fun but odd experience and interesting to see the audience participation, but when I recently caught this film again on TV, I really couldn't believe how truly dreadful it was. Like many others who give this movie low ratings, I do not understand the cult following of this film. For such great talent (Curry, Sarandon, Bostwick and others) to be a part of something on this low level is pretty surprising, even this early in their careers, (with perhaps the exception of actor Charles Gray who has no excuse for this - ANY role he's done is ALWAYS played the same way, with no range at all - his best role you'll find is probably his portrayal of Blofeld in the '71 Bond film Diamonds Are Forever). As an adult now, I find Rocky Horror to be boring, and actually repulsive in many ways, and probably even worse as a musical production, and just plain stupid in many parts. At one time it might have been fun at the high school level, but overall, it really is an awful movie that is really only watchable in the context of a Midnight Movie-showing atmosphere with a lot of people joining in with singing and lots of interaction with what is on-screen. But on its own, it just doesn't stand up.
0345505387|1.0|Let it first be known that I have read all of Diana Gabaldon's books, several times for some and love them. The Outlander series is, of course, THE best ever. But, I have to say that I did not care for The Exile at all. I found the artwork too dark, the male characters too similar and oddly oriental, and what can I say about Claire? Very disappointing. May as well have drawn in Betty Boop or some such. I labored through it simply out of devotion to the series but it was labor. Passed it on to another fan who only managed a dozen pages before giving it back. I applaud the exploration into a new genre but I have to give The Exile a thumbs down.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|Two geneticists, played by Adrien Brody (OXYGEN, THE JACKET) and Sarah Polly (DAWN OF THE DEAD, NO SUCH THING), develop a female, human / animal hybrid. They name her DREN (yep, NERD backwards). DREN seems OK at first, but this is a horror film after all, so, unbelievable terror awaits! The idea of \\"Don't play god\\" (aka: \\"Don't mess around w/ nature\\") is older than this or any movie. SPLICE is a modern take on this theme, w/ the scientists facing the ethical / moral dilemma of their creation, as well as it's lethal potential. DREN is a well-realized, FX creature, and has several surprises in store. SPLICE does have it's silly moments (the dance lesson!), but makes up for this w/ originality. Recommended...
0307454541|1.0|I picked this book up a few years ago and only got through the 1st chapter before I ditched it.  When I heard they were going to make a movie of it, I tried reading it again.  There were so many times that I wanted to stop reading but forced myself to finish the section/chapter/book.  It's not well-written, the plot is full of holes, and there is more talk/description of rape than any other book I've read.  Most of the book is all back-story (and a boring one at that).  Still not sure what all the hype is about...if you want a dull plot and unlikeable characters, this book is for you.
B000M53GM2|5.0|This two hour plus 1995 film with Pierce Brosman, with lots of hair and humor and action, is delightful. A secret weapon is stolen by a rogue Soviet general and 007's mission is to retrieve it. The film starts with an episode in which 007 and 006 attack a USSR fascility to blow it up. They are sourrounded by Soviet soldiers; we see 006 shot; 007 escapes in a miraculous, indeed impossible manner when 007 chases and jumps aboard a plane.<br /><br />The film jumps nine years to a car race and sex. The film has its usual female characters with suggestive names. In this case it is Onatop, or is it on the top. She is a pilot. She is able to kill men during sex by squashing them with her legs in a scissor hold. She is working with the rogue Soviet general. She has a near or actual sexual orgasm when she kills people.<br /><br />Since fifteen years have passed since this film was made, we will see several actors in the film who later made it big on their own: one, for example, played a detective in a long running series, one a weird psychologist in a series, and one introduces Masterpiece Theatre, among other things.
1563523302|4.0|If you sat down and wrote out a list of every athlete, every celebrity, every politician, every business titan... every single person you could reasonably assume was probably a millionaire, you might come up with a few thousand names. Let's say you were great at it and came up with 50,000 people you could reasonably assume were probably millionaires. At the time of the book's writing, there were an estimated 3 million millionaires in the US. Where are they all? And why can't you identify them? This book not only answers that question, but in doing so it helps you figure out how you could become one of those millionaires yourself.

0060555661|4.0|This book is timeless. It's the one title that Warren Buffett continuously holds up as the guidepost for his success as an investor. I personally found the updated notes and interpretations a little more accessible. Ben Graham is from a different era and decidedly speaks/writes with the style of bygone days. Far from being quaint, in the context of investing, that actually makes him a little hard to follow. That's not to say his advice is any less useful. Which is where the updates come in. Jason Zweig does an excellent job of taking Graham's timeless wisdom and interpreting it for us.

0439023513|3.0|I was very disappointed by this book. The first 2, in my opinion, we're sensational. I was expecting much more from this one. I didn't like the direction it took. From the very start Katniss seemed so disconnected and reckless. Much moreso than in the first 2 books, and almost to the point of frustration.         --- Possible Spoiler ---        The ending was far too sudden and very anti-climactic. It almost felt to me like it was just jumbled together at the very last minute in order to meet a deadline. I would have liked for things to go much slower and come in more detail. The relationships between Katniss and those closest to her seemed to disappear into the background, almost as if she no longer cared. I was going to give the book 2 stars, but decided on 3 only because of the way it ended (literally the last 2 pages).

I've had several other ones but this is the first I've gotten that's over the head and I must say what a difference it makes. It doesn't fall off at all and the earbuds stay inside your ears. It's also light wieght and comfortable in the ears. The side facing mics also help direct the sound into your ears. I used to max out the volume on my iPAD so I can somewhat hear the sound but with these I had to lower them a few notches. Really like them!

B004A8EI9M|5.0|I have been a fan of the comic book, so It was nice to watch this first episode. The Tv show adds little things to help the characters grow. I can't wait the next episode.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is by far the best all time comic movie ever.  Heath Ledger (God Bless You, 1979-2008) as the Joker was questionable at first, but once I saw the opening negotiation scene with the mobsters, I was hands down convinced that this was the man for the job, \\"Wanna see a magic trick?\\".  This movie, unlike many other reboots, didn't bore you.  In fact, it kept you urning for more.  Both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger put on a performance that was exceptional.  I hope they reconsider another reboot because Christian Bale as the Dark Knight was perfect.  As a fan, I gonna miss Heath Ledger playing the Joker, but I would hate it more if they reboot the whole franchise and try to one up the Joker character with a new actor.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|A great musical to have on Blu-ray, the quality is amazing and you get the sing along bonus :-). Is one of those movies that lifts your spirit with no effort and leaves you with a big smile and wanting for more. Except for Brosnan, the actor's singing will not disappoint you. And what else you can say about Meryl Streep: she is just a GENIUS of this craft! 100% lovely.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This was the best reboot of any comic character franchise. Though I'm a big fan of Michael Keaton version of Batman, Christian Bale gave the character a more realistic, down to earth feel.  Many of the scenarios in the movie seemed very plausible for the real world and as a comic fan, that combination has made it one of my all time favorite comic to movies ever.  Excellent movie and an excellent story as well.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I must say when I saw this mini-series on HBO, I was stunned.  I worked in a veterans home several years ago and heard stories from those veterans that fought  this war....this is right on target.  How can \\"anyone\\" say this isn't a great movie.  It's true, it's realistic and shows what our veterans before us went through for our freedom!!!  I also thought no movie could top Band of Brothers but wow!!! how wrong I was.  Tom Hanks, Steven Spilberg what a outstanding job you did in bringing this story back to us generations later....to the three marines who have to relive and tell the story \\"Thank You, Thank You, Thank You.\\"  All Americans should see this series.....to realize what our veterans go through when they go off to war and the price that was paid for our freedom.  Five stars is not enough to rate this series....it should be higher.  I highly, highly recommend this series.  I am purchasing it for friends and relatives to give too...in the meantime...\\"Thank a veteran for your freedom\\"

B00005ASOI|5.0|Considered one of Dario Argento's best, most suspenseful and most beautiful films. Suzy Bannon [Jessica Harper] arrives in Munich to attend one of the foremost dance academies in the world. But the dance academy has a dark past, a history of dabbling in the black arts, and some of the students think the teachers may still be involved in these nefarious activities. Suzy is the antidote to the evil that has seeped into the school over the centuries, but it will take skill and determination to pierce the innermost walls and secrets of the school. With its over-the-top Art Nouveau sets and Argento's signature use of primary colors, Suspiria is like being a voyeur is someone else's nightmare.<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary edition contains two discs of additional material which will be of interest to any Argento fan; those who are not fanatical about Suspiria will enjoy the less expensive, more readily available standard release.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|My sister gave me this book and I was not that interested in reading it to begin with. However, once I'd read the first page, I was hooked. The story of Charlie, an extremely shy and tentative teen, was appealing from the get-go. The first-person style of writing is extremely effective, creating the feeling that you know this guy. We follow him through his new friendship with a girl named Sam. He experiences sex and does drugs for the first time with this group. There is a very \\"Skins\\" feel to this novel, more relating to a JJ style of character.    It's a fantastic read, I highly recommend it to anyone. I don't read many books myself, would consider myself to be a causal reader if anything, and found this book exceptional. The references to other books, movies, tv shows and songs is simply incredible, and single-handedly created my love for the Smiths and The Great Gatsby.     Read it. Now.
0385738757|2.0|I read the first book.   I liked it.  The second book bothered me.   The author did a good job of finding multiple ways of describing pain.  The main character, Thomas, is in pain most of the book and with each page the author is challenged to find a new metaphor to describe the most excruciating pain in a new way.  He does fairly well at that.   But this book is one endless series of unfortunate miseries after another.  The primary reason for having an ensemble travel with the main characters is so the author has a group of people to kill off in random ways.   The group is supposed to be survivors because they are the fittest or the smartest but the deaths of so many are so random that it is annoying.       Think of the Lord of the Flies where most of the cast wears red shirts marking them for death in the most miserable and gruesome ways.  They wander through the most miserable environment populated by zombies who want their noses.      Ok, I keep reading even though I suspect as I do that I could skip 20 chapters and not miss out on anything.  When I reach the end, my suspicion is confirmed.  I could have skipped 20 chapters and missed very little.  The last 15 chapters or so keep telling us on each page that very soon we will have why these kids are subjected to this miserable torture.  Each page promises that the next page will have an explanation.  That never happens.  Wait for book three.       I do care about the main character.   I would like to know who is the traitor.   I would like to know who WICKED is and what they hope to accomplish by experiments that would make even Hitler shudder.   Do I trust the author to answer those questions in book three?   No.    Do I want to go through yet another book of pain in hope that there will be answers?

0765326353|4.0|Brandon Sanderson is someone I have heard about multiple times, and I have looked for his work at a used book stores I frequent.  However, until recently, I have been unable to acquire any of his books for reading, so I went into this book knowing nothing except that Patrick Rothfuss loves this book. I follow Pat's blog, and that is how I became aware of this books existence.  I found this book, luckily enough, at my local library!  +1 for free reading courtesy of your local library!    So going into this book, I've read nothing by this author, and had few expectations except that I would enjoy the book.  I am not the type of person who tries to figure out a book while reading it, but I instead enjoy the book, and let it unfold while I read it, as I have always found that far more enjoyable than spoiling it for myself.  So....now you know me and my back story :D    Got the book, and after the wife told me I'm not allowed to start it, I did anyway seven days later, and then I finished it seven days after that.  So 1000+ pages of reading in seven days roughly.  Yea, I had a hard time putting it down once it got going.  The beginning was, as others have mentioned, a bit slow, as Sanderson is trying to create an entire world in which the tale is to take place.  It starts you in the middle of something huge that makes no sense at all, and as the book unfolds, more and more comes together, like pieces in a puzzle.  It's exciting when the pieces are revealed, and when you fit them together.  The unveiling of Kaladin's past was an interesting read, albeit with a few predictable pieces.  The development of Dalanir and his son Adolin's relationship was at times annoying in the same way talking with someone who shows no ability to think outside of a very small box can be, and at other times so real it reminded me of moments in my own life.  Bear in mind, when I say it is annoying, it's actually a type of compliment, as that is part of the development of Adolin's character whois having his ingrained habits and ways of thinking challenged by his father, and is having a difficult time with understanding him.  It is similar to watching culture shock take place.  Although I don't think it was done as well as it could be, I still enjoyed it for the most part.      There are many more details that bear significance and are worth discussing, however, long story not quite as long, I really enjoyed this book, and am even more excited for where it will go!  With much of the story and world fleshed out, Sanderson has done a good job of creating a land with many different possibilities , which I am looking forward to discovering!    My real rating would be a 4.5 star, but amazon doesn't allow that, so the 4 star will have to suffice, as this book is not quite deserving of a 5.  Close, mind you, but not quite.
B000065V3H|4.0|From the title, I assumed there’d be a warning against buying love, but there’s not.  Instead, it’s really a warning against selling your soul to be popular – which Ronald Miller does after paying Cyndi Mancini, the most popular girl in high school, to date him for one month.  As the saying goes, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side.  On the other side, being popular can feel like a job.  Cyndi warns Ronald not to get carried away by status, but Ronald doesn’t heed the warning and betrays his best friend in the process.  We also see how shallow Cyndi’s friends are as well.  What’s not explained is why Cyndi stays and continues to stay.  There’s even one scene where she rages against them, yet despite nothing changing afterwards, all is happy again. Overall, though, I consider this movie a good warning against losing your authentic self to fit in.lly about buying love, but rather about selling your soul to become popular.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|We just keep watching this.  The information is fabulous, if not disgusting.  It is very interesting to hear what the farms have to say and to get their view on the industrialized farming operations.  We were amazed at the 'blacklisting' that is being done by the giant corporations.  We are now big fans of Polyface Farms! He is an excellent example of how good stewardship can be profitable.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|Sixteen years ago Mariah Carey released [[ASIN:B000026EQP Merry Christmas]] which has been raised to epic proportions and lauded as one of the best Christmas albums on the market. Now she's back with a sequel of sorts, 'Merry Christmas II You' which doesn't really attempt to out-do the previous Christmas album on any level. Merry Christmas II You in many ways tries to re-establish Mariah's star power after her past few albums have had a less than positive run on the charts. Musically this album picks up where \\"Merry Christmas\\" left off with a slightly more modern sound. There are some really great moments musically where we're re-introduced to the singer free of the Hip-Hop and R&B vibe that's hindered her past few releases; there are some songs that feel a bit out of place and the album overall feels like a sampling of Mariah Carey over the years with a little of her old gospel-influence, a dash of hip-hop and pinch of a style that's very classic and reserved, a bit new for Carey. In all, it's a decent album. It definitely is not on the level of the first Christmas album but you can't help but to feel a bit relieved to hear Mariah getting back to singing, hitting high notes and dropping the urban and hip-hop act from the past few albums.<br /><br />The Good: The best tracks are those where Mariah lets go and really sings and proves that she still has it in her to impress with her voice and octave range. The best track on the entire album is a duet between Mariah and her mother Patricia where the two women belt out \\"O Come All Ye Faithful / Hallelujah Chorus\\". There are a few other tracks that impress including the original track \\"Oh Santa!\\" where Carey mixes in a bit of her dance/pop background into a fun holiday track; \\"The First Noel\\" where she simply sings the song without any gimmicks and slips into a very smooth R&B interpretation of \\"Born is the King\\" that reminds you of her [[ASIN:B000002BQK Butterfly]] era; her very simple and subtle treatment of \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem / Little Drummer Boy\\". She mixes in a few original tracks as well that sound like outtakes from the [[ASIN:B0007GAERG The Emancipation of Mimi]] album including \\"When Christmas Comes\\" which sounds similar to \\"Fly Like a Bird\\", \\"One Child\\" that sounds as if it belongs on the previous Christmas album and her own dance-inspired interpretation of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\".<br /><br />The Bad: What I appreciated about the first Christmas album is that it had a rather consistent sound; \\"Merry Christmas II You\\" is a bit all over the place as it attempts to reach out to Mariah Carey fans of all sorts. You have \\"Christmas Time Is In the Air Again\\" that's classic, jazz sounding and a very hip-hop \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\"; a very slow and lackluster performance of the Charlie Brown Christmas theme on one track and then a very 1990s-dance/techno take on \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". When listened in one setting, the album has a bit of an unfocused feel to it as if Mariah and company couldn't commit to just one aim or overall goal. She's at her best, as usual, when she's just singing her heart out. When she deviates into trying to mix in a bit of hip-hop or R&B it sticks out like a sore thumb. Also, the live version of \\"O Holy Night\\" and slightly new version of \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" felt a bit unnecessary - it'd been nice if she'd included two different songs rather than do two songs from the original Christmas album.<br /><br />In all, I liked the album because of one big factor: Mariah's voice. While she does her whispering/raspy singing on a few tracks, I was so glad to hear her go back to hitting a few high notes and pull back a bit on the pop/hip-hop style that she's played with for the past few years. It felt like a return of the old Mariah, pre-Rainbow, and was fun to have Mariah wow us with her voice once more.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"O Come All Ye Faithful / Hallelujah Chorus\\", \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem / Little Drummer Boy\\", \\"The First Noel / Born is the King\\", \\"Oh Santa!\\"
B003XRZZFM|4.0|This latest \\"Dimmu Borgir\\" album, \\"Abrahadabra\\" was my introduction to the band and their sound. I know very little about black metal as a genre of music, for that reason I approached this release as a symphonic metal album and I have to say \\"Abrahadabra\\" left very positive impressions.<br /><br />For starters it is plain to see that the album was an expensive one to make as it is rich in orchestral arrangements (featuring a 50 member orchestra) and incredibly large choir. To its credit \\"Abrahadabra\\" makes full use of these assets as the role of both orchestra and choir is not complementary, instead these classical elements bond perfectly with the melodies of the electric instruments. The role of the band is equally significant as all songs open on thick and dark guitar riffs also including rather melodic, often twin guitar, solos/leads while the drumming is very intense, a fact that solidifies the identity of the release. In addition, lead vocalist Shagrath masterfully goes through a wide range of vocal tones and while his approach is thick and distorted it never goes totally brutal and it is fairly easy to make out the lyrics he sings. Favorite tracks include `Gateways', `Dimmu Borgir' and `The demiurge molecule'.<br /><br />According to the booklet notes, \\"Dimmu Borgir\\" is lead vocalist Shagrath, guitarist Silenoz and lead guitarist Galder. Musicians completing the line up are key player Gerlioz, drummer Daray and Snowy Shaw on bass ( I was totally surprised by this inclusion being unaware Shaw could handle bass player duties, being fist and foremost a drummer.)<br /><br /> Overall, `Abrahadabra' is a very enjoyable album from a symphonic metal perspective, demonstrating strong musical vision which very much shapes the character of the songs on offer. A very interesting and intriguing album.<br /><br />\\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 310) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"Incredible performances, amazing production, a huge spectacle I would say.\\"

B003DT19F0|4.0|This was a great movie for a parent to share with his second grade daughter.  She loved it.  Interesting plotline, and good values are taught.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|\\"Merry Christmas II You\\" is Mariah Carey's second Christmas music album, a follow-up of sorts to her 1994 \\"Merry Christmas\\" album. That album had the festive hit \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" which appears here in a slightly revamped version with a lush string intro. This album captures the fun and joy of Christmas, from the brief string intro \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" which leads to the bouncy \\"Oh Santa\\", a new song. Other new songs are the Nat King Cole-channeling \\"Christmastime Is In The Air Again\\", the horn-peppered Soul ballad \\"When Christmas Comes\\", the eighties-sounding \\"Here Comes Santa Claus'/'Housetop Celebration\\" (with a Hip Hop feel and a bassline reminiscent of Chic's \\"Good Times\\"), and \\"One Child\\" (with a children's choir).<br /><br />The rest comprises traditional fare; a beautiful medley \\"O Little Town Of Bethlehem/Little Drummer Boy\\" (with Carey's vocals fluttering and flickering like a firefly), \\"The First Noel/Born Is The King (Interlude)\\", \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" (which is actually \\"Christmastime Is Here\\"), \\"O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus\\" (featuring the operatic vocals of her mother Patricia Carey), a spectacular live recording of \\"O Holy Night\\", \\" and a Disco reworking of \\"Aud Lang Syne\\" with a slow intro, very Donna Summer,<br /><br />The production is top notch with vocal acrobatics in ample supply, and choirs perfectly complementing and never overshadowing where used. Perfect for Christmas with something for everyone.
0812977246|4.0|I'm not sure why I never read Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park earlier, but after nearly 30 years, I finally got around to it.  It's a very good literary thriller, elevated by Smith's insight into life behind the Iron Curtain.  It is this insight and unique backdrop that raises this novel above its otherwise conventional crime story.<br /><br />Investigator Renko is trying to solve the murder of three young people in Gorky Park but conducting an investigation in the Soviet Union isn't easy when the investigation leads places the political machinery doesn't want him to go.  There are political pressures and jurisdiction issues that hamper the investigation and aspects of his personal life (his loveless failing marriage, his legendary father who has fallen out of favour with the Party, and his apparent disregard for advancement in the Party) only complicate matters.  Needless to say Renko's investigation will lead him to expose corruption of superiors.<br /><br />This is an intelligent novel.  There are layers to the dialogue where not everyone says what they mean and motives and ulterior motives are played out in a kind of deadly chess game.  This is not necessarily light reading.  There is no clever banter and the pace may be slower than some people like.  Renko is stubborn, cynical, and morose (not necessarily qualities that fans of wise-cracking, butt-kicking, square-jawed action heroes are looking for) but I appreciated his flaws.  Renko is a fully realized three-dimensional character.<br /><br />Gorky Park is regarded as a benchmark in the crime fiction genre and its unique insight (particularly in its day) of Soviet culture is fascinating.  The crime elements in the novel are pretty standard fair, but the writing, characters, and setting elevate it to a higher level.  4 ½ stars.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is the best yet of Rick Riordan - and that is saying a lot since his Percy Jackson series is the best fantasty out there after Harry Potter.  I was sort of skeptical about how good another serie based in the same world will turn out; how he'll incorporate my fav characters from Percy Jackson in this book.  But Rick Riordan has outdone himself.    The Lost Hero (I'd like to believe it means Percy since he's lost in this book) is told from the perspective of 3 heroes (Jason, Piper & Leo) making the characters a lot more 3-dimensional and loveable.     Jason - the son of Zeus / Jupitor - has no memory of who he is or where he's from when he finds himself thrust in a half-blood camp hero quest. Of course the son of Zeus has fantastic powers; like flying and channeling lightning.    Piper - the daughter of Aphrodite - is not too happy to be claimed by the goddess of love.  Add to that her cabin-mates who remind her of ditzy airheads with attitude problems. And her huge crush on Jason, a guy who might or might not be her boyfriend.  And her charm-speaking a power we can all use...    Leo - the son of Hephaestus - is uncertain about revealing his fire powers since everyone believes those who wield fire are cursed. Of course his low self-esteem is rooted in his mother's death, for which he believes he's responsible.  He hides his insecurty behind a wisecracking, tough-talking persona.    You'll thoroughly enjoy the journey of these 3; along the way, meeting your fav characters from Percy books like Annabeth, Thalia, Chiron and a new and vastly entertaining Satyr Gleeson Hedge.  And the ending is not exactly a cliffhanger but it leaves you highly anticipating the next book - The Son of Neptune (we all know who this is!!!!! Yeee-haaaaw!!!).     Pick it up - you'll love Jason as much as Percy, and Piper is a credible follow-up on Annabeth.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Blu-ray helps but doesn't warrant repurchasing the whole set again. .  When you watch these sci-fi classics in HD , its an improvement but not the typical major improvement you usually see when you upgrade to Blu-ray. . One caveat, one of the movies is not helped at all by the Blu-ray upgrade and has a distinct greenish tinge to it (apparently the original was damaged) .  But if you don't already have the trilogy, then blu-ray is the way to go.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Well I've always loved the Sound of Music, since I was a kid. And now finally it's on Blu-ray at last.  As soon as you pop it in (It does take a LONG time to load on my LG BD-390 which in normally fast),  you will notice a HUGE difference from anything you've seen in the past.    This Box Set is very nice. The kids got a kick out of The Hand Painted Music Box included.  Everything else is great too ... Souvenir reprint, Snapshots (Postcards), Hardcover Book.  Very nice presentation when you open it up, and it was shipped in it's own special box  to insure a safe delivery.    One little gripe .. The CD that's included does not match the one being sold individually.  The box says there are 16 tracks, but there's actually 17. The unlisted track is My Favorite Things  which I think is by Lea Michele. On the disc being sold individually there are 24 tracks.   Some are reprise songs, so maybe that doesn't matter, but we are missing Laendler, Entr acte & Finale.  Since this is the Super Box Set, I wish that they had included the full CD as well.

B0047S1KMS|5.0|This was shown finally , unedited on american tv in 2010 on a cable channel. why it took that long is beyond me. This show is a great zombie show that ties into 'big brother' the 'reality' tv series. As much as I loved this series I can't say the same about the bb series it's spun off of. This is like a george romero zombie flick because it lampoons the shallowness of the people in reality tv land. And in the way hordes of zombies keep coming because this was 'like a religion to them' , this is a borrowed idea from the original classic 'dawn of the dead' where they kept coming to the mall. In this one the zombies move faster like the newer version of 'dawn of the dead' or the modern classic \\"28 days later'.  There is humour in this like a romero flick and lots of gore and cussing too. The characters are generally not very likeable , there are a few decent folks in this one but that's not the point , life is filled with self important narcisistic people and they really exist in show biz so that's all the more realistic. Ironically the great new zombie series on amc 'the walking dead' was on at the same time! not to worry that one will be around for a while because it's awesome. This one is worth owning though , it moves fast and delivers in dread and gore and doesn't give you a cheap ending either.

1439177783|5.0|This brutally honest account of Portia de Rossi's life is shocking, emotional, and completely spellbinding. Portia bravely takes us to her darkest hour of insecurity and self hate as this memoir impetuously weaves in and out of her childhood, her days on the set of Ally McBeal, and falling in love with her wife, Ellen DeGeneres.     Born Amanda Rogers, this over achieving preteen strives to be anything but ordinary. Mediocre is clearly not her thing and she proves that early on by not only beginning a modeling career at twelve, but also by changing her name to Portia de Rossi by the time she reached age fifteen. Shortly following being criticized about her adolescent body does her long and unhealthy journey with crash dieting, binging, purging, excessive exercising, and starving herself begin. Through years of modeling Portia picked up weight loss strategies such as eating only three hundred calories a day and taking laxatives. She routinely dropped weight rapidly this way before a modeling gig, but was thrust into a whole new realm of unexpected self perception when she joined the cast of hit show, Ally McBeal. She instantly felt pressure to be more stylish, prettier, and of course, thinner. Her level is self discipline skyrocketed as she would fallaciously feel unworthy and unprofessional when she would show up to a fitting and be bigger than a size four.     Being controlled by food wasn't Portia's only dilemma, hiding her sexuality ranked pretty highly as well. Portia was constantly worried about her secret being revealed and even had anxiety over the possibility of the paparazzi and tabloids getting wind of the information she was desperately trying to keep under wraps. Only after her ex-husband leaves her and runs off with her brother's wife, does Portia come out to her mother and brother. Her mother seems very supportive and expresses that she loves her daughter no matter what; however, in the same breath, her mother goes on to suggest that she keep her sexual preference a secret. Not only a secret from their extended family, but Hollywood as well claiming that is simply isn't their business. Surely that felt like a slap in the face. Voyeuristically we witness bits and pieces of Portia's female love interests, whether the women feel the same way or not. We spectate her path to self-discovery and more importantly, self-acceptance.     For years no matter how well Portia did she never believed she is good enough. No matter how beautiful she looked, she still felt self-conscious. If simple words like \\"normal\\", or \\"womanly\\" were used to describe her, it would set off an episode of harmful ways to be thinner, eventually landing her at only eighty two pounds. This memoir does not shy away from graphic or intimate moments. It is straight forward, rough, and in your face, but in the best and most descriptive ways possible. These pages come directly from the brain of an eating disorder survivor, and shed light on issues from a completely new perspective. Refreshingly, Portia is clearly not afraid to show us exactly how, self proclaimed \\"insane\\" and \\"crazy\\" she was at certain points in her life. For example, she comprehensibly explains how she would eat Cheetos so the orange color would be a marker of where she was in the process when she proceeded to throw up after binge eating. She vividly describes how she would secretly stuff her face in her car, jab her fingers down her throat, accidentally cutting her gag reflect with her nails, and throw up in the street. She would then take off the shirt under her sweater to wipe her face and hands and head in the house where her brother is like nothing happened. I definitely commend her for this vulnerable writing. I cannot imagine the strength it took to reveal this information, including her flaws, her sick repetitious behavior, and also the way she would belittle herself aloud. I'm sure it felt great airing some of these things and getting them off her chest for good and if this memoir helps but one person then I'm sure it will all be worth it. This tale is a bit disturbing at times but it turns out to be extremely uplifting, and inspiring as well as intellectually written without being pretentious. Portia was absolutely correct when saying this book is for anyone who has ever been on a diet, that alone will make this chronicle relatable.
B000O599WG|4.0|John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan - what more can one ask in a western? Comedy, action, songs, and the inevitable good-over-evil make a great story.  Throw in a young Angie Dickinson, and you get a great show.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is the first dvd of a television show I've purchased. It is so good I had to own a copy.  The audio commentarys by the actors on some of the episodes is great, hearing the actors talk about what went into the production of the various scenes is great.  The deleted scenes added in make it worth buying the dvd.   I would reccomend this dvd to anyone who likes fantasy, action packed stories. If you read the books it is fun to see the differences and the things that are the same.  If you only bought season 1, season 2 is even better.
630469654X|4.0|A fun tale of magic, medieval times, and romance.  The lovely lady-hawk Michelle Pfeiffer, the lovable thief Matthew Broderick, and knight Rutger Hauer make this an action/fantasy to enjoy.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This is my faviore show.  I've never purchased dvd of a show before Legend of the Seeker, the show is so good that I just had to own it so I could watch it whenever I want.  Season 2 is more compelling with lots of action and great plots.  My faviorte charactor is Cara. The relationships of the main characters that have developed this season are great.  The only thing I wish there would have been  more behind the scenes additions and the audio commentarys as in the season 1 dvd.  I really liked the Mord-sisth piece with Cara.   Anyone who has read the books would love the show it brings to life the charactors and the story even though there are some differences.  I hope there will be more seasons as it is a great show.
B0001907DA|4.0|I always used to get stares when, as a peace officer, I was asked which movie was closer to reality as far a police work was concerned, and I told them 'Police Academy'.  All of us in police work can point to our Tackleberrys, Hightowers, Hooks, and Mahoneys. This has the whole set.  They did decline in quality as the series progressed, but while the first several were the best, the characters are enjoyable to the end.  Now in one boxed set - what more can one ask?
B003YBNRHU|5.0|Love the DB and have since the 70's. This CD was a long time coming and worth the purchase. You will enjoy it,
B003IY48PS|1.0|I had always told myself that I would never watch Evil Dead after seeing the trailer back when I was a kid.  The movie looked weak even way back then. Well, My cousin decided to play the movie tonight at his house, and boy oh boy, I wish I had back that time of my life.  The movie is comedic to the point, where it makes it stupid.  The guy gets covered in blood in one scene, and in that same scene his face is magically clean again.  Then in part 2 he connects a chainsaw to the wrist of where he cut his hand off.  It is just retarded, and lame!  I seriously don't see how this movie gets such good reviews.  I think it sucked
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Frequently called a classic, this book uniquely presents war from the foot soldier's perspective.  For those of us who have never served, it describes in detail the revulsion of war.  Many works tend to glamorize the battles, but this does just the opposite.  So much so that at times, it seems that Sledge, who never rose above Private, concentrates too hard on showing the horror of war.  Yet that obviously was the reason for his book and in that he succeeded.  R.V. Burgin, another NCO who was also in the same company as Sledge, found him to be too hard on Officers.  The book is obviously written from a strong point of view that war is nasty, brutal and life in it is usually short.  It is hard to disagree with that.  I would recommend this book only to serious students of WWII as the casual reader will be disenchanted.
1439177783|5.0|As the previous reviewer has pretty much summarised the entire book (!) I'll just say that this is an honest, moving and well written account of a dark time in Portia's life. It was hard to read how she brought herself close to death, keeping herself on a tiny allowance of calories and strenuous exercise (in high heels at times). I know Hollywood expects women to be thin, but I was saddened to read her accounts of costume fittings - where she was humiliated for being anything other than 'stick thin'.    I loved the story about meeting Ellen in 2001 at a concert, when Ellen invited her over to her house along with other guests. Portia thought she was just being polite, but it turned out that Ellen had only invited the other people over so she would have the excuse of a party to invite Portia. So Ellen was stuck with having to entertain all those people that night!    I think coming out as a lesbian in Hollywood is still a risky move (how many others are there? not many) and Portia is an inspiration to other women who are coming to terms with their sexuality and trying to live their life honestly. Well done Portia, from a fellow Aussie :)
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Wonderful cd. I love it. Nice arrangements, solos, choice of songs, has everything. I saw Eric play at the Fillmore in 1967, very powerful an loud as hell, but the talent was there for sure. He still 'has' it!
B0029LHW68|5.0|This new album by 30STM recognizes the bands abilities to change genres and still sound amazing. Every Song on this album are very unique and compliments to Jared Leto for a great vocal performance (definitley worth a Grammy).  1. Escape: 9/10- This is a great opener which at the end is extremely powerful.  2. Night of the Hunter: 9/10- At the beginning of the albums release this was my favorite song on the album but one other song caught my ear. Very intesne drums and has a very progressive rock edge to it. Creepy lyrics but always a great listen.  3. Kings & Queens: 9/10- This is the lead off single from this album and it deserves it because its powerful and his vocals soar throughout the song. The music video is also pretty good for this song, you may want to check it out.  4. This is War: 9/10- For a little while this was my favorite song on the album because I loved the powerful chorus. Everything about this song is great.  5. 100 Suns: 3/10- After awhile I get annoyed by this song because it possesses no real enthusiasim and no real emotion which makes the song kind of boring. I guess you could say the lyrics work well with the rest of the album.  6. Hurricane: 8/10- At first I thought I was going to hate it because it had Kanye West on it but I take it all back because the version with Kanye West is so much better than the one that is placed ont he album. I love the vocals and synths and thats the reason why I keep listening.  7. Closer to the Edge: 10/10- Best song on the album hands down. I love the alternative feel and then the pop and progressive feel kicking in. The vocals are just amazing and inspirational. The music video for this song it really good too. Make this one a number one hit.  8. Vox Populi: 9/10- I love the kid chorus in the background of the song. The song is very powerful and I love how great the drummer is in this song.  9. Search and Destroy: 5/10- I would have to say that this is the weakest full length song on the album. It just dosen't catach my attention as much. I'm not saying its a bad song but its one of those I skip over when I'm listening to the entire album.  10. Alibi: 10/10- Great song, one of the best ballads I've ever listened to. This is one to download off of Itunes If your not going to buy the entire album.  11. Stranger in a Strange Land: 9/10- A very electronic song but one of the best songs on the album. I just love the opening, I get overjoyed by that cool electro Rock beat.  12. L490: 7/10- A good song, not sure of its purpose on the album but a very good insturmental. Their is some monks in the background I'm guessing that symbolizes something.  Well, Their you have it a complete overview of the album. I saw that their wasn't one so I made one. This is one for your CD collection
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I kind of liked this movie better than the first movie, but still not as much as the show. I like the characters themselves, not just the fashion. I thought the first movie concentrated too much on the clothes and not the people. I thought so much of the last one focused on the clothes...they never did that in the show too frequently. The fashion was there then, but it wasn't really the point. Okay, the Lucy Liu Birkin bag episode, the Blahnik Sedaraby shoe shame, maybe the Roberto Cavalli shredded dress, the ruined Louboutins, the scrunchie...the items were prominently featured, but they didn't really focus on them too too much over the story.<br /><br />This film did seem to focus more on the interplay of the girls rather than the objects, I liked that. The wedding at the beginning seemed like it didn't really fit at all....almost like I was watching one episode of the show, then the movie begins. I did miss \\"the City\\"...I mean, much of the film is the girls in Abu Dhabi, which was fun for a while, but....meh. I wasn't sure if they were trying to make us LIKE the UAE, or dislike it (but I certainly don't want to go there now!) Still, I mostly wanted the girls AND New York.<br /><br />Overall, I did think there was more interaction with the girls, and I liked that. The story was unusual and even seemed forced at times. I never really thought Aidan went together very well, so it was odd to bring him back. And the behavior of each girl seemed too \\"themselves\\" even too much of their own stereotypes, they never seemed to break out of that much...which is when it gets interesting (like when Charlotte gets a little wild or Miranda gets emotional, etc.) But for some reason, they seemed like more like the girls I knew and loved all those years ago. Wish they would have been home! I am glad I bought it though. I like to watch all the episodes chronologically sometimes (over the course of a few weeks!!) and now I have another 2 hours!!
B003YBNRHU|5.0|So wonderful tohave new music fromone of my all time favorite groups...just saw them at Ironstone this last summer. What a treat, especially to get it so soom after it ws released to the stores. When you live in the mountains sometimes it takes forever to get something new. THANKS AMAZON.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|This set is a welcome change to the normal remaster of the same material. at least there is a different version to enjoy this time. Lennon's vocals are superb, and the clarity is outstanding. I suggest you buy this NOW!
030726999X|5.0|As psyched as I am about the film version of this book out in major release, I find myself picking this last chapter of the trilogy up off the shelf for one last read. The Lisbeth Salander character will be talked about 50 years from now.<br /><br />Steig Larsson, RIP!
B000MV8AE0|5.0|A positively beautiful movie. I rank it up there with \\"The Last Station\\", films that should receive rave reviews and world recognition.
B000A7DVRC|5.0|Hilarious, over the top story of men gone back to cave-man nature in a modern world
B00005QHV5|5.0|The remastering is absolutely wonderfull.The sound is perfect.We hear almost all the instruments.This is by far my favorite Beethoven's symphonies cycle.Gunter Wand gives all we want in this experience of pure music...dynamics, rich colors of the orchestra, emotions... A classic conducting of a classic masterwork. Highly recommanded!
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Quite the dramatic series. It was hard not to watch the whole first season in one take.  Looking forward to the next series.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|I found the first season of SONS well-done but I kept my distance. The closest I've been to this culture has been working in a prison (they all watch the show and love it). I had a hard time empathizing and worrying whether the Sons should do a gun deal, drug deal or increase their commitment to porn. Like the SOPRANOS we are asked to identify with lawbreakers, albeit ones who are supposed to watch over the town in some obscure way. At first I found Tara's relationship with Jax incomprehensible as well. I mean we know about the whole \\"women who love bad boys\\" thing but this woman was a damn doctor--how did she become one with so little sense? The Second Season helped me overcome all my quibbles with show. Seeing Tara bully the hospital administrator has got to be one of the all-time empowering scenes for women. Drop your wimpy stance and punch somebody. Yeah! Gemma is amazing, too. \\"God wants me to be a fierce mother.\\" Whoa, now that is one heck of a fresh take on empowerment. While at times it reminds me a bit too much of that 70s movie The Warriors (each sub-sub gang clearly defined by ethnicity and stance) I have accepted that the Sons are \\"good outlaws\\" who just happen to make a living doing things that, well, in California may not be illegal that much longer. The finale for Season Two was masterful. If I was a bass, I'd say I swallowed this hook. After a bit of a wobbly ride getting starting, this show has a clear shot for a long straight ride until the gas runs out. (I gave it a four as I reserve fives for proven masterpieces).
0525951652|1.0|I am a great fan of Ken follett but find his pricing on Fall of Giants to be out of line.  No printing expence, no paper,no ink, etc.  Read a great number of his books but will wait until this comes down in price
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|I have to say the movie looks very rich and detailed on Blu. The film also has a good pace and the characters fare quite well given the situations they are put into. Also the idea of humans also being Predators is an interesting twist rather than have the creatures share most of the glory.<br /><br />Extras are very decent.
B0000A0DXA|1.0|I agree that this is a horrible film.  When I ordered Boogeyman 2, I expected something that at least somewhat followed the first Boogeyman film.  I left a review on the other Boogeyman 2 film (I guess there are 2 versions??), as that film is what I thought I would be receiving.  That's the film I want to see.  Please don't waste your money on this version.  Let the Boogeyman have this film.  Please, if anyone sees him, tell him he can have my copy.
034544678X|5.0|Insightful book. I didn't read too many pages before I was getting useful information from it for working with my dogs.
B000XUUQQK|2.0|I must be in a time warp.  The Boogeyman 2 I just received stars John Carradine and is directed by Bruce Starr & Ulli Lommel.  It is nothing like the movie description reviewed by the others.  Where did this one come from?  It looks like a low budget movie from the 1970's.  (Is it??)  I just finished watching Boogeyman (which I liked), and popped Boogeyman 2 in the machine to continue what I thought would be a similar story.  The version I have is horrible. I actually wish the Boogeyman would come out of the closet and take this DVD with him.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|excellent price, service, quality--you can't go wrong dealing with this vendor!  dvd can be watched in german, english or french, or in the original german with english or french subtitles.
1569242739|5.0|I love cupcakes and am not vegan. This book's recipes are largely replacing the non-vegan cupcake recipes in my life. The basic chocolate cupcake, in particular, is a perfect balance of sweetness. For birthdays, I've made the rose water pistachio (wonderful and light). For weddings, I have made the chocolate (the best chocolate recipe I have found). The book is also helpful in giving you insight into substitutions you can use in your baking outside of the cupcake world. Overall, a tried and true, go to cookbook in our household.
B00079FUI6|4.0|Great Show, received in quick time of delivery, DVD in case was loose but worked fine. Will order from this company again, great customer service.
1439148953|4.0|A great read.   If you grew up in Brooklyn or anywhere in the 50 and 60's, even better.   Now looking forward to reading Mr. Toibin's other novels.
158270208X|5.0|As a companion book to The Secret, this is excellent. It is mostly a blank book but be sure to read the directions and follow them completely--it is the key to the success of the book.<br />  I found that the instructions made my commitment to doing the blank pages every day very helpful. And by completing the blank pages with the tips along the way, I was able to focus on what I really wanted, not what I thought I wanted. It helps save a lot of time chasing rainbows that you don't really want.<br />  Be prepared to do the work. This is a blank book you fill.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie since I was a kid and I loved it then and I still love it.
B003BKF696|5.0|The casual reader of reviews appearing in amazon.com may wonder what the significance is of a review of a CD at a stage when there already appear in excess of 70 reviews.  It is quite simple.  The latest delivery by the National is such a jewel that the number of potential reviewers is not a closed or limited group.  The National has from their first CD,been favorites of the critics and quite rightly so.  I do not propose that this is necessarily their best cd thus far,but in a year where there have been some excellent releases(neil young's le noise, the latest robert plant and bonni prince billy springs to mind)this CD really holds its own.  From track 1 the national enfolds the listener in music which is brilliant,lyrics which are intelligent descriptions of love,despair and similar human emotions.  'SORROW FOUND ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG\\",announces the second track.  One sentence so beautifully crafted,and this sets the tone for the remainder of the album.  I confidently predict that this CD will feature prominently when reviewers compile their albums of the year.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|There's something for everyone on this album -everyone who loves Christmas and Carey's voice- and yet neither the quality or cohesiveness of the work are compromised.    A thrilling experience, Merry Christmas II You evokes fond memories of wintertimes; and where there's none, it proves to be very inspirational. To quote from the original 'Christmas Time Is in The Air Again' \\"Mr. Grinch simply can't resist/Warming up when he looks our way\\".      While Mariah Carey's first holiday album 'Merry Christmas' gave us the adored gem of a song 'All I Want For Christmas Is You', it was mainly a record that focused on the young artist and showcasing her talents. Far less self-conscious, 'Merry Christmas II You' puts YOU, the listener, center-stage. Here's a track-to-track analysis as to how it achieves that:    Santa Claus Is Coming to Town: A half-minute intro with NO VOCALS, it will warm your way to this sonic ride with bells and a timeless Christmas melody.    Oh Santa!: The album vocal opener is a festive fusion of Christmas bells, claps and background vocals over which Mariah's lyrics and voice race with the exuberance that often fills our hearts when we realize the holiday is fast approaching.     O Little Town of Bethlehem/Little Drummer Boy Medley: The first traditional song shares with its predecessor the magical sounds and sonic twinkles, gradually braking the rapid pace to the beat of the classic drum and vocal soaring of Mariah.      Christmas Time Is in The Air Again: The pace is slow and warm now, giving more room for a song that is more about content than distracting production. The lyrics and delivery of the those are evocative and heart-warming. Snuggle up with hot chocolate for full enjoyment.    The First Noel/Born Is The King: Another solid medley that takes its time, as Mariah Carey's signature melismatic unwrap the word 'Noel', sounding it out over and over again until the ambiance of the song becomes that of transcendental bliss. Twenty seconds after the 3 minute mark, the same treatment is given to 'Born Is The King' for a magical ending.    When Christmas Comes: This Jazzy number introduces horns and picks up the pace. A classic Mariah Carey mid-tempo cut, this song is reminiscent of 'The Emancipation of Mimi', which was in many ways a gift to Carey, her fans, and avid music listeners.    Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)/Housetop Celebration: A song done right! Yes, the beat is faster, and the voice more restrained, but that is for a greater overall effect: the chorus and Christmas 'noise' will remind you of Christmas classics you watched on TV.    Charlie Brown Christmas: Thoroughly reimagined, this song carries on with the same feeling of inner joy, warmth and transcendental music. This song paves way to the album's undeniable true gift.    O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus (feat. Patricia Carey): Significant on so many levels, and powerful beyond comprehension, this song finds Mariah Carey FINALLY introducing her listeners to the voice that molded her. Patricia's operatic voice and Mariah's stratospherically high notes blend and race to deliver THE BEST version of this Christmas classic. Your jaw will drop.    O Holy Night -Live from WPC In South Central Los Angeles: Another grand song, the live version of O Holy Night overflows with Carey's unmatchable vocal runs and high notes.  Goose bumps and smiling heart, you will be transported to the middle of a Christmas concert.    One Child: By this song, you realize that Mariah Carey has enlisted grand choirs for the last three songs, taking you from one-on-one late-night-by-the-Christmas-tree vocal rides to communal festivities. 'One Child' is a beautiful song with a choir of children that will take you back to those school productions with your parents and/or children.     All I Want For Christmas Is You -Extra Festive: Indeed, this album is 'II You'. Mariah knows that this song is the modern Christmas classic that EVERYONE sings alongto: at work, in school, on the way to the market, everywhere! And what better way to make it extra festive than to introduce it with the joyous chorus that we love to sing on the top of our lungs?!!    Auld Lang Syne -The New Year's Anthem: BEST VERSION of the song E.V.E.R.! The big vocals in the intro, the countdown, and the repetition of the chorus over dance music, Mariah's laughs and ad-libs -everything about this song is done to add cheer to your new year eve celebration!     This album overflows with Christmas cheer and transcendental festive moments. It will make your Christmas that much merrier. A great gift and a solid work.
B0000024YL|5.0|These songs are iconic of the time period they come from.  They bring back the memories of the late 60s/early 70s.  I love this CD
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This is one of the best movies I ever saw. As others had already pointed out, it is not strictly an action movie. But it a suspense movie that maintain your attention untill the end. The exact plot is not totally understandable, but the important thing is that we feel that life is a so fragile and virtual thing if compared with guns. Guns are forever, they last much more than butterflies. To be alive is a potential risk and a real danger: this is your sensation during the film, the sensation that something will happen, tragically and unexpectedly.
1401227821|5.0|If you're a fan of Adam Hughes and his uncanny ability to capture the female form it's a must have! Hard cover recommended.
144471032X|4.0|Great Book and is really working for my husband and I. Would recommend to anyone who loves meat. If you don't you won't be able to handle this diet.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Love, love, love this show. Really wanted to hate it so bad but after the first 10 minutes I was hooked. I owned all the episodes on iTunes but I wanted all the special features. Totally worth the money. The first half, what was Volume 1 the special features aren't great but the last half or Volume 2 really make up for it. Season 2 on DVD should be just that much better. Can't wait.
1853260436|2.0|First let me say, I like Jane Austen. I'm not kissing up to my wife, and I don't feel less masculine in admitting it. I like good writing, and Austen is clearly a good storyteller.    That said, I'm not always really into the subject matter of her stories - romance, coming of age, etc. But she writes well enough that I generally want to keep reading. Additionally, I've always enjoyed the many film adaptations of her books.    But I wasn't crazy about Northanger Abbey. It was her first novel, and you can tell. The story is painfully slow, the characters (except for the heroine) are underdeveloped, and in general the love story feels very Jr. High (except with wealth and British accents).    If you're reading the whole Austen corpus, then by all means read this. But if you are picking and choosing, I'd put Northanger Abbey at the bottom of the list.
B000066C1N|5.0|I was so glad to find this album. I heard it on amovie that was pretty old and was not sure I would be able to find it so easily. Thanks so much!!
0525951652|5.0|I have always loved Ken Follett's books and this one is no exception.  It gives a wonderful depiction of life during WW1.
B002ZG9846|1.0|As I stated in the title this movie is absurd and amoral. Many of my friends call me a hypocrite because I call the idea of Hit Girl immoral yet I love the anime Gunslinger Girl. In my opinion Hit Girl is very different from the girls in Gunslinger Girl. In Gunslinger Girl you are supposed to feel bad for this girls much like one does for child soldiers. In Kick Ass Hit Girl is portrayed more like a hero than a victim and imo that's just plain wrong. Also the entire movie is just absurd. Unlike in Gunslinger Girl, Hit Girl's physical abilities are not augmented at all so her being able to do a lot of what she does is likely impossible. Anyone feel free to contradict me with medical evidence but I highly doubt any 12 year old can take out a bunch of trained men 1'+ taller than her and 100 lbs heavier.<br />Furthermore the entire idea of the character Kick Ass is ridiculous. I would die laughing to see a real life guy with his physique and little martial arts and weapons training be able to survive for a second against the stuff he did. I guess it seems I am in the minority in hating this movie and imo that's a sad fact in itself.
1607882302|5.0|This book was funny, insightful, personal, and straight-forward. Tony Hsieh puts his life out on the page for everyone to read.  His experiences in childhood are used to show how tenacity and failure can propel you towards success over time. Eventhough he experienced success financially early in his twenties, he risked his personal nestegg to grow professionally and personally. It is inspiring to learn of the culture he has created at Zappos.com, his encouragement of professional development of his employees, and his adherence to core values within the company. Other CEOs should look at this model. I hope Business programs across the country will study this, because Generation X and younger want to make a difference in this world through their professional work and personal/community service. These employees want to have meaning and purpose in their work. We better wake up, take some risks, and trust our employees!  Thanks for writing this book, Tony!!
B000059HAI|5.0|There is plenty of real-life drama associated with this historic event not to need to clutter it up with a fictitious love triangle, as in the recent movie, \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  This earlier movie depicts political and military events and decisions leading up to the attack by naval units of the Empire of Japan on the US Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor, HI.  I like the use of the Japanese language with subtitles for the Japanese characters...it added a sense of realism not obtainable another way.<br /><br />The behind the scenes view of this film, including the goings-on inside the Japanese embassy in Washington D.C., the US military's ability to read Japan's diplomatic code, and the clues it gave all contribute to the realism.  The tension is almost palpable as coded messages come in and are broken, and middle-level military personnel try to get high ranking leaders to act.<br /><br />At the same time, the discord between the Japanese naval and army leaders provides insight into the fact that there was not unanimity on the decision to go to war, but a reluctant acceptance that an attack was unavoidable...so it was planned and carried out, extremely well.<br /><br />The special effects are somewhat dated, but this is a film that military history buffs will appreciate.<br /><br />5 stars for realism, acting, and overall presentation.  Thanks!
0674049160|5.0|A beautifully produced book. Excellent value for money. Can't change the magnificance of the original story but Patricia's annotations add to the depth of the story.  Some of the annotations are a bit odd though, defining words that are very obvious, for example on the first page the description that \\"Netherfield Park is let\\", do we have to be told \\"let\\" means \\"rented\\"?  Otherwise the only difficulty is trying to keep the story going and read the book itself.
B003PIUC02|5.0|This is the single most historically accurate film / series on the Roman empire I have ever seen.  It becomes immediately obvious that the series was heavily inspired by [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300 (Widescreen Edition)]].  Of course, there is certainly nothing wrong w/that as both of these films were quite well done.<br /><br />There are too many tidbits of historical accuracy to mention, but I will point out a few.  In the arena sequences, the gladiators are shown with their sword arms being padded.  This is true to form as the Romans loathed a quick bout.  The last thing they wanted to see was a gladiator with his sword arm disabled as he would not be able to fight back against his adversary.<br /><br />Also, the gladiators did collect their sweat, mostly for wealthy Roman matrons who wanted to use it to remove wrinkles & improve their  health.  One of the gladiators is a freeman instead of a slave.  This has historical veracity as well as occasionally people in dire financial straits would voluntarily become gladiators and bet on themselves to get out of debt.<br /><br />Not a whole lot is known about the historical Spartacus, other than the fact that he was a Thracian slave who was trained to be a gladiator at a gladiatorial school (known as a ludus) in the Roman city of Capua.  This allows the writers a great deal of leeway to ad-lib on history.  The result is a remarkable series which takes its time to slowly unfurl the storyline.<br /><br />For a series that stars a bunch of buffed up dudes, the acting is pretty darn good.  As a matter of fact, it's downright exceptional.  Andy Whitfield has a fabulous screen presence and none of the actors portraying gladiators come across as big dumb oafs (thankfully they didn't cast the bland John Cena for the series!).  As was the case for [[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300 (Widescreen Edition)]], the actors go through a month long boot camp to become ripped.<br /><br />SPARTACUS scores very high on the skin-o-meter, which is always a good thing. Also, the gladiator bouts are not for the squeamish.  It's good to see that Lucy Lawless has no qualms about nudity, now that her XENA days are over.  The series does a terrific job of really taking us inside the ludus with all of its brutality & debauchery.<br /><br />This is a series that is bound to be appealing to both men & women.  Men will love it due to all of the action & nudity, while women will be drawn to all of the muscle-bound jocks.  For those who are interested in a fictional account of a female gladiator ludus, I would highly recommend [[ASIN:B0041T4P4S Gladiatrix]].  If Roman history is your gig, then this series is most assuredly for you!hich is always a good thing. Also, the gladiator bouts are not for the squeamish.

B001HN694K|4.0|I loved this movie right from the start. Great special effects, amazing visuals, and great actors. I recommend it to fans of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I love this movie. It is awesome. I loved the story line, the acting, everything. It wasn't just another \\"Zombie\\" flick.
0451228375|4.0|There have been many great reviews already. I just want to add that the audio version, read by John Lee, is very entertaining, even though it is incredibly long (36 CD's!).  It took me about 3 CD's to get completely involved in the story.  Also, I have not read Pillars of the Earth and didn't find that this hampered my enjoyment of this book.
1400064287|4.0|This book was based on a factor from Malcolm Gladwell's book The Tipping Point. Except this book decided to take a deeper dive into the principals of the Stickiness factor. Hence, what makes ideas stick to people mind. I happen to agree with Gladwell's principal and enjoyed how the authors of Made to Stick took a deeper dive into the foundation of the Stickiness factor. This book is an easy read that people can learn from. The ideas were well thought out and reinforced with fairly strong exapmles. Made to Stick could help large and small business people understand how to market to the populace. It will not make you a marketing professional but, it certainly will help point you in the right direction.
B004132HZS|5.0|I was really excited about this series, and it absolutely did not disappoint. As a big fan of the original Doyle works, and the 80s Granada series with Brett, I wasn't expecting to find a new favorite Holmes...but I certainly did. The acting is superb- Benedict Cumberbatch is respectful of the Holmes character, but gives it a modern flair and completely new spin that is sharp and sexy. His delivery of the amazing stories and script (brought to us by the flawless minds behind Dr. Who, Gatiss and Moffat) is a whirlwind. Fantastic. Martin Freeman brings back the real Watson- closer perhaps to John's character as Doyle intended it, moreso than the echelons of bumbling and inferior Watsons we are sometimes given in some translations who amount to little more than a foil to Holmes at best, and comedic relief at worst. He is truly a match and a perfect yin to Holmes' yang....the unsuspecting hero, who appears at first to be very average...but ends up being extraordinary and in his own way, deserving of respect even from a man like Sherlock. Their interaction is natural, believable, the embodiment of Holmes and his man. Martin Freeman is such a great actor- so much in his expression alone, rules this character. The dialogue as well as the unspoken between Benedict and Martin are worth mounds of praise. The rest of the cast is extremely well rounded out, with no weak links whatsoever. I am SMITTEN by this retelling, particularly the last episode, which had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Holmes fits so well into modern London...it's as if he has always belonged. I've heard nary an unkind word said about this series, and I am not alone I'm sure as I wait breathlessly for the continuation next year! What a delight. My only complaint is I wish it were MORE episodes!
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Of course it's an excellent product--it's the freakin' Beatles! Do you honestly need a review to tell you that?
B002H3F7F6|5.0|So, when I first got this album, I was a bit skeptical. It actually took me a bit to get into it, but after listening to it a couple of times, I grew to love it. It's perfect for a cold, windy winter's night, with a roaring fire and a good book. The main reason I love this album, and one of which many others hate it, is Sting's voice. I really don't understand why people are continuing to besmirch his voice. I found it enticing and captivating. He truly portrays each style of music wonderfully, which brings me to my next point. I loved the diversity of the CD also. The different styles of songs keeps you interested and entranced.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into all of the songs, but I will list a few that I really enjoyed and why.<br /><br />1 Soulcake- This particular song is so upbeat it makes you want to dance. This is probably my hands down favorite song on the album. I love the lyrical quality to it, and well, the magic of it. It's absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />2 The Hounds of Winter- This song is very...well I'm not sure how to describe it. The best way I would describe it as a winter trip in the desert. If it were a color tone, it would be sepia. It's just...sad, but not. Like I said, I really don't know how to describe it but I still love it.<br /><br />3 You Only Cross My Mind in Winter- I love listening to this song as I'm going to sleep. It's so very soft and lullaby-esk that it soothes. Its extremely sad and nostalgic but the musical quality to it is beautiful so that it doesn't make me sad, but happy. The flowing notes and words paint images on your mind of a man thinking of his once love, possibly walking in an empty park while its snowing.<br /><br />These are my top favorites, but I love every single song on this album, really. It's a beautiful, heart-breaking, joyful, playful, collection of songs that really stick with you through the winter.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|Being a fan of the group since 2000 and seeing them live twice I was really looking forward to this product coming out.  In my mind they are one of the few bands that brings great energy to any live show they play.  This DVD is great for any fan of the band that likes live music.  I like the set they play on the disasterpieces DVD better just because they only had two CD's out at that point and it was much more heavy, but I have grown with the band so this by no means is a let down or anything.  Great live crowd, and great to see them get top act at the Download Fest.  This DVD also contains all the videos from All Hope Is Gone and a behind the secens movie made by Clown that last's about 90 mins.  The only downfall is that is not in shot Blu-ray but that can not take away my five star rating from a great show put on by a great band.

1582406723|5.0|I actually downloaded The Walking Dead Vol. 1 for free on my iPad, some kind of promotion they're doing for the show.    The artwork looked fantastic on the screen. One of the most innovative features I saw was the 'Guided Read' option. It essentially blows up the pages frame by fame and allows you to really read it the way the author intended. I'm not sure if this is common in digital format graphic novels (as I don't usually partake) but I found this to really draw me into the action.    All in all, a 5-star, no-holds-barred read.     Check it out, you won't be disappointed!

B000I5XOW8|4.0|The Fugitive stands even today as one of the best chase movies ever made.  But I have to say I would disagree about the Academy's decision to give Jones the Oscar.  That year other actors could have received the Oscar John Malkovich for In the Line of Fire, Pete Poseltwete for In the Name of the Father, and Ralph Fiennes for Schindler's List.  I watched this movie several times, Jones does give a good performance but I bet no one expected him to win the Oscar. Jones gives a performance that is so low-key that a moment or two gave a great impression to the Academy.  For example, Jason Robards for both All The President's and Julia, Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine, , Cuba Gooding Jr. for Jerry Maguire and Jack Palance for City Slickers.
B003062NG0|5.0|Amazing...an album of recordings that were not released from the Lightbulb Sun/Stupid Dream era and most bands would sell their soul to have these as a proper release. I'm extremely thankful that PT decided to re-release this out of print album. If you're a fan of the band it's a must, but if you're just finding out about them I recommend grabbing this cd too, it's really a great collection of music.

0805091742|5.0|Most people THINK they know what checklists are about.  After all, we've seen them, used them, even probably been bored to tears by them at work, in school and at home.<br /><br />When I've mentioned the book to people, some kind of nod and tell me they love checklists, use checklists... or else they shrug and admit that checklists don't work for them.  Sometimes, they have something else that's great.<br /><br />They're all wrong.  Unless they've read the book, the way Gawande uses the word checklist is fundamentally different from the way it's often used and abused in our culture.<br /><br />Despite the popular connotations of the word \\"checklist\\", this book is NOT an organizational how-to.  It has little to do (except tangentially) with home management or day-to-day \\"To Do\\" lists.  Most importantly, checklists are NOT about micro-managing every single step in any given process.<br /><br />This book offers instead an overview of how checklists have revolutionized aviation - making it radically safer and more reliable - and how they can be put to use improving quality of service in a number of areas, particularly in medicine, a field where most of us feel that doctors' intuition is more valuable than a set of rote procedures.<br /><br />From his own experience, he relates how studies of checklists have improved surgery in a number of hospitals around the world - even in some of the world's poorest hospitals.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Gawande through all his books, and I admire the way he can turn a critical light on the field of medicine; even on his own practice.<br /><br />One of Gawande's more interesting points is that a checklist which is overly controlling (ie which has too many items) is one that won't get used... and therefore is not likely to help at all.  Checklists, as Gawande envisions them, are about identifying the most critical items, the ones that could ordinarily be overlooked.<br /><br />This book should be required reading in surgical programs - if not in medical schools around the world.  And really, its lessons can be generalized to fit almost any area of expertise or business practice.  Well worth reading; checklists can indeed change the world for the better.ts lessons can be generalized to fit almost any area of expertise or business practice.

I was say a more suspense action like film would suite it better off.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good Storyline<br />Cast<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bad Acting<br />VERY slow pace<br />Un-Realistic - Makes you feel like you are watching something that you already know the truth about, adds to the bore factor...<br /><br />As far as plot and underlines go its all included in the synopsis and descriptions here on A and I don't need to repeat it cause this ones doeskin deserve it!
B000J10ERO|3.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Christopher Reeve casts an immense shadow over the entire \\"Superman\\" legend.  His well-chronicled brilliance in the role even somewhat bossed parts of this movie into being a pale copy of some lines and scenes from mostly the original Richard Donner \\"Superman\\" film.  The problem is, I shouldn't begin a review of \\"Superman Returns\\" by mentioning Christopher Reeve at all.  In short, this movie, directed by Bryan Singer, has a serious identity problem.<br /><br />Here, Brandon Routh steps into the roles of Clark Kent and Superman, becoming the first actor since Mr. Reeve to play the dual role on the big screen.  Routh is merely passable in each role, but doesn't possess the unique charisma required to completely earn either role.  There is a rote sense of being told that it's Clark Kent and Superman and the viewer takes it as a passive fact rather than investing emotionally in a legendary fictional American hero.  That is almost a fatal flaw in itself, but the movie also squanders a fine Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor by foisting recycled bits of Gene Hackman's storyline on him.  Kate Bosworth gives one of the best performances of the movie as Lois Lane.  I love Bosworth's Lois Lane, in part because it was one of the only characterizations that didn't strain to capture some sort of irretrievable original ideal.  Frank Langella as Perry White and Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen are both also marvelous because they are allowed to be authentic to this film.  Eva Marie Saint is excellent as Martha Kent but underutilized.  I wish Anthony Hopkins had been Jor-El for this, as rumored.  As much as I love Marlon Brando's interpretation, the late actor's presence in this movie was an odd reminder of its inferiority to the original \\"Superman\\" movie.  Mr. Hopkins' talent and gravitas would have given this movie its own heft.  John Williams' awesome score is always fun to hear, but is another unneeded anchor on this movie.  Noel Neill and Jack Larson, co-starson the 1950's TV show \\"The Adventures of Superman,\\" have good cameos in this movie.<br /><br />This is a \\"Superman\\" movie that does achieve a unique look.  Metropolis looks extraordinarily modern but in certain artistic ways the movie nods to the 1930's, the decade which produced the first \\"Superman\\" comic book.  The Superman suit itself looks like somewhat of a stylistic throwback to that era.  A Superman who struggles with the affects of the immense tasks he undertakes references the Fleischer Brothers' cartoons of the 1940's as well as \\"Superman: The Animated Series.\\"  There is even a re-creation of the cover art of \\"Action Comics #1.\\"<br /><br />This is a moderately good \\"Superman\\" movie which could have been great if it had mustered the courage to break away from its classic predecessor, and find its own voice.

B0006A9FKA|2.0|Let me state the good before the one bad thing. It's a good movie. It's very funny and very well acted. Very well done, directing and writing. It's an all around good movie. The one bad thing is the usage of the \\"F\\" word. I mean Wow! It's as if the writer of the movie was granted a wish by a Genie for every time he put the \\"F\\" word in the script. There was one scene where I had to mute it and wait for the scene to end before turning the sound back on. I would give this movie five stars. They were lucky I gave it two.

B0039PPW60|2.0|I have over $100,000 in pro sound equipment. I use A&H, Crown, Mackie, JBL and so on. My experience with Behringer is mixed. It is not unusual to buy a new product and have it dead on arrival. So it was with this mixer. I wanted a small and cheap mixer to play with. I did not want to haul the Presonus mixer out every time I needed to mix some narration tracks. The mixer arrived faulty and I returned it. The replacement arrived in A-1 working order and has been faithful to this day. That is the problem with Behringer. They copy other manufacturers, cutting quality,but selling tons of equipment. I have associates who use Behringer and it is \\"OK\\" equipment. But once you taste higher-end equipment you won't go back. It all comes down to budget. If Behringer works for you-go for it. Just make sure you thoroughly test your unit BEFORE you need to use it.
B003VIW8DK|3.0|Okay, this album is rather so so.  Frantic is so much better and because of that I was hoping Olympia would improve on that record.  It doesn't.  Part of the problem is the overproduction.  Olympia is just too clean sounding.  The production tries to hide the limitations of the songs (a constant problem with Ferry) but in the past Rhett Davies (his engineer) has made the sonic textures interesting.  This time around it just sounds flat to me.  HOWEVER...Olympia does contain one of Ferry's best songs ever...it is called \\"Reason or Rhyme\\" and is absolutely top shelf.  A companion piece to the eno/ferry penned \\"I Thought\\" off of Frantic.  Worth the download and them some.  end  kdc

B0039TD7RC|5.0|How else can one review this album other thsn to say that it must be the most compelling and mystifying group of songs ever recorded. I'm sure the Stones had no idea what the hell they were recording at the time. We have a pretty good idea how manic it was in the South of France back in the summer of 71. But isn't that how great things are produced? Out of a mixture of flashes of brilliance, frustraton, exasperation, creativity etc... I hated this album to begin with. But ask me now and I'll tell you it's the most amazing group of songs I've ever heard in one group outing. Some of the songs are so out there...simply blows one away.

B003EV6DBW|3.0|It took me a while to get into this season.  The season started off a bit uneven, the new Doctor just seemed ANGRY(?).  And the plot relied a little too much on Amy getting put in a perilous position and having to 'trust' the Doctor to get her out of it.   But it was quirky and fun and the Doctor seemed to get over his crankiness by the end.

0316069485|4.0|First Sentence:  The last time I'd eaten at the Water Grill I sat across the table from a client who had coldly and calculatedly murdered his wife and her lover, shooting both of them in the face.<br /><br />Jason Jessup has spent the last 24 years in prison, convicted for kidnapping and murdering a 12-year-old girl.  New DNA evidence has won him a new trial, but the LA DA's office can not use one of their own to prosecute the case.  Instead, they hire defense attorney Mickey Haller to switch sides.  Mickey agrees to prosecute the case as long as he runs the case with his ex-wife Maggie McPherson as 2nd chair and LAPD Det. Harry Bosch as investigator.<br /><br />You can never go wrong with a book written by Connelly, and this is one of his better books.  From the very beginning, you are involved and want to keep reading to the last page.  It really is a legal thriller.<br /><br />The story is much more plot-driven, than character-driven.  Certainly there are details of each character's personal life--it wouldn't be realistic without them--but the story focuses on the case.  While that did mean there was less character development than I'd have liked, it made sense with the trajectory of the story.  To do otherwise, may have bogged things down.<br /><br />The drama is split between the investigation and the courtroom.  And drama there is.  Connelly creates an excellent sense of tension without ever going over the top.  When there is threat, it feels real.  When there is emotion; that too is realistic.<br /><br />The courtroom scenes were ones I found fascinating.  From pre-trial, to dealing with the political and media pressures, jury selection, and legal maneuvers, having just served on a criminal-trial jury, it all seemed very real to me.  The ending was not as satisfying as I might have wished, but it was more realistic than a more classic ending.<br /><br />One element I did find disconcerting was the alternating voices.  I do wish it had all been done in third person, but understood why it was not.  However, it was a bit confusing at times.<br /><br />I've always said there is nothing wrong with a \\"Good\\" book.  This was more than \\"Good\\" but still falls in that range.  It is a four-hour, straight-through, airplane read, and that is not meant to be a disparaging term.  It does mean it's a book in which one becomes so engrossed, you can tune out everything else around you, go for the ride, and finally breathe at the end, looking around you to remember where you really are.

B003YP7N9O|5.0|Stand Up is one of my top 5 favorite Tull albums and I was hoping for a deluxe release a la what was done with This Was.  However, when I initially saw this version being discussed online, I too was (a) a bit confused that the Carnegie Hall show was 2/3 of the package (since, really, it belongs with the Benefit album); (b) somewhat disappointed that 5.1 treatment was being given to the Carnegie Hall show and not the studio album (for me, frankly, CH has never been a top go-to when I want a slice of Tull).    However, having now listened to everything several times, I'm pleased and think this purchase was worth the somewhat high cost, especially when I realized what had been edited out of the CH concert on the 25th Anniversary box edition (which, at the time, I assumed was the \\"complete\\" show except for the still-missing Dharma for One).  To my delighted surprise, the concert translates remarkably well to surround - although most of the action is across the front, and the back channels are not used for much (I assume this was done to try to place the listener in the context of an actual concert, with the audience therefore around and in back of one and the band up front), I was reminded of how energetic and well-recorded this date was.  It is also great to finally have this show in a (largely, supposedly) unedited, intact form.  Together with the 1970 Isle of Wight show, fans now have a well-documented period in the early life of Tull.    The studio cd is also nice to have - although it appears to be the same remaster as released in the early 2000's, there are more bonus tracks on this version, making the earlier remaster somewhat redundant now.  The package itself is good-looking, with period pictures that I at least have never before seen.    I therefore recommend this, particularly if you find it at a reasonable price.
B004222UC8|5.0|I've reviewed this album under the regular listing for \\"Eternal Idol.\\" However, the deluxe editions that Sanctuary is doing in the UK are great for all collectors of Sabbath and those who are looking for something different. This is a 3 1/2 to 4 star release, but the bonus CD makes it a 5.<br /><br />Not only do you get the remastered, very underrated album, but you also get a second disc that has the recording with the original vocals laid down by Ray Gillen. Gillen died a few years later from AIDS. That, along with the fact that the release with his vocals has floated around in bootleg circles for years now, makes this a heralded release in many circles. People in the know never thought it would officially see the light of day.<br /><br />The recording of \\"Eternal Idol\\" is legendary insofar as the turmoil surrounding the album. With two weeks to go before its release, Gillen left the band, and Tony Martin came in and recorded over his vocals. Subsequently, Martin would sing on four more Sabbath albums.<br /><br />This release is only available as an import. Rhino has done a great job in their remastering of past Sabbath albums, but these releases won't come out in the US. This, along with \\"Seventh Star,\\" are a must for any Sabbath/Iommi fan.

B003ZK58WM|3.0|My 3 stars is not attributed to the overpriced Kindle cost - which I agree with - but because this could have been a great story but Follett only created a mediocre novel.     The characters are mostly sympathetic, but shallow and predictable. The plot meanders, is often too detailed (i.e. the chapters regarding the Russian Revolution)without any excitement, tension or seeming purpose. And though they are detailed, the dialogue is shallow, not believable and quite frankly, dull. Follett just doesn't flesh out his characters or his back drops. England seems no different than America seems no different than Russia.  The love/sex scenes are juvenile at best.    Even the most exciting sequences were dry and non-explosive. What started out as a seemingly great read, dragged on to be quite pedantic. Very disappointing and I will NOT be looking out for the next edition...
0061122416|3.0|There is no nuance in the \\"Follow Your Dream\\" theme of this fable. Santiago is rewarded for following his dream. Others who don't follow their dreams, like the crystal merchant who does not make the Haj, are shown to be dull and unfulfilled.<br /><br />Santiago's dream is about finding gold. In the process he has a second dream, life with Fatima. While there is a lot of talk about the Language of the World, the Soul of the World, the Elixer of Life, the Philosopher's Stone, etc., the dream is totally materialistic. Similarly, there is a lot of talk about the nature of love, but Santiago's love is for someone he has hardly spoken with.<br /><br />The edition I read had some provocative discussion questions at the end. The framing of two of those questions, seems to belie the theme by their suggestion that dream following might not be appropriate or practical.  The first was \\"Do you think there may be an element of \\"narcissism\\" in pursuit of one's Personal Legend?\\" The third was, \\"Can you think of an example ... when you had to give up something to meet a goal and found the price too high?\\"<br /><br />While the story has charm and is an entertaining read, as literature, which it seems to portray itself as being (the metaphorical dialog and a study guide at the end), it falls short.
0385533829|4.0|When I have the luxury of time, I browse the shelves of real bricks and sticks bookstores, collect a pile of books I'd like to take a closer look at and then settle into one of the comfy chairs so kindly provided by store management and start reading. With some books I need only read a page or two, with others the first couple of chapters. \\"Buy\\" and \\"don't buy\\" piles are made, money changes hands and I feel happy and excited about the adventures in store as I drive home.<br /><br />*sigh* I love books...<br /><br />My point? If I'd never heard of Dan Brown and if The Lost Symbol had been one of those books I decided to take a closer look at, it would have gone into the \\"don't buy\\" pile. The use of \\"adorned\\" twice and \\"the skull cradled in his palms\\" three times in the 3 page prologue would have had me wincing and doubting the skill of both the author and the editor. But I have heard of Brown and I read the DaVinci Code. While The DaVinci Code didn't convince me that Brown is an amazing writer, it did convince me that he could tell an entertaining tale; one that engaged my mind and made me curious about historical events I was previously only vaguely aware of. Some repeated phrases in The Lost Symbol's prologue weren't going to keep me from seeing if The Lost Symbol might be similarly engaging.<br /><br />And is it? Well, not quite...but I still think it's worth the read.<br /><br />Like the DaVinci Code, The Lost Symbol is fast paced and engrossing and the story definitely kept me turning the pages. I know very little about the Freemasons and while I'm forced to admit that they didn't spark quite the same level of interest in me as did the Templars and Mary Magdalene, The Lost Symbol still managed to make me want to learn more about them and some of the other mentioned groups and events. I don't know how much Brown twisted history and fudged facts while writing The Lost Symbol but, in all honesty, it doesn't matter much to me. It's a novel, after all, and I read it as such. For the historical events alluded to in his story that piqued my interest, I can do my own research. Doing just that after reading The DaVinci Code was more than half the fun of that book. So, it could be argued that my enjoyment of The Lost Symbol, now that I've finished reading it, is just beginning.<br /><br />Is The Lost Symbol great literature? Alas, most would concede that it is not. But is it an entertaining read? I vote yes. Certainly, I found it worthy of its place in that \\"buy\\" pile.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Note: I have the illustrated version of The DaVinci Code and was happy to pick up the illustrated version of The Lost Symbol as well. I think they've done a terrific job with these special editions; the design and paper quality are top notch and having photos of places, items and artifacts etc. printed right alongside the text discussing them is well worth the extra cost sometimes charged.

He acknowledges difficulties, but never discusses them in real detail because he wants to focus on the more general notion that great people working together to fulfill a great vision can overcome most anything.  The specifics of the problem matter a lot less.<br /><br />But that's only true to a point.  While I have not experienced financial success anywhere close to Mr. Hsieh's, I related deeply to his story of risking everything to keep his company going and barely surviving through the luck deal here and the miraculous financing there.  The reality is that most folks only hear about entrepreneurial companies when they are finally successful and think that it all happened overnight.  In fact, Hsieh had been working as an entrepreneur and learning that craft for his entire life.  Most entrepreneurs find overnight success after years and years of hard work and terrible sacrifice.  The true test for an entrepreneur comes not from being close to failure and surviving, but what he or she does after losing everything.  In one of Hemingway's books (\\"Death in the Afternoon\\"?) two people are discussing how brave a young bullfighter is for working so close to the bulls.  The other observes that we cannot know how brave he is yet because he hasn't been gored yet.  The bullfighter who is willing to work close to the bull after knowing the pain of the horns and the stomping hooves is the brave one.  Hsieh doesn't come across as knowing what it is like to be gored.  Maybe he has and is hiding it, but I would prefer knowing that story that the one's about his transcendent vision at a rave party.<br /><br />My only problem with the book is Hsieh's deep affection for life as a party.  Yes, we should have wonderful fun.  And life should be enjoyed.  But too much silliness just gets in the way of real pleasure and joy.  Maybe my view comes from being older that Hsieh and seeing things from a different vantage point.  For example, he tells us a story about he and a co-worker driving a truck across country non-stop.  They consumed vast amounts of Red Bull and crashed for 12 hours after they arrived at their destination.  At first we might see this as a story of heroic strength and dedication.  But if we think about it for half a second, they could have stopped TWICE for six hour each, been much safer on the road for themselves and others on the road with them, and arrived ready to work rather than crashing.  I would recommend the safer and less stressful travel method.  I would not think well of an employee who risked his life, the lives of others, and my property because he couldn't do basic arithmetic and realize that rest is essential to functioning well.  Does anybody else remember Dennis Barnhart and his company, Eagle Computer?  The day of the widely anticipated IPO he died crashing his new Ferrari.  A lot of people lost a lot of money because of that accident.  When you run a company, you have to be mindful not only of what you want and what you are trying to do, but all the lives that depend on you accomplishing that work.<br /><br />All in all, this is a rather charming business book.  I don't think it is a business classic, but I am delighted my daughter shared it with me and that Mr. Hsieh took the time to write it.  I guess I will be interested to read how his views deepen and change with another decade in the trenches.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIs like to be gored.

B0043X7WLA|5.0|I promise that there is something here.  I promise that this music is worth listening to, and it contains what is good in people.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I love The Roots and I own all of their music (even Organix and the Live material). With that said, I believe this is the most cohesive album of them all. If you could tell a story through instrumentation this is the way to do it. Every song blends so well into the next one as if it were one big story. Upon inital listen I wasn't feeling the album, sampling each song with 20-30 second snippets. But once I actually had the time I sat there and listened to the album from front to back and was blown away. The instrumentation is on point as always, Thought is and will always be razor sharp and on top of his game. In short, if you're a Roots fan and you enjoy real music you should thoroughly enjoy this album as I have.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|At the risk of reading redundant to all the lambs out there, this is the much-anticipated follow-up to my favorite Christmas CD of all time, the 1994 multi-million Christmas seller by the American diva. I do not buy many CDs nowadays, unless I think I really will be surprised with the product, or if there is a good track record by the artist in my book. Though I like MC a lot, I find her earlier releases stronger than their followers. Still, I like her music though I do not consider myself one of her lambs per se. But since the 1994 release has been held in such high standards, needless to say, even before buying the CD I expected MC to take me into the heat of the forthcoming holidays. So, let's dive into the meat of things...    The packaging is standard, but nice. Looking at it put me in the mood. That also raised my expectations. It looks very festive, with a night cover (vs. the day scene of the previous CD). Great, I thought, something even sleeker than the previous one. Now, as I got the CD out of the case and ever so gently inserted it into my car player, I was ready to embark onto a great little adventure driving through Minnesota, as I would be listening to the 13 little gifts MC has laid to our feet. Yes, 13! That's 2 more than the previous CD!    Track 1: Very sleek arrangements. I love it already! The excitement is palpable. I feel like Santa is getting closer as the seconds go by. Literally, 23 seconds, I am thrown into a new realm. I did not expect this to be so short, but read closely. Yes, it is just an intro to MC's new Christmas world. Nice smooth transition though to what many hope to be MC's response to ALL SHE WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS, which is...    ...Track 2: OH SANTA: I feel like I have been transposed from my car to a reindeer sleigh. It has the vibe to the first perennial penned MC Christmas track, with a little something more...I think. Over the past couple of weeks, it has grown on me. I still think that all she wanted for Christmas was a tad better, but there we are.    Track 3: Nice medley of two classics: O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM/DRUMMER BOY. I honestly never liked the little drummer boy, but it is well done here. The beginning of the song is a little too nasal for me, but then it picks up at the 2 min mark. I would say this is decent.    Track 4: Very nice original track by MC. It's got a nice little jazzy sound to it. I wish it were less whispery, until our little bird soars into more of a voice at the 1:48 mark.    Track 5: This is an OK track. Very tender interpretation, but a bit whispery.    Track 6: The track is not very festive. Sounds like what she's been doing on other albums since 2005.     Track 7: Another medley mixing HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS and an original by MC called HOUSETOP CELEBRATION. Actually that one's got a nice groove to it. Nothing spectacular, but OK.    Track 8: I never loved the CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS, but she does OK. Very subdued, which works for me in this song. I do not know whether it is because of the Carpenters' version, but it works for me.     Track 9: The irony of this song is that this faithful listener may abandon this version for Celine's. It seems to lack some soul. MC also immortalized her mother's voice on this track. It ends better than it starts.     Track 10: Now there is a highlight. A live performance of my favorite version of OH HOLY NIGHT live. I think this was recorded about 10 years ago at the WPC in South Central LA. Honestly, this is what I expected the entire CD to be like, much like the previous one (can you foretell this one may not fare as well as the previous release in my book?). The great thing is that MC really sings it very well. It sounds very natural. That is the voice I miss.     Track 11: Kind of sounds like a filler to me. A bit dull...    Track 12: A new version of ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS. This one is dubbed as \\"Extra Festive\\". It starts great, just like track 1. And then, blah! It seems like nothing more than a re-arranged copy of something we know. Not much better. I actually liked the original better. The additional layers do nothing more for me, but frustrate me because I expected something already festive to be more festive. Sometimes, things are better left alone. Don't get me wrong. This is not terrible. It's just nothing new. An additional track that is not really a new track.    Track 13: Ring in the New Year. like most intros to the songs in this album, this one is nice. She sings (vs. whisper). It's got a good vibe. Reminds me of the vibe that JOY TO THE WORLD brought to the previous CD, with a little less something.     So, overall, I do not like this CD as much as I thought I would. A big expectation with average results. Maybe it will grow on me over the next few weeks. The track listing is somewhat deceiving as you really just get 10 real new tracks. I doubt it will be as perennial as its predecessor, but it is OK. I also wish lyrics had been included, which I always enjoy reading. The anticipation for this album will probably make it do well in the charts. There has been a lot of marketing surrounding this release, but I doubt it will be as successful as the first CD. I give it 4**** because I like MC, but if you just wanted a Christmas CD, it would probably be 3*** with the live #10 track as well as the intro track that make it enjoyable to listen to.

1400023343|5.0|In the Spanish music and movement program for young children that  I direct, I recommend Barbara Pearson's book to all the parents, whether they come from monolingual or multilingual homes.    I find the book very encouraging. My husband and I (both native  speakers of English) are raising our three children bilingually. I re-read parts of the book when I want to be re-energized, sometimes to find what our next steps are, sometimes just to be reminded why we're doing it. With young children in the house, it took me a little while to get around to reading the sections with background information about bilinguals, but when I did, I found them fascinating and accessible.    I don't understand how someone can think this book is not  objective. Pearson addresses so many different scenarios and types of bilingual households that it's easy to find yourself in the book. I feel she bends over backwards to include as many different perspectives as possible, including people who tried to raise a bilingual child, but let it go. She is practical and realistic. She lets you know that bilingualism doesn't just happen unless someone helps it happen. It takes commitment and a certain amount of outside help, which isn't always available.    I keep a couple of copies on hand, and lend them to people when they have questions I can't answer. I am thrilled that it's just been published in Spanish - Hijo Bilingüe - so now I can recommend the book to my Spanish speaking families as well.

0525421580|5.0|I was a little worried when I started Will Grayson, Will Grayson. I've read Looking for Alaska by John Green and I loved it. But I was really worried about how they were going to pull off having two main characters with the same name. I was worried it would get confused and I wouldn't know which one was speaking and etc.<br /><br />Honestly? It wasn't a problem at all. Mainly because the stylistic differences in the writing/printing of the book, but also because of the two vastly different lives the two Will Grayson's led.<br /><br />In the end, I didn't have a favourite Will Grayson. At first I really liked the first one better. He was funny and witty, whereas the second one was too depressing and angry all the time. But! Like all good characters, both Will Graysons evolved and grew up as the story progressed, and in the end, I liked both Will Grayson's equally. But Tiny Cooper....he was just epic. Even just his NAME is epic. Definitely my favourite character. He was hilarious and so himself throughout the whole book, and even though he too grew up, he really did remain the same person.<br /><br />Writing wise, I thought the stylistic choices of both authors fit the characters very well. I think John Green wrote for the first Will Grayson and David Levithan wrote for the second, but I could be totally wrong and I don't want to make any real assumptions. Either way, the way each Will Grayson's story was told seemed to really fit their personality. I liked that a lot.<br /><br />Story-wise, I enjoyed it a lot. All the characters were so real and I wouldn't be surprised if someone wasn't like, \\"yeah, this story happened to me!\\" despite the serious improbability of running into someone with the exact same name as you.<br /><br />The ending was definitely not enough closure for me, although I am definitely one of those people who needs to be told exactly what happens to the character after the story ends, so the not-enough-closure thing is probably only me.<br /><br />Anyway, if you've read a John Green and/or David Levithan book before, or even if you haven't, I definitely recommend reading Will Grayson, Will Grayson. It was absolutely hilarious, but also serious at the same time. The first few pages are so funny that my boyfriend even wants to read it, if that helps to alleviate any doubts you may have.Levithan book before, or even if you haven't, I definitely recommend reading Will Grayson, Will Grayson.

B0042AEOG0|3.0|I always hoped for Mariah's second Christmas album. There are so many beautiful Christmas songs that have slipped her radar the first time around. She hasn't released an album with true, and honest singing since 'Glitter'. Many fans will beg to differ. However, this review is my own, and I'm stating just how I feel. So, although this album does not contain her best vocal-work, she still put forth effort in bringing forth the type of musician that most of us have enjoyed tuning unto through the years. Without question, 'Merry Christmas ll You' is, in fact, her best singing of this decade.<br /><br />Let's begin with the first single 'Oh, santa'. In Mariah's own words it's a mirrored version of her previous christmas single, 'All I want for christmas'. Supposedly, she believes that the her current christmas single delivers the same timeless, and classic feel when listening to it... NOT. 'Oh, santa' is one of the  worst tracks on the album. I do not feel all aglow while tuning into this song, whatsoever. Although, it is truly 'that' bad I still felt I needed to buy this album. I believed there had to be at least 'one' shining moment on this release -- after all, it's a christmas album. How else can an artist release christmas album with no vocal standouts, right?<br /><br />The vocals on 'The First Noel' are ashy, and whispery as usual. Beautiful song, but not her best. The lullaby sound is gorgeous, though. The vocals couldv'e been MUCH, MUCH better though. I know what falsetto is, But Mariah does this type of singing on 95% of all of her music. It begins to come into question, Can you not sing HEAD ON anymore in a full voice?. I understand a few songs, But Mariah does full albums in Falsetto, It can only be Falsetto for so-long before we start wondering if something's wrong.<br /><br />\\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\", Again, She sounds ashy and whispery all over again, She's trying her best to get by on singing all the words in a whisper (As usual). It's not very becoming,I actually prefer the Peanuts version, And then to have the Charlie Brown piano in the beginning was too much for me. She should have left this alone, She should've sang another Christmas classic instead. Like \\"What Child Is This?\\" \\"Breath Of Heaven\\" or \\"When A Child Is Born\\" Which all have breathtaking melodies. I would've loved to hear one of those instead.<br /><br />\\"O Little Town Of Bethlehem/Little Drummer Boy\\" goes so well with her voice, it's so dazzling and pretty how it's been put together for her. It's still way over sang in the breakdown, The arrangement is beautiful but she's screaming and straining to hit the notes. It comes off as too much, But I know her intentions were to do what she used to. So again, A for effort. Also, The \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" Part of the song is pointless, There's really no point in how they mixed a sentence from that song and go back to \\"O little Town of Bethlehem\\". It's still has a very pretty sound and I can overlook all the negative things about it.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" Is just ugly, Why would she do this song this way? This is a \\"Christmas Album\\". I was shocked when I heard how terrible this was. This song is very disapointing. I'm not too fond of the sound of this one. Not Christmas-ee enough, It's songs like this that make me wonder why she couldn't use this extra space on the album to sing something beautiful to fit with the rest of the album. I honestly DO NOT understand why she does stuff like this, Not just on this Christmas album, But her latest album's in general she's just been throwing stuff together lately. Everything about this song is distasteful, classless & disgusting. There's just so many lovely Christmas songs to choose from, How about \\"Away In A Manger\\" or \\"Angels We've Heard On High\\". She could've squeezed an extra medley of beautiful Christmas songs with her mother instead of this trash. All the album's she releases HipHip Nonsense she couldn't make an exception just this once to do a pureand rich Christmas album once again? or just one more song with Patricia?<br /><br />Now for the surprises, \\"One Child\\" is a very special Christmas gift from Mariah to her older fans. What a treasure, This song will be remembered in years to come, I can guarentee it. Just like on the first Christmas album, Many Schools from all around the world performed and learned the words to \\"Jesus, Born On this Day\\". \\"One Child\\" has that same affect, It sounds like a leftover from the first Christmas album. Beautiful Melody and Vocals, She surprised me Vocally on this one also. She's not over singing, She's just singing effortlessly. Reminds me of 90's Mariah. This is my favorite on the album. It's very well written. I've been playing it non-stop. I don't think the album gets much better than this.<br /><br />The beginning of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", Is Mariah reverting to her classic self once again. Hitting all the notes with a wholesome voice and semi-bare tone. It gets tragic after the beginning if you're not prepared. You might think you're getting a full enchanting Christmas ballad, Instead you're slapped in the face with a upbeat Dance track, Isn't that great?!. Which I must admit it's find Considering it's the end of the album and the theme of the song is \\"New Years\\". It's a celebration type song And it's celebrating the end of the album aswell as the start of a NEW year. So I'll go easy on her with this one. I actually like it. Atleast she gave me what I missed from her for a very long time, And that's her voice.<br /><br />Oh! I almost forgot to mention, Another well written Christmas track by Mariah \\"Christmas Time Is In The Air Again\\" Is a sparkling and dreamy Christmas Jazz ballad. Very Jessica Rabbit or Ann Margret \\"Let Me Entertain You\\". This is a different sound for Mariah. It's such a lovely song, I just wish she would've sang most of the song how she does towards the end of the song. She opens up vocally when the song is almost over. 90% of the song is whispered (As usual). Still a pretty song though. It feels like Christmas everytime I hear it. You have to listen to it all the way through to love it, At first listen it's like watching nose hair grow, But it captures you. It did for me.<br /><br />Song's I failed to mention were \\"When Christmas Comes\\", \\"O Holy Night (New Version)\\" and \\"All I Want For Christmas (Extra Festive). The \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town (Intro)\\" Is beautiful, It's very rich. I love it. I won't go into the other Three, I'm exhausted with Mariah and her games, So that pretty much speaks for itself.<br /><br />Overall, I love the magical and enchanting sound of the melodies and style of \\"Most\\" of the album.

We were a little worried about the sounds level being too low after reading other reviews but the sound is great.  I personally would not want it to go any louder, especially since most of the time we are using we are trying to settle him down, not stimulate him.  I would highly recommend this mobile.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|Absolutely one of the most original sci-fi ideas to come out of movie-dom in decades! Not since Alien and Forbidden Planet has there been something so unique. I've watched this movie at least 25 times,and I don't get tired of it! Loved the character development of Vikkers van de Merwe. He's a pencil-pushing, code enforcing drone of a human, whose mother never thought him smart. His father-in-law promotes him. Father-in-law has always considered Vikkers as weak. At the end, Vikker's father says he's forgotten his son and never thinks of him. Yet Vikkers ends up a Super Hero of sorts! I had never seen Sharlto Copley in anything before. I like him, like prawn parts, he grows on you.    As one of the other reviewers said, this movie should have been a trilogy with Part 1 being the fact that the giant spaceship ended up poised over Earth? Why? Apparently because of missing \\"fluid\\" for the tiny space-ship \\"part\\" that fell to Earth. Then humans went up in helicopters after 3 months, broke into said giant spaceship and removed the residents, then turned them into welfare bums on earth.    Part 2: That would be the current District 9.    Part 3: (On its way in sequel I'm sure) would have Vikkers (as it is pronounced) waiting for prawn Spaceship Captain Christopher coming back 3 years later on his promise to turn Vikkers back into a human.    Damn! I'd have paid to see all 3 of these movies if they existed! And I would especially love to see some movie tie-in novels on this genius idea! I'm sorry they passed up the chance. Come on Hollywood, 3 times the money!
0316113077|1.0|I thought this book was OK, as far as decorating books go.  Although some of the instructions had great tips, overall, it was lacking.  The cake recipes have so much sugar in them, that's almost all you can taste.  I would not buy this book...check the local library first.
0307269191|5.0|I have read several novels by Murakami but had no idea he has been running marathons. I was curious as to what he had to say. The book made run, put me back into my studio to work. I am planning to buy more copies for my beloveds. The book is certainly about running, running everyday. But it is also very much about various aspects of creative process and life itself. I am an artist and much of his musings and reflections on running could be very well applied to art, music, or any other creative endeavors. There are some truly moving passages, which I will not mention here. It should be read in the continuum of the daily repetition of running that he describes. But I will mention one of the phrases that stayed with me: Murakami would like to say this on his tombstone: \\"At least he never walked.\\"
1611062357|5.0|This is an exciting dramatization of one of the best Christmas stories ever.  The Colonial Radio Theater is a very talented group that tells the story of Scrooge  in such a way that all ages are interested.  Keep up the great work!!  As a veteran homeschooler (16 yrs) I find all the Colonial Radio Theater cds very exciting for  presenting living history and literature.  My boys loved them and now my grandson   is listening! Also I love the cover art.
0316098337|4.0|I am always reluctant to read books about kidnappings and captivity. The y can get too emotionally manipulative. Too often such books become almost unbearably violent (memories of \\"Living Dead Girl\\" and \\"Tender Morsels\\" still make my skin crawl) or unrealistically light and a tad misguided (I am in a minority in my assessment of \\"Stolen: A letter to my captor,\\" but I do think the setup of this book is far from reality). But \\"Room\\" gets and portrays such an experience just right IMO. I guess this is why it snagged a Booker nomination.<br /><br />Of course, the personal story of a 19-year old girl kidnapped and held captive for 7 years in a confined space of 11 by 11 ft, is horrifying. But it is told from a POV of her 5-year old son Jack who is sheltered to the extreme, even from the captor, and whose childhood had been practically idyllic. Jack's life in Room is full of adventure, games, play, and studying, and, most importantly, great times with his loving Ma. He doesn't comprehend the horror his Ma has to live through, he doesn't know why he has to sit in the closet and count while Old Nick comes over to \\"jump on Bed,\\" he doesn't understand why his Ma would ever want to leave their Room. But we do.<br /><br />Jack's perspective is definitely the most unique aspect of the novel. The topic of kidnappings is in vogue right now in literature (And no wonder, just google the words \\"kidnapping\\" and \\"captivity\\"), so it is pretty hard to create a work of fiction that will distinguish itself among others on the subject. But Jack's \\"voice,\\" with his unawareness of the outside world, inability to understand that this world is not limited to 11x11 sq. ft, space, and lack of social interaction with anyone but his mother, is a wonder and the strongest point of this book.<br /><br />Another important issue \\"Room\\" touches upon is what happens after the escape. The escape is only the beginning of the journey to recovery, if such a recovery is at all possible.<br /><br />\\"Room\\" is undoubtedly a hard book to read, and yet it is at the same time a hopeful story, a story about unwavering love between a child and a mother, and about new beginnings.<br /><br />As for the \\"Room\\"'s chances of winning Booker, they are pretty slim IMO. I don't think it well qualifies as literary fiction. Good popular fiction - yes. The subject matter is just too commercial and worn out to create any significant literary impact.doubtedly a hard book to read, and yet it is at the same time a hopeful story, a story about unwavering love between a child and a mother, and about new beginnings.<br /><br />As for the \\"Room\\"'s chances of winning Booker, they are pretty slim IMO.

0385533829|5.0|Right now there are 2601 reviews for the original (non-illustrated) version of this book, so I'll spare you the whole \\"what is this about\\" mantra because you probably already know.  This book is another in the \\"Let's Illustrate Dan Brown\\" series and is easily the best one yet.  How they fit in the number of pictures they did while not taking away from the story is beyond me.  It's not a secret as to why this book is coming out around the beginning of the Christmas shopping season; this will make an awesome gift for those who have and have not read this book.  I have each and every one of the illustrated versions AND in a word, they're worth it.  The pictures are colorful and bright and are in perfect concert with the story.  The calligraphy is beautiful, and when you wrap it around a larger, more gorgeous book frame... marvelous.
0765326353|3.0|First off, I was pretty surprised by the number of rave review for this book. There were times when I thought the book was great, and there were times I was like \\"what the heck were you thinking, Brandon??!!\\" After reading all the rest of Sanderson's work, I was definitely disappointed with The Way of Kings.     THE GOOD    As usual, Sanderson delivered well developed magic systems. This is one thing I have loved about his books: the magic feels real and has rules and limitations that make sense. It's not just wave a wand and say some Latin word and *poof!* something cool happens. Though the systems haven't been revealed a whole lot, the reader can see that they are thought out systems, with real rules.     Again as usual, the ending was awesome. Sanderson is known for exciting endings, and this book was no different. *SPOILER* When I thought he had killed off two main characters, I was cursing his name like I have so often at G. R. R. Martin. Luckily, Sanderson has a soul, and I should have realized he wouldn't send them off to their doom.*END SPOILER*    At first I didn't like the interludes. I thought they were weird and gimmicky. But after a few, I found them refreshing, and Brandon seemed to tie them in just enough to the story so you realize their importance.     THE BAD    1000 pages. This book did not need the length it was given. For the first book in a giant series, shorter would have been better. It's so daunting that I feel bad trying to recommend it to others.     But even worse than the length was the pacing. It wasn't until the last 200 pages that I got to the \\"can't put it down\\" point, which I think really needs to happen quite a bit earlier. The first book in a series likes this should grab the reader and make them want to continue. It shouldn't attempt to introduce the whole world at once, especially a world as different from our own as Roshar. One thing that made The Wheel of Time so great was how engaging the first book was. There was a clear goal, and the characters achieved that goal in the first book. Very similar to The Sword of Truth. In TWoK, I never quite figured out what the goal was. And that will hurt potential readership. This combined with the length made me take way too long to finish this book.    As others have noted, the characters are all kind of flat. I hope this improves with the series, but based on Sanderson's previous works, I'm not sure that will happen.     OTHER THOUGHTS    Some other issues that may be more particular to my tastes:    I didn't like the lengths of the chapters. Just as I'd start getting into one character's story, I'd be yanked away to another (\\"Aww man, back to Shallan?\\") Then I'd get into that character's story, only to be ripped away again 10 pages later (though I never was unhappy to get back to Kelsier....I mean Kaladin). I would have much preferred 50 pages or so per viewpoint. I suppose the chapters could be the same length, just have a few in a row following the same character. I shouldn't spend 20-30% of my reading time reorienting myself to following different characters.    Speaking of Mistborn, the Prologue (or was it the Prelude?) sounded a LOT like some of the Mistborn sequences. This isn't even necessarily bad, but it was a bit jarring.    *SPOILER* The scene at the end where Shallan realized that the Parshmen were the Voidbringers felt very reminiscent of the revelation in Mistborn that the Koloss came from humans. *END SPOILER*    OVERALL    In the end, I'm glad I read the book. I'll probably continue on in the series, and now that I've invested effort into getting to know the characters and the world, I anticipate that I'll enjoy the future books a lot more. But I fear that this first installment will scare away a lot of potential readers.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This DVD set is absolutely wonderful! I was going to buy it if it had just had all the episodes on it, but the TONS of extras really make this the best DVD set I've ever owned. The commentaries are hilarious and the outtakes are just too funny (I don't know how they can get through any scene with Donald Glover's improvising- he's so great). Definitely buy this set!!!!

0439023513|2.0|I loved The Hunger Games.  It was lightning-fast, clever, and engaging.  I also really liked Catching Fire -- it started out a bit slower than its predecessor, but really picked up in the final third.  In general, it served as both an echo and an expansion of what made The Hunger Games so exciting.  I had high hopes for Mockingjay.  I expected the story to blaze and explode, continuing to develop and intensify the characters and relationships from the first two books, before crashing into a satisfying conclusion.  Instead, Collins dropped the ball and let the story fizzle, and it was painful to read.  [Spoilers ahead.]    First, the characters.  In Mockingjay, Katniss spends a lot of time sedated, hiding, and having nightmares.  The charming, gentle, selfless Peeta I knew and loved made no appearance -- instead, he's been tortured into a monster that illogically switches moods between violent, repentant, self-loathing, confused, and docile with no real reason except that Collins needs him to.  I still like Gale, but he gets pushed aside because he makes Katniss mad (again, for no real reason, considering we're supposed to believe they're the closest and dearest of friends).  All three of them seem to forget who they are, and who the others are -- you'd never know that for the past two books we've been watching them protect each other, cry over each other, miss each other, and comfort each other.  We also get introduced to a lot of minor characters -- many of whose names I couldn't even be bothered to remember -- only to watch them get killed off one by one.  We get it, Collins.  There are casualties in war.  Funny how none of those casualties are important characters, until we get to the most pivotal of moments.    Second, the pacing.  When I read the first two books, I could hardly put them down because there was always action and I was always desperate to know what would happen next.  In Mockingjay, those moments of urgency were few and far between.  There were endless descriptions of battle plans and technology that were tedious and hard to follow.  When the action finally deigned to make an appearance, it happened in short bursts with a lot of wallowing in between.    Third, the ending.  I understand the point Collins was trying to make.  War changes people.  Okay.  I get it.  But given the backdrop of the first two books, I wasn't convinced that these characters would have been changed in these ways.  Even the meager epilogue did nothing to balance the bleakness of the ending.  Katniss chooses Peeta and completely gives up on Gale, which shocked and upset me, since I was always convinced that her relationship with Gale was the realer, deeper one.  Even if she didn't choose him romantically, I have trouble believing that she could just write him off like it was nothing, and that he would go along with it.  We also get no satisfying explanation for how Peeta was able to go from wanting to kill Katniss with his bare hands to being able to calmly raise a family with her.  Perhaps most offensive of all, however, is the fact that after three books of buildup, the reader doesn't even get a front row seat when the Capitol finally falls.  Instead, we're whisked away from the action with Katniss, kept in the dark with her while everything exciting happens, and then given an incomplete explanation that doesn't even cover what we most want to know.  I was waiting to find out that there was more to Snow than just a supervillain exterior, waiting for a solid explanation for Katniss's last-minute turning on Coin, waiting to hear about what had become of the Capitol... but we got none of those things.  Instead, we're given page after page of Katniss's tortured inner monologue, which is unrealistically brimming with metaphor.    Mockingjay could have been the exciting conclusion of a thrilling and memorable trilogy.  Instead, it was heavy-handed, slow, unsatisfying, and poorly executed.  I think Collins could have made her point without sacrificing the fast pace and logical character/plot development of the first two books.  Too bad she changed course at the last minute and took the trilogy with her.
0765326353|1.0|I started the day after publication, and still haven't reached the half-way point.  The writing is stiff, the characters flat, and the structure awkward.  And this fellow teaches creative writing as his day job?  I almost was tempted to get myself tested for ADD!  Sanderson's work is VERY derivative of the Hyperion Quartet, and fails on every count to meet the literary standard set by that first-rate opus.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Ultimately, there are too many words and not enough passion. Brooks paints an interesting picture of the rise and fall of the zombies, and the overall effect that they have on mankind. But, it all reads more like a textbook describing events in too cold a manner. We don't get to feel the passion, fear, hope, desperation, or any of those emotions that would have been felt in a book that was a story of the events. I can see how someone can like this book - as it does paint an interesting world. But ultimately, the world was too shallow and emotionless. I would vastly prefer a book that told the story of survivor(s) and their personal trials and tribulations. But this book does not really engage you, or at least, did not engage me, in the plight of mankind. There were really no people to care about, just transient characters. There was no real hero, and the \\"bad guy\\" was this vapid ghost of a thing called \\"zombie\\", which other than Yonkers we really didn't get any real feel for. In the end, that is where the book fails for me. It reads well, writing is fine, the characters and set pieces do have some interest, but it reads more like  a series of anecdotes that have some limited connection. This style in itself leaves behind the emotion, so at the end of the book, when we find out how the war \\"ends\\", we don't really get to share any sense of fear and or relief.

B002T9H2L0|1.0|I'm addicted to war movies. This war movie was a mix of gore, unexpected revision of history and black humor. After the first fifteen minutes had gone by, I wanted to leave, but stayed because I kept hoping there would soon be a reversal of the plot, in order to 'save' this movie. It never came. Don't bother buying this movie. I'm sorry but I don't see the need for humor in a war movie. War is anything but funny, just ask any Veteran of combat.    I feel sorry for all the WW 2 Veterans who went to or bought this movie, thinking that they were going to see a new, fair & accurate depection of WW 2. Shame on Brad Pit for doing this movie. It is clearly his worse work to date, but to be fair, he was most likely closely tied to the script, if there was one. Hope that the paycheck he got was worth it.
B0017OB12O|5.0|I watched it last night and was very, very pleased with this blue ray version.  There is little or no grain throughout the entire film, earlier DVD versions were not so lucky. I can not remember seeing this film look so good. The daylight scenes are a color revelation, especially the vibrant greens of the Ceylon forests. The film looks brand new. What a remarkable restoration. The acting surpasses the action which is a relief; Saito and Nicholson talking over corn beef and Johnny Walker, and Nicholson's reflections on his army career reminded me last night just how good this international cast was. I think it shows what a great director like David Lean can do with such an enduring, exciting story. Run, don't walk to buy this blue ray treatment.
B004498KPU|3.0|Sony Legacy is trying to push this off as a complete collection, but it by no means is. This set features a 4 minute version of the short film Ghosts, the full version of which is 39 minutes. I have no idea why they have chosen to do this. Otherwise, this is a good collection, especially for the price. It's just a shame they abridged Ghosts.

I have all there albums and wore them all out.Saw this band twice in Denver over the years,once with Traffic and they totally rocked.Alvin Lee is a great unheralded guitarist who is just now getting his do.

Buy it if you need to hear some After.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|DAS BOOT (Original Uncut Version)--This is one of the finest films I have ever seen on submarine warfare during the Second World War.  I cannot say enough about the film because there is not another film on the market today that reflects the dedication to service of the men whom served on a submarine.  Submarine life was difficult at best during the Second World War; and, the actors that portrayed the characters in the film were truly believable and realistic.  The film will carry you from the beginning service of this U-Boat (submarine) to the end.  The suspense will keep you on edge all the time and when the movie is through you will have a very good idea what life on a U-Boat was like.  I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys submarine movies; and, in my opinion, DAS BOOT is the very best!

B0033WDCRA|5.0|Frankie Goes To Hollywood is the '80s band famous for creating a bookend of an era. With the release of their monumental \\"Welcome To The Pleasure Dome\\" double album in 1984, they have effectively put the final finishing touch on the art form that began 20 odd years earlier with another band from Liverpool -- the Beatles.    When the Beatles emerged on the scene in 1964, they have astonished the world with their completely new brand of music. What the Beatles offered at that time was a 180 degrees turn, away from the anemic doo-wop tepid music, and into the full blooded rock. Their music was delivered with extreme white heat intensity that remained unmatched to this day. In short, the Beatles showed the world how the music should sound, how the songs should be written and performed, how the recording studio should be used, and in general, how to change the world. The world, in turn, listened very attentively, but the rest of us simply didn't have it in us to fully internalize and live according to the new set of instructions.    The only other band that managed to somehow approach the set of instructions left to us by the Beatles was Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Alas, they could do it only for a few short months, before they simply imploded under such white heat intensity. So yes, another thing that the Beatles managed to impress the world with is their stamina. Frankie obviously didn't have the stamina, nor did they have any staying power. They died as quickly as they emerged, like a meteorite appearing for a few fleeting moments in the night sky.    What they left in their wake is this gem of an album. Basically, this album manages to accomplish two things: a.) summarize pretty much everything that happened in music up until that point (same as what the Beatles did in their own way in the early '60s), and b.) indicate how should the music of the future sound like.    Same as with the Beatles, no one was able to take the set of instructions Frankie left us on their seminal \\"Welcome To The Pleasure Dome\\" album and run with it. Instead, the music business dissipated into either largely monotonous hip-hop genre (with insane quantities of repetition), or into nostalgia, the 'me too' attempts by various musicians to restore the past glory of the '60s/'70s. During the past 25 years, we haven't been blessed to hear anything as substantially new as we can hear on this album.    Luckily, we now have this diamond, the precious jewel that comes only once in a generation, restored to its full glory. The sound quality of this remaster is simply to die for. If you happen to have access to a high end audio system, give this CD a spin -- you'll be absolutely blown away. Nothing else approaches the sheer white heat sonic intensity of this album. The brilliant, super edgy sound on this remastered CD will rip a hole through your heart and through your brain.    Back in the early '80s, some people really knew how to produce music. That was before the days of cheap-ass computer software that mainly smothers over vital nuances in music.    Overall, this CD is the most brilliant thing that happened on the music scene since last year's remastering of the Beatles catalog. Run, don't walk, and buy this remastered CD!

B003YUC2FE|1.0|As a HUGE Pixar fan I pre-ordered this trilogy box set as soon as I heard of it's existence. Upon arrival though, it's extremely underwhelming. The discs are held together in cheap black foam inside the \\"Collector's Tox Box\\" (which isn't impressive at all BTW). There's no individual case, nor jewel case for any of the discs, they just sit in foam. Literally.     Also, no bonus content that's exclusive to the box set versus the 3 Blu-ray editions separately. That fact is what really finalizes my opinion on disliking this.     I'm so torn. I want to purchase the Toy Story 3 standalone blu-ray, but I want to hold out even more for a \\"15th anniversary trilogy boxset\\" super edition that does this closing trilogy some justice for a proper retail release.     :(

B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed this SO much more than the first one.  The first one I had a really hard time finishing.  If it hadn't been such a highly recommended bestseller, to be honest, I probably wouldn't have finished it.  And because of that, if I hadn't bought all three books at once, I probably wouldn't have read the second (which it took me months before I was willing to give the Girl Who Played With Fire a chance) and that would have been a shame because the second book was amazing.  I'm glad I had them on my Kindle because when I finished this book today while I was out of the house at an appointment, I breathed a huge sigh of relief that I was able to IMMEDIATELY open the third book and start reading.  Not to get too spoiler-y here, but you definitely want the third book handy when you're at the end of this book as it ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger.
B0035V35PI|2.0|Ninja Assassin is loaded with action...and that's all it has..The action is surrounded by an unlikeable cast of characters and a horrible story...even for a B-movie. Action scenes are overdone. They are loaded with too much fake CGI blood & tricks. Even the shurikens are fake. Dialog is just painful to listen to.  A very slow and uninteresting movie..the blood and gore wasn't worth waiting for in this mess.. I was hoping the whole cast would die..    The only positive thing to say is that the soundtrack on the Blu-ray version is quite good. If you have a 5.1 or 7.1 sound system you're in for a treat. Too bad the movie sucks..    Save your money.
1400079144|5.0|I just finished reading this latest book from Dan Brown and I found I just couldn't put it down.  It grabs you from the start and the revalations keep coming.  It is a very compelling read.  Don't expect to start it late in the day or you will be up most of the night!  Each of the characters is well written and completely formed, unlike some other writers.  The action is non-stop and totally believeable.  I would highly recommend this book to any fan of Dan Brown's.
B003UERZ88|3.0|I've always liked Rob Halford's solo material more than Judas Priest. I'm a big fan of Fight and the first two Halford CDs.    After a long wait..we finally get Made of Metal. Overall it's solid..but kind of generic. It can't touch his last CD \\"Crucible - Remastered\\" Some of the music and lyrics are just.. eh.. The title track \\"Made of Metal\\" is just stupid..the music..and especially the lyrics...NASCAR? I like NASCAR but this is just dumb. Other tracks are straight forward metal and throw in some metal ballads. Even though the lyrics can be cheezy at times..He still has one of the greatest voices in metal. No question there. Musically it never really gets above average. It's serviceable..that's it.. This is the least heavy Halford CD. I'd say the best song on the CD is \\"The Mower\\".

OMD were one of my favourite bands from the 80s and I have been disappointed too often by continuing to buy albums based on a band's output from some 25 years previous.  Not the case here.  This is an excellent CD and, whilst being instantly recognizable as OMD and offering nothing radically different from the best of their past, it still manages to sound remarkably contemporary.

B001H5X7KC|4.0|Tropic Thunder is a 2008 action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller and starring Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. as a group of prima donna actors filming a Vietnam War film when their fed-up writer-director decides to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.    What I expected from this movie was to have a good time laughing my ass off. Fortunately, it's funnier than most comedies I've seen in quite awhile. I didn't even find \\"Superbad\\" as funny as people made it out to be. Maybe I don't laugh as much as normal people. Unfortunately, the film didn't exceed my expectations. I expected more laughs but what can you expect? I'm just a non-laughable person.    But who cares if I didn't laugh as much as I expected to. I actually laughed, which must count for an accomplishment the film did. The beginning of the film starts off with faux trailers, like the ones shown during \\"Grindhouse,\\" so don't worry if you're not seeing the movie, even though you are seeing it. It just gives you what movies the protagonists are in.    Most of the laughs are close to the beginning and end and a little in the middle. The movie works as an action movie and a comedy, each actor seeming to have a fun time in their roles. I also like the fact that this movie has a lot of cameos (and when I say a lot, there is a lot) but I won't surprise you, even though there is one apparent name that is sticking out to you already.    Well, if you don't already know, I won't say it but if you do, you must know that after people see this movie, people would start to respect him as an actor, even though I never lost respect for this man. People will start to see him as a cool man. Like Morgan Freeman in \\"Wanted,\\" you'll hear and see things that this man has never done before and it's quite funny because his performance is so over-the-top.    It's not only him that may be the highlight of the movie, so the other is obviously Robert Downey Jr. How is he? He's very good and funny but all of you should know that by now. Everyone else in the movie also give off a few laughs, although the first two actors I've mentioned are probably the most memorable.    With some decent action scenes and very funny scenes, \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is the comedy to see this summer. One of the reason might be because of the cameos and over-the-top performances in here. Another is that this film actually made me laugh, which is an incredible feat for comedies to accomplish this year. For those reasons, I think it's a worthy admission to see it in theaters.
B002UXRH10|5.0|When Rihanna first arrived, no one expected her to last. Was it the best producers money can buy? A globalist conspiracy? Rihanna being just another pop drone, taking on whatever image brought in the bucks? All of the above?    The timing of this album is most interesting of all, and demonstrates true art in its execution. Upon release, Rihanna had just been released from a tumultuous and abusive relationship with fellow pop star Chris Brown. Public perception centered around the musical evolution of rihanna's once teeny bopper past. Shockingly, the album goes head first. The lead single intentionally attempts to subliminally make reference to the domestic abuse incident. Even worse, it romanticizes, even sexualizes the situation! For someone like rihanna, a role model for young girls...this is a controversial and jarring thing to do. It also is a bit more human, and realistic. Because the raw darkness and disgust personafied in this song makes it special. It just as ugly as the state of the world we are in now. This album was not done for the money, it was REALLY done to push the pop envelope, to expand the artform and to make you FEEL. God help us all.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|I would like to start off by saying I'm a fan of the FINAL DESTINATION series. Even the much maligned third film is starting to grow on me. When it was announced that David Ellis was returning to the director chair (along with screenwriter Eric Bress), I was quite excited, considering that part two is arguably the best in the series. But this one. If I were to describe this film in one word, I would say DISAPPOINTING. In fact, this is one of the most disappointing movies of this year! The fact that the makers of part two has returned just adds on to the frustration.    The film starts off pretty rushed. In fact, the film is rushed altogether. You feel as if the filmmakers wanted to get through with the film. The laziness is so apparent in here that you're wondering how much the executives offered in their salary. The film is so lazy that there are even glaring plot holes in the hackneyed script! How the hell does a film that is based on something ridiculous have plot holes? The film--better yet, the franchise, spends most of its time in setting up rules on the order people are going to die yet this film ignores practically everything and kills people in any order it feels like!    Even the clever foreshadowing from the previous films is quite blatant here. The laziness is also extended to the death scenes. Remember, quality, not quantity. Even though this film has the most death scenes compared to the previous entries, most of them suck and even that word wouldn't give the deaths that much justice. We all have to admit it sooner or later but we see these films for the death scenes. What is the freaking point in watching this film if they turn out to be lazy to an extent that some death scenes are rehashed from previous FD films? Exactly. There is no point.    Another problem about the death scenes is that there is barely any suspense when people are about to get killed. Usually, in the FD films, seeing the set up of the Rube Goldberg-like death scenes IS the suspense, but in here, they feel as if they come out of nowhere because of how rushed everything is. They're surprising, yes, but the surprises wear off very quickly. Google up Alfred Hitchcock's definition of \\"suspense\\" to learn the difference between surprise and suspense.    Let's move on to the next problem: CGI. With the 3D technology, it's obvious the filmmakers wanted to add more CGI effects so the images could pop out on the screen. The problem here is that the FINAL DESTINATION series is always known for their practical effects. The premonition sequence in here works well in 3D, sure, but the CGI is terrible! They look so fake that I questioned how this film wasn't released direct to DVD.    You know you have a bad film when a franchise that was supposed to be scary and mysterious now turns into something that pokes fun of itself. It has happened many times before, most notably, the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise. It's as if the filmmakers were aware that the franchise is dying and that their last attempt was to add self-aware characters and idiotic, dumb lines in the film with the many problems the film already has.    Even the characters are more like an excuse to kill them off later. It's apparent that this isn't a movie but more of a carnival ride, waiting to see who dies and how they will die. That's how low this film has gone. You'd also be surprised to find out that the most fleshed out character is, in fact, not the protagonist, but a supporting character, played by Mykelti Williamson. He gives a laughable and forced performance but that's nothing compared to Bobby Campo, who is easily the worst premonitionist in the franchise. He can't act to save his life. And the less we say about the others, the better. However, I'm willing to admit the only character I did feel sympathy for was played by Krista Allen, who plays a motherly role with an extremely short running time.    However, there are other few things that I liked about the film (emphasis on the word \\"few\\"): There's a sequence in a salon and a car wash that have at least SOME suspense. I don't know if this counts but I also liked the opening credits, which I thought was ingenious, a montage of the previous films' memorable death scenes. And that's about it. Three things. What an accomplishment!    I guess it isn't hard to tell but this is, by far, the weakest in the series because there's nothing new. You'd expect that a mythology so easily expandable would be explored here but no. By the end of the film, you feel underwhelmed. You wished they could have done better. In fact, you KNOW they could have done better. If they were to make a fifth film, they better put some thought into it. If you're thinking about watching this movie only ONCE, you should see it in its intended format in 3D AND in theaters, but I don't see why anyone should waste their money on this film.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but i just found it to be predictable and silly and all the story is a nonsense wreck. I took my two children ages 3 and 5 to see it in 3D one month after watching Toy Story 3 (wich they enjoyed from start to the end), but after 30 minutes watching Despicable Me both of them where standing from they're seats and getting busy just playing arround. This is a lame Universal Pictures copycat of Disney-Pixar movies.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The film explores the back stories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens to destroy the United Federation of Planets.    Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Trekkie (is that how you spell it?) in any way nor have I seen a single second of the Star Trek universe in my entire life. In fact, I never really wanted to watch the films in the first place because they never interested me. However, since the fantastic J.J. Abrams was on board, I knew I should see this film. To my relief, the film was great. In fact, it's the best movie I've seen this year thus far!    If you find yourself almost teary in the first few minutes of this film, you know it'll be good. The film is character driven. There's a lot of action sequences, yes, but the film is really character driven. In fact, the high point of the film was its characters and the casting made it possible. From a glance, Chris Pine doesn't seem like the \\"right\\" person to be in the movie. After all, he doesn't have a good track record for the movies he has starred in so far. However, he really does a great job playing the charismatic, smart talk guy. Zachary Quinto does an equally exceptional job as Spock, a name I've heard so many times without knowing who he really was. Eric Bana plays an almost unrecognizable performance as the \\"villain.\\" Simon Pegg and Karl Urban play the comedic relief characters. And to wrap the diverse ensemble up, Zoe Saldana, Ben Cross, John Cho, and Winona Ryder give us each a unique performance.    Apart from the cast, the action sequences were amazing, along with the special effects. The score by the underrated Michael Giacchino is great, especially hearing the theme song for the first time. However, the story is also really great. I didn't realize this was a time movie at first. I found it mentally stimulating. The laid back feel and the slapstick humor addsto the immense satisfaction when the credits roll.    The film is really good because there's almost nothing bad to say about it. Yes, maybe you can find one small detail here and there that doesn't make the film perfect, but no movies are perfect. This movie is human, with sharp dialogue, and fantastic characters, a complex story, with action sequences to fill on top. If you haven't seen a summer movie yet, make this your first one. As you can see, the film is very accessible for non-Trekkies. However, I'm sure the die-hard Trekkies will appreciate the new, fresh zest Abrams have brought into the film.

B002AT4K9Q|4.0|It's been eight years since ex-con Dominic Toretto drove across the Mexican border, committing himself to a fugitive existence. Now, holed up in a beach shack in the Dominican Republic, and living on the run with the sole remnant of his past, Lett, he tries to piece together a new life. But he knows the authorities are always just steps behind him. And, when a tragic death of someone he loves brings Brian O'Conner back to L.A., Dom reignites his feud with the agent. As they are forced to confront a shared enemy, a sociopathic drug kingpin who is flooding the U.S. with lethal product, Dom and Brian must give it to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him and avenge the tragedy that he caused their small de facto family to endure.    Now here's something you wouldn't expect in the Fast and the Furious series: A sequel that is better than the original. I have to say, F&F is an impressive film compared to the first, a film that I already was impressed by. I guess the main reason is because of the nostalgia. F&F is a very satisfying film only if you watch it back to back with TFaTF, unless you can remember watching TFaTF a couple of years ago.    One thing that is extremely enjoyable about this film is how it references the first film, and it references the first film quite a few times. Another thing that is great is that the action sequences are more entertaining and still well made. Take the opening scene, for example. It's supposed to reference the opening scene in the first film but the one in this sequel is much more thrilling and exciting as hell. It's filled with so much energy that you'll be blown away and the use practical effects rather than CGI (with an exception of the climax of that scene) is commendable.    Speaking of CGI, the film, I'll admit, does use it more frequently than the original, especially the climax sequence. I guess that's a weak point of the film because the Fast and the Furious films are known for realistic car sequences. I liked the story as well because there's more weight to it. Add on to the fact that our four-member clan has reunited since the first film, which is really excellent. We get to see Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez develop their characters a couple of years after the first film. They seem much more mature and emotional in their roles.    Overall, I think this sequel is a perfectly well made film, even to an extent that it's better than the first film. The action sequences are more exciting than ever and you get to see the original clan reunite after two sequels! What's not to like?
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I decided I wanted to read it again.  About once every 5 to 10 years I reacquaint myself with Paul and his world.  I bought the Kindle edition 40th anniversary edition.  What a hugh rip-off.  I started reading last night and the family hasn't even left for Dune yet and there has been at least 10 typos.  So I calculated that a minimum of 1092 people have bought this book (number of reviews) times $13.98 is over $15,000.  Penguin could have paid a high school kid to read and correct this book for a year, rather than just sending it to Amazon sight unseen.  Love the book, but feeling cheated.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.    This is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.    Saying that \\"Up\\" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichéd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. \\"Up\\" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, \\"Up\\" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.    The rich story in \\"Up\\" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The filmis also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.    I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.    Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like \\"Up\\" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of \\"Up\\" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that \\"Up\\" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it.
B0042AEOG0|1.0|What on earth is Mariah Carey doing with her voice. She really rapes those beautifull songs with her 'breating singing'. I was looking forward to the new christmas album but this is really disapointing. I'm not gonna buy this.
B001GCUO16|2.0|The film focuses on the violent past of mutant Wolverine and his time with Team X, before Wolverine's skeleton was bonded with the indestructible metal adamantium. The plot also details his early encounters with Colonel William Stryker, the Weapon X program, Wolverine's interactions with other mutants and his complex relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed.    Hearing the reactions from the majority of the people that have seen this film, I'm not surprised that the movie was disappointing. This film suffers from what X-Men 3 did and more: It has too many characters in one short running time, although the film felt like it never seemed to end. Including that, the story wasn't that good and the film felt like it should have never been made. What's the point? Why would anyone want to know the origins of Wolverine? Well, if you do, why would anyone want to sit through such a disappointing origins story?    It's apparent the filmmakers didn't spend a lot of time with the whole story. I've never read the comics so I wouldn't know if the film translated what was on page to screen or not. Even in the first few scenes, I was laughing through my mind because of Wolverine's horrible-looking bone claws. The origins story also didn't add much to Wolverine's past. And for the first time, I'll say that the CGI in here was a bit cheesy and very unreal. When Wolverine actually plays with his steel claws for the first time, the CGI looks horrible and cartoonish.    With the many characters here, I felt like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and Will i Am were the best ones here. I feel sorry for Jackman, because you can tell he's trying to do his best with the source he has been given, along with the rest of the cast. I found Lynn Collins very annoying, though, as Wolverine's girlfriend. Ryan Reynolds was decent, although he appears for only a short time in the film and Taylor Kitsch was good too as Gambit.    With the negatives aside, I liked one thing: Split the film into threeparts and I liked the last, third part. I really found the film enjoyable from that to the end, including an interesting way how they connected the last scenes to the first X-Men film. I also found the action sequences above par, especially the last sequence. Overall, I'm not surprised that I was going to be disappointed. I do like the third part of the film, though so I'll give the film that. If you're a fan, you can see it, although it may not be the best origins story to tell.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Having really enjoyed the first Iron Man film, I was really looking forward to seeing this follow-up. Knowing that Chaplin's Robert Downey Junior was once again assigned to the lead role, I was reassured that this would not be another of those sequels that merely trades off the success of its predecessor (see Police Academy). The film didn't disappoint. It was more of the same, both in quality and tone, which is what I wanted, and I suppose most other Iron Man fans wanted.<br /><br />The story follows up from the original film, but is heavily influenced by Robocop and its sequels, with humour undercutting the drama in many places. It isn't so comedic that the serious part is undermined, but there are quite a few broad comedy moments. The character of Tony Stark disturbs a little in places, his self-destructive nature in terms of his business, his environment, and his health are all darker features of the character that elsewhere exhibits great optimism and positivity. Downey Junior brings this complex character to life - so that when he is out partying, you can see in his eyes the darker undertones of his personality. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, although a reset switch appears to have been hit, and the closeness they achieved towards the end of the first film is forgotten about and she is just his assistant, rather than nearly his wife. The relationship follows pretty much the same path this film, although she has a rival in the form of a sexy spy Scarlett Johansson, and an all star cast is completed with appearances from a very dirty looking Mickey Rourke as a Russian physicist with a grudge against Tony and Samuel Jackson as a spy pretty similar to the role he played in the Matrix.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is great as his friend, Rhodey, but he's a recast from Terrence Howard in the first film. Don makes a very good job of this and by the end, you forget that he's not the same actor, and Marvel Comics boss Stan Lee's cameo as Larry King has to be seen to be believed! Gary Shandling puts in a semi-comic performance as a senator, who is there to needle Stark, and threaten to take away his Iron Man suit. Shandling is just right for the role, looking now rather like a grinning Jimmy Carter/Kennedy type politician.<br /><br />Overall, the look of this on blu-ray is excellent, and you can see how well the sets and effects have been made, although it's a shame that the extras are very pedestrian, and it feels like little effort has been made with these. Clearly they are holding something back for the two disc edition, but this feels a bit mean, and makes disc collectors like me want to wait for \\"ultimate edition\\"s before buying. This doesn't detract from the film though, which is heartily recommended to anyone who liked the original film.Gary Shandling puts in a semi-comic performance as a senator, who is there to needle Stark, and threaten to take away his Iron Man suit.

B000UJ48SQ|4.0|A great flick. Today this film would cost an unbelievable amount of money. the costumes are great and the military actions are well done.
B00005JNQS|2.0|I liked this movie to begin with.  Unfortunately, once Rodney had arrived at Robot City, I soon began to lose interest.      The biggest problem with this movie is that there are far, far too many characters that crowd each other and overwhelm the plot.  Robin Williams is annoying and old - his jokes are repetitive and have been done already in other movies.  I just watched Disney's Aladdin a few weeks back, and couldn't help thinking Robin Williams' performance in robots was \\"robot genie!\\"  Most of the other characters are very forgettable.     The animation looks good and the movie does not feel too dated.  The world was very detailed and interesting.  It felt huge and populated.    The plot itself was very simplistic and didn't really develop much beyond its basic \\"you can follow your dreams whoever you are\\" beginnings.  The world was nice and left me with that feeling that you could watch the movie a dozen times and always notice something fun and interesting going off in the background.  Unfortunately, I could barely get through this movie once and won't be watching it again.  The whole thing left me clock-watching and bored.      Robots was not a particularly funny movie, and I thought the humor in places was plain obnoxious-fart and ass jokes?  No thanks.  There were a couple of jokes in there that only the adults might get (most of them background stuff, that you'll only spot if you're paying attention) but for the most part, this movie didn't earn more than a \\"hah\\" from me.  Very disappointing.        The ending made me happy only because I was glad the movie was over.  Maybe a very young child would enjoy this movie, but anyone else should save themselves the boredom and watch something like Shrek instead.

1400063515|4.0|In his book \\"The Black Swan \\"Nassim Taleb very eloquently describes why applying mathematics to Economics and Finance without really understanding the true fundamentals of the underlying processes is a risky, and as has been recently observed catastrophic exercise. Letting Quants take over our financial markets with mathematical and even worse computerized models without true insight has had devastating consequences. Using the Bell Curve without testing the underlying basic assumptions is foolish. For that reason the author rightfully calls the bell curve \\"the great intellectual fraud\\". Assuming that one can diversify risk of non stationary, interdependent processes full of convoluted and not well understood feedback loops through mindless applications of stochastic calculus is the fallacy of the 20st century and the abuse of mathematics. Nassim Taleb Postulates that the more complex mathematical theories of Benoit Mandelbrot on fractals could provide much better understanding of managing risk in an ever more dynamic, complex and interconnected global economy

0385493622|5.0|In 2006, Grigory Perelman proved Poincare's Conjecture concluding a 100 year struggle by other genial mathematicians. This book describes an even more heroic accomplishment by another mathematician, Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's famous theorem (or better conjecture) in 1995, after other geniuses (Euler, Legendre, Lebesque, Hilbert and even Gauss) had been trying unsuccessfully for 358 years. Fermat's Last Theorem states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than two. For n=1 this is trivial and for n=2 this is the well known Pythagorean formula. Every approach was pursued even the use of super computers. In 1954 one of the earliest computers was used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all primes up to 2521. By 1978, this was extended this to all primes less than 125,000. By 1993, Fermat's Last Theorem had been proven for all primes less than four million. But of course this still is no mathematical proof for all positive integers.<br />In the end, in 1995, Andrew Wiles found a proof but he had to borrow from unexpected other fields of mathematics like Algebraic Geometries (Riemann) and Elliptic Curves (Poincare). Intriguingly the same tool set which was used for the Proof of Poincare's conjecture. With the recent solutions to Fermat's Last Theorem and the Poincare conjecture, perhaps even the Riemann hypothesis could now be solved. The Riemann hypothesis tries to find an answer for the distribution of prime numbers. Prime numbers are maddeningly capricious. They clump together like buddies on some regions of the number line, but in other areas, nary a prime can be found. So number theorists can't even roughly predict where the next prime will occur. Here the notion of unpredictability raises its ugly head again, remember Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and chaos theory! Mathematicians will be thrilled if they do someday succeed in proving the Riemann hypothesis, but odds are that they have a long way to go, but then again it is only 151 years ago since Riemann formulated his hypothesis in 1859.hey have a long way to go, but then again it is only 151 years ago since Riemann formulated his hypothesis in 1859.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I bought My Garmin Forerunner 405CX to assist with my half marathon training.  I needed help tracking my distance.  This is a great product and has a lot of features. I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone. The bezel soetimes is non responsive when your hands are wet from sweat.    The only problem that I have had with the watch, is the battery life.  On a full charge I could only use it for 2 hours before it would start beeping that the battery life was 0.  There were times when the watch showed a 90% battery but once it picked up the sattelites, it started flashing low battery.  when I ran my half marathon, I was not finished when it started flashing low battery.  It completely died less than 3 hours from the time I started the timing. Luckily I was finished with my race by that time.  When I tried to charge the watch after the half marathon, it would not charge and I could not get it to do anything.  I called Garmin and they tried to talk me through resetting the watch.  When that was unsuccesful, they had me send it in to be worked on.  I received a new watch from Garmin less than a week after I mailed off the watch.  This new watch, holds a charge for days! I ran for  hours this past weekend, and still had a 70% charge.  I think the first watch had a bad battery.  I was extremely happy with the attention and help that I received from Garmin when I had a problem with my watch.  I was worried that I would be stuck with a $400 paper weight.
B001PPF11W|4.0|CONTEXT: A solid, guitar alt-rock debut from one of the most important bands of this generation. A bit underrated and overlooked in light of what Radiohead would achieve their career.     MUSIC: Drenched in attitude and passion; the three guitar attack stands out the most. Agressive musicianship that reaches for heights the band would grab on their next album.     LYRICS: Thom Yorke shows the beginnings of his skill for phrasing and imagery. Unfortunately, many of the lyrics are overly self-loathing.     HIGHLIGHTS: Creep, Thinking About You, Vegetable.

B000MRAAJM|2.0|I bought this set based on the rave reviews and was disappointed by the quality of transfer to Blu-ray. I have watched the DVDs and was expecting a much better video / audio quality for the extra dollars that Blu-ray discs cost. Sorely disappointed. I think I will remember to buy discs recorded using new technology - not the ones recorded earlier and converted to HD - the difference is obvious.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|Until this Christmast album I was seriously getting sick of Christmas albums they all started sounding the same, and boy were they bland.  At least here MC gives us a fun and upbeat Chrsitmas and the original songs that are presented her kick major behind as far as Christmas albums go.  They are written well.   Thanks MC for a fun and fresh new Christmast CD....I love that fact that she did her own version of \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" makes me feel like a little kid again.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Saw 3D was a gut wrenching film from beginning to end. The return of Dr. Gordon was awesome and was not disappointed by his performance. The continuing battle between Detective Hoffman and Jill escalated with Hoffman's identity being released to the IA and on the run. With this escalation brings countless deaths and a man losing his way towards vengeance and trying to eliminate all loose ends. The main character in this film, Bobby Dagen, becomes the next pawn in Jigsaw's Legacy, as he must face a series of traps that he must free all of those he has deceived. By lying to everyone about his experience in a Jigsaw trap, and making money off his book, he will endure pain and suffering along the way towards his ultimate test which shouldn't be any surprise. This film has it's ups and downs, however, it does give a sense of closure as it respects to Dr. Gordon. The traps in this film may not have the same moral dilemma that the past six have all carried with, but everyone must realize that these traps were set forth by Detective Hoffman, a man who has lost his ways, and has thrown everything he was taught by Jigsaw out the window. The main game was set in motion by Hoffman to get his hands on Jill Tuck, and also give way to his escape (or so Hoffman thinks). Saw 3D feels different as a film, but that's what makes it fun and exciting. Though some of the acting was bad and could have left out some humor, but not all, overall the film was enjoyable and had a great sense of closure at the end. If this is truly the last Saw in the franchise, it was truly a blast and will be hard to beat.
0307463745|3.0|Rework is a very fast read, partially due to being very well-written but also because it doesn't contain very many words. Margins are wide and there are a lot of illustrations which add nothing but page count. The 27000 words could fit into about 60 pages using less \\"artsy\\" and more standard typesetting.    In those 27,000 words you get somewhere between fifty and one hundred 3-400 word blog-like pieces of business advice. I did not find anything particularly insightful or deep, just common sense. It's all very well presented, but there's really nothing new here.     On the other hand, the book is very inspiring, so if you're looking for inspiration to start a business, it's a great read. In particular, you can gauge your business acumen while reading it. If most of the content isn't obvious to you already, you should probably NOT start a business.
0385342047|3.0|I am a huge Sophie Kinsella fan and have all her books.  I hate to say it but this was her worst.  The title is 'Mini Shopaholic' but had 90% to do with planning a party and very little to do with Mini.  I don't mind that the character hasn't changed.  It's a certain formula and that's what makes it popular.  I was looking to read about a Shopaholic and not a changed Becky because then it woudln't be a book about a Shopahlic, would it?  In any case, the story just was flat and over the top at times.  What man would put up with such antics with nothing more than a smile on his face?  In any case, if you're a fan, it's still a decent book, jsut not her best. I would recommend taking it out of the library though.  And Kinsella needs to end now with the series even though the book clearly left the option open for another book.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love the characters - not only the two stars, but the other detectives and Castle's mother and daughter, as well. Each character is well thought out and plays an important role. The mysteries are well thought out, and I can't tell you how happy I am that the crimes are solved without all of the grisly details (and camera work) of the forensics. I actually bought this DVD set as a gift for my daughter, but I'm going to put it on my Christmas list, too.
6305971935|4.0|The Philadelphia Experiment is an interesting story of what is claimed to be mostly true.    The United States did conduct this experiment by trying to make a US Navy ship invisable to Radar.  What did happen is said to be mostly true as the way Hollywood told the story.   It is said by men that were there the Hollywood version had some romance added to the story that really didn't happen.  As the movie version of the story it is very entertaining.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I first heard about 'Frozen' on the internet and was intrigued by the premise and took a chance by buying the dvd. Not having seen Adam Green's previous films, I had a clean slate when it came to expectations. I was not disappointed, the movie takes a very simple concept and manages to an extremely tense and frightening experience that you will not easily forget. No cgi and and no soundstages combined with good performances only ads to the depth of realism.<br /><br />All the special features are very insightful and worth watching.<br /><br />'Frozen' is highly recommended and one of the best releases of 2010.
B000ZM1MG4|3.0|This movie is about a post-op transexual who runs for a political office. She falls in love with a woman and begins to question her choice to have gender reassignment surgery when the object of her affection refuses to have gender reassignment surgery herself. Odd film but good acting.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|Hands All Over isn't quite as good as Maroon Five's freshman & sophomore albums. The first 2 albums were \\"front to back\\" CDs meaning you could listen to them from beginning all the way to the end without complaints. This one--not so much.     I personally like tracks 1-3, 6, and 9 and that's about it. I didn't care for the Lady Antebellum collaboration & the Alicia Keys cover. I guess my Maroon Five standards are too high.
B003QCCS36|5.0|This album is my first exposure to Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs.  I absolutely love this album.  The music is at the level of Neil Young and the vocals sound a little like the Marshall Tucker band.      These guys are excellent musicians.  Would love to see them live.
0767903862|3.0|The first 40% of the book is made up of lame non-adventures (he hikes through endless suburbia, is chased by dogs in a park, goes on and an meandering search for drinking establishments), in places that he himself describes as dull, with vain attempts to spice up the non-action with descriptions of all the terribly dangerous things that could kill you in Australia (none of which he encounters). His writing is amusing for the first 20 pages or so but then the oh-so-clever and precious style begins to get tedious. It is all a bit too forced. It would be a better book if he took it down a notch. The parts about Australia were interesting but there was too much Bill Bryon on the subject of Bill Bryson.     Could he possibly have been bored in Australia? Let's hear Bryson's own words:  On Sydney: \\"The frappuccino heaven that is modern Sydney...\\" \\"We set off on foot to the Museum of Sydney, a sleek and stylish new institution, which manages to look interesting and instructive without actually being either.\\"  On Canberra: \\"Even the lake, which winds a serpentine way between the commercial and parliamentary halves of the city, has a curiously dull, artificial feel.\\" \\"many people believe the Parliamentary Zone has an empty and unfinished character,...  I'll say. It was like walking around the site of a very large world's fair that had never quite gotten off the ground.\\"  On Tanuda: I liked Tanunda [wine country] and had a very pleasant evening there, but there was absolutely nothing exceptional or eventful in the experience,  Adelaide: \\"The real problem with Adelaide these days, I suspect, is that it has just stopped being interesting.\\"    In his defense, Bryson is a superb researcher and editor. He is excellent at culling information from a variety of sources and presenting it in a compelling manner. He did this superbly in the other books of his that I have read, A Short History of Nearly Everything, and The Mother Tongue. This book is no exception; the bibliography attached to In a Sunburned Country is impressive. You can see that he has done his homework.     But even the Australian people are described as being pretty grim: \\"They don't have that happiness in their faces anymore. I don't think anybody does.\\" \\"They are an extraordinarily self-critical people. You encounter it constantly in newspapers and on television and radio--a nagging conviction that no matter how good things are in Australia, they are bound to be better elsewhere.\\"    Then he hits Melbourne and heads out to explore some of Australia's most impressive natural sites. The book changes, it comes to life. Bryson finds the joy and élan he was missing, and suddenly Australia goes from being a place that you might have been relieved not to have visited, to being somewhere that you are dying to go and see.      He still make judicious and effective use of all kinds of interesting factoids, but they are placed in context and made relevant to his experience, as he appreciates the beauty and wonder of the land, and ponders its complex and challenging history.     Despite the cultural wasteland of the Ned Kelly tribute in Glenrowan, friends Alan and Carmel take him to Powers Lookout, and there we are given our first glimpse of the magnificence of Australia's natural features. From there it just keeps getting better and better.    \\"What he had for us the next day was a place called Alpine National Park, and in fact it was even better. Covering 2,500 square miles of eastern Victoria, it was lofty, grand, cool, and green. If ever there was a portion of Australia remote from all the clichéd images of red soil and baking sun, this was it.\\"    The Great Barrier Reef: \\"Well, it was wonderful. No matter how much you read about the special nature of the Barrier Reef nothing really prepares you for the sight of it... I was captivated beyond description.\\"    \\"Daintree National Park. The road wound up and through a mountainous and intensely beautiful rain forest. We had at last madeit into the wet tropics, and I couldn't have been more pleased.\\"    The Gibson Desert: \\"Even on a smoothly paved highway, in the comfort of air-conditioning, you are not entirely robbed of the sense of what the explorers must have gone through. The discomforts can't be fully imagined, but the scale can, and it was awesome.\\"    The uncanny sight of the Devil's Marbles and the mystique of Uluru (Ayer's Rock): \\"In every other way more arresting than you could ever have supposed. I have discussed this since with many other people, nearly all of whom agreed that they approached Uluru with a kind of fatigue, and were left agog in a way they could not adequately explain.\\"    This is travel writing at its best: Just the right balance between historical, scientific, and contextual information, and the beauty and the wonder of just being open to the experience and letting it unfold. That is what tells the reader that something special is out there and that there is an urgent need to see it before time has taken its toll.     Bryson puts his finger on the crux of the matter and wryly notes, \\"Perhaps it's my natural pessimism, but it seems that an awfully large part of travel these days is to see things while you still can.\\" And there is a lot in Australia that is worth seeing.
0807014273|5.0|\\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" is probably the most inspiring book I've ever read, and I've actually re-read it at least five times since first purchasing it a few years ago. If you ever wondered how to find a meaningful life, then this is the book for you. It's important to read the first part which details how Dr. Frankel was able to find meaning in the most difficult of all circumstances, as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp.   However, the real impact is the modern day applications of his theory of Logotherapy, and he brilliantly outlines how his timeless principles are applicable even in 2010! Every time I read the book I find a different way of interpreting his philosophy to a current life situation, and I can highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The band of Brothers is the most amzing mnie-series or movie ever created.  The battle scenes were amazing.  The cinematography was beatiful and the script artfully created.  I enjoyed the depth of the characters; they became friends before the end of the 8th episode.  I highly recommend this series without reservations
B002ZG974M|4.0|I watched this movie with my husband, toddler and baby and we all loved it. It has plenty of \\"maternal nudity\\",   which consists of breasts (when the babies feed) and pregnant bellies. No vaginal or birth scenes here. I got a   lot more out of it than most other people did because I am interested in natural birth, cloth diapering and   organic living in general. I just wish they showed more about how the primitive mothers took care of their babies   when they were sick or injured, baby food preparation, more about how they diaper or potty train- things like that.   It made me realize how absorbed we \\"civilized\\" folks are in all of our gadgets from the moment we are born.   The two developed nation babies quickly had learning toys surrounding them, while the primitive babies played   outdoors with what nature provided. The primitive moms did not worry about their babies crawling naked outdoors   in the dirt, crawling in and drinking from a moving stream, crawling under livestock or on rusty barrels. When I   let my son crawl outdoors he tries to eat every stone he sees, so I don't know how they keep them from choking   on stuff! Meanwhile we developed nation mommas are concerned about each milestone, counting how many words the   child is learning and whether they will be ready for grade school, so why do we complicate things? We tend to go   for the man-made answer to everything. As a mom I felt this movie taught me not to worry so much about the small   things (like back when my son ate a bug & I nearly passed out) and I was reminded that babies are all the same no   matter where they are born, they just adapt differently to the environment they were brought into & this movie lets   us watch that happen.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I prefer the Band of Brothers to the Pacific.  I liked the familiarity of characters in Band of Brothers.  These guys could have been your dad, brother, neighbor.  The pacific characters seemed too ecentric.  While the higgins boat scene in the Pacific was stunning, many of the other special effect shots were disappointing and trite.  I did not like the episodes in the Pacific which strayed from the themes of war and battle.    Kenneth Haft    Glen Allen
0061433047|1.0|I like Pratchett but this last book wasn't up to his normal work. Maybe my Kindle missed a few pages on the download, but it seemed to me there were missing parts. SPOILER ALERT, Like why did Tiffany have to marry Roland and Letitia during the fire? What did that have to do with anything? What bothered me the most was the whole Petty deal. Multiple times in the book (and in previous books) they talk about witches doing what is right and not what is nice. It's right to let a man who beat his daughter so hard that his unborn grandson dies get away with it? It's right to allow that to happen? What happens to Mr. Petty? Nothing as far as I can tell. They revisit the incident and the daughter is a major character in the book, so it's not like this was a throw away incident. That amazed me that there was no resolution to that incident. Maybe Mr. Petty realises he was wrong and stops beating his wife/daughter but that doesn't change the fact he beat his daughter so hard it killed his grandson. In Lonesome Dove (an amazing book, I suggest you read it) Woodraw Call and Augustus McCrae hang their friend Jake Spoon for murder. They do what is right, not what is nice. He begs them to let him go and talks about their past history together to try and get them to relent. They don't let their past history get in the way of what needs to be done, that is doing what is right, not what is nice. Mr. Petty committed murder, he should be punished and he wasn't. That bothered me.
032147404X|4.0|The Digital Photography is targeted at both the beginner and intermediate photographer. It contains about 200 tips on how to make you photos look like the pros'. It is a 218-page book with each tip occupying a page (plus a few pages of ads placed unintrusively at the back of the book). Each tip is accompanied by a high quality picture.<br /><br />There are over 120 tips related directly to shooting:<br />Flowers (11 tips)<br />Weddings (21 tips)<br />Landscapes (29 tips)<br />Sports (17 tips)<br />People (14 tips)<br />Urban Shooting (16 tips)<br />General Tips/\\"Recipes\\" (14 tips/recipes)<br /><br />The rest of the book are primarily tips on equipment (e.g. lenses, tripods, cable release), operating your equipment (e.g. ISO, exposure, tripoding), post-processing (e.g. sharpening, RAW processing, organizing), printing (e.g. print size, paper choice, color profiles), and other topics of interests (e.g. selling your photos as \\"stock\\", monitor calibration, megapixels).<br /><br />The Digital Photography serves as a book that offers a solid, all-round view of general photography techniques. You can benefit from this book even if you're into a particular niche, such as landscape photography.<br /><br />As an intermediate photographer, I already know many of the tips and tricks covered in the book, so I feel the book is perhaps best suited for a person who is just starting to venture into the world of SLR photography. With that said, I did learn some very helpful techniques from the book. I also found many helpful tips for taking more creative shots. All in all, I'd recommend this book for both the beginner and intermediate photographer.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|I have all the A-ha CD's and this one is incredible. The songs are stuck in my head! Simply wonderful songs.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I used this video in a college course I teach. The students have to write a paper on how the life of this young man was affected by the environment he lived in.  They seemed to enjoy the movie even though many had already seen it. I'm hoping I'll enjoy their papers when I get them! Above all the movie is a wonderful story and fits in easily to any kind of education.
B0021L8V1G|3.0|So it is official Tony Stark is Iron Man and he has been given quite a task. What kind of a hero is he going to be and will he destroy himself in the process.<br /><br />This movie of course is only a small portion of what is on the way and now it is no longer a secret. In this movie Iron Man is being taken on by villains and heroes alike. There is a new villain out there who apparently had some connections with Tony's dad wants revenge. Because of his extra fame as an industrialist and a super-hero Nick Fury is trying to make sure that he doesn't get out of control even if it means taking him off the roster of the Avengers.<br /><br />I really can't figure out how to put this review together because that is pretty much what the movie was like. It was a great deal of fun, but it was very much reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock. Just throw your characters to the canvas and hopefully a story will pop out of it. Well thankfully the humor and the great action sequences were able to keep the crowd interested and the movie did make quite a large amount in the box office. Still, in my opinion Marvel has to keep their heads on strait and stick to the plan ahead. There is a monster movie franchise brewing here and if they keep putting together movies like Iron Man 2 people will get very skeptical about the future projects.
044656740X|1.0|The other readers, who gave negative feedback on this book, mention that the author's advices don't work and are even illegal. However, I think that the biggest issue of this book not the advices themselves, but a promotion of sponger way of living. He clearly tells to take money from people without giving anything at all in exchange. He discourages readers to open their own companies stating that they cannot succeed, discourages to get education and do work which is useful to society. Or, to invest in third-party companies (well, he does tell to buy stocks, but only to sell it very soon for higher price). He never tell his readers to think what useful they can do. He brags how he deceives people, but this is not what somebody should be proud of.<br />Also, the author's statement that everyone can make money this way apparently is not true. A society can bear only a small percentage of such spongers. Others have to produce values the spongers speculate.
0316098337|3.0|For the 1st 100 pages of this book I kept telling myself, \\"I can't keep reading this\\".  The language (from the viewpoint of a 5 year old) is so unusual that it takes some getting used to.  But my desire to find out what happens to Jack and his Ma was greater that my desire to stop reading, and I'm glad I stuck with this book.      I can't remember the last time I felt so much sympathy for fictional characters as I did in this book.  The story line is amazing and I would have rated it higher but the language is so peculiar that it was a distraction at times.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I received the Blu-Ray yesterday. This was actually for my wife. I don't care that much for the movie - just a little too sweet for me. However, It appears most of the reviews on this page are about the standard DVD and not the Blu-Ray. I was very interested in how the transfer would look. I'm not a video expert, but I was very pleased with the quality as well as the extras. My wife has seen the movie about 1000 times and was also pleased with the enhanced quality. Hope this helps....
B003VS0CXS|5.0|A family movie from the 1960s that is musical, magical, and mystifying. It grabs your senses using real people, prior to all the animation of today's films. Now--HOW CAN IT BE?--it is even BETTER. If there was a movie destined for Blu-Ray, this would be one. Double Chitty luck for those who own the right players and big screen TVs.<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke as Potts, an inventor extroidnaire, but with inventions more likely to fail than succeed. Van Dyke is not the only huge player. Benny Hill is Potts' father, in a descent sort of way. Lovely Sally Ann Howes appears for glamour but is excellent in her role. Of course it is the castle scenery, the car invention, pirates and so much more that make this a grand story for all ages, and a pure delight on a big screen with Blu-Ray. It's humor, suspense, sweetness, and glorious music and songs that will reconnect with new generations now.<br /><br />I was in college when this movie first ran. Now I buy for my grandchildren. They love it! Nothing quite like this is doable today. This show will never become outdated, especially since technology finds new ways to improve.<br /><br />Final endorsements come from two song titles which you and the kids will be singing for days/weeks. This DVD is \\"Toot Sweet\\", & \\"Truly Scrumptious\\".
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|If you're looking to buy this Blu-Ray, you're likely familiar with the film so no need to review the actual movie.  If by some chance you haven't seen this film then I'll quickly summarize: Awesome classic.    As regards the Blu-Ray, Warner did a fantastic job of restoring this classic film, especially considering the source material they had to work with.  Yes, this Blu-Ray is very grainy.  Yes, some shots are quite soft.  And yes, that's *exactly* how this film is supposed to look.  This was released in 1933; film stock was grainy and lenses were out of focus every now and then.  In this Blu-Ray disc Warner has given us a wonderfully accurate presentation of this historic film.  I commend Warner for resisting the temptation to \\"clean up\\" this film for modern audiences that seem to have forgotten what old movies actually look like.    Complaining about the grain on this Blu-Ray is akin to complaining about the lack of sound in [[ASIN:B0040QYROK The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray]]] (and wait till you see how grainy that is).  Or that Gone With The Wind doesn't fill the entire HDTV screen.  Or that Psycho is black and white.  Or that Kentucky doesn't have ocean front property.  I mean it is what it is folks, no amount of complaining is going to change what this incredible 1933 film looks like.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Like other four-star reviewers here, I'll echo the thought that I was pleasantly surprised by the film, expecting a tired remake of the original, instead of the more polished and fresh movie starring Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.  The kid can actually act.  And Jackie Chan, who was reprehensibly awful in The Spy Next Door, turned in a quietly dignified, subtle and nuanced performance in the mentor role.     A few quibbles.  No idea why a film like this has to be 140 minutes, when 90-100 minutes would have been plenty of time to tell the story.  They never explained why so many American-looking kids lived in the same neighborhood in China as Jaden Smith's character (Drey), was it a special residential block used to house foreigners?  China looks much too beautiful in the movie to be real, it must have been made with the help of the tourist ministry, for example, they have serious air pollution problems in all the major cities.      Other than that, an enjoyable film that honors the original, while updating it and changing the setting to a more exotic locale.
B000002JSN|5.0|physical grafitti is so outstanding.  it is full of high quality musicianship, great lyrics, great guitar licks.  jimmy page stands out as a genius in producing such greatness.  the group are all incredible musicians, and they make their music really magnificent.  page's magical guitar stands out here , as it does in every recording.    it stands out as an album which grabs you and doesnt let you    go.    it just blew me away.  \\"night flight\\" is a gem tucked in with many others.  so many songs that are like that.  they just keep on with one after another fabulous sounds.
0061433047|5.0|I've been a long time fan of this author. The I Shall Wear Midnight book is his best yet. It is an interesting mixture of a witch as a sort of public service, some devious relationships with various normal and truly odd individuals and societies. There is humor, a serious threat, adventure, men growing into their  responsibilities, and a budding romance. I'm already re-reading parts of the book.
0553805371|5.0|I'm not crazy about scientists opining about religion from a scientific view point.  However, this book, like e0very one of Hawking's books, taught me something about the universe that I did not know.  Any book that increases one's knowledge is worth reading.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|It's a little disapointing that this set is nothing more than the regular Blu-ray Editions bundled together with nothign exclusive to this set, but you are getting $105 worth of content (3 blu rays moves at $25 each and digital copies for Toy Story 1 & 2...a digital copy is included with a single Toy story 3 purchase but not 1 & 2) for $65...which is not bad.    The case they are in feels a little cheap and takes up way to much room on a shelf, but thats my only real complaint.  The movies themselves are classics.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great final book to a great series.<br />So glad the loose ends were tied up!
0756665949|3.0|Short review:<br />I do realize this book is an encyclopedia for the series, but I wish they had taken a different approach in producing an official book. I would rather see a season by season dissection of the series, much like Matt Groenig did with The Simpsons ( [[ASIN:0061711284 Simpsons World The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1-20]] ).They could have placed \\"easter eggs\\", trivia, facts, and made the encyclopedia portion a smaller part of the book.
B003WTE886|5.0|Taylor Swift's new CD is outstanding first track to last. I have never purchased a full CD of her music (always downloading what I liked) but this one is worth owning. Her songwriting (always strong) has matured. \\"Dear John\\" is a heartbreakingly bitter song that carries a lot of emotional clout. \\"Mean\\" deals with the bullies of the world in a biting yet positive fashion. \\"Never Grow Up\\" touches your heart. She mixes Country with Pop and has created a CD that is very listenable.
B001SN78JO|5.0|What can I say?  Anything with Jim Carrey is a treat, a fantastic life loving experience.  When I'm blue, depressed, feeling really desolated, it is Jim Carrey to rescue.  This move is no exception, I seen it when I was feeling really not too good.  Made my day, my week may be what do I know may be my whole some time to come.  Thankyou god for Jim Carrey.  He is the Ace Ventura, he is the Fletcher Reed, he is the Charley Baileygates (Nee Hank Evans), he is the Dick Harper and finally he is the Truman and the one and only Chip Douglas (AKA Cable Guy).  Thanks Jim for everything.  Loved the movie for it featured the Bruce Almighty.
B0049EFEPO|4.0|Overall I thought this episode was fairly good. I thought \\"Cloverdale\\" was a slick gloss on the name [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]]. It brought back memories of monsters not seen until late in the story and of the video taping by one of the characters. This episode further develops Chloe's transformation into...who knows what, while tying her and Matt closer together. What I didn't get was whether Chloe's transfusion also furthers her(her host's ?) agenda toward delivering the Destiny over to previously shown aliens. The complexity of her and Dr. Rush's relationship adds a subtle undercurrent of suspense as well. I wonder what the writers have next in mind. Will Chloe and Matt really get married? Does the shared blood mean that they will both be transformed into some sort of human/alien hybrid? Will this cause the Colonel to stop trusting one of his right hand men? There is certainly enough material here to keep me watching.
B003AJKPL2|3.0|Item is clearly durable enough to pit Cherries but it goes to hell quickly when used on Olives. It does not do a clean job on the Olives it does pit and the soft center section tears after pitting just a few dozzen Olives. I have cured Olives for a long time and know what I'm doing. I WAS NOT abusing this tool in any way. I was able to salvage the tool, repair it and it will be used solely as a Cherry Pitting Tool from this day forward and I am sure that it will do a fine job.
B003WSFXKY|3.0|I consider Guitar Heaven not that Greatest as the title. Good performance but I feel it needs more to be a classic.
B00290JDPM|4.0|I purchased this for recording autio during board meetings with 35+ in attendance. The sound is great! The only problems I see with it is that the microphones I purchased didn't work with the recorder. I could use the extra microphones but then the microphones on the recorder did not work. I thought needed to purchase the more expensive microphones but I tested it out without any extra microphones and it worked great! The battery life on the recargable batteries was ok. If you wanna use the power cord the recorder doesn't stand up... big bummer. But all in all I love it!
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Great guitar performance as always. The CD is simply great as it is the name of the CD. Simply CLAPTON. My favorite theme from the albun is Autum Leaves...great interpretation (voice and guitar).
B001HN694K|4.0|I like the fact this was a sequel and not a remake. I loved the animated Disney version as a kid, it was my absolute favorite! I was a little afraid of a dark, weird version of the story messing with my fond childhood memories. The cartoon version is a classic and Disney knew that classics should not be remade, even when it is their OWN classic! The new version is colorful with some dark undertones but it's a fun movie and it's kid friendly. It also is a totally different storyline from the original where we see a 19 year old grownup Alice who remembers little of the strange dream she had as a child.      I think the movie did a good job of being different and original as well as bringing back our favorite old characters only in a human form. I really liked Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter! The Red Queen was especially mean even more so than in the original and she was on the brink of being annoying. Anne Hathaway overacted a little bit in her role as the White Queen though usually she is great in fantasy-like roles like this. I think it was partially the White Queen's makeup too, I thought it was a little harsh. Otherwise the costumes were awesome...and at least the question is answered that many little girls asked when they saw the cartoon, \\"How does Alice's clothing grow and shrink with her?\\" LOL! Well, we see her go through several wardrobe changes throughout the movie so the new generation finally has an answer to this question!     Personally, I think Tim Burton could have added a little more color and fun. Wonderland (now Underland...what is up with the title?) should be a bright, colorful place. Tim also missed the mark a little bit in other areas too. The very nature of the \\"Alice\\" story had a paradoxical, crazy, dreamy kind of vibe. What we see is a gray, dark world that is in ruin because of the evil Red Queen. I would have LOVED to see the White Queen change it back to the colorful, happy place I remember in my childhood but that doesn't happen. It has a good ending that I don't want to spoil but it still left me wanting the crazy, fun and wacky Wonderland that we all are familiar with.      Then again, this is a Tim Burton movie so a lot of it was sort of what I expected. Personally, I think Tim has done ENOUGH with the 'dark' theme. His movies are starting to all look the same. I do appreciate the gift he has for thinking outside the box. Unfortunately though, I think he needs to look outside the box when it comes to his style! I would like to see him make something that is just as flashy and eye catching but that has a little bit lighter of a feel. His work is becoming predictable.       I think they should have chosen a different title for this movie like \\"Return to Wonderland\\" or something like that. It isn't the same story as the original and the name is a little misleading. It is rated PG and this seems appropriate. It IS definitely more of a kid's movie but it does have a lot of action and intense scary music that might be a little much for very small children. I did like this movie and I was entertained. It wasn't boring and would probably hold the attention of kids or adults who are into kid's movies. I would probably watch it again though I don't think I would pay to see it. Honestly, Disney's animated version was better and I would rate it five stars in a heartbeat! Tim Burton's version in my opinion is only worth 4 stars. It was a good movie but it wasn't a great one. It is MUCH better than Tim's terrible \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" remake but I still felt like something about this movie was missing...hence the reason my rating is missing a star!
0316077054|5.0|This is a tough book to review with out giving too much away, but I'll do my best.<br />I really enjoyed Beautiful Darkness.. a strong sequel to Beautiful Creatures.  Although, in my opinion, it did fall just short of the first book.. which I absolutely loved. Mostly I think that was due to the slow pacing of this first hundred pages or so.  Even though I felt it took a bit for me to really get into it.. the book doesn't really spend any time going over what happened in the first book.  Beautiful Darkness jumps right into new content rather than spending time summarizing the previous book.  It's been like 5 months since I read BC, so I went ahead and re-read the last few chapters of BC to refresh my memory a bit and bring me back up to speed on the story and characters I had first fallen in love with.<br /><br />Once the story in BD did start to pick up, there were some answers to question left in BC as well as new questions to be explored, twists, turns and lots of action.  There is a introduction of new, likable characters and the expansion of our favorite existing ones..<br />We learn a lot more of Macon's story and the history of the Blood Incubus, as well as, more about Ethan's mom as he learns more about himself and his own family's past. Ethan is still a very strong character, likable and very relatable. There are a lot of flash backs and history to be told. With all this new information, the Dark and Light,  of the Caster world only becomes more complicated as Lena and Ethan are pulled further apart struggling to find there own path where they fit in.<br />In the end, things aren't so tightly tide up as we are left with a huge cliffhanger and the assurance of a fantastic 3rd book to come.<br /><br />All in all, Beautiful Darkness defiantly not a stand alone book, but is a great read as a sequel and a strong setup for a third book (as it should be). I am really excited to see how things play out in this trilogy and cant wait to get my hand on the final book.
B002LW9ITY|4.0|My 2.5yo son is a big fan of Cars (both the movie and toy cars), and when I saw this I knew he'd love it. No complaints coming from the little guy, but there's something about the metallic paint of these vehicles that don't seem to have the same quality as the typical \\"Cars\\" cars you find in stores.  Not sure if it was due to a limited production run, or simply due to contaminates in the air/paint.  Not an issue for young kids, but may be a concern for some collectors. It looks like each car might come out a little different, dust in the paint, etc..    Very happy with the purchase, and love watching the movie in Blu-Ray. Would definitely recommend to other fans.
B000NVL9FQ|5.0|When this album came out it was during the earliest years of what people now refer to as \\"progressive rock\\";1968-1970. At the time psychedelia wasn't quite over as a musical entity so in it's time it's not entirely certain what adjective people would use for these kinds of albums in their time. In the years after this,especially later in the 70's the music that grew from this and even ELP themselves found themselves on a serious \\"bad taste\\" list to the point where in some circles even picking up records like this would be considered embarrassing. Well even prog haters would have to admit that,especially in the early years of it's existance that there was a lot to admire. Out of all that was happening with King Crimson,Genesis and Yes as the 70's came in this album perhaps did one of the most successful jobs at actually fusing classical/operatic themes with some rock elements among other things. In the end it doesn't quite embody the stereotypical \\"pretentious\\" quality associated with the genre. A good reason for that is Keith Emerson's piano and keyboard work. Even when enterpreting Bartok as \\"The Barbarian\\", \\"Knife Edge\\" from Janacek or on original material such as \\"The Three Fates\\" he presents us with what could probably be best described as \\"chamber rock\\". This album is mostly instrumental and the few vocal bits it does have are hardly defining but Emerson's excellent soloing,especially on acoustic piano will draw most people into the music as opposed to away from it. On multi piece numbers such as \\"Take A Pebble\\" you'll even hear elements of both blues grass and a lot of the jazzier elements Emerson had faced off on with his previous band The Nice. Of course having heard none of their music I have no base for comparasin. The last two numbers of the album \\"Tank\\" and the hit \\"Lucky Man\\" both have conclusions that feature Emerson soloing on a moog synthesizer,probably one of the earliest uses of the instrument on a pop album. Taken together this musicially ambitious but also melodic and wonderfully crafted set of songs are of a type that inspired a lot of people to explore this genre. But you won't find a group just looking for something new and over-the-top to do here;these are three very expert,involved and talented musicians who clearly know what they are looking to achieve and in the end successfully achieved it. So sometimes if a certain music is controversial and you want to understand the positive side of the coin you might want to go to the source and if that's what one does with this album there won't be anything to disappoint.musicially ambitious but also melodic and wonderfully crafted set of songs are of a type that inspired a lot of people to explore this genre.

B003WKOLQO|5.0|Love it. Volbeat continues to raise the bar with their music. This album is a little heavier than previous ones but not too over the top. It may not be metal my mother would like, but then again, who would wants to listen to the music your mom does. I really like that there is still a rockabilly feel to a few of the songs. There are no disappointments with this album. No political B.S. just rock n roll the way it's meant to be. Buy it. One thing that's cool is their last track, \\"Thank You\\", thanking all the fans for supporting them with love and hellfire. Rock on brothers and sisters.     btw - buy all their albums
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I purchased Dexter the fourth season.  I've gotten dvd's from Amazon before, always hassle free and am totally satisfied with the product.  I recommend buying from them anytime.
B00197POXG|5.0|Awesome, Awesome!  Arrived quick and in great shape. It was only dented on the back of the box slightly...didn't affect the quality though!
B001CC7PP8|5.0|First time owning this timeless film and purchased for a Halloween film fest.  50 years after its release, Psycho still embodies the terror and suspense that is synonymous with the name Alfred Hitchcock.  Credit also goes to Bernard Herrmann for the masterful soundtrack--from the nerve-wrecking opening sequence to that legendary shower scene. An absolute Hitchcock masterpiece!
044654759X|2.0|I normally love Nicholas Sparks books but was very disappointed in this one. It was a little slow to start but what really bothered me is that once the villian was introduced it felt like every other paragraph was just a repeat of the villians' twisted thoughts. I understanding needing to develop a character but it felt like he was just repeating the same thoughts over and over just to fill up pages. We get it, he is a crazy bad guy now move on to the rest of the story. I was also very disappointed in the ending. I want a happy ending as much as the next girl but not at the sake of reality. Like another reviewer said if I wanted to read a book about the paranormal I would purposely buy one not get tricked into reading one.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|i own all of the sound of music.  this combo is the best in picture & sound.
B003WTE886|5.0|A beautiful, well-written album with Taylor's signature sound and fresh lyrics. I have been listening to this album on repeat for days and I am still in love with it! I'll admit some of the songs weren't my favorites at first, but once I listened a few times and understood all the lyrics each song had it's own magical qualities. There is not a single song I skip. Worth the price!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This Blu-ray edition is simply the best the film has ever looked on disc. For the Blu-ray the makers went back to the original negative, which was too damaged to use previously, using new restoration techniques. The detail in the picture is just amazing, it's a whole new experience. The sound restoration is remarkable, it's deep and rich and full. Fox have really gone to town with the extras not only do we get all the extras from previous editions but a host of new and rare items to make an astonishing collection. This is one of the best Blu-ray editions yet.  The Sound of Music has always been a superlative film. Every aspect of the film work. The locations, the music, the script the direction and the acting all came together at just the right time to create this film. The jewel in the crown is Julie Andrews, one of the greatest musical performances ever.   A magnificent film presented in a breathtaking edition.
0307474712|1.0|I was very disappointed in this novel.  I was under the impression that it was a romance between two people when in fact it was a romance between Dexter and Dexter.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|No long-winded review of this film is necessary. If you haven't seen it, and you even remotely enjoyed the original, it's sequel, or any other animated film, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. That being said, my kids and I did not have the opportunity to watch this film in 3D and look forward to it's future release for 3DTVs.<br /><br />  As for the format, this is an amazing and feature-rich release. The Blu-Ray creates a better-than-cinema picture on any quality 1080p HDTV. There are dozens of extras, and though I haven't watched each yet the ones that I have seen are high in quality. The 4-disc pack is a must-have for the modern family: The Blu-ray is perfect for movie nights, the DVD is wonderful for the in-car DVD on long trips, and the digital copy works well on the iPod/iPhone for long waits at the airport/doctor's office/etc.<br /><br />Again, this is a great movie.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Jigsaw definitely saved the best for last. A lot of loose ends are tied up. All the pieces now fit together. The final chapter has everything you could ask for in a Saw film. It did seem a little rushed, but it was very suspenseful. I loved all the new traps and twists. The only flaw is that Tobin Bell didn't have enough screen-time as Jigsaw, but you may not notice because of all the new games being played. It was good to see Cary Elwes back as the infamous Dr. Gordon. Hoffman has become more of a serial killer this time and tries to find Jill. An author named Bobby Dagen has written a book about how he survived a Jigsaw trap, but it's all a lie. When Bobby is really thrust into a game, he has sixty minutes to save his wife, or she will die. The Saw franchise has had a good run. I'll miss seeing them at the theater every year. I highly recommend SAW: THE FINAL CHAPTER!!!
0307454541|2.0|Like many others, I was drawn to read the late Stieg Larsson's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo by all the media buzz; you can only hear the words \\"literary sensation\\" and \\"international bestseller\\" so many times without getting a little bit curious. I haven't read much in the crime fiction or mystery genres (unless you can count the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter), but if the first book in Larsson's \\"Millenium Trilogy\\" is typical of these types of books, it seems I haven't been missing anything.<br /><br />The book follows financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and private investigator/hacker Lizbeth Salander. Blomkvist is reeling from a libel case he has lost against a CEO of a large financial firm when he is recruited by an aging industrialist named Henrik Vanger to investigate the mysterious death of his great-niece from nearly 40 years earlier. Blomkvist is only convinced to take on the case because Vanger claims to have information that will help him appeal his libel case verdict. Salander is brought in later to assist in research and to use her photographic memory and phenomenal investigative skills to help Blomkvist. Through different methods, they come to the conclusion that the great-niece's brother, Martin, was somehow involved. The mild-mannered Martin proves to be an active serial kidnapper, rapist and murderer so meticulous in the execution of his crimes that he is only discovered by the pair because of leftover evidence of ritualistic murders Martin's father had committed many years earlier. Salander saves Blomkvist from being murdered by Martin and the pair surmise that his sister wasn't dead at all: she had run away to escape from her demented brother. With the conclusion of the mystery, Blomkvist learns that Vanger never had information that was useful for his appeal. Salander, however, hacks into the personal hard drives of the guilty party. Armed with damning evidence, Blomkvist writes an article and a book proving the claims he had no sources for in the previous year.<br /><br />One striking but unflattering detail about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the unnecessary exposition. Larsson spends a lot of words describing details that are not necessary to the plot. One might argue that exposition is necessary to set the stage and flesh-out the details for a more believable story, but in most cases Larsson's excessive description adds little. There are too many instances in the book where he describes the temperature, the furniture of a room, and the technical specs of hardware when it adds nothing to understanding or appreciating the characters, the setting or the storyline. Why is it important to know about the handmade furniture in Blomkvist's cabin, especially when this tidbit is offered in the last 10% of the novel? How does it help the reader's understanding to name the speed, memory and storage of a laptop when saying \\"Powerbook\\" would have sufficed? I found my eyes glazing over during unnecessarily descriptive paragraphs.<br /><br />Larsson's style and character development is clunky. The text alternated between plain language and particularly dense descriptions of complex financial sector operations. Perhaps this was an issue of translation, but plain writing can be forgiven when the plot and characters are rich. The plot wasn't dull, but it wasn't surprising either. Blomkvist, as described in a report by Salandar, is something of a lothario, yet it is never clear what it is about him that women find so engaging. He is a smart reporter, but he is rarely charming and there is little to go on in terms of physical description to explain why women are so attracted to him. In effect, we are told he is a lothario instead of being shown that he is one.<br /><br />Salander is a more interesting character than Blomkvist, but also more frustrating. It is alluded to that she has Asperger's Syndrome and Larsson's portrayal of her misunderstanding of the world, mistrust of authority figures and aversion to close social and physical contact are well-portrayed. Where Larsson failed concerning Salander is the reaction she elicits from nearly everyone else due to her goth/punk look. Even though this book was published in 2005, the way Salander draws the attention (and prejudice) of others because of her tattoos and dyed hair makes the novel seem dated. The development of her sexual relationship with Blomkvist is both too obvious and unnecessary. It's not surprising that she would be attracted to the one person that accepts her at face value, but it seems odd that Blomkvist takes an interest in her sexually; he has two sexual partners and is working on a third before he ever meets Salander. They seem to have no chemistry with each other, outside of their work, and their relationship adds next to nothing to the narrative and very little to their characters.<br /><br />Despite Salander and her delightful anti-establishment attitude and complex revenge schemes, it is not enough to redeem this book. A dull, plodding story, overly complicated discussions of financial dealings, too many Vanger family members to keep track of, boring characters and clunky execution make The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo one to skip.<br /><br />[This review also appears on FingerFlow.com, a site for review and discussion of creative works.]ical contact are well-portrayed.

B003KLGKAA|5.0|Have watched Doctor Who since it came out I like all the shows this one is good to.
B0040Y7EU6|2.0|We already have an excellent performance of the Carmina Burana on DVD: Seiji Ozawa's 1989 New Year's concert with the BPO and a stellar cast of soloists, together with a fairly smashing Beethoven 9, recorded 2001 in Japan, both in fine sound and fair video. Sir Simon Rattle's new version documents a 2004 New Year's concert at the Berlin Philharmonie and is coupled with Beethoven's Leonore III overture and -- a very British Proms encore -- H&auml;ndel's Halleluja Chorus from \\"Messiah\\" in Sir Eugene Goossens' bombastic beef-up which throws in everything \\"but the kitchen sink\\". In Rattle's understatement: this is \\"a little bit over the top\\". As ever, the BPO musicians play exceedingly well and Leonore comes off fine, though with nary an individual touch. Sir Simon usually is at his best in the flashy, extraverted repertoire and the \\"Carmina\\" start out with an exciting \\"O Fortuna\\". From here on the performance flattens. Despite Rattle's (not always attractive) ecstatic facial and body language, this is a snappy, energetic, but ultimately low-profile reading of Orff's highly dramatic, sensual and evocative score. The soloists and choirs are very good and so is the video, given the ghastly colored floodlights. But the audio (all three tracks) is indeed compressed, as TBS observes. You may try cranking up your (pre)amp's volume. I fared a bit better when I used my (Denon AH-D500) headphones, but nothing will really compensate for the limited dynamic range. This raises the question why EuroArts (who have also done this to other issues) and other companies stupidly sabotage their own productions. Do they really think we listen to DVDs on a Victrola?
0071636080|5.0|Let's face it, few (if any) of those who read this book will then be \\"insanely great in front of any audience.\\" That's not why Carmine Gallo wrote it. Rather, his purpose is to help his readers to present their ideas to anyone, anywhere, anytime \\"with the power of believing in themselves and in their story.\\" Obviously, there are valuable lessons to be learned from what Steve Jobs does and how he does it. He brings so many resources to bear on each presentation. They include (1) a thorough understanding of the given subject, (2) a passionate interest in it, (3) rigorous and extensive preparation, (4) total self-confidence and physical presence that command attention, (5) brilliant insights that are thoroughly developed, and (6) sharp focus on what is most interesting and most important to the audience...and on nothing else. I have seen Jobs in action several times and can attest to the power and impact of what he says and how he says it.<br /><br />Note: Visit [...] and upload his commencement speech at Stanford in 2005. Once you've seen and heard it, you will never forget it. You will also want to share it with recent school and college graduates.<br /><br />Gallo cites a few tips early in his narrative. They may seem simple but don't be fooled. All of the greatest public speakers will tell you that it took them many years (about 10,000 hours) of deliberate practice to master them.<br /><br />1. \\"Plan in Analog\\": Think of the presentation as a story that has a setting, a plot, characters, conflicts, increasing tensions because of unsolved problems and/or unanswered questions, a climax, and a brief concluding lesson.<br /><br />2. \\"Answer the One Question That Matters Most\\":  Those in the audience are asking the same question, \\"Why should I care.\\" Disregard this question and you will lose the audience almost immediately.<br /><br />3. \\"Develop a Messianic Sense of Purpose\\": Gallo notes that Jobs was worth more than $100 million by the time he was 25 and it didn't natter to him at all. That wasn't what he was about. \\"Understanding this one fact will help you unlock the secret behind Jobs's extraordinary charisma.\\"<br /><br />4. \\"Create Twitter-like Headlines\\": Develop headlines into 140-character sentences. Less is more.<br /><br />5. \\"Draw a Road Map\\": Jobs effectively uses the most powerful principle of persuasion, The Rule of Three (i.e. three new products, three objectives, three barriers. three parts, three new features).<br /><br />6. \\"Introduce the Antagonist\\": In each of Jobs's greatest presentations, he introduces a common enemy against which everyone unites, becomes emotionally engaged, prepares to do battle, agrees to make sacrifices, etc.<br /><br />Note: It could be waste, a foreign country, the New York Yankees (\\"the Evil Empire\\"), a product, a competitor. Whatever.<br /><br />7. \\"Reveal the Conquering hero\\": At each presentation, Jobs introduces a hero that the audience can rally around.

B003ES5ZPK|5.0|When you get a new HDTV and decide to mount it on the wall, cable management can be an interesting challenge in of itself, but even more challenging is trying to get the TV as close to the wall as possible without crimping the expensive cables connecting the unit to other components such as a BluRay player, DVD Player, video game system, AppleTV, etc. With this Angle Swivel Adapter for HDMI by AmazonBasics, you are in no danger of crimping your cables and/or forcing the TV to not be flush with the wall or stick out unneccessarily on one side. Not all wall-mountable TVs have their input cables on the side, and even if they do - it's unlikely your other components allow that flexibility when dealing with the challenge of where to put those devices. Cable crimping will cause premature aging of the cables, and fine breaks to the delicate wires insulated inside, leading to quality and signal loss. The adapter swings over 180° (90° each way) and the swivel has about 75° of play each way, making this a must-have for wall-mounts or even just tight enclosures when dealing with lots of cables inside an entertainment center. It is sturdy and well constructed.

It's a nice box set to take along if you're going to be teaching others to play for the first time.  We also picked up one up for my father-in-law for Christmas.  He used to play D&D and the art in the red box is very reminiscent for him.  A great product and at a great value.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|'Mojo' as its name suggests is probably the closest Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers will ever get to making a pure blues album with Tom Petty orchestrating his usual magic as a songwriter on guitar & vocals leaving Mike Campbell to cast his spells on lead guitar. Keyboard maestro Benmont Tench augments proceedings on various pianos and organs whilst Ron Blair plays bass, Steve Ferrone plays drums & percussion and Scott Thurston adds additional guitar & Harmonica. Unlike previous albums, Mojo captures the band jamming during various 'live' sessions in the studio (mostly without the use of overdubs) creating a diverse range of fabulous new songs, some influenced by other great artists and many with both feet firmly in the blues!<br /><br />First up is the fast rocking 'Jefferson Jericho Blues' that opens with a lurid tale about Thomas Jefferson before the band decide to reveal their psychedelic side on the dreamy 'First Flash of Freedom' that has some great moments throughout followed by the upbeat 'Running Man's Bible' which certainly gets the pulse racing! On 'The Trip to Pirate's Cove' we discover a musical treasure that resembles 'Slabo Day' by blues legend Peter Green before a compelling 'Candy' and melancholy 'No Reason To Cry' lead us into the powerful 'I Should Have Known It' that salutes vintage Led Zep! 'U.S. 41' tells a tale from the Great Depression country blues style whilst 'Takin' My Time' unleashes some great heavy delta blues before 'Let Yourself Go' features Scott Thurston giving his all on harmonica. 'Don't Pull Me Over' is the rhythmic reggae wildcard on this album and if you thought pure blues was 'risky' for these guys... then check this one out! Mike Campbell's Gibson Les Paul Sunburst cries out sublimely into the night on 'Lover's Touch' before delivering haunting guitar licks (worthy of Mick Taylor back in his heyday with the Stones) on 'High In The Morning'.

1904633781|5.0|Amazon: You folks aren't thinking.  I do not have time to do this for all the purchases I make.  Plus I am ordering books.  I want to read them, not make a video about getting the book.  I am happy to do the old way, but this is a bit too much.  Now, if it is something extraordinary I would be willing to write more--like this time. I am merely asking for the sellers to do as they promised and will let them know I am satisfied or not.  This particular book arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|I call this a popcorn movie, which is my way of saying it's not meant to be taken too seriously.  For instance one reviewer was upset because it's called the Karate Kid, but there's no Karate (in the formal sense) in the movie.  This film is not trying to be any more authentic than the first film was.  It strikes a nice balance between following the original storyline and adding enough new material to be interesting.  There are a couple of scenes that pay homage to the original movie.  I won't describe them (no spoilers!) but if you saw the first movie you will notice and get a few chuckles.  There's a lot to like, including Jackie Chan in the mentor role and a few scenes of real martial artists displaying their highly developed skills.    The only criticism I have is the tournament fight scenes feel quite a bit more violent than in the first movie.  It's hard to believe that young teenagers would be allowed to fight using martial arts without any protection and a clear sense of limits.  The fights are exciting in part because they convey great danger, but parents may want to remind their young martial artist children not to take such risks in the real world.    In a nutshell if you liked the first movie then I believe you will enjoy this reprise.
030745455X|2.0|I've read a lot of mystery books and I had a hard time keeping interested in this one. Characters not developed, motivations not clear. Disappointing ending. Won't be reading more from this author.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|I bought the movie because I liked it.  I enjoyed the special features and I thought the film (although different from the book) was excellent - but then I didn't expect the movie to follow the book exactly, they rarely do.<br /><br />The action was excellent, the acting was great, and the characters draw you in (which is high compliment from me since I usually much prefer books to movies).  This is a great movie to sit down and watch with family and/or friends and popcorn.
159448385X|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations.  I bought it because I belong to a book club in my neighborhood, and this was the choice.  I have always enjoyed mystery books, so this was a departure from my usual selections.  However, I am very glad I had the opportunity to read it.  Although I began the book by hoping I could get through it in time, I finished wanting more.  The author is a terrific writer.  Although there was a lot of detail to the story -- which I don't usually care for -- this detail added a great deal.  I learned a lot from reading this fictional but factual story, and I do recommend it highly.
B000001GQD|5.0|So, my two cents. Yet another five-star review. I have been listening to classical music for a very long time. But when I heard Richter play the Rachmaninoff, I had the oddest feeling that I was hearing it for the first time. He plays with such utter clarity, and this is really Richter's strength - absolutely perfect articulation. Regardless of how fast he plays or how enormous the chords and arpeggios are, every note is distinctly audible. Surely, this has to be the best performance of this concerto. Never mind that the orchestra is just so-so, and that the conductor is also just so-so ... at least he doesn't get in Richter's way, and this CD is about Richter, not the conductor.<br /><br />The Tchaikovsky has been criticized a lot, not because of Richter but rather Von Karajan. I have never liked Karajan's work. He is about as exciting as a glass of water. And, yes, this performance suffers from a lack of vigor with a quite slow tempo. To give some credit to Karajan, although it is lacking in drama, and while it does not make up for the lack of excitement, it is certainly eloquent.<br />However, again, this disk is about Richter, not the conductor, and once more, I felt as though I was hearing this concerto for the first time. I heard things that I never heard before, not even from Cliburn whose version with Kondrashin is certainly more energetic. Cliburn was a fine young pianist with a lot of talent. But Richter was a musician.<br /><br />As for the comment from a previous reviewer criticizing the sound quality ... you should hear the Melodiya release with Richter/Mravinsky/Sanderling first, then you would appreciate this CD more. Mravinsky and Sanderling with the Leningrad Orchestra may have given better performances and Richter may have been more free on the Tchaikovsky than he was with Von Karajan, but how can you tell? The sound quality is just awful (see my review for the depressing truth). The sound on this DG CD is certainly good enough considering the recording dates.<br /><br />All told, an excellent disk. Well worth the modest price.told, an excellent disk. Well worth the modest price.

0316010669|5.0|The eyes may be the windows into our soul, but facial expressions are apparently good indicators of everything from how likely a marriage is to survive to how likely a suspect is to pull the trigger on his gun.  It seems almost intuitive that over-analyzing is counter-productive, but Malcolm Gladwell gives us lots of examples to prove it, including a war game that made me cringe to think that our military really operates this way.  Almost as scary is the process of determining how to handle ER patients with chest pain, in which case too much information may actually be misleading information.  The author takes several detours, including one at the end that indicates that first impressions are not always valuable, particularly where a gender or racial bias may come into play.  The conventional wisdom that women are inferior to men in the brass section of an orchestra is blown to smithereens by blind auditions.  Warren Harding was elected President, apparently because he looked the part.  Gladwell also points out that often our choices, in everything from speed-dating to music, do not always bear out what we say we like.  In fact, we may claim to dislike something just because it's different, but without innovation, where would we be?  Thanks heavens market research is sometimes ignored.  In the case of New Coke, the taste tests were taken seriously, and they proved to be totally deceptive, since taking a sip of something is a lot different from drinking an entire 12-ounce can.

1419553429|1.0|The book has 2 parts: First 2/3 verbal and last 1/3 math. There are very FEW questions and no practice tests in this book.    The math part is OK, but do not expect any good tips or examples of difficult GMAT questions. It is NOT any different from regular GMAT books in terms of difficulty of questions. The title 800 GMAT is absolutely and completely misleading. The questions do not resemble GMAT questions. For example, divisibility and mods, which are quite frequent in GMAT, are not covered (I got 2 in my GMAT). Princeton Review's Cracking GMAT book has more difficult questions than Kaplan 800 GMAT. Last but not least, there are duplicate questions in the book.    The verbal section is in complete disarray. The questions are not great and the explanations for answers of some questions are ridiculous, unclear or insufficient. It feels like they just didn't want to put any attention into the content. It feels like it was assembled by a greedy corporation.    Overall, the book was worse than useless. It did not improve my math score (I scored same before and after studying this book), but it may have lowered my verbal score due to confusing and misleading explanations to questions. I recommend Princeton Review Cracking GMAT over Kaplan 800 GMAT.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|The story is great. I read it in paperback awhile back. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is so full of typos and other errors that it distracts from the story. For example, instead of 'hand of the king', it says 'hand of the ring'; 'longs words' instead of 'long swords'; 'torn' instead of 'tom'; 'righting someone else' instead of 'fighting someone else'; just to name a few. There are many more, and I'm not even one third through the book. Also punctuation errors.<br />I contacted Amazon about this problem, and got a reply stating that they were working on getting it fixed. I hope they do, as a book as good as this deserves a better translation.

Its different and unless you have an ear for the beauty of the art involved in this type of blending, you wont get it!  Serj truly enjoyed himself and its reflected in his voice and pose.  So if your the type of person that actually understands and enjoys the 'art' of music and Serj's unique ability of song and composure, you'll love this perspective.

B003UERZ88|2.0|The single most unremarkable piece of work Halford has put out since Two (anyone remember that boring crap?).

Now I have to actually go out and buy a real chihuahua.
B003VBVQKS|5.0|This one deserved a sonic massage and got it! Interesting package - the first CD has a crisp remaster, the second has a remix in which the bass and drums have much more oomph and the songs go all the way til the actual end rather than fading out, so you get some extra Tommy Bolin guitar in there. That adds to the enjoyment. The 2 bonus tracks are fun also; one is a big fat crackling riff with a nice little Jon Lord keyboard solo. The other song is just Ian Paice drumming away while Tommy Bolin throws a barrage of guitar licks at him. Very free-spirited and a taste of what should have been had this line-up lasted....

B003U0AHBO|3.0|I've always been a major Robin Hood fan. It all started with the quintessential Robin Hood film that I grew up with starring Errol Flynn. Swashbuckling at its best, this film was by far the best telling of the story of Robin Hood. Several others have done a good job as well. I even liked ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES even though many critics rapped on Kevin Costner for not adopting an English accent. In any event, I'm a Robin Hood fan.<br /><br />Sorry to say but I'm not a big fan of the new release to DVD, ROBIN HOOD starring Russell Crowe in the title role. Its not that it's a bad film, it's just not the Robin Hood I'm used to. Perhaps it's not even the Robin Hood that most people are used to.<br /><br />The film begins in the camp of King Richard where Robin Longstride (Crowe) is an archer in the King's army. On their return from the Crusades, the army is attacking castles on the way home. The King ventures out one night in search of one honest man, he gets and earful from Robin. While glad for his honesty, this leads to Robin and his friends being placed in the stocks during the next battle. A bad decision as during the battle the King is killed.<br /><br />Now here is perhaps the biggest problem with this film. While many films seem in need of more story, this film has far too much. We're given scenes of Prince John, the heir to the throne behind Richard and his petulant child attitude towards life. We are shown the King of France plotting an invasion of England with traitor Godfrey (Mark Strong). We get court politics in the form of William Marshall (William Hurt) trying to do all he can to save England. And we eventually see a group of the King's men returning home with his crown led by Sir Robert Loxley only to be ambushed.<br /><br />Thanks to the efforts of Robin and his men heading home on their own after learning of the King's death the crown is retained but at the cost of Sir Robert's life. Robin promises to return the crown to London and Sir Robert's sword to his father. Thus is set in motion an elaborate lie.<br /><br />Robin returns and is greeted by Robert's wife Marion (Cate Blanchett) and Robert's father Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow). Returning the sword, Sir Walter offers Robin a chance to better himself and help by posing as his son. Thus Marion would retain the land in the Loxley name and the lineage would continue.<br /><br />While all of this is going on, Godfrey has convinced King John (now in place after receiving the news of his brother's death) that the crown needs more funds and must enforce the taxes people have been lax on. Given a command of his own, Godfrey has them killed by a team of French soldiers who are now under his command, plundering each town they go to in an effort to anger the Barons thus causing a civil war to break out.<br /><br />Okay let's face it, Robin is the star of this movie and you know up front that he's going to save the day. Word of the uprising reaches Sir Walter and the arrival of Sir William also brings about the back history of Robin. But I won't spoil that for you. I also won't tell you what happens from here on out with the exception that by the end of the film you discover that all of this takes place and sets the stage for the legends of Robin Hood we've all grown up with; living in the forest, loving Marion, his merry men, etc.<br /><br />If you can't tell from what I've told you already, there is tons of story involved in this telling of the tale of Robin Hood. So much so that at times between not being sure who is English and who is French and just who is siding with whom it gets a bit confusing. Some will have no problem following along here (fortunately I didn't but it felt time consuming) but others will wonder what in the world is going on.<br /><br />The cast does a good job here but no one shines in any role. Crowe, who I think is a great actor, just seems to be going through the motions. Blanchett seems to be far too much of an independent woman forthis to be taking place in the late 12th century. Only von Sydow comes off well as the blind patriarch trying to save his land and his country.<br /><br />The golden age of the swashbuckler remains the classic telling of the tale. This film features much less action and only in about two scenes makes note of the famed skills with a bow and arrow possessed by Robin Hood. Don't misunderstand; it is a good movie, just not one that I'm likely to watch repeatedly. Instead I'll take down the classic with Errol Flynn, pop it into the DVD player and watch it again. It remains the standard that all Robin Hood films must be compared to.mes off well as the blind patriarch trying to save his land and his country.

1582701709|2.0|Thinking positive, being positive ...while ignoring the natural laws and systems of persistent effort, innovation, focusing on your life goals and hard work are simply good hopes without substance.  I felt I was insulted when I read about this guy who was expecting to receive checks in his mail box ....I think will wish that for next month too..instead of receiving my water and energy bills on my mail inbox :)<br /><br />There are some natural laws and principles you can not go against...you can try to cheat life but in the end you receive what you pay for.  You can hope to win the lottery and spend a lot of money in it , or you get yourself a better education , being more proactive in your work , organize to build a business...that is you choice.

B003TVMIDO|3.0|Let me start by saying I have only just received this box and have not yet listened to the entire set. First of all, I was disappointed to discover that the 'Double Fantasy' disc does NOT include the 'stripped down' remix, which means a separate purchase of that disc is required. For some reason I had assumed that this high-end box would include the remix also, as the single disc (without the remix) cannot it seems be purchased separately. Nice way to annoy those fans willing to spend up big on the boxed set!    I was aware that the box did not include Lennon & Ono's first three so-called \\"experimental\\" albums. This may be understandable from a commercial point of view, but surely these three albums are an important part of Lennon's solo output, which is supposedly celebrated in this box. Same goes for the Live Peace in Toronto LP, as well as several worthwhile compilations and live LPs from the '80s (Menlove Avenue, Live in New York City). Surely it is clear by now that fans willing to fork out for an item like this are also the kind of people who want *everything* included - b-sides, non-album singles, live LPs, compilations, and so on. Is it really that difficult?    The packaging seems overblown and unnecessary, and in some ways poorly designed. It's tasteful for sure, but the fact that the box is about three times the required size seems over the top. I haven't seen so much wasted space inside a box since I bought Windows 95. The CD sleeves sit open edge down so the discs and booklets can easily become dislodged. The slide-out tray is an interesting touch I suppose, but overall the size of the box is a problem. Trying to fit this box as well as the differently shaped Beatles remasters (plus the Lennon Anthology etc) on a shelf is more difficult than solving Rubik's cube. Finally, the annoying habit of attaching cardboard to the *outside* of the box annoys the hell out of me. Once the shrinkwrap is off there is nowhere to put this oversized piece of cardboard, which is really only there to act as eye candy on the shelf.    Other reviews have commented on the poor sound quality, and I tend to agree based on my first listens. At first I thought my 'Double Fantasy' disc was faulty, so poor was the sound quality to my ears.    Overall, I am mighty unimpressed by this box considering the hefty price tag. Up until now I was reasonably positive about Ono's handling of Lennon's catalog, but this has changed my mind.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Can it really have been 26 years since we witnessed Daniel-san take on the Cobra Kai and win? Yes unfortunately it has. So what better time than now to take that story and make it something just a little bit different?<br /><br />THE KARATE KID is not a remake of that classic film starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. Instead the film makers have decided to take the thin outline of a plot and turn it into something new, something a bit original. The fights, the teenage love story and the relationship between teacher and student are there, but this film changes enough to make it not the original.<br /><br />Jaden Smith stars a Dre Parker, a young boy whose mother has just taken a job in Beijing, China.  Leaving their home in Detroit for the great unknown, Dre isn't quite sure how to adapt to his new location at first. Making a friend with another transplanted young boy, Dre eventually goes down to the playground near his house. There he meets Meiying, a young Chinese girl practicing her violin in the park. But before a friendship can begin, another boy who fancies Meiying takes a poke at Dre.<br /><br />Cheng, the class bully, faces off against Dre and easily takes him down. Using martial arts techniques Dre is unfamiliar with, he is ridiculed in front of his new friend and ends up going home bruised and beaten.<br /><br />The bullying continues until Dre sees a chance and tosses a bucket of slop water on the bully and his friends. After a chase through the back alleys, they end up near Dre's home but not close enough for him to get away. Another beating follows but as Cheng is about to punch the fallen Dre one more time he is stopped by Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), the building superintendent.<br /><br />With more moves than the group of boys can handle, Mr. Han easily disposes of the group. After taking care of Dre, a discussion follows in which Mr. Han states that there are no bad students, just bad teachers. He then suggests that Dre state his case to their teacher and ask for peace. But Dre has already seen their teaching style of no pain, no mercy. When Mr. Han accompanies Dre to the dojo, he learns what the teacher is like and rather than allow Dre to be beaten non-stop, offers to accept a martial arts tournament challenge rather with the school as long as the bullying stops.<br /><br />So much for the set up. Now it's up to Han to teach Dre how to defend himself. But Han doesn't look at kung fu as a way to defeat someone. He looks at it as an art form, a way to insure peace rather than war. And Dre must learn that as well, the heart of the form as well as the moves. The training is slow going and Dre doesn't recognize that he is even being taught. That changes and he begins to understand better as well as become accomplished in what Han is trying to teach him, eventually preparing him for the final battle.<br /><br />On this journey of self discovery Dre also finds time to find his first big romance and learn about respect as well. He matures as the story moves forward and comes to realize that winning isn't the only thing.<br /><br />With the exception in the change of locale making Dre not just a transplant from one part of the U.S. to another, he faces total change not only in language but in culture as well. He discovers that perhaps he's not as all that as he thinks he is and changes both physically and mentally.<br /><br />Jaden Smith does a fine job as young Dre, showing an acting ability that comes from his own talents and not totally from his parents (Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith). His portrayal is believable and well done. Jackie Chan also shines giving a performance that many will be stunned by. Normally the comedic fall guy in most of his films, Chan has a chance at a real dramatic role here with one of the most touching scenes in the film relating to his past.<br /><br />No, this film is not a remake of the original. It has its own feel, its own pacing and its own style. The film has taken a skeleton of a story and placed muscle and flesh on it. This is not your father's KARATE KID. It's a new story for a new generation.It's a new story for a new generation.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|I gave it 2 stars because it's John Mayer - that's really the only reason.  If it were anyone else I'd give it 1 star.  I think he's amazingly talented.  I've enjoyed all of his previous albums (Continuum especially), but this album is just not up to his standards.  The entire thing sounds like background music.  Nothing stands out.  The lyrics are far from clever like in his previous work.  You can do better John.  I'm still a fan.  I believe in you.
B0009KQOLU|5.0|Great Kung Fu movie. If you liked the first then you will like this one. More of a story this time and less bloody great fights and twists.
B00406UK5A|3.0|Faring better here than he did with his last lackluster effort (Doomsday), director Neil Marshall's Centurion details the story of Roman soldier Quintus Dias (rising star Michael Fassbender), who after becoming the sole survivor of a Pictish raid, finds himself among the Ninth Legion led by a heroic general (The Wire's Dominic West) to take the fight directly to the Pict.  Things end up not going so well, as soon enough Quintus and a handful of others are hunted down by the fierce, animalistic warriors.  While Centurion offers up ample amounts of bloody violence, warrior philosophy, and gorgeous cinematography; the film as a whole doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before in any other media of this type, whether it be 300 (which Fassbender and West both oddly enough starred in), HBO's Rome, or even the Spartacus series on Starz, minus the slow-motion/quick-edit fight scenes that is, which we should all be thankful for here.  Still though, the cast is great, with Quantum of Solace beauty Olga Kurylenko being a stand-out as a mute, vengeance-driven Pict femme fatale.  All in all, Centurion isn't bad one bit, and is a nice return to form for Neil Marshall, who brought us modern-day genre classics like Dog Soldiers and The Descent, and if nothing else, hopefully Centurion is the starting point in the right direction for the director to go.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|It seems that Hollywood has fallen in love with comic book characters once again. Of course Hollywood tends to do so when a genre makes money. The success of BATMAN BEGINS and IRON MAN as well as their sequels has Hollywood realizing fans are willing to pay top dollar when their heroes are done right. But on occasion those in Hollywood still think they can do the original better and anger fans, as was the case with the release of JONAH HEX. But when looked at on its own instead of through fans eyes, this movie isn't all that bad.<br /><br />Josh Brolin stars as the title character; a Confederate soldier who decided there'd been enough bloodshed, killed his best friend/commander and turned in his fellow soldiers so he could get on with his life. Unfortunately his friends father was a maniacal leader named Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) who didn't take kindly to his son's death of Hex' becoming a traitor. So he burns Hex' wife and child alive while forcing him to watch and brands his face with the letters QT.<br /><br />Hex survives the ordeal, is rescued by Crow Indians and finds himself with a power to communicate with the dead, apparently due to his near death experience. Revenge escapes him though with Turnbull dies in a fire. Hex, scarred for life inside and out, takes on the role of bloody avenger and becomes the deadliest bounty hunter around, taking out those who would prey on the innocent in the most brutal ways possible. And you learn all this within the first 5-10 minutes of the film!<br /><br />But this is a movie that last 81 minutes so we need a story. It turns out that Turnbull never really died. Instead, he's been leading a group of mercenary soldiers who still think there's a chance for the south to rise again. So much so that they've discovered a secret weapon the Union had and never put together and are now gathering the pieces to do so. Once built, cities will be set aflame and their cause will bring about a new order in America.<br /><br />Knowing of his past relationship with Turnbull, President Grant orders Hex be turned lose on his trail and bring Turnbull to justice. In return, Hex will receive a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed as a bounty hunter (like the killing the dirty Sheriff early in the film). Knowing who he's after means Hex cares less about the bounty and more about the man he's pursuing.<br /><br />Just before being \\"recruited\\" to set out after Turnbull we get the chance to meet Hex' girlfriend for lack of a better term. Suffice to say that Lilah (Megan Fox) uses her womanly ways to earn a living in the Wild West. Get it? Good. But she has a soft spot for Hex who passes on the chance to be with Lilah forever because anyone who gets close to Hex has a tendency to end up dead.<br /><br />As Hex follows leads to find Turnbull, we get to see his abilities come in handy. He questions a recently deceased member of Turnbull's army and later digs up his old friend, Turnbull's son, to get more information that will bring him closer to the living Turnbull. A final confrontation is sure to follow and it does. To find out if Turnbull is successful in bringing down the USA, you'll have to rent or buy the movie.<br /><br />The movie is beautifully shot and looks great in scene after scene be it the desert, a town out west or an abandoned fort taken over by the bad guys. The special effects, especially when Hex talks to the dead, are top of the line and believable as far as raising the dead goes. And the make up, most notably that used on Hex which involves a sort of hole in the cheek burnt face look, is done to perfection.<br /><br />Brolin does a solid job as Hex, a man tormented by his past, afraid of his present and uncaring of his future. One risen corpse tells him that they're waiting for him down below but it doesn't seem to faze him. He knows he'll get there eventually but he has work to do on Earth first.<br /><br />Fox does little more than look good but for the most part I think her fans expect little more than that. Does she have acting ability? Sure, but when your roles all call for you to be scantily clad or topless (not here) then your acting isn't what most people are looking for. I think she has the talent, let's just hope we see more of that instead of skin next time around.<br /><br />Malkovich does a great job of being the over the top bad guy. Heck, he does a good over the top good guy too (see his performance in RED for that). Here he has little to work with but makes what he has work for him. He's mean as can be and that makes you root more for Hex.<br /><br />On the whole the movie offers an enjoyable night's entertainment, delivering plenty of action and story to boot. While it may not be the movie die hard comic book fans expected, everyone else will have a good time with it. Give it a rent and afterwards you might even consider adding this one to your collection of westerns.<br /><br />One last note. In watching this I was expecting something that was one of the most terrible films ever made. The online world has portrayed this film as deserving of a Golden Turkey award. Viewing it from that perspective made the film far more enjoyable and less a struggle than perhaps a fan of the comic series might have with it. Viewed on its own merits as a piece of fluff entertainment, it does a great job.Sure, but when your roles all call for you to be scantily clad or topless (not here) then your acting isn't what most people are looking for.

0887307280|5.0|If you have ever considered starting your own business, reading this book is a must to create a foundation for your ideas.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Bloody. Read other reviews if you need but buy this if you like bloody dark adventures. The best series in a long time in my book. A must have. NOT FOR THE KIDS.
B003U4UNUU|5.0|Video played fine for my wife.  No issues. ... Well other than I believe she has a crush on Sawyer now.  Hmmm.
1573300403|5.0|A wonderful treat to see most of Michael's music videos. There were some I hadn't seen before and certainly not the long editions. I played them as background music for a family gathering and we were soon all mesmerized, stopped talking and just watched, cheered and danced.
B00000JLWW|2.0|I feel kind of bad writing this because I haven't asked for a refund or exchange, but for $15 I didn't think it was worth my time.  Two major issues:  1) The disk skipped multiple times in my player (not sure how since DVD is new?)   2) The screen was small on my TV.  I tried to adjust to make it bigger, but I believe that's how the picture was put on the DVD.    Overall, the movie was ok, I got past the skipping parts, but it was not what I expected for my $15 + S&H.
B0009KQOM4|5.0|Not all movies are serious and should be just a good laugh. This one gets a 5 because Selma does a striptease that is so sexy but she does not remove any clothes so I guess it is a dance not a strip. The movie is funny to me and worth buying if you have a dark side to you.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|So there I was waiting for something to do on the weekend this popped up, didn't read a review and only saw one television spot. Not the usual routine I go when watching a new movie, so in short it was a gamble. Great halls above, if I can win in Vegas with gambling like this I'd be rollin' in the green! I have never had so much fun watching a movie(twice), I mean the entire theatre was synced up with the laughs, and guffaws. The writing and casting were on point, clever and full of one-liners that have earned their place in my dictionary.<br /><br />Aside from the visual candy of special effects and cinematography, Scott is a Bass Player, aside from Flea of the Peppers, nothing this cool ever happens to bass players. Mike ripped this roll and his somewhat reserved and straight-faced acting paid off with benefits, he even got down with some of his own stunts. From a gamer and comicbook geek's point of view this was an unexpected fun ride with a really good soundtrack accompanying it with an added bonus. And yes, I own the soundtrack and play it religiously. The Blood Red Shoes will have you bopping and breaking out you air guitar and Beck's emotional acoustic number will have you wanting to date a girl named Ramona.<br /><br />This film touches on a myriad of subjects and it blends them well and serves it up for any moviegoer to enjoy; may I suggest a cold Coke Zero with that? Whether you are a fan of the genres this film hurls at you in roaring balls of flame, you'll fall right in line with the rest of the crowd when the door opens up for an experience that will hold nothing back. Do yourself a favor this year and get this movie, it's a keeper.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Phenomenal. A must have for any Michael Jackson fan. His artistry in song and dance come alive in this performance. It was almost like being there
B0036EH3UC|5.0|This includes every episode of every season.  Definitely worth getting if you want to have all the episode.  BSG as a show is strange because they have season 1.0, season 1.5, ect. so it could be easy to miss some of the first season - but this package has everything.
B0009VCSYQ|5.0|My girls love the movie. The movie is the good girl makes good doing bad but not to bad stuff story. Not a must have but still a good buy. Maybe not for every family but my girls are old enough to see this stuff. No nudity.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This video takes you \\"backstage\\" with Page, Edge, and White to see some of their creative processes. It inspired me to write more music.
142311339X|5.0|There are Greek Gods and there are Roman Gods.  They are the same Gods with different names.  A child of a God and a human is called a demigod.  And with that we are introduced to three demigods destined to become heroes.<br /><br />Set in modern day America, the three face difficult tasks on their way to winning the initial quest while battling forces of nature and some of the lesser gods from mythology.  This book is an exciting read that leaves the reader anticipating the second book in the series.<br />But while you wait for the second book, pick up the first of the Percy Jackson series.  You'll wonder why you missed it.  Rick Riordan brings mythology into a real world.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Sometimes you watch a movie and sense that the actors had as much fun as the audience. This is one of those. Won't change the world, but it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. You'll have a good time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is for the people wanting to shred it up. Not quite as hard as P90X but the volume is way up. My wife went from a good \\"in shape\\" size 3 (she is a tiny thing) to a completely ripped to the core warrior size 1 using Jullian Micheals books and DVDs. My wife has always been sexy, smart, and confident but she has really turned it up using JM media. I will tell anybody to listen to this woman. Male or female use her program, IT WORKS!!! I am more of a big heavy lifter but her ideas are game changing and I take stuff away from her as well. JM is not a fad, JM is for real people. Am sure she makes a fortune but what she gives you is priceless. If you are 500lbs this DVD is not for you, but she has the stuff that is. I hope you come back and buy this when you are 200lbs to push yourself futher. I am not a paid reviewer, I am a very happy husband who watched his wife become a completely ripped to the bone machine using JM stuff.
B0028R3NCU|1.0|I really want this reader to work because of the small size and easy \\"pocketablity\\".  I am now on my 3rd one.  1st one lasted about 5months - quit working, card is fine though.  2nd one failed after 1month, card is still fine.  Trying the third one now, but not holding high hopes.      I also went through one of the Elong fobs - it failed after about 3months.      I am in an office setting every day - no water or abusive environment.  I leave the adapter hanging from a small Swiss Army Pen knife in my dress slacks.      Right now I am trying out the SanDisk MicroMate adapter.  We shall see...
006029129X|5.0|What is there not to like about Harold and his purple crayon?  It is a child's imagination at the highest level.  No problem is too difficult to be solved as long as Harold holds the crayon in his hand.  And in his hand it stays until Harold joins the rest of the world in blessed slumber.  Enjoy Harold.  Remember what it was like to be a child.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|Paul Keith Davis spoke of Secretariat - with a heart 2 1/s times larger than normal, coming from behind, increasing as she goes - as prophetic of a generation. This was BEFORE Disney undertook to popularize this legendary horse. Amazingly, it is being released just as the Hebrew new year 5771 begins, which is also prophesied to be the year of the horses, those who run under God's authority in unbridled power. See the article here: [...]
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Really great movie, but it kills the entire next generation series. There is way too much time travel in the Star Trek series and movies. The movie is a game changing event so they can rewrite Star Trek with Kirk and Spock from a different angle.
B000059XUO|5.0|i would pretty much have to say that this movie was good the last time i watched it on a vhs and for this price who could not want to buy it on dvd. i love it. so glad that i found it and didnt have to dig out the vcr. lol =)
B003XL6EKS|3.0|Flamingo (Deluxe Edition) by Brandon Flowers is an album I would call a \\"beautiful mess\\". I had high hopes for Brandon's first solo effort. I love The Killers and I knew that this album would be very different but sometimes change is not always a good thing. Brandon's voice and melodies have always bring his strong attributes but the concept and lyrical structure fall flat and after listening to this album for 56 minutes - instead of feeling refreshed, all I feel is confused and drained. Half of Flamingo is great and the rest is just so-so. Standout tracks include: Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Hard Enough (featuring Jenny Lewis), Playing with Fire (this track gets better as it goes along), Magdalena, Crossfire, On the Floor, Swallow It, and The Clock was Tickin' (a surprise gem). I have been listening to this album for a month now and I sorta like it but I don't love it. Brandon Flowers is a talented artist but I think he does his best work with his boys backing him up. 3 1/2 stars for Flamingo.
B0038QMREA|1.0|This guy is horrible !<br />I hope he hasn't given up his day job!<br />There is a resemblance to him and Dylan now though.<br />They both sound like froggy on the muppets.
B00005QBUK|5.0|Great sound, inconspicuous, and rugged for its frame.  The headphones are easy to pack and/or stow away.  Great for listening to sound on laptops.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I almost never post reviews on Amazon, but felt the need to after reading some of the negative reviews on here for 'The Pacific'.  The bottom line is that TV doesn't get better than this.  Truth be told, movies rarely get better than this.  I am honestly stunned that anyone wouldn't be impressed and respectful of this monumental work of art.  I know that there is no pleasing everyone, but for me it is hard to find much to criticize about 'The Pacific'.  The constant comparisons to 'Band of Brothers' are understood, but I actually felt that 'The Pacifc was more human and real.  Both are outstanding though, so noo need to complain about either.  Per the title of my review, the naysayers are just wrong in this case.  This is an important, touching and honorable series.  I highly recommend it.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I really enjoyed this story.  The differences in lives between the characters in India, those in America and then how it all comes together.<br /><br />I always enjoy a book that looks at life from a different culture.<br /><br />The character of Kavita, to me, was the most impressive.  Her strength was the true shining light in this book.
B002ZG994U|1.0|This movie really is rather boring ,i didnt get involved with the cast like we all did with the show .The story line is like somthing out of a bad B grade movie and the action was forgetable,if movie companys are worried about piracy then putting out crap like this is not going to help convince people to part with there cash
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I really like this cd.  There is a lot of piano and she sounds great.  My absolute favorite song is Christmas Time is in the Air Again.  That could be an all time classic.  I also like When Christmas Comes and Oh Come All Ye Faithful.  The one song that I was not a fan of was the Here Comes Santa Clause, but other than that song the cd is great. Her voice is so phenomenal.  The best vocal performance on the album is When Christmas Comes and Oh Come All Ye Faithful.  :)
B000026ETU|5.0|\\"Zebop\\", Carlos Santana @ his best. Exquisite \\"Jazz\\" undertones on several cuts. The remake from the original vinyl to CD is very well done. Zebop ! is a \\"must have\\" for the serious Santana fan/collector. My favourite cut is \\"I Love You Much Too Much\\" , an instrumental. Don't miss this one !!
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|This new release is nothing like Clapton's history of rock guitar.  This offers more of relaxing/blues sound. Makes a great addition to any collection showing a wide scope of his works.
B00480WO4S|5.0|One of the most sought after collectibles the last few years have been special edition, statues.  Comic books are cool, original artwork is insurable, but nothing says NERD like a shelf of statues.<br /><br />Sorry Ruben, but, I am a comic book, statue lovin' nerd.  Sales of statues, unlike reprint comic books and 'classic' editions are ONCE, and that is it.  Their value remains consistant, and will not vary.  That is part of the beauty of statues, their craftsmen are truly that.  This is no two dimensional representation, this is 3 D, with texture, color, and some day, voice chips.  These can be moved to create action scenes, or used to practise acceptance speaches for Eisner Awards.  They are tactile, and, in my home, even my wife appreciates the Procopio Lone Ranger and Zorro.  (but not my comic books).<br /><br />Having said that, Pop Sculpture, by Bruckner, Oat and Procopio, is a great book that answers the big question \\"How do they do that?\\" Comic books I understand, but statues and the production of them, transforms an idea into a model, and then a piece of art.  The process may seem to be simple, then so does solving world hunger (invent a new crop that you give free to countries, they feed their people, the end).  Each step is covered in depth, and makes it seem simple.  This is not easy.  These men are talented, innovative artists who see more than we do.  Imagine King Kong without these type of skills?  or the first Godzilla films?  You can't can, you?<br /><br />I love this book and the obvious passion these four men have for their craft.  Do them a favor, buy their statues, and buy this book.  Disney had their 8 Old Men, we have the Four Young Artists....appreciate them!
B003XKPPOU|3.0|This movie is another existential downer from Pixar.  I was a huge fan of their early movies which were far more light-hearted and child friendly.  I don't mind crying in a movie when I am left with a warm and happy feeling at the end.  But when my 5 year old turns to me and tells me he is sad at the end of the movie, I realize this isn't the fun Pixar that we started with.  I would really appreciate it if the writers would go to therapy and work out their death issues and get back to writing fun movies.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|The films are indeed classics and are wonderful examples of innovation, warmth, and fantastic storytelling.  The bonus features are plentiful and detailed providing fans with hours to enjoy.  To top it all off, every possible Toy Story related home viewing option is presented.  It's all here.    However...    The packaging is a serious let down.  The outside of it looks decent enough, but the discs are housed in a black foam.  There are no individual cases for each set or disc.  What this means is that you need to be extra careful to not scratch or smudge the discs, and organizing them is a slight chore.  Spending an extra 5 bucks on behalf of the manufacturer per toy box for decent ways to house some of animations all time classics seems like it would have been a worthwhile investment.    On the upside, if you stick with the box set, it's the only way to get digital copies of the first two films - a bonus for some consumers and an unnecessary addition for others.  Also, each film has a bluray and dvd counterpart so regardless of the means of watching the films, you will have every option available to you should you desire.  In terms of value, you may end up spending less getting the box set if you don't presently own all 3 films.    If the packaging were more secure, this would be a no brainer.  As is, it is underwhelming in spite of the addition of digital copies to the first 2 films.  At least you'll be able to watch any of the 3 films in nearly every format presently available.  It would just be nice to know that the discs themselves would be able to avoid scratching based on how they are kept.
B003L1ZWG2|4.0|I make this review short & sweet:,<br /><br />Taut thriller with plenty of suspense. Give this one a try if you're looking for something without Boggyman,Monsters or The Supernatural to give you a chill.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|This is a great series, just like Planet Earth was. Shots are amazing and beautifully done but Oprah just ruins it! She shouldn't be in this. This is the American version which i'm sure lost BBC a lot of money. Go and buy the regular version with David as the Narrator. It is extremely better. You might have to order on line but is so much better
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I bought the cd before going to a Neil Young Concert. Great cd, great concert. First time of purchasing on Amazon. Since  then I  have purchased a watch. I have no complaints  thus far.
0316069485|3.0|Everyone else has done the plot work here. I just need to add my \\"reader's response.\\"<br /><br />Connelly's great characters are wonderful here, his plot twists and turns kept me reading.<br /><br />The ending -- less than satisfying for me. I felt it was kind of open-ended, as if more is to come from those end-of-book unexamined crime scenes.<br /><br />One thing that convinces me of such a possibility is this: In the final scenes, at the trunk of the tree, during the digging, something is found. Bosch and Haller examine it. It suggests only slightly a connection to something Bosch knows/feels. If a certain Disney character were found on the charm instead of a \\"graduate\\" symbol, I would have felt the case \\"closed.\\"<br /><br />The relationship between Haller & Bosch was neglected. The forcing of their daughters to meet was almost like an add-on, not really done well. And though I've read most of the Bosch series and some of the Haller books, I truly got mixed up with daughters and wives and ex-wives and babysitters etc. There was a slight hint that one of the kids was in danger of abduction .. and the threat held sway over the book to the end. Except for that, there was no need for all those marriages and daughters being so pervasive in the book. There are better ways, and Connelly knows them all, to make a tough guy look more human and ways to illustrate the effects and regrets of marriages and relationships gone bad.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars becaues it's unlikely for me to put this \\"type\\" of book in the same league as a classic, 4-5*. But for its genre, its length, pace, story, it's pretty good.
B003PIUC02|5.0|One of the best shows on TV...Shame that Andy Whitfield came down with cancer, but glad to see that he is doing well. This is like nothing else on TV. It demands your attention and holds you the length of the season. Just completely badass...no one does it like Spartacus!!!
B000AAP7BM|5.0|Mexico en la Piel by Luis Miguel is a wonderful album. Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan made a superb job with the musical arrangements.  Luis Miguel's voice is simply angelical, engergetic and crystal clear.  He sings every song with pride and his passion for folk Mexican music makes of this album a real jewel.  In addition the DVD showing parts of Mexico, musical history of Luis Miguel and  a coupple of concerts live...makes this cd a must to have.  I don't get tired of listenging to it.  I enthusiastically recommend it!  Thanks.
0812973992|4.0|I didn't love this book, but I liked it enough to recommend it. But I do want to make a point that this book is NOT about Philippe Petit.  To me it was an interesting view of how close we all are to each other, one way or another and how interesting people can be regardless of who they are and what they do.  I do have to admit that some parts of the book are more entertaining than others, but they have to be read to understand what is going on.
B00006I53S|4.0|This lens has shown its age. I am not sure why Canon still bundles it with the latest APS-C bodies. There are new EFS 18-135mm and EFS 15-85mm with UD glass element to replace this lens. Get these instead. However having said that, the EF 28-135mm can be used for full frame cameras. So it does have its advantage depending on what you do down the road. I bought this lens before the EFS replacement lenses were introduced. Its IS and zoom range were the features that intrigued me for the purchase. It was my walk around lens at the time because the kit lens, EFS 18-55mm mk2, was just too crappy (the new one with IS is lot better). The EF 28-135mm has accompanied me to many vacation trips and produced many good memories. I even accidentally dropped it on the floor one time along with the camera body. They survived. Picture quality is quite good, but not exceptional. You cannot compare it against a prime. If I stop down this lens on an APS-C camera body, I could hardly tell the difference of its picture quality from my EF 24-70mm F2.8L unless I magnify the image to peek the pixels. People complain about its zoom creep. But so what? My lens has taken a lot of beatings and still functions like it's new. For its price, the build quality is quite fair. The EF 28-135mm is a good bargain a few years ago for an average consumer. Today you have more choices. I am sure you would pass up on this lens and get the latest EFS equivalence. They are better built with better glass and IS.
B001HN694K|5.0|In my opinion this version of Alice in Wonderland had even more \\"muchness\\" than Lewis Carroll's original works.  The cast is marvelous, especially Johnny Depp who was absolutely brilliant as the Hatter!      I've read both Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass.  I've seen other older adaptations of the books in movie form.  I've seen the original Disney animated version, which I never liked, even as a child.  Nothing comes close to Tim Burton's 'return to Wonderland'.  As far as the animals and sets go,  Computer Generated Images have ruined me for anything less.  Another A+ here, I loved, loved, loved the CG.      There are so many wonderful aspects to this film.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  Brilliantly done!  And if that wasn't enough, it contains no profanity!  Bravo!  I've added this to my list of all time favorite movies!
0553805371|5.0|As a Physicist myself, i couldn't wait for S. Hawking's latest book to be published. Shortly after it was available online, i went on and bought it from Amazon.com.  The book is a phenomenal piece of work that describes, with the most easy to read way, all the miracles of our universe. I definatelly recomend it, even to people who have limited knowledge of theoretical physics.   The delivery was extremely fast, only two days, and the book was delivered in perfect condition, just if i had bought it out of an ordinary bookstore!  Thank you Amazon for this!
140016060X|5.0|I thought this was a great book. If you're someone who thinks normal is boring, then you'll like this book.
0143118420|5.0|This is an amazing book, I would suggest it to anyone who loves to read.  Also, I would suggest seeing the Movie.  In my case I watched the Movie first then decided to read the book!
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I did not had any expectation about this book and I am happy to say that it was great. It kept me laughing all the way and I found it refreshing. Even when it has the right ingredients for a vampire/romance history, it lack a bit of erotism. The characters are funny as hell and the things they say are just hilarious. There is not much of description about charters and situations, The writer doesn't go deep in details as other writers but she gets the point. I was hopping for a bit more \\"action\\" for the romantic couple. The end was a bit dry, no your usually happy ever after but it gave my face a smile.   If you are into light vampire/romance novel, this is perfect for you.. if you are into more erotic/romance (true blood type) definitely need to choose another book. This is too light....
1416972242|5.0|When I sat down to write a review of this book, I ran into a problem. First City of Bones was so good I bought and read this book before reviewing it. I am even a third through City of Glass before coming back to review this one. The writing in this series is just so good, I did not even want to stop and write a review but keep reading.<br /><br />This book continues almost immediately after City of Bones, The conflict and tension between Clary and Jace is at a new high. The triangle of Clary, Jace and Simon has new and interesting twists. Alex is accepting his sexuality and though many react negatively to his being homosexual, Clare does a good job of handing the subject matter. The battle between Valentine and the Clave takes a dark and deadly twist. Down Worlder children are being murdered and their blood drained. The Inquisitor has been sent to investigate Jace and his father Valentine. Valentine's quest for the Mortal instruments is intensifying. But questions about who is more unstable arise - The Inquisitor of Valentine?<br /><br />I can only say this is a great book in an excellent series by and amazing author. I cannot recommend her writing enough.
0061989142|4.0|I came across this book while I was in Books-A-Million. I honestly have to say that this book is good. It has some great information in it for women that are trying to upgrade their closets with some basic essentials but she also shows you how to mix and match what you have for different occasions. I love Laurens's classic style but she also can tweak it to make it more fun.
1416955070|5.0|Having already read the first book in the new prequel trilogy to this series, The Infernal Devices, I starting reading this book with some preconceived notions. Cassandra Clare blew them completely out of the water. The world was familiar, the weapons, the battles and the environment. Humans, werewolves, vampires, warlocks, Shadow Hunters, down worlders and mundane all mixed up in events together. But being set in our time was an amazing new twist on something I was familiar with. And yet something so new and unique I found myself picking up the book again and again when I should have been doing other things, and saying to myself just one more page, or till the end of this section or chapter but could literally not make myself put the book down.<br /><br />The characters are amazing and the world creation so complete, so seamless, and so believable, that, as a reader, you feel as if it might not be fiction but a clearer view of reality than most of us have in our day-to-day life. The books in this series are so well-written that you will read the books back to back and maybe even read them again and again. This book was the first one published by Cassandra Clare and the skill shown, and mastery of the writing craft, is amazing for a first novel.<br /><br />It is set in a world with a battle between light and darkness, and a group of humans who try to keep that which is evil from destroying our world. These shadow hunters are humans who have been blessed with the blood of an angel. They have claves around the world and work to keep the peace between other species and with each other, and to protect humans. The major players seem to be warlocks, vampires, werewolves, fairies and the shadow hunters, also known as Nephilim. Our main character is Clary Fray, a young girl who finds herself mixed up in a world that she never knew existed, but that she was destined to be a part of. She is a strong character who is learning who she really is and what she will do with her life.<br /><br />This world by Cassandra Clare is one I will visit again and again, as new books come out and rereading the ones I have read over and over, and I cannot give books a higher recommendation than that. They made my to-be-read-again list.by Cassandra Clare is one I will visit again and again, as new books come out and rereading the ones I have read over and over, and I cannot give books a higher recommendation than that.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|Look, this movie has so many flaws that it's really difficult on where to begin but it also has some amazing pros to it.<br /><br />PROS<br />- visually pretty (and I mean some fantastic special effects people worked on this and pulled out all the stops, well not like Avatar but the effects were neat)<br />- it's a global catastrophe movie<br /><br />CONS<br />- nobody explains how the Maya knew - although that's not explored much at all<br />- the special effects are unrealistic (I mean do we really have a to fly a plane under a falling train?)...then again, it's an end of the world movie so why not go all out ... which they do<br />- the action scenes just keep coming and coming and coming and going and going and going. . . it's neverending<br />- seriously, the politicians and the rich is who we decide to save?<br />- how did they know that the means for survival should be put where it was put and that it would work as designed....I mean, entire continents were swallowed in lava...<br />- the characters do things that normal people wouldn't do<br />- the plot has many many MANY MANY many many issues and holes in it<br />- it has a happy ending (after a global calamity of giganormous proportions, everything is just fine in about a month....go figure and they head off to the one place on earth that wasn't impacted by the calamity . . . huh?  why spend billions building your rescue vehicle if there were parts of earth that were hardly affected?  Just save the money and go to that place right?)<br /><br />So at the end of the day, if you have absolutely nothing else going on then consider sitting down and suspending disbelief....and you have to work hard at suspending disbelief.<br /><br />This movie probably works best as a drinking game:<br />- everytime an entire city crumbles, take a drink<br />- everytime lava is shown, take a drink<br />- everytime a giant tsunami hits, take  a drink<br />- everytime something just plain ridiculouse happens, take a drink<br />- anytime there is a plot lapse, take a drink<br />- anytime an actor does something that no rational human being would ever do, take a drink<br /><br />You'll be roaring drunk in 5 minutes and probably suffer from alcohol poisoning by about minut 15 after the action gets going.  No on second thought, forget the drinking game -- too dangerous in this kind of movie.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars because it is definitely an A movie, with an A cast....and, it was FUN to watch.tional human being would ever do, take a drink    You'll be roaring drunk in 5 minutes and probably suffer from alcohol poisoning by about minut 15 after the action gets going.

073933705X|4.0|I've just listed to this audio performance of the \\"Boy on the Stripped Pajamas.\\"  It was well performed and a very engaging performance.  The story is thought provoking.  There are two complaints about this book that I have heard.  One is that the story could not have occurred the way it did.  There were electrified fences at Auschwitz that would have prevented this.   On the other hand, was the boy in the stripped pajamas a real boy or the angel of death who brought the tenth and final plague to the Egyptians in the Biblical Book of Exodus.  There seems to be some parallel between the two stories.   This story also has the feel of a Twilight Zone episode.    Another issue that I can see is that the childish misunderstanding of words would probably not be the misunderstanding that a German speaking boy of that age would have made.  However, the misunderstandings that a German speaking boy of that age would have made would not be understood by an English speaking child (or adult).      What the book does do for the reader or listener is answer the question, \\"What would Auschwitz look like through the eyes of a young German child.\\"  That is a question well worth considering.  .
0525951652|4.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book!  I had very little knowledge of WWI, and I am learning so much about the allies and enemies.  As always, Follett's characters are richly described and interestingly interwoven.  I am looking forward to the next volume.
B000002LK1|5.0|Once or twice a year I come across a disc that gives me goose bumps and Violator did that for me when it came out and still does.  Depeche Mode are one of the few bands that their music consistently improved with each release.  I was amazed after so many great releases that they could come out with their best ever, they are a fountain of creativity and imagination.      Undoubtedly many purchased Violator because of Enjoy The Silence but were rewarded with a wonderful beginning to end listening experience.  One of the best things about this CD are how many times the songs have been remixed since the originals, particularly Enjoy The Silence, possibly one of the most remixed songs ever.  Two of my favorites are Enjoy The Silence (Richard X Extended Remix) and Enjoy The Silence (Reinterpreted also called '04, there is also a new video for this version on youtube).  Violator is my favorite Depeche Mode disc and one of my all-time favorites by anybody.

157453470X|5.0|My first exposure to Neal Stephenson was the 6 cassette abridged Cryptonomicon which wouldn't have been a problem, except it was listed as unabridged and I didn't realize it wasn't until I started listening.  I see that has been corrected.  Once I found the real unabridged version on Audible, all 42 hours of it, I loved it and went on to listen to his entire ouevre.
B000002NHN|5.0|I bought this CD for 1 song \\"Dante's Prayer\\" so we could play it at a funeral for a family member. It was recommended by a friend and it fit perfect into the remembrance of our loved one.  It's really a good CD. I'm not into Celtic music, but Loreena has a wonderful voice, and it does have a New Age edge to it.
B000QUEQBS|4.0|I have watched this film about 4 times I think. It is rare that I watch any movie more than once. We have been inundated in our society with one man army/hero films(Batman,Superman and shloads of others). Yet this one stands out for me because it points to certain political truths. A good double feature would be this film paired with Bulworth. Start with Bulworth and then watch this one.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|I was an avid fan of Battlestar Galactica when the \\"re-imagining\\" was brought back to the screen in 2003.  The writers and producers did a great job balancing what the original series was with the new vision.  But after watching the entire series over the past few weeks, I've come to appreciate what they have done even more.      Most peoples first knee-jerk reaction to sci-fi dramas is \\"nerd alert!\\" but this show was more of a human drama centered in space.  The special effects are great, but they weren't the show.  The characters were real; the heroes had flaws, the villains had there positive aspects and watching how they evolved and grew as the series progressed was extremely entertaining.  A very enjoyable ride.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I stumbled upon this movie in Netflix, unaware of what the story was about, and who Temple Grandin is. So many people have said it much better than I ever can. This was just one of those wonderful gems that you stumble upon unknowingly, and walk away at completely uplifted as a viewer. Clair Danes did a marvelous job in her portrayal, and the overall production was excellent. I very  much appreciated how they brought the viewer in to the film, allowing us to see how Temple see's. I'm now off to learn more about from Temple Grandin, by ordering \\"Emergence Labeled Autistic\\"...It has been quite awhile for me, but I think I have a new role model.
034544678X|5.0|Of all the dog behavior books out there, this one is the most concise and to the point.  For example, one of the tips she gives is to walk AWAY from your dog when you want her to come.  It works.  I can tell you, I have never felt more confident about reading my dog's body language and letting him interact with other dogs.    She clarifies the ideas of dominance and leadership, and explains why those words have such a negative meaning.  The best part is, you don't even need to touch your dog(s) to get them to respect you.  It can be done through positive reinforcement.  Her claim is that dogs will have pack-like behavior when they are getting high quality food from a central source (you).  The idea centers around how dogs behave in a multidog household, as opposed to how they behave in a scavenging feral dog pack.

The whole aspect of whether it was right to resurrect history when one party had no prior knowledge survaced.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|This cable works just like it should. It relays crystal-clear video and audio from my PS3 to my new LG 26\\" LED TV in up to 1080p. I don't believe there's any difference in the quality between this and an $80 Monster cord from Best Buy. The only thing I could see is this one dying first, but then you can just order another one and still spend less!
B0000640SA|5.0|Took like 2 months to get this product. Amazon assumed the package was delivered, but there was no signature confirmation (probably because the item was a mail-slot-sized box). They asked me to review it the first time, and I'm all \\"I never even got this.\\"    On the bright side, after I filed the ticket, the movie was delivered within 2 days.    In itself, the 2-disc set is a microscopic marvel of DVD-packaging production. The dvd box is themed as a medical history folio of Leonard Shelby, the star of Memento. It has a post-it that tells you to 'watch,' and a number of photostatic copies of various medically-themed sheets, just as flavor for the box.    The movie itself is amazing. Shot in reverse chronological order, Memento is an investigative psychological action-drama starring brain-damaged hero Leonard Shelby. Someone raped and killed his wife and destroyed his ability to remember, but he's created a system of polaroids, tattoos and very specific notes to take the place of memory. Since he can no longer form long-term memories, the audience is taken on a ride with Leonard in the way he sees life. The movie starts with Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) getting shot in the head by Leonard, and it continues as a slow reveal of exactly why this had to happen, and how Leonard, with no ability to know why, was certain that Teddy was the one who killed his wife. This is accomplished through scenes (each exactly the length of time Leonard can remember before forgetting) in reverse order accompanied with segments of a phone call between Leonard and an unknown caller, describing his condition, letting the audience know exactly what he's capable of, and how he manages to function day-to-day.    But what if you wanted to disentangle the chronological mess the movie finds itself in and really see how Leonard Shelby would look in real life? You then use the hidden movie on Disc 2. I won't explain how, but on the extras disc you can find a full copy of the movie, spliced into chronological order.     The movie was excellent, the DVD production superb. The delivery, though, sucked.
B004132HZS|5.0|I sat down fully expecting to hate this show.  Sherlock Holmes with a cell phone?  Blasphemy!  Not to mention that I am a die hard fan of Jeremy Britt's portrayal.   What can I say, a truly unexpected pleasure!  The characterization, dialog, and chemistry are commendable.  The first and third episodes are positively superb.  The second is fine--not as great as the other two, but it still has its moments.  Since the next three episodes won't be available until Fall 2011 (assuming everyone can get their schedules worked out), I'm looking forward to those episodes being stellar as well.  I'd much rather have quality than quantity (though if both could be managed, that would be great too!).
B002LS4M9E|5.0|Man, all I can say is, \\"What a bargain.\\"   I purchased this some time ago and I haven't been disappointed. I pull it up on my iPod time and time again, and I never get sick of the soul this guy puts forth.   I'll spare you all the music jargon and just tell you, if you love good pop music, with just a strain of modern beats and sparse arrangements, this album's for you.   And at 2.99? That's less than the moca-frappa-chino that you would have dropped that money on anyway.
B0037W68F4|4.0|Congratulations is a very good album, Oracular Spectacular on the other hand is not.  I find the music on OS predictable and after a listen or two just uninteresting.  Of course, mainstream music fans will love it.  Congratulations, on the other hand does not fit into any mainstream mold, it is quite experimental.  It is the direction I hope they choose because seriously it is a far more mature album musically.  I know people like what they like but this album is certain not one star material.  It deserves a couple listens to know if it's working.  If you know what I mean.  Not the best album of the year, I give that to The Radio Department's \\"Clinging to a Scheme\\".  But interesting nontheless.
015626224X|4.0|I ordered this book because I had to read it for my English class and I thought it was just another boring book. As I was reading it, it became a bit more interesting than I thought. If it weren't for my English class I would have never read this book.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|After having seen this movie too many times to count both in the theater and at home I never expected this to be such a revelatory experience.  I sat through the entire film with my mouth hanging open at the clarity of the picture and sound.  It was literally like I had never seen it before.  I'm sure even just the DVD is far superior to the last release of this film.  For anyone who is a fan this is a must.  The thrill of that mountain top opening and the wedding scene brought back chills I hadn't experienced in years.  The hills are alive...again !

1400052173|5.0|I liked this book because it told me something new and interesting on two fronts.  The first is a view of the cultural evolution of slaves in America.  I never read about this subject presented with such freshness and unabashed candor.  The second is the science about cell lines.  This was the weak point in the book, but covered in enough depth for me to learn something.  The book was well written but not good enough for me to read it twice.    I felt as if political correctness held this book back somewhat.  For instance, Henrietta's cancer cells are so prolific that they can take over whole cultures when used in an experiment.  The author hits this pretty hard but then drops the subject after suggesting that thousands of scientific studies using these cells may  be tarnished.    The author also skips the obvious topic of \\"under what circumstances will exposure to these cells lead to an infection of another person?\\"  In our culture, taking a pee in the park in view of other persons, unwittingly or not, often leads to a conviction and a place on the sex offendr registry.  This is done without any evidence whatever that persons who view this dastardly act become meaningfully harmed in any way.  Hookers with AIDS receive only the skimpiest of punishments even though they pose a huge documented public health risk and infect others willingly by taking advantage of their hormonal weakness.    If we don't know how various forms of cancer can be transmitted or how dangerous it can be to be exposed to cancerous cells, shouldn't we be at least as concerned with this as peeing in the park?

0312330537|1.0|Diary of what became a very reluctant reader    Day 1. Okay, let's make some time and do this thing. Two years ago a friend gave me a copy. She was lyrical about it. Couldn't tell me why, and answered my questions only with a \\"You just have to read it... I can't spoil the plot now, can I?\\" The close to a thousand pages kept me far from ever picking it up. But now I feel ready. Let's do this thing.     Day 2. Am close to page 100 now, and I'm not sure why so many people praise this book as enthusiastically as they do... I find his style of writing utter boring, with the Usual Suspects filling the pages: expats somewhere in a tropical city, frequenting a lousy watering hole, being involved with sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. Gosh, how extremely un-original can one be...?   Another thing that's really bothering me, is the excessive amounts of useless blabber. Could the editors not have taken out their red pens and do what they're supposed to do: take out all dead wood? Maybe it'll come to me, later on. Let's give the next 100 pages a try. Only 800 to go till the end.     Day 7. I've started reading diagonally. The man needs way too many words to tell a story. And it's sooooo badly written too... Sad! Will I give up, or shall I give it another try? Okay, to the author's credit: I have actually earmarked a page because I liked some of his sentences. A meager harvest, after close to 200 pages. Most authors are winding up their storylines now, heading for some kind of mesmerising finale. This man is still picking up pace; going nowhere in particular - apart from another deep dive into his memory, regurgitating conversations he once had that, for any other author, should not have made it into a book. And I honestly don't see him get anywhere close to my heart...   Okay, to the author's credit, I did like this part: \\"...some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again. Some truths about yourself are so painful that only shame can helpyou live with them. And some things are just so sad that only your soul can do the crying for you.\\"     Day 10. Finished the first part. Only 780 pages to go.   It's a very long time ago that it took me this long to read a book.    Why on earth did my friend like it so much?     Day 15. Drastic measures are required. I'm upping the pace of my speed reading. Page 286.     Day 18. That is it. I've given it another 100 pages and have gone beyond the magical 1/3 limit. This clearly isn't working. For the first time in a very, very, very long time I decide to put the book back on the shelves. Unfinished.   It reminds me of this scene in the movie Amadeus, about Mozart. The composer plays a piece for the emperor who can't get too excited and, based on the words of his adviser, says, \\"Too many notes...\\" The barbarian! How dare he?     But its exactly what I feel about Shantaram.     A quick calculation tells me the book contains about 300,000 words.   Even half of that would have been on the rich side.    No.  Not for me.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|Watch very closely the Polish hooker (called \\"Lost Girl\\" in the credits) watching the TV in the opening scene, and the events surrounding her throughout the film. How does she get to being in Piotrek/Smithy's arms at the end? I think that she watches a film starring Nikki Grace, which cascades through her consciousness. At the climax, Nikki's performance kills the \\"phantom\\" which had been torturing Lost Girl. Thus, released from internal torment, Lost Girl is able to join her husband and son back in the real world with profound gratitude.<br /><br />WE get to watch the amazing process of that film-within-the-film infiltrating through the Lost Girl's mind, and Nikki's character meeting Lost Girl's husband, older relatives, floozie friends, events back in Poland, maybe a guardian angel or two, and other memories along the way.<br /><br />I regard this as David Lynch's manifesto about the power of art, and specifically acting, to change people for the better. In the end, Nikki's performance receives applause for killing the phantom and replacing the \\"Rabbits\\" nonsense in Room 47 (a metaphor for Lost Girl's soul, perhaps?). Nikki then takes her place in Lost Girl's fully processed memories, along with other movie heroines (Laura Harring's femme fatale from Mulholland Dr. is there). Nina Simone and some African-influenced dancers joyfully play us out.<br /><br />The greatest trick of this film is how experiencing it is subjectively very much like the Lost Girl's encounter with On High in Blue Tomorrows, the film within the film. The tension and fear that get built up are unbearable in some scenes, and the frights are very startling (even though being extremely cheaply staged). Then afterward, INLAND EMPIRE unfolds in our minds for days. We replay it. By some alchemical process, once we've processed it for ourselves, we are elated, and maybe enlightened, or so I think this is Lynch's sincere hope and purpose.<br /><br />David Lynch: You have to make another film, buddy, before all those cancer sticks get to you.
B003BW0CB6|2.0|Loved all his books but this was a real disappointment.  You keep on waiting and then it's like he didn't finish the book. Should have listened to the negative reviews. Thought I would be the last person to write a bad review about Michael Connelly.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Before that 55 hour marriage in Vegas, K-Fed *shudder*, and the well documented breakdowns, 2003 found Britney Spears at the top of her game. With a few songs from her prior album that declared \\"I'm grown!\\", In The Zone doesn't just say it. It proves it with less emphasis on sugary pop while stretching itself out for more R&B/electronic sounds.<br /><br />Me Against the Music is a playfully, energetic face-off between Brit Brit and her biggest musical influence, Madonna. The best thing about it is that both are on the same wavelength. Britney's not intimidated by Madge and the Material Girl doesn't try to overpower Miss Spears. The rapid fire delivery leaves me out of breath and I'm just listening to it! Madonna's (with a bit of Kylie Minogue's) influence is all over the ethereal atmosphere of Breathe On Me.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|Seeing there are already quite a few \\"in depths\\" reviews, I don't want to go into details except to say that I think it's a great story and makes one think. Personally, I came to the conclusion that it doesn't matter if you're born young or old - either way, we have to go through the same trials of life. You're helpless when you're born as a baby and, if you live to a ripe old age, you usually end up being helpless again. (I live in a senior cummunity and see it happen every day). I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a serious movie and is not afraid to think of what life is all about.
1935182617|5.0|Bruno Lowagie is a Belgian National Treasure! Bruno, as the primary developer of iText, together with all of the online documentation, has made extraordinary contributions to the art and science of PDF origination and manipulation. These contributions alone are significant, even without the books.    What is so amazing is the fact that Bruno has been able to write two editions of \\"iText in Action\\", bringing them to print, both as eBooks and print editions, concurrently with his maintenance of the iText library and its online documentation. All of this -- in a period of about five years -- while dealing, at the same time, with family adversities that would plunge most people into deep depression.    \\"iText in Action, 2nd Edition\\" is a mandatory addition to the library of anyone who is serious about working with Portable Document Format (PDF).    Congratulations, Bruno, on your contributions to the PDF literature. May you have many more successes, in both your professional and personal lives. I am proud to count you among my friends. You are an inspiration to us all.    Warm regards,  Bill Segraves  Sarasota, FL, USA
B002JVWQT6|5.0|Modern Family is a winning combination of great casting, smart writing and it's actually funny. There are very few comedies worth watching on TV today, but this show delivers every single week. The whole cast is outstanding and there is real chemistry between everyone, but I think three actors really stand out. Ed O'Neill sheds his Al Bundy persona and turns in a very comfortable, laid back performance that does wonders. Most of the big laughs come from Ty Burrell, who finally found a role that lets his dorky humor shine through, and Eric Stonestreet who plays the most over-the-top character other than Gloria, but never falls into that too far it doesn't seem real anymore category. Julie Bowen, Sofia Vergara, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Rico Rodriguez, who acts like a grown man trapped in a child's body, all fill in the cracks and often deliver very memorable moments themselves.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that there is no sophomore slump with Modern Family. The second season continues its trend of brilliance.
B0028KGD8I|1.0|How anybody can even call this show a show really boggles my mind. If you wanna watch something that is suspenseful and creative and deals with psychological disorders watch something created by the timeless director Alfred Hitchcock. His work is very dark but it is of excellent taste. This show is garbage in its purest form, just avoid it there are too many shows to list that are better than this POS!
B000F8O35U|4.0|received - mild problem with the disc. Seems fine now. Ordered two discs at the same time - Little Mermaid and also Aladdin from two different sellers - one came .50 postage due - WTF? Not sure if it was Scott Weinger or Jodi Benson - beware.
B000002H97|4.0|Wherever I may roam might also be my favorite track off this album. I have always been a big fan of Metallica, heavy music, and music from across the world and all cultures. These guys are one of the best at the genre, they tear through your eardrums with powerful guitar riffs, slamming drum rolls, and badder than evil vocals! This however is not their best piece but it is much better than saint Anger and I also like it more than load and re-load. This album is what brought them to the mainstream, but the real reason why I think this album is important because it turned people on to their past 4 smashing albums as well and that they were a cool band for years before the 90s rolled around.     Don't get me wrong this is a great album with some very good tracks like Don't Tread on me and the classic sad but true! It is also sad but true this was their last really good album too, the 4 that came after it all fell pretty short but death magnetic came close     Later!
B003NFM3JU|3.0|Saw this movie in 3d in the theaters last year. The animation was ok, not really to my taste. Also the 3D effects weren't the best I've seen. Other than that i enjoyed the movie
B0027IG30Y|1.0|This probably the worsed season to make things even. Season 5 is gonna be great because hopefully they will end it. This show is so meaningless and lackluster its not even worth talking about. bad acting, weak and kinda of a spin off storyline of dark comic books like Spawn and Nightman. Sorry I had to put those awesome characters in the same paragraph as this freak of a show. If you want to watch something cool, even though I think TV as a whole is a waste of time for the most part watch Rescue Me; Dennis Leary is excellent in it and it deals with real issues real heroes have such as PTS, substance abuse, and depression from working and living in modern society. Also House is a great series. Very witty and suspensful, well the first few seasons were.     just avoid this garbage altogether.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Amazing movie. It was everything I expected, and could not have asked for anything more. The story and animation were great. Will definitely be buying this movie.
0465043550|3.0|I know that authors who write books are constantly treading a fine line between too many graphs and no readers vs. no graphs at all but a book that reads like a \\"Bert and Ernie\\" book. For a book with this many mathematical concepts, it would not have hurt to have a few problems put in the book to concept check the ideas that the author was trying to convey. They need not have been included in the chapters. They might have worked just as well as appendices. One gets the impression that the author assumed an understanding of not much more than 10th grade Algebra II. If a person has enough of a curiousity to pick up a book like this, then I'm sure that they have made it through enough math to understand a few equations (one equation is sometimes worth even MORE than 1,000 words).<br /><br />This book had so much information, that I can only write about the things that left me the deepest impressions.<br /><br />Impressions:<br /><br />1. Could this book have been rewritten as a discussion of the limitations of modeling? There are echoes of books that I have read before (notably, Paul Ormerod's \\"Butterfly Economics\\") about how the assumptions that go into econometric modeling are not true. The authors seems to go back and forth between showing the limits of academic Economics (one thing) and Finance (a very different thing). I wonder if the book could have been better put together in the aforementioned way and made to flow a bit more smoothly.<br /><br />2. This guy has a *humongous* ego a la Nassim Taleb. I noticed this right away between pages 5-7 when I went back and counted the word \\"I\\" 22 times over those 3 pages.<br /><br />3. The author did a yeoman's work measuring price change data from 1916-2003. That alone earned my respect and made this book worth reading. 87 years. 365 days per year. That works out to 31,755 data points to deal with.<br /><br />4. I see where Taleb got his ideas of \\"Mediocristan\\" and \\"Extremistan\\" from. It's just that he babbled on about those concepts for much longer than Mandelbrot (who did it in something like 3 pages). (I find the earliest date of publication of \\"The Black Swan\\" to be something like 2007-- three years before this book came out.) Maybe Mandelbrot was also not the first one to notice that the Gaussian Distribution is not appropriate for many/ most issues of finance. But just the same, this foreshadows Taleb's work, and even makes it look a bit derivative.<br /><br />5. I had heretofore never thought about what fractals represented graphically. This book started with the basics of that idea, but I might have liked more discussion thereon.<br /><br />6. The book was very easy and light to read for about the first 3/4. In the last 1/4, the pages just dragged on by. There are also some problems with the organization. He put \\"In the Lab\\" and \\"Ten Heresies of Finance\\" at the back of the book. But since those are the problem to be answered, why didn't they go in the front of the book? Even after ALL THAT discussion, he comes up with (p. 255): (a) he doesn't know and; (b) that the problem needs further research? Huh?<br /><br />7. There were some interesting lines of reasoning opened up by this book (that fractals can be used to describe market behavior), and the case might have even been more solid than what it seems. But, then again, there may have been nonsense uttered with seeming profundity (economists are very good at this). After it was all said and done, this was just not settled for me. It may be that Economics is neither Gaussian nor fractal but simply chaotic.<br /><br />8. The book does not do much talking about prediction. And that is important. For example, on p. 219, he says that \\"prices scale as the model predicts,\\" but now what? Yes, you can take the known data and go back and make a model for them, but what about using the model to go forward to predict prices? And better yet, why not work through a few different data sets and demonstrate how your model predicts where theother ones failed (and *why* they failed) in prediction? A question on prediction that arose during the book: A physicist might believe that he can predict the future given knowledge of the position, velocity, and direction of each particle as of a given time. But that information is not forthcoming. Is Benoit saying that he could predict prices in that same way with fractals? And that it's just a matter of limited information?<br /><br />9. If there is a correct calculation to be made, and IF someone finds the correct way to make it, then won't other people find the same solution? And then won't the price on the stock fall back to reality? And then won't we be right back where we started?<br /><br />This is worth the secondhand purchase price.other ones failed (and *why* they failed) in prediction?

B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Tales, especially those with a happy ending, are always in vogue. This one has all the traditional plot elements, including a bewitched mother, a bumpkin that turns out to be a prince in disguise, black magic and white magic, etc., etc. I am not going to reveal any aspects of the plot, to give the naive viewer the opportunity to experience the many great turns and surprizes. Unlike many fairy tales, this one also boasts a parade of great actors. First and foremost - Michelle Pfeifer as a BAD WITCH! Only an actress that is ultimately confident in her divine beauty would dare to be portrayed visually and thematically as she is here. Then, DeNiro, a pirate that turns out to be less tough than one would expect and boasts of a really exotic profession, really magnificent in his role. Both exhibit great comic abilities and seem to be enjoying themselves immensly acting in this movie. One may suspect they paid for for the priviledge to be in the cast, although this is rather unlikely.  Except for a rather slow opening, the movie zips along rapidly with delightful tongue-in-cheek scenes and one-liners. Let's not forget a cameo master performance by Peter O'Tool and an excellent portrayal of Septimus by Mark Strong. Brilliant shadow performances by the departed princes! In general, the strenght of the movie is in acting, directing, special effects (by to-day's industry standards, at a perfectly satisfactory but not overwhelming dosage), and script.  There are some weaknesses. Although Claire Danes is a great actress, sho looks more like the hero's mother than his lover (well, stars are supposed to be ageless). Also Charlie Cox is very good, but no competition with DeNiro or Pfeifer.  To sum it all up, 115 greatly enjoyable minutes (out of 127). A must to have at home for those nights when you desperately need an upper.
B000069KE0|5.0|This album is as good as the debut if not better for a few reasons. Some people seem to think this album isnt up to par because its not as heavy or Terry Kath's guitar isnt as prominant so what. Its called Musical growth obviously Chicago didnt want to make the same album again and i dont blame them. Just because something rocks hard doesent make it automatically good. Take Black/Death/Speed Metal that kind of music rocks the hardest and it certainly isnt good music. Chicago 2 has more of a variety of styles of music than the debut.. Yes there is a little bit of filler on this album im not crazy about the classical pieces but i stll give the band credit for doing it. The first album had the Free Form Guitar piece i dont know how that made it on the record its just 7 minutes of terrible noise. Some people seem to think that 25 or 6 to 4 is the best song on the album just because of Terry Kath's smokin guitar solo and while its a great song it isnt the best. This albums opens with four really nice songs Poem For The People happens to be my favorite from this album mainly because of the nice horn arrangements. In The Country is one of Terry Kath's best songs. The Ballad For A Girl In Buchanon suite is awesome as well. Chicago are the only band on the planet that have released 3 double albums in a row. I rate the debut album and this one dead even both are awesome for different reasons. Everyone knows how Chicago lost their way after Terry Kath died however between 1969-1977 they recorded some great music. Some of the Mindless Masses that think their 1980's material is good should really check this stuff out.I wanna throw something out there to all of the true Chicago fans after serious thought i came up with two people that would honestly have been a good replacement for Terry Kath. Al Decarlo from the Chicago band Madura his voice is similar to Terry's in terms of tone and gruffness it wasnt as deep but still similar Al has more range check out the song Drinkin No Wine by Madura to get an indictaion. Second guy Kal David from another Chicago band The Illinois Speed Press Kal's voice is as deep as Terry's but not as gruff and they have a similar guitar tone. Check out these three songs from The Illinois Speed Press 1. Hard Luck Story 2. Free Ride 3. The Visit to get an indication. Id love to hear some feedback on this first albume by Madura to get an indictaion.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|It is rare to find an album in which every song speaks to you. Rarer still, that each song speaks to a different part of you. Florence + the Machine's eclectic style is seen in each song. \\"The Drumming Song\\" is a progressively exciting song, while \\"My Boy Builds Coffins\\" is a new take on a seemingly mundane subject (and quite deep, I might add). Her voice lends well to the melodic music, but the use of instruments and background vocals adds to the depth of sound. For artists of all types looking for an inspirational atmosphere, playing Florence would do the trick. Her songs have a way of dragging you into them and letting you frolic through the notes without knowing you are there. I often find myself disappointed as the last note of a song plays only to be rejuvenated when the next one begins. They are by far one of the most overlooked talents in recent times. While finding comfort in a small following, the band re-released the album into a more accepting public and now find themselves growing in popularity. Another release of the album comes in December 2010 with a special edition containing songs from this version as well as ones never before heard. They also are planning on making an appearance on SNL in November 2010. It is my hope that they will maintain their eclectic feel while finding great success in their new found popularity. For anyone wanting a different sound in their ears, this is the album/band to do it. My hats off to Florence.

B00275EHJG|5.0|My first son was just 2 1/2 years old when I got him the Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack. I know this for sure because at the top of the Amazon Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack product page it says, \\"You purchased this item on November 28, 2001.\\" Wow...how time flies.<br /><br />So it was to my surprise that when my son, now 11, stayed home from school with a cold earlier this year, I found him watching Toy Story. He had just put the DVD in the player, so I sat with him for a second before I headed off to work. Then the second turned into a few minutes; then a few minutes turned into a nostalgic hour; which of course turned into, \\"What a great, classic movie, Dad; Let's watch Toy Story 2!\\" So I obliged. (I hope my boss isn't reading this.)<br /><br />I'd forgotten what classics Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are. And it turns out that Toy Story 3 is just as classic as the first two. Not only do these movies deserve just a viewing, they deserve to be added to your movie collection. Watched the Blu Ray version last night with the entire family, and had to buy the standard DVD today, because my 7 year old daughter insisted that she needs to be able to watch the movie several times...but \\"upstairs\\" where i don't have a Blu Ray player set up. No problem. I may be biased because of the strong emotional attachment that I found that I had and have renewed with these movies, but I say that all three Toy Story movies truly are collectors' items.<br /><br />While watching Toy Story 3 last night, just as when I watched the first two again earlier this year, I was laughing out loud, holding in the sobs and just plain enjoying perhaps the best animated movies ever to come out of Disney.<br /><br />The first is about Andy's (6 - 8 years old?) toys and what happens when Andy introduces his new Buzz Lightyear to the group of toys that he grew up with. But the toys better be sure to stay out of the hands of Andy's next door neighbor Sid, because Sid's idea of fun is toy torture! Then in Toy Story 2 it's spring cleanup time, and the toys better hide if they don't want to end up in the yard sale; especially if you're a rare toy and there are greedy toy collectors that would just love to have...er..I mean...sell you. Finally in Toy Story 3 Andy is all grown up and the Toys have to deal with wondering if Andy will take them to college (a bad bet), keep them in his room (probably not or....Donate them or....Throw them out in the trash?!?<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are once again magic together in Toy Story 3 and they are joined by a cast of many many A-list voice talents...Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head is my favorite (ya hockey puck!).<br /><br />And one more note, if you've ever seen the Buzz Lightyear [[ASIN:B00004T2SJ Disney Channel spinoff]] but not the movies, don't be dissuaded by the spinoff because it was silly in comparison; the movies are head and shoulders above the spinoff in acting, animation and storywise.<br /><br />I'd grab the whole collection and see Toy Story 1 & 2 before 3 if you haven't already...it really puts things in perspective to watch it chronologically.

B0017OB12O|5.0|I'm still not entirely sure why Amazon lumps the reviews for all versions of a given release in the same category. It makes it especially hard to locate reviews on the blu ray version. Anyway, this is a review of the blu ray version recently released, in a collector's format. It is composed of basically a digibook within a hard external case, which is quite flashy as it has raised illustrations and looks quite nice. Upon removing the digibook (which is quite a bit thicker than others), you will find a blu ray version of the film, a dvd version, and a few other things.<br /><br />First up is the small production book. Actually in comparison with the material you get from other digibooks (which are usually scant on information), these few pages are full of notes and events during filming, almost a quick documentary in itself. It's nice to see a version of this book-within-case that is heavy on words and light on pictures, which are still nice on a few pages.<br /><br />Second are the replica lobby cards, located after the incorporated book. Not much to say about these, a nice addition for collectors but not much else.<br /><br />Finally the movie itself. As far as picture goes, its unbeatable for a film from 1957. Much like the other big releases around this time period, care was indeed taken to release a near perfect picture. Obviously in full 1080p, the lighting and scenery really shine here. I'm no expert on filmography and never really looked into the film types and ratios, but what I can judge is a quality blu ray transfer. The picture is sheer excellence down to the last scene, and is quite reminscent of the older James Bond transfers which were fantastic. All in all, as good picture as you'll see anywhere else in blu ray. The audio is great as well, with a fantastic 5.1 transfer. I have 5.1 sound, and it I can tell you it was transferred with the utmost of care. There is no mono soundtrack included in this version.<br /><br />Extras include a wealth of features, including the previous releases' documentaries and new unreleased features such as Alec and William on the Steve Aleen show. Also included is a narration of the premiere by Holding. The main thing here is the \\"beyond the bridge\\" section, in which the full film plays and when applicable scenes come up, the screen size is reduced and graphics will appear on the screen with the movie, along with factoids about the scene. It is a great feature for those who won't mind the screen reducing every now and then.<br /><br />All in all, this is the definitive version of the film. Chock full with features that you'd expect from a collector's release as well as the film itself (ranking among my all time favorite films), you can't go wrong with this. If you own a previous version, strongly consider this. If you've never owned it or seen it, buy it TODAY., including the previous releases' documentaries and new unreleased features such as Alec and William on the Steve Aleen show.

B003YHSE7W|4.0|What makes the Iron Man movies great is that it all looks so real and Director Jon Favreau does an excellent job making it all believable too. And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an \\"iron\\" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but can fly.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of the eccentric, wise-guy Tony Stark than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark in Iron Man 1 and he hits it on the head again in 2! The rest of the cast, including Mickey Rourke, and acting in the movie were terrific. Rourke has about 3 lines in the movie, but that's all he needed. His character was well played and effective. And kudos to Sam Rockwell for an equally effective Justin Hammer portrayal.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 picks up where 1 left off and has Rourke as Ivan Vanko out to avenge is father for a slight by Stark Industries. And Justin Hammer is just the man to help Ivan exact his revenge. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing once again has the viewer clamoring more Jon Favreau's in Marvel's series of Avengers related films over the next several years...I can't wait.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 lost a little of the original shine that 1 had, but it's still an excellent movie. Worthy of collection and at minimum a Netflix must.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this item a few days ago, and I am very happy with it.  I have it attached to the handle of my Baby Jogger City Mini stroller.  I can leave it attached all of the time, as it does not impede the fold of the stroller.    We took a trip to the zoo yesterday, and I loaded it up with:  Smart phone in the small mesh zipper pocket (this would also be a good area for a small wallet).  27 oz Klean Kanteen bottle in one of the drink holders.  Sunglasses in the other drink holder (another Klean Kanteen bottle would have fit however).  Medium size camera, small bag of cookies, and a zoo map in the main compartment...with some room left to spare.    The velcro straps are very strong.  I thought they would sag under the weight of my fully filled Klean Kanteen bottle, but they did not.  The product appears to very well made, especially considering the low price.  My only small complaint is that the Sunshine Kids logo is a bit cheesy looking.  I might try turning it around so it faces the rear of the stroller and can't be seen.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I haven't watched all five discs but I have rented two from different sources and the results are the same: no audio is available if you select the bonus commentary.    I rented Disc One from Blockbuster (an actual physical store) and all three episodes and the \\"8:15\\" recap played perfectly. However, when I selected the audio commentary for the first episode, \\"LAX\\", there was no audio. I tried various ways to get it to play but, in each case, there was no sound.    I received Disc Two from NetFlix.com a couple of days later and its four episodes also played normally. However, when I tried to play the episode \\"Dr Linus\\" with its audio commentary, there was no sound.     I also rented the last disc of Fringe Season 2 from Blockbuster. I played the season finale with commentary and it played just fine so the problem is confined to the Lost DVD box set only. I am so glad I didn't buy the box set, as I would normally have done in the past. It would have been a colossal waste of money.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|The AmazonBasics HDMI Male to Female Swivel Adapter is a great choice for narrow locations and restricted space like your entertainment center that is located near walls or corners. I found it to be useful tool that connects like a regular adapter, in addition to a pivoting center that allows flexibility of movement to help you adjust the placement of the cables and to accommodate the avaialble space.

B003VIW8DK|2.0|As a Ferry, and more particularly, a Roxy Music fan of many years, I must admit the latest offering from the once king of suave Bryan Ferry is a disappointment. I've really tried to get into this album and like it but thus far have not succeeded. I would go so far as to say that this would be Ferry's most uninspiring effort (for me as a listener). He's never been great with the solo albums as being totally satisfying efforts, and yet has produced such great singles from these - \\"A Hard Rains A Gonna Fall\\", \\"The Inn Crowd\\", \\"The Price Of Love\\" etc.This album doesn't even have that! What's disappointing is that from the opening of the first track - \\"You Can Dance\\" with its similar instrumental break as to \\"Avalon's\\" (Roxy's last studio album) \\"True To Life\\" to the other 9 songs and their obvious usage of Ferry's female backing vocals (sometimes excellent on his earlier efforts) it all gets a bit annoying and repetitive. That's not to say it's terrible. It's not! The instrumentation is excellent and the production slick. It's just that the album doesn't grab you in any way and want to keep you interested. Ferry just treads old ground covering it all in the gloss of ultra fine production and fine musicianship. Given that old Roxy mates Brian Eno,Phil Manzanera and Andy MacKay all contribute, the lack lustre effort is all the more surprising. There was talk that the guys were getting together for a Roxy reunion album, an event much anticipated by many a Roxy Music fan. Well, if this was anything like what they would have produced under the Roxy name, then perhaps it's better that they didn't record another album. Let's remember them for the great \\"For Your Pleasure\\" and \\"Stranded\\" efforts!  For me the best track on the album is a rather slightly above average version of Tim Buckley's \\"Song To The Siren\\". It's a soft rock but generally pleasant and competent version of the song, but the original, or even better, This Mortal Coil, versions are infinitely superior. There'ssome really great (but very, very brief) keyboard work done on the otherwise unexceptional song \\"Heartache By Numbers\\", otherwise,I'm sorry to say give it a miss.\\"Frantic\\", and Ferry's other new millenium effort \\"Dylanesque\\" at least had some fine moments. I must admit, I've been reading a book based on the pre Roxy Music period of the band members - \\"Remake Remodel\\"- which explores their influences - particularly with the arts- and despite some interesting anecdotes about the band members, have found the whole exercise a rather self absorbant lot of crap, and admit this may have influenced my recent (poor)perceptions of this latest Ferry album. Look Ferry may be a self confessed \\"snob\\" and surround himself with human artefacts that serve this, but he is capable of some very fine music and lyrics that's much, much better than this (album).

1439163146|5.0|I purchased Palo Alto Stories because I had read an article in Vanity Fair magazine written by James Franco on how he prepared for his role as poet Allen Ginsburg. The article was so well-written that I was hooked by the first sentence. The article was to the point and flowed so smoothly that it never once lost my interest. I had seen Franco in several movies and was [unfairly] surprised that an excellent actor was also an excellent writer. I was curious, so I purchased his book. I found it, once again, extremely well-written, and would have given it an A-plus-plus if I had been a professor [I am a former editor and reporter]. It is a deeply insightful book easily portraying the thoughts and lives of a certain group of adolescents, some troubled, some just curious. However, for me, this book resulted in the purchase of another: in one story a boy talks of the children's book \\"The Rainbow Goblins\\". Franco's young character discusses this book with his friend in such a manner that I wanted it for my grandchildren. I purchased it and we all love it. As Franco wrote, it is a beautiful book with a nice story. [One of our grandchildren also zeroed in on the blue goblin's bare bottom.] Two excellent books, thanks to one Renaissance man.

0316098337|5.0|My husband and I listen to books on CD. While some books translate very well on CD, many depend on the quality of the reader(s). This book was the most enjoyable, thought provoking, disturbing books we have read (listened to) this year....out of 46. It sounds like a memoir. The facinating story about this 5 year old Jack and his young mother locked in a one room shack for all of Jack's life and seven of him Ma's life makes for an extrodianry tale of survial and endurance of the human spirit. We could not stop listening and to this unabridged version and finished it in three days. Emma Donoghue is a master story teller. These are real characters  that become heart-renching real people. Jack is not a \\"cutesy\\" 5 year old, he comes across as an intelligent, imaginative and curious little boy dispite his confinement. This is a MUST read for all parents, grandparents and anyone interested into the insight of a small childs mind, no matter what his environment. Absolutely a great book. Wonderful and unforgetful.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|As a fan of the show \\"Sex And The City\\" and the first movie I was ecstatic when I heard that a sequel had been green lit and ordered and not within 10 minutes of watching this film my bubble busted open (I had truly hoped with Michael Patrick King back at the helm the film would NOT fall victim to the sequel curse, by alas it did)<br />We find our favorite foursome 2 years after the first film left them: Carrie and Big are married and living in their fabulous 5th Ave. apartment. Carrie still wants to live it up like a 20 year old (which she's not anymore) and go out while Big is quite content on staying home with take out and a black and white movie. They have a brief discussion about having children (which thank goodness it was brief because I have decided now that these two should NOT procreate)<br />Miranda has a new boss at her firm that is a sexist pig and she up and quits. This is not the Miranda I grew to know and love, that Miranda would have stood up for herself!<br />Charlotte oh \\"whoa is me\\" Charlotte...Still a happily married mother of 2 (a 2 year old Rose and 6 year old Lily) who INSISTENTLY whines that her girls are driving her crazy. I seriously wanted to shove a pacifier in her mouth! She hires a beautiful nanny which adds to the annoyance that is Charlotte in this film she becomes an insecure little wuss.<br />Samantha is TRYING to stop menopause through every pill, cream, trick known to man. WISE UP Samantha, its going to happen! Through her friendship with Smith (who'd a thought that one after their ending in the first movie?)and a fellow P.R. person she gets an all-expenses paid trip to Abu Dhabi (on a note: the film was banned from filming on location in U.A.E. and shot in Morocco) for her and the girls where the real trouble begins...<br />Carrie (and by some oddly convenient twist of fate) runs into Aidan. This was the BIGGEST letdown of all...there was much hype that when John Corbett signed on for this film and he has MAYBE a combined 10 minutes of screen time. They share ONE kiss after dinner and Carrie falls apart for much of the remainder of the movie about how/if she should tell Big. There was SUCH potential there gone down the drain.<br />Samantha gets caught making out on a beach with a well to do Dane and she is detained until released with help from the man who brought her there (he also subsequently cancels their meeting and all paid expenses)En route to hurry back to the hotel to pack the foursome cause a near riot when (in trying to lure Charlotte away from black marketers) the contents of Samantha's purse spill out (including condoms) She makes VERY obscene gestures to the male crowd causing a bigger stir. (This was another problem I had...I found the film HIGHLY disrespectful to the Muslim culture which is the last thing we needed to do in today's society)Thankfully the girls are saved by some \\"rebel\\" Arab women who share their love of fashions.<br />Bottom line...A exceedingly disrespectful film to the Muslim culture (when its the last thing we SHOULD be doing), these women are going around in clothes and living in apartments most of us only DREAM of affording (are they immune to the floundering economy or something? It just depressed me even more knowing how unrealistic that was) A HUGE missed oppurtunity with John Corbett returning, and lastly, these just were not the girls I watched and fell in love with every week.<br />Sarah Jessica Parker says there is the possibility of a third film while Chris Noth said the critics beat the film to death and he doubts there will be a third film-sorry SJP but I have got to go with Chris on this one!They share ONE kiss after dinner and Carrie falls apart for much of the remainder of the movie about how/if she should tell Big.

0140186395|5.0|East of Eden is primarily set in the Salinas Valley, California in the time period between 1900 and 1918.  Primarily, but not exclusively: some chapters are set in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and the story also goes back to the period of the American Civil War.<br /><br />Two families and their intertwined stories feature in the novel: the Hamilton family, and the Trasks.  The Hamiltons anchor the story: Samuel and Liza Hamilton (John Steinbeck's maternal grandparents) and their children convey a sense of life and continuity in the Salinas Valley.  The Trask story is of two generations of brothers: with each brother trying to win the love of his father.  The how and the why of this struggle is beautifully depicted. From the first generation's Adam and Charles to the second generation's Aaron (Aron) and Caleb, the enduring themes are the battles between good and evil; love and hatred; and acceptance and rejection.  It is the possibility of change through the exercise of free will: `Thou mayest' that adds such a rich dimension to the novel.<br /><br />`Virtue and vice are warp and woof of our first consciousness and they will be the fabric of our last, and this despite any changes we may impose on field and river and mountain, on economy and manners.'<br /><br />It is the characters who make this story come alive.  Cathy Ames, who becomes Adam's wife, is a truly evil character.  And yet, for me, the most monstrous action in the novel is Adam's passive withdrawal from his sons rather than her acts of violence.  Cathy may be a monster:<br />`I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents.'<br />But acts of monstrosity can be passive as well as active.<br /><br />Two of the characters are simply wonderful: Samuel Hamilton and Lee stand out for their wisdom and humanity.  This is a complex, multi-layered novel that is magnificent in a number of different ways.

0307276902|5.0|I loved the book. I read it when it first came out, many times. I will admit that my BS radar went up several times, before the author was exposed as making most of it up. Alot of things were hard to believe, for example- the dentist. Novocaine is not a narcotic. It is an anesthetic. And I noticed alot that he portrayed himself as a big tough-guy. And the things like staff taking him to a crack house to retrieve a patient that he is not even supposed to have contact with?<br />But I have to admit I like the book. I have read it many times. I am a recovering addict. I read in a few of the negative reviews that reading this book might scare people that need help, and not seek it. Just because of this book. Come on- addicts seek help when they are ready. Addicts lose friends to overdoses, and that doesn't stop them from using the same drug- how is this book going to scare them? And Oprah? Humiliating him on TV- \\"You lied to me!\\". Who is she? GOD? There are more important things to get that worked up about. I cannot believe how so many people felt personally betrayed. Get over yourselves!<br />When it was discovered that it was fiction, it didn't change my thoughts or feelings about the book. I like his style of writing, the way he describes things. I think he is a great writer. And the sequel, \\"My Friend Leonard\\" is even better. And I just finished \\"Bright Shiny Morning\\" and it is great too.
0812550706|5.0|`Or at least as close as we're going to get.'<br /><br />The central figure in this novel is Andrew `Ender' Wiggin, a six year old boy, born into a future world which has already suffered two invasions from a species commonly known as the buggers. Ender is monitored by the military for years before being recruited to join an elite group of children in training at battle school.  Their mission? To protect the world against another invasion by the alien buggers.<br /><br />Ender is viewed by the military as the one most likely to succeed and as a consequence he is singled out and pushed almost to his breaking point as he faces more frequent and more difficult obstacles than his classmates.  Ender is promoted more rapidly than his classmates and then graduates to command school where he faces increasingly more difficult challenges and is pushed even harder. The external challenges that Ender has to face are tough enough, but it is his internal demons that are the hardest to face.  The world may need Ender to save it from invasion, but Ender himself is at risk.  Ender's sense of self is under constant attack: every aspect of his life is controlled and the world in which he lives has little time for individuality.  Ender has a purpose, but not a place.<br /><br />`If there was love or pity for him, it was only in his dreams.'<br /><br />The world in which Ender lives is full of challenges to be overcome, constrained by regimented behaviour and absent of compassion.  Whether this is justified by the circumstances (do the ends justify the means?) is an interesting question to consider while reading.  While Ender is training to save the world from external invasion, his equally brilliant siblings Peter and Valentine are influencing the world internally by posing as adults and expressing political views via a global network that is similar to today's internet.<br /><br />The world created by Orson Scott Card is a fierce place: the stakes are high and a lot of weight is resting on the shoulders of Ender.  This is the first novel in a series I've been meaning to read for some time:  now that I've started I'm keen to read the rest as soon as I can.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smiththe first novel in a series I've been meaning to read for some time:  now that I've started I'm keen to read the rest as soon as I can.

B002ZG981E|4.0|Inception is an interesting movie but might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a man who specializes in dream extractions (think corporate espionage) - going into a shared dream state using a military derived technique with a team and a subject to extract a piece of information from that subject's subconscious mind.  This can sometimes involve going into a dream within a dream (or more).<br /><br />Much was made of the complexities of this movie and indeed it is complex but for a generation growing up watching Matrix movies (especially the latter two) this is positively straight forward - and that's not a bad thing.  This is helped by Cobb's new dream architect (played by Ellen Page) who is also new to this world and to whom he explains the rules of the dream world (and thereby us - something not as well done in the Matrix flicks).  In addition to these dream rules there are the complexities of Cobb himself and the guilt he feels over the tragedy of his wife and kids and how this affects his missions.  And the complexities of the new job - to plant an idea into the mind (this process is called inception) of a young business tycoon who has a strained relationship with his dying father.  So yes it is complex but at no time did I feel lost either and this is a major plus for the movie.<br /><br />Some other plusses are extremely cool effects in the dream worlds, likable and believable characters whose interactions are fun to watch, effective action scenes, light comedic moments that pop up rarely but never fall flat and a satisfying emotional arc for our main character.  Truly there are many positive aspects to this movie.<br /><br />Some minuses are that it's a bit too long with a few dragging dialog sequences that could probably have been edited down.  This leads to the fact that it does slow down in parts such that you begin to get antsy (not that I have a short attention span but in a world where anything can happen?).  Despite the preceding two sentences I have to admit that all the dialog added to the movie in one way or another.<br /><br />I was a bit distracted by the fact that the dream rules - although meticulously laid out (which is appreciated) - did not always feel like the movie followed to the letter as laid forth.  (possible minor spoilers) For example the rules of time of a dream within a dream, etc. are laid forth but at times things seem to happen way too fast a layer or two in compared with what we know the rules are.  I also understand that the filmmakers wanted a realistic representation but I felt that dreams were - on the whole - rather boring.  I get that these particular dreams were tailor made but they were so orderly it was a bit disconcerting.  No chaos, no random events, unless provoked by the outside world (or only the next layer up),  just cities and buildings and people in suits.  Speaking for myself (but I'm insane) my dreams are a bit more chaotic.  Then again there were a few surprises in there and a few very cool dream fight sequences.<br /><br />Overall, yes, I do recommend this movie.  It's not as complicated as you may initially think but carries its own for sure.  The characters are well developed and the action carried out quite well within a well defined universe.  It is long and you may struggle with some of the rules but overall the movie is rewarding in visuals, story, overall action and emotional depts.

B00005V9IJ|5.0|OK, while going to the dentist is probably not on most people's top-10 list of things to do, whenever I have a trip to the dentist on the calendar, I like to watch \\"Cast Away\\" the night before.  I am especially likely to do that if I have a major dental event the next day...you know, like a root canal, getting a crown, or even cavities that need to be filled.<br /><br />This film is almost entirely a solo effort by Tom Hanks, and he does a fantastic job of being a time-obsessed FedEx exec who spends his time flying around the world trouble-shooting and instructing FedEx centers about how to be more efficient and time-conscious, until tragedy strikes.  The time flies by for me each time I watch this film as Hanks works to find ways to survive alone on a small south Pacific island where he washes ashore.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely top-notch.  The storyline is great, and the combination of acting, story, and music rates a solid 5 stars.<br /><br />Again, if you dread going to the dentist, watch this film and you'll be grateful that you can.  Now, I didn't say happy that you can go to the dentist, but you will be grateful.  Why do I say this?  Well, I'll give you a two-word clue, \\"ice skate.\\"<br /><br />5 stars all the way!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Okay. I'll admit it. I am really sick of vampires, unless they are being used as bullet fodder. Until the trendy Twilight craze finally dies down, I will usually avoid vampire books/films/TV shows, etc. like the plague.<br /><br />This film was completely different, and utterly refreshing. Dark and pensive, and beautiful in a bleak Scandinavian manner, Let The Right One In completely hooked me and became one of my favorite films from the first time I watched it. No sparkly vegetarian vamps here (thank God!!!). Only two lonely and strange youngsters who find comfort and protection in each other's company. While there seems to be an element of romance, it is not a \\"romance\\" in the traditional cheeseball sense.<br /><br />I don't want to give a lot away...this is simply a film that you must watch to understand and appreciate. If you are looking for another Twilight-esque vampire film, look elsewhere...for the rest of us, this film is a true gem.<br /><br />*A note on subtitles: I am not rating this film according to the subtitle quality on the DVD--I am rating the film on its theatrical and artistic merits as it would have been seen in the theater.*

B0042AEOG0|5.0|Santa Claus is Coming To Town Intro -   It's a beautiful introduction to the album. There are no vocals and its just a calming slow soothing instrumental to set the festive mood of the album. It's not worth paying 99 cents as an individual track but it does flow well with the rest of the album. (NO RATING)    Oh Santa! -  This single is thrilling, catchy, cheerful, and magical all at the same time . Mariah has the \\"midas\\" touch to make golden hit songs one on top of the other, and this one is no exception. Oh Santa! Starts with very enegetic cheerleaders that take you on this Disney Mickey-esque vibe building up to the excitement of Mariah's uptempo double layered vocals in which she chants to Santa for her lovers return. Lyrically, the song expresses the same idea as her classic \\"All I want for Christmas Is You,\\" while also sounding current, hip, and deliciously infectious. The song ends with a synthesized whistle and raspy belts that put you on an instantaneous holiday festive atmostphere.  (5/5)    O Litte Town of Bethlehem/ Little Drummer Boy Medley -   Mariah swims through the vocals in the beginning with a breathy solid tone. The instrumental is very classical and live souding, nothing synthetic. The mood of the song is calm soothing and then towards the end it dramatizes as Mariah belts clearly and extensively . the choir is beautiful but then its overshadowed by Mariah's powerhouse vocals. This song sounds as if belonging to an oscar winning motion picture. (5/5)    Christmas Time is in the Air Again-  My favorite song on the album. This song is full of soul and emotion like no other Mariah Carey song. Fans of songs like \\"The Wind,\\" would love this song. It has feeling of longing and Mariah sounds relaxed and classy while expressing more than impressing. Someone mentioned that they feel like dancing to this song with  a gown on in a ball...and it truly describes that Cinderella, Disney classical feel to it. I still can't believe she wrote this song, when I heard it for the first time, I could've sworn the song was a classic from the 50s. (5/5)    The First Noel/Born is the King interlude -  This song is just great to me; not amazing because I was dissapointed with Mariah's low notes being tuned so obviously. Again she swims through the song and flows over a piano instrumental with soft strings, then she belts Noel just like in 1994. At the end, she trascends to \\"Born is the King\\" with a sexy, sultry 90s style R&B, really magical ending in a solid extended head note that would give you chills, a true cherry on top. (4.5/5)    When Christmas Comes -  My second favorite track on the album. Many lambs would agree that this is the standout track of the album. The song is pure jazzy R&B with Mariah singing in the stylings of the Emancipation of Mimi. There are no breathy vocals, just soulful mid register chest and belts. There are whistles, trills, runs, long notes, OMG it fully embodies Mariah's vocal capabilities, it's excellent to say the least. Right when you think it'll end, she trascends to a brief \\"Jingle Bells\\" and takes the song to another level vocally.  It's intense. (5/5)    Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane) House Top Celebration-  A lot of people don't like the song because it's hip/pop and they feel it doesn't fit on the album conceptually, but this is an underrated number everyone should give a chance...it is extremelly good. It's festive and the instrumental reminds me of Queen's \\"Another One Bites the Dust.\\" Mariah layers the vocals by singing in a low register and high breathy falsetto at the same time like in \\"That Chick\\". She then ends the song with belts similar to the ones in Glitter, in which she showcases her acrobatics and melismatic capabilities. I'm really glad she included this. (4/5)    O Come All Ye Faithful/ Hallelujah Chorus-  This is standout track to many but I feel the song is more impressive then expressive, I wish Mariah would've stuck to the magic of the original. I feel like she's trying to show off more than capture the emotion of the song. While I do like the incorporation of her mom's vocals, I feel like they don't have a good match because she isn't as strong as Mariah and it sounds weak on spots. I also noticed studio enhancements that were unecessary. I mean, the song is a great vocal performance but not amazing as a whole. If you like \\"Fly like A Bird,\\" you would love this song. (4/5)    O Holy Night (Live from WPC at South Central Los Angeles)  What can I say? This just shows Mariah as an artist in her own league noone else can touch. This song is goosebumps from beginning to end. I'm really glad it was included because fans know how annoying it is to be going back and forth on YouTube to watch this MINDBLOWING perfomance. (5/5)    One Child -   Those who like \\"Jesus Born on this Day\\" from the original Merry Christmas album would adore this. The song is emotional and the children chorus is beautiful. The song sounds as if Mariah sang it in 1994, there are no scratchy vocals, everything is clear and the song is strong and smooth at the same time. The lyrics again prove her amaizing songwriting skills. (5/5)    All I Want for Christmas is You (Extra Festive) -  It's incredible Mariah can resing this song as she did back in the day.  The introduction is similar to the album's beginning with \\"Santa Claus is Coming To Town,\\" setting the perfect mood for  a fun, catchy classical. I thought it was a bit unecessary to include this but its undeniable that this is one of the best songs of her career. (4.5/5)    Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem) -  90s Euro Pop meets Mariah. The beginning is mindblowing, as she belts high and then countdown from 10 to 1 starts as the song picks up its poppy pace.  I can already picture the song being played at clubs in New Years.  The song is overall fun but the layering make the song kind of corny and Mariah makes weird remarks at the end of the song. Its still fun to hear!!! (4.5/5)
B000003TAW|5.0|Sixteen years later and these 10 Songs still sound as fresh as they did in 1994.  There is something unique that makes this album stand out among the numerous  grunge must-haves. Mixing depressive Nirvana-like riffs with beach boys choruses  just blew me away back then and it still does. Btw, my 3 month old son is already a  huge fan of this album as well. Should i be worried ?

0439023521|5.0|This is a remarkable young adult series that will also appeal to older age groups (much like our friend Harry Potter).  I commented to my husband that before long, people will really be talking about The Hunger Games Trilogy.  Though much darker and more violent than other young adult books I've read, it still conveys a universal attitude towards an oppressive dystopian regime in the tradition of 1984 and Brave New World.  I would liken it to an adolescent Running Man, as the powers that be demand an annual tribute, selecting one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the 12 districts of a post-apocalyptic America known as Panem.  These tributes are pitted against each other in a fight to the death, the lone survivor earning prestige for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />The book is very well structured.  We are introduced to Katniss and her world in the 12th District, her family and background, and her devotion to her younger sister Prim, which causes her to volunteer as the District's female tribute in her sister's place.  She is whisked away to prepare for The Hunger Games and we are given a better idea of the structure of Panem, but it is purposefully ambiguous, leaving room for development in future books.  The games themselves are a struggle for survival, to hunt or be hunted, but Katniss's greatest challenge is determining how to address her fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta.  Can he be trusted, when in the end there can be only one winner?  Are his professions of love genuine, or just a gimmick to help them stay alive?  As the battle rages on and the number of tributes dwindles, Katniss must make some serious decisions if she is going to keep her promise to Prim and get out of this alive.  The conclusion was riveting and left me with extreme anticipation to start the next book.  The dilemma left for Katniss to confront made for a great segue into Catching Fire.<br /><br />For adult readers like me, this is an easy and captivating read (I consumed it in one day).  I will diligently be spreading the word about this fantastic book and its sequels.in one day).  I will diligently be spreading the word about this fantastic book and its sequels.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|As this epic band leaves this studio for the last time, they take back the memories of recording for the last time together for their newest album ABBEY ROAD. What is known to many as their last songs, the pop/classic rock band, The Beatles yet again hit the music industry with their 11th studio album released on Sept. 26, 1969 by the Apple Corp. In this album, like the others, is featured Paul McCartney (bass guitar, vocals), John Lennon (rhythm guitar, vocals), George Harrison (lead guitars, vocals), and Richard \\"Ringo Starr\\" Starkey (drums, vocals).       This CD comes pre-packed with 17 new, original songs. Tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8-17 are all sung by either Lennon or McCartney. Tracks 2 and 7's vocals are done by Harrison and track 5 is sung by Starr. Some of the most famous songs from this album are \\"Come Together,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" \\"Because,\\" and \\"The End\\". This also includes \\"Polythene Pam,\\" \\"Octopus's Garden,\\" \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and so many more. And what seem as though is all catchy tunes, pointless lyrics, and great music in general is so much more. Each song in ABBEY ROAD has little to a decent amount of meaning or if not, shows the fun of singing from each of the member's style, respectively. For example, in the song \\"Come Together,\\" each member's flaws are stated. Then it is stated how they should set aside these flaws and differences and join together as one, single unit. What made this album unique was that the band decided to create their songs into a medley, each one leading into the next. The Beatles tried to experiment with the adding of the medley, but that just added to its popularity. We all must respect The Beatles for their ingenuity shown by the band on this album.   The Beatles, a trend starting over 50 years ago, is still around today because they are classics. What made ABBEY ROAD a classic was noted from its strongest songs. \\"Come Together\\" is arguably the best opener for any of The Beatles albums. The way the instruments slow down and speed up with Lennon's makes this track so great. In \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy),\\" the guitar riffs and solos make this song one to remember. Lastly, the venture The Beatles took when creating what is known to many as the \\"Abbey Road Medley,\\" a continuous flow from the song \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" to the song \\"The End\\", is perhaps one of the best ideas throughout their albums. This was first thought as filler songs to many, but then later acknowledged for its cohesiveness and how smoothly it flowed from one song to the next.    Though The Beatles may have split as of December 31, 1970, their legacy continues to live on through Ringo and Paul and through their everlasting music. What The Beatles had accomplished in one decade cannot be replicated by any other band in lifetimes to come. Their music is the total package, period.
0439023521|5.0|I finished this book in roughly two days, that's how tightly it grabs you.  The story about a dystopian future society that brings back gladiatorial games between kids and teenagers is very tense, as the main character, a girl named Katniss, tries her best to outsmart and defeat dozens of young girls and boys forced to become survivalists, thieves and cold-blooded murderers.    The concept of the story its strong enough to carry itself and garner the reader's interest, but the writer goes much further than that and makes sure you experience all the horror, the violence, the urgency and the fear, until you feel you are starving, bleeding and caked with dirt as well.     I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I'm ready to devour the rest of the trilogy.  Do yourself a literary favor and read it now!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Originally ordered from a vendor in Amazon marketplace and instead of receiving a used copy from VA, received a new one from China!  According to the liner notes, the bass player is Paul \\"McCairmy\\" and the drummer is Ringo \\"Start\\".  There still appear to be a lot of bad copies out there--watch for newly listed sellers.  Amazon customer service couldn't/wouldn't do anything about it except tell me to send it back to the seller--who now has an address in Texas.  Buyer beware.    Wound up paying full price for a new copy and am happy with it--and the amazing music.  Just a shame Amazon isn't taking a tougher stand against the bad guys.
0765350386|5.0|I enjoyed this book (and the rest of the series) very much.  The magic system is *very* original and so detailed that you can't help but feel like it's real.  The books aren't perfect, but the story is engaging and largely unpredictable.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in fantasy novels with a lot of action and anticipation mixed in.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Wow!  I've had a laserdisc, a DVD, and now Blu Ray of this fun movie.  Yes, it's un-even and a little slow towards the end, but the music is great and van Dyke was never better.  My favorite part of the transfer is the audio.  Just beautiful.  Well-balanced between voices, effects and music.
0765326353|5.0|The Way of Kings has scaled to the top of my elite bookshelf, taking its rightful place as one of my favorite books of all time.  I loved the depth of character, complexity of plot, unexpected twists, and the fact that the book had an ending in its own right, despite being the first book in a large series.  If Brandon continues to put out books of this caliber for the entire series, it will go down as the best epic fantasy series of all time.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|When I learned Russell Crowe would star in a new Robin Hood movie, I felt certain that at least it could not be as bad as the Kevin Costner rendition. Russell Crowe and Robin Hood surely would equal an intelligent and exciting film. But I was wrong. The problem begins with the screenplay, which apparently is another postmodern exercise in its boring faith in its perceptions to begin anew: it is an attempt to 'imagine' what kind of actual facts might have undergirded the growth of the legend. None of it, beyond the most obvious, is particularly plausible, and it does not add up to close to a satisfying whole. Its falsifying of history is much worse than anything in the Errol Flynn movie, because that clearly is meant to be just swashbuckling fun while this wants the audience to see it as saving people from the bad history of swashbucklers. If Russell Crowe is not ashamed of being in this movie, he is not as discerning as I thought him to be.
B003ONNWO6|5.0|I was amazed the condition the dvd was and played beautifully. Very pleased with purchase!
B0041X90ZS|5.0|OK, so they have Live In America from their first tour, which was ok, but I thought Neal sounded like crap. Then Live in Europe from the 2nd tour, which was an improvement.  As another reviewer pointed out, Neal sounds great on this one! As does the rest of the players. Here are the pros and cons of this release:  PROS: The band coudn't possibly sound better that they do here. The Whirlwind, which is the best prog-rock concept album since Dream Theater's Scenes From A Memory, is played in its entirety. Plus, as I have stated in my review of the Genesis cd Live Over Europe, The Whirlwind live is played at a slightly lower key so the guys don't have to hit really high notes while trying to sing live. This is especially notable during the segment of The Whirlwind, Lay Down Your Life, in which Neal flawlessly dominates!  The sound quality of the 3 audio cds is amazing, like you're actually there. You've got The Whirlwind, plus All Of The Above, We All Need Some Light, Duel With The Devil, Bridge Across Forever, and Stranger In Your Soul, played to absolute perfection!  One comical note is the fact that during The Whirlwind song, Set Us Free, Neal forgets the lyrics and you can hear Mike Portnoy trying to remind him. On The dvd, this is edited out.   CONS: On disc 1 of the audio portion, The Whirlwind, it is one long 79-minute track. It is not divided into individual tracks like it is on the studio version of The Whirlwind. So if I want to hear Is It Really Happening, I have to keep my finger on the skip/search button of my cd player until it gets to that part.   The dvd has \\"sort-of\\" face-paced video edtiting, but not so bad that it is unwatchable. If you have seen any of the recent Iron Maiden live dvds, those are unwatchable because of the horrible video editing. This is not as bad as the Iron Maiden dvds. The video editing on this Transatlantic show is kind of fast-paced, but not so bad that it will give you a major headache.   There's my review. Personally, I love this set. But if you are picky about the things I have stated above, take caution.
0307473465|4.0|This book is a quick read, but unlike others of its itty bitty length, it tells a great story with detail and character. The story, taking place in post-war Germany, is of a young many who has an illicit affair with a woman twice his age. Despite the strangeness of the relationship, and of the woman's mysterious life, Michel loves Hanna absolutely and that love haunts him his whole life. After young Michel is abandoned by Hanna, he tries to forget her, but everything reminds him of her. Their paths cross again years later when Hanna is put on trial for crimes committed during the war, when she was an SS guard in charge of transporting Jews to concentration camps. Despite the horror and shame of Hanna's past, it does not seem to compare to the one secret she has kept within her all of her life, a secret Michel discovers while wishing to save her from the grips of a conviction and prison sentence. The story is wonderful, the characters real and the plot heartrending and unforgettable. A great read!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|That I am over 65 and I love this album.  Remember at my age I heard Buddy Holly when he was only heard on local Texas radios in the Texas Panhandle, I went through the British Invasion, and survived the Acid Rock days.  All this means I have heard a bunch of good music, hated some and love some and nothing more.  I heard this album with my son on XM.  I asked him who it was and had he ever heard them before.  Since I was talking to him about music, he hated the album immediately and no he had never heard them before.  I was use to this so I looked them up on youtube and watched their video.    I could not figure out what kind of music they were.  I first thought something like country or folk.  That is beauty of this group.  They have style!  They are not like any British[Irish?] group coming out of England to here.  Oh I know that on youtube they give you \\"simular\\" bands to see, but they aren't the same.    This music is raw in its performance. It is not polished with slick back ground music.  You have a somewhat strange arrangement of instruments, guitar, bass, electric banjo in a guitar frame,  key board, and foot  beat drum.  In some ways the songs reminded me of Irish rebellion songs and at other times religious themed folk.    The main song I heard and was played on the radio was Little Lion Man.  This was the first video I saw too.   Now I am ashamed to say I didn't really listen to the lyrics, because the tune got in the way and I mean that in a good way.  I was really into the music and not listening.  I reccomend SIGH NO MORE and WINTER WINDS as others to listen to.  They evoke strong religious themes or so I think.    Their videos are what really hook you.  You watch them and you see the vivid emotions in the lead guitar singer's face.  It feels like youi are listening in on private moment.    At my age, I found this album moving and I have listen to it several times now  and I still have not gotten to the lyrics yet.  Their music just sweeps me up.  Finally my wife walked by when I was listening to this and she stopped doing the house work to listen.  She stood through two songs and asked her what she thought.  She just smiled and nodded.  I then asked her what the songs were about?   She looked at me and shook her head, \\"what words?\\"  See that is what I mean.
0142000671|5.0|I accidentally ordered this. The day it arrived, I spent the afternoon enthralled by Steinbeck's writing and his unique view of the world. \\"East of Eden\\" is one of my very favorite books and I don't really know why I've never read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" before. I vaguely remember seeing it as a play while I was in high school.<br /><br />A story about two men working together to attain their own version of the American Dream, it brings up many ethical questions and can lead to some interesting discussion and thought.<br /><br />Excellent. I no longer have to wonder why it is a classic.
B002U33GUQ|4.0|Enjoyed a more structured and expansive Brad, especially \\"Don't Be Sad\\" - ignore the title and just  relax in the attractive arrangement.   I much prefer BM when he fits in well with other musicians, as here.
0380730405|5.0|Daphne du Maurier's slow, steady psychological thriller was pure enjoyment. I had a few moments where I remembered black and white scenes from Alfred Hitchcock's cinematic creation of \\"Rebecca\\". I must have watched it as a child. I was glad that I couldn't actually remember the ending.<br /><br />The young bride narrates and the reader journeys through her somewhat obsessive thought process as she meets the inhabitants of Manderley--her new home.<br /><br />The writing is superb and the main (unnamed) character especially is completely and some times frustratingly realistic. Wonderful!
144471032X|5.0|This plan is wonderful and I don't feel like I'm on a diet at all.  It is so easy to follow and I never feel hungry. I did the Attack Phase for nine days and lost 13 lbs.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to change their eating habits and not feel like they are being deprived of anything.  There are no cravings for sweets or anything that is not on the food list.  Some of the ingredients may be hard to find.  Quark is used in several recipes and cannot be found in my area.  I had to order it online and that was very expensive but worth it.  I suggest that you just give it a try; you won't be disappointed.
0307473465|5.0|I read this book yesterday.  I read it fast and I'm still trying to digest it. It leaves me with a lot to think about and I don't know how I'm going to rate it yet. I'll have to come back to it later.<br /><br />Updated: Jan. 28, 2010.<br /><br />I still don't know how to rate it. It was disturbing and dark though well written and intriguing. I think the author may have obtained his ultimate goal of causing the reader to think seriously on unpleasant but legitimate topics. In that case, I would have to rate it five stars.<br /><br />Did I enjoy it? Not really. I don't think the reader is supposed to.<br /><br />I definitely think Michael was a victim (albeit willing). Is Hanna a victim too? Of Hitler? Were they all victims? When do people cease to be the victim and become the perpetrator?
0765326353|5.0|I'm not going to claim that I knew of Brandon Sanderson before Robert Jordan passed away and his wife tagged Sanderson to finish out the Wheel of Time series.  But sometimes blessings come out of bad situations.    I've since read his entire catalogue and enjoyed each and every one of his books.  He may not be Robert Jordan, but over time I've come to realize that's a good thing.  He's now an author that stands on his own merits, his own words, his own well though out and well constructed novels.    With that being said, I had some nervous excitement as I picked up Way of Kings.  I was both excited and nervous for the same reason: I was being presented with an opportunity to begin another epic series.    Nervous because my experience (a shared experience that most of you can attest to) has been long and drawn out.  A Song of Ice and Fire might be finished in the next ten years, the WoT series has been going for twenty years, and even Erikson's series has been running for a long period of time (and he's extremely prolific compared to the other two).    Excited because I love reading books and then having that anticipation for the next one to come out.  To become invested in another group of characters.  To follow another plotline that I can wrap myself up in for the next chunk of my reading life.    Now that I've got that all of my chest, I can say what I thought of the book.  It was great.  It started slow, it offered up a lot of questions that I wanted answers to but soon found out that weren't going to be answered for a long time, if not ever in this book.    These problems, if you want to call them that, were short lived as the stories of Dalinar and his sons, of Shallad, and of Kaladin soon sucked me in and I began eagerly turning each page hoping with one part that the answers were going to be there and another part hoping that they weren't so I could experience that excited anticipation again.    The first book in the Stormlight Archives is a long start to what promises to be a long series (which I'm still excited about after reading the first entry).  I could think of many worse standalone books or series that one could read.  It's Sanderson at his finest and I have a sneaking suspicion that what's to come is going to be better!
0689865384|3.0|Even though Uglies was different from the books I usually read, I did enjoy it. It reminded me of Orwell's 1984 without being so dark. The idea of mind control, Big Brother and so-called utopian society are interesting to think about as we continue the shift toward bigger government in this country. It also addresses relevant ideas about the perception of beauty.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|After the spring and summer of Bruno Mars being on two huge hits, he has released his solo debut. I have to admit that I wasn't sure about ordering this disc. I am a professional DJ and very apprehensive about purchasing debut cds. I gave it a spin and I was very impressed! The Cd covers a few genres and is solid all the way through. He covers reggae, R&B, rock and pop. In my opinion he is in the running for artist of the year. My favorite tracks on the disc are \\"The Lazy Song\\" which is a great pop/ska song, \\"Liquor Store Blues\\" ft. Damian Marley, \\"Marry You\\", \\"Runaway Baby\\" and the closer \\"The Other Side\\" ft. Cee-Lo & B.o.B. None of the tracks are fillers. \\"Our First Time\\" is pure baby making music! That one ranks up there with Marvin Gaye and Barry White. Just preview it and you will get an idea of what I mean. All in all a great disc and the beginning of a superstar!
0316172324|5.0|The idea of \\"Blink\\" is that the areas of our expertise generate some of the most reliable gut instincts and impulses, and how we can come to use these impulses in a controlled way.  \\"Blink\\" also tackles the ideas of where these impulses fail, and investigates why.<br /><br />As a whole, concise book, the arch of the elements involved is a little wobbly.  Each chapter feeds into the other, but the ideas come across as initially disparate, a bit of a shock to a reader expecting a smooth reading experience.  What kept me tied to the book was the idea of applicability.  As I read through each part of the book, I found myself evaluating my own experiences against the ideas of the experiences presented in the book.  In that respect, I found the book invaluable for helping improve my own rapid cognition by evaluating some of the misconceptions I might have about it.<br /><br />The plus and minus of the book is that it, in itself, is \\"thin-sliced\\" as far as subject matter.  No segment is comprehensive.  In some cases this is due to interest; I can envision the publisher/editor saying \\"well, the details of this study would be great to go into more detail about, but people will snore.\\"  In other cases, it seems like it may be due to the lack of tangible concepts in some of the examples; How does one truly evaluate the nature of a person on a scientific level when it seems to be all a matter of opinion?<br /><br />The advantage of this is that the final message of the book, the closing element, brings together both the positive and negative aspects of snap judgments.  One person's auditory rapid-cognition can be completely clouded by their visual rapid-cognition.<br /><br />The advantages of knowing what to trust and when is critical, and in this case \\"Blink\\" helps explore reasons and examples of exactly that.

0786955570|5.0|This game was one of the biggest and surprises I've had in regards to Role Playing Games this year.  Most table top Role Playing Games or RPGs are very time intensive:  with a time commitment in advance to create a character, and multiple sessions to get a game started.  Now, to be fair, this is not a true RPG.  This is a \\"lite\\", RPG-like board game that incorporates many aspects of an RPG.  That is exactly what makes the game so great.  It's a fun game that throws you right into the action and you don't have to be a Role Playing fanatic to enjoy it.    The game takes place in a single setting, Castle Ravenloft, and begins by throwing your characters into what is essentially a dungeon crawl.  The characters are pre-made and come from some pretty basic player classes from DnD 4th edition.  There is a little bit of character customization which comes from choosing your own \\"powers\\" or abilities that your character will use throughout the game.  Once each player has selected a character, the fun begins right away.  Each player takes turns exploring, fighting monsters, and facing the many traps and dangers that lurk within the dungeon.    Scenarios are chosen from the adventure book before hand and have varying difficulties.  As the players explore the dungeon, you add new tiles to the start tile and the game board expands.  Monster, treasure and encounter cards are drawn and played as the players expand deeper and deeper into the castle.  since the dungeon tiles and game cards are always shuffled, the game will never play out the same way twice even if you are playing the same scenario.  The randomly generated factor of the game really adds a lot of replay-ability to the game.  The boss characters can also make the game very challenging.     Castle Ravenloft has everything you need for your adventure packed into one complete box.  From the miniatures to the artwork on the cards and even the box itself, the game pieces are very nicely put together.  All in all, this isa solid board game that will entertain the casual player and the experienced RPG fan alike.  It is the best board I have played since Settlers of Katan and I would highly recommend it.
B002ZG974M|4.0|Usually, babies just burp, poop, and sleep. Yet, [[ASIN:B002ZG974M Babies]] still manages to be an entertaining movie. It follows four babies, one from Namibia, Mongolia, Japan, and the U.S. each. At a certain point, the movie isn't so much about watching cute little babies (although there is plenty of that), but rather gaining an appreciation of just how differently some kids are raised. The sleek daycare in Tokyo is contrasted with the farm animals in Mongolia and the dusty abandonment of rural Namibia. Thus, the diversity of babies demonstrates the diversity of human cultures and living conditions. I thought the film did run a bit too long (at a certain point, the babies lose their charm), but it's nonetheless a fascinating study in contrasts.
B004A9F9ZI|5.0|I've always been a fan of the zombie genre but I get disappointed when I see a bad zombie movie and there are a lot out there. My favorite zombie movies are Night Of The Living Dead, 28 days later, Dawn Of The Dead (original and new), Zombieland and Dead Snow. Zombieland was a pleasant surprise, I didn't think it would be such a good zombie movie being comedy also. When I heard that there was going to be an actual mini-series made about zombies I instantly became stoked, but after I found out it was an re-imagining of The Walking Dead comics I about fainted. I think the first episode of T.W.D so far has stayed loyal to those films and The Walking Dead comic but at the same time while being its own entity. In my opinion you can't go wrong with Frank Darabont as the director and then the producer of both Aliens and Terminator movies. I am extremely excited about this show so far and cannot wait for the second episode, \\"Guts\\" to come out this Sunday. I recommend you watch this show immediately !
B000RPCK1U|5.0|Although there is only one bedroom scene with a near naked woman, and that a gratuitous scene unrelated to the drama, this 1997 two and a half hour Bond is excellent. A megalomaniac, megarich newspaper, magazine, and TV fanatic decides to start a war between Britain and China, not the US, so that he can sell more newspapers and magazines, and get more TV viewers. There is lots of action.<br /><br />The story starts with 007 rushing to get out of an area about to be bombed by a missle. He makes it in seconds by escaping on a plane with an enemy soldier behind him trying to choke him to death. The fanatic has an invisible ship. He controls a satellite. He has his people torpedo a British ship while leading the world to think it was done by the Chinese. He shoots down Chinese planes making it appear that it was done by the British. The two countries decide to go to war. Bond is given 48 hours to prove that the British and Chinese were not involved.<br /><br />Bond had and has a sexual relationship with the fanatic's wife and starts one with a Chinese secret agent who was sent, like him, to discover the truth. The latter two have many adventures together. For example, they are handcuffed by the enemy, escape on a motorcycle, drive while handcuffed, evade a helcopter by remarkable ways, and save each other - mostly Bond saving the female - on several occasions.
0739344269|3.0|I was disappointed with this book.  Dr. Hawking did not answer the question of why God was not necessary in the creation of the universe.  The book struck me as a last desperate attempt by a great physicist to try and grasp the brass ring of the so-called Theory of Everything.  Unfortunately, he fell far short.  Anyone who is not a theoretical physicist may find this book a little bit of a slog.

0140157352|5.0|Without hesitation I would recommend the bestselling Getting to Yes. It captured my attention from the first page to the last and had me nodding in agreement throughout. The authors were somehow able to synthesize everything from systems theory to anger management to elements of the Tao Te Ching in a one crisp, smart approach to negotiating win-win solutions. They presented their approach quickly and cleanly, sparing the reader all the specific research studies/citations and technical jargon that would be unnecessary and unhelpful for most of us.<br /><br />Negotiating doesn't need to be a mentally draining and frustrating tug-of-war that often ends up in a stalemate. It can be a logical, intellectually stimulating brainstorming process for coming up with a win-win solution. Critics of the approach will likely label the idea as naïve, unrealistic, or simply impossible. It IS impossible if your goal is simply to bend the other person's will until they accept your position. But the authors are advocating a complete shift from negotiating for your position, to negotiating for principles: fairness, mutually agreeable solutions, ideas that strengthen long-term relationships, and so forth. Those who master that alternative approach are likely to see huge gains in both the short-term and long-term results of their negotiations.<br /><br />If you're still hungry for more after reading the book, you can pick up the Getting to Yes Workbook called [[ASIN:0140235310 Getting Ready to Negotiate (Penguin Business)]] and, for particularly difficult negotiations, [[ASIN:0553371312 Getting Past No]].<br /><br />Because we're all involved in negotiations in our personal and professional lives, we could all benefit from polishing our negotiation skills. As Dr. Chester Karrass said, \\"You don't get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.\\"
B00361DR4Q|5.0|It is an excellent album, which should have in your collection if you love Verdi.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|When my girls first started watching BIG TIME RUSH it didn't take long for their songs to seep into my soul. They were catchy, uplifting with great vocals. There CD wasn't out or any indication of when it would be, and we just had to get a hold of their songs. So we purchased several off of itunes to tie us over. But once we discovered the CD would be released, we signed up right away for it. What a great CD. Something the whole family can enjoy.  Who would have thought that only a few weeks later we'd get to meet them!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This item arrived in perfect condition, the case was perfect, all DVD's worked perfectly.  Great arrival time, and kudos to the seller!
B0043A0U94|5.0|I like this CD and the mastering is superb.  Very clean, smooth and warm sounding.  Just the opposite of what the other reviewer writes.  I think you should ignore the other reviewer as he seems to have a personal problem with all Audio Fidelity titles.      This 24K title allows the instruments and the ambiance to breathe.  I don't like the heavy handed use of top end EQing and compression to change what the clear intent of the artist and producer intended, and this version respects that.  This was one of Billy's finest recordings and was chosen as the first title to be released by Sony on CD.  I'm glad the CD doesn't sound like the LP.  After all the LP is \\"analog\\" and the CD is \\"digital\\".  Besides, I already have the LP and the CD so I welcome a different perspective on sound.     I don't ever feel the mastering engineer should impose their musical concepts taking the music and the ambiance on the tapes and turning the sound into something \\"brighter\\".  I want warmer not brighter.  It seems that the other reviewer likes to use EQ and compression to manipulate the sound.  I don't want my sound manipulated.  The songs on this album are all classics.  This Audio Fidelity 24K title will be my new go-to when it comes to Billy Joel's 52nd Street.
B002BE7JEI|4.0|I liked this movie and was looking to add a blu ray movie to my collection. I read on the net that this is a great blu ray movie and the critics were right. If you are looking for a great looking blu ray movie get this one. I first figure out if I like the movie, then does it look good in blu ray. If you like the movie you will not be disappointed. Also it would be a waste to buy a movie just because it looks good in blu ray  and you know you will never watch it. Does the story have some hole sure but don't all movies.    Also getting the standard dvd along with it too is good.
B000001F7R|4.0|yes it's true. this IS one of def leppard's BEST albums.  their first album which came out in 1980 rocks from beginning to end. steve clark and pete willis' guitar rips through this album, and lyrically, they're firing on all cylinders here. and it may sound funny, but this album has a bit of a 'trippy' feel to it.  this album is, head and shoulders above ANYTHING the band has released since 'adrenalize'. which was about the time that the wheels fell off the def leppard train. which is sad since their guitar players (now) vivian campbell and phil collen are fully capable of writing great hard rock/metal riffs,(remember 'rainbow in the dark' and 'stagefright'?) and putting together a killer album, but alas, they seem to just NOT want to.  so i highly recommend this album if you're up for a dose of hard rocking delight. if you're a fan of 'slang', or 'euphoria', or 'songs from the sparkle lounge', you probably wont like this album.  but if you like some good hard rock and metal with that 'classic rock' sonud to it, then this is the album for you.    my advice to the leps: ditch campbell and bring back willis and write a rocking record before the ship completely sinks.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|We both love this show and really want to have the whole series, BUT save yourself a LOT of trouble and don't buy this set.  Here's our story:    Purchased (through Amazon) when the price dropped to the $80 to 90 mark.  Received quickly (Amazon is the best for that), watched the first disk, played ok.  Tried for the second disk - would only play about half way through, then locks up, jump around, frozen picture.  Tried in several DVD players.      Return  - Amazon usually won't take back open items, but since this is defective they replace no problem.  When filling out the return I notice SEVERAL YEARS of people complaining that this set doesn't play!  Check competitors sites, SAME THING!  This is not a good sign.  I call Amazon, rep is nice, says they will suspend sales of item for review.  Sure enough, the page has a \\"temporarily not available, under review for defects\\" or something similar.  After 7 days, banner goes away, they call to say they return all stock and got a new shipment, they are sending us one.  Sounds good!    Return AGAIN -The second replacement comes - SAME ISSUES!!!!  Return for refund, not going to go through that again.  Tell Amazon again about the trouble.  Item goes 'under review' again, then back on sale  - what did they review?  Always loved Amazon but now I feel that they are knowingly selling a defective product.    2 shipments, 3 different sets, all are unplayable.  The DVDs are defective from the manufacturer - on close inspection it even looks like the layers inside are separating (a watery, wavy look on the shiny side).    No response at all from Lionsgate (I emailed them)-  let's just say they suck at customer service.    Your choices are to by the individual seasons (and pay over $200, no thanks) or do without - this set will just piss you off when half the episodes can't be played.
B004A9F9ZI|5.0|The pilot exceeded my expectations. It's cinematic, tense and dramatic. While this episode does not introduce many characters aside from Rick (and Shane in a way), they did it really well. I cannot wait to meet (again) the Atlanta camp survivors in the next episode (Glenn!).
B001Q9E9F6|3.0|The long tail is the name for a known feature of statistical distributions that is also known as pareto tails, fat tails, power-law trails or heavy tails. Most people go by the 80/20 principle in which 80% of the revenue come from 20% of your customers. The Long tail distribution is that 20% of items represent less than 50% of occurrences.     The author explained that a significant part of Amazon.com's sales come from obscure books that are not available in the limited shelf space of the brick and mortar store. This shows a major downfall in the traditional brick and mortar store model. If I want a CD I just download it from i-tunes or make a playlist on YouTube. Pandora and last.fm lets me stream music of artists I like and recommends other artists based on previous listening. I have the ability to get CD's and new artists that would not be available at an FYE or a Best Buy store. I think another example would be the boom in micro breweries and how people have access to this once \\"not touchable\\" brews. Beer advocacy.com allows it participants to swap beers essentially trying to get around the three tiered system.     The author wrote in The Economist, some of the reviewers criticized him for the fact that his style of writing was not able to stretch into book length material. I agree with this statement, I found myself skimming over the pages because of the repetition. He used the same examples over and over again, I like a lot of different examples it makes it more interesting. He does have a good flow in his writing and does not use a lot of academic jargon. If you are just looking for a summary read the publication in Wired magazine from October 2004.     If you liked the Tipping Point, Freakonomics, and Made to Stick you will like this book. This is for someone who is interested in micro economics. It would also be good for MBA students, business people, and just someone looking for a good read. The internet lets people have access to many products not like they did before.
B003WSFXKY|2.0|Quite disappointing in selection of tracks, performers and performances. A CD I definiitely could have done without. What we need is Carlos himself playing the greatest guitar classics, not delegating them out to others.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|First off, I have never listened to an Accept album. I loved their song \\"Balls to the Wall\\", but I never actually owned anything or heard anything else from them. I consider myself a metal head, but I just never got into them for some reason.     I listened to some samples on Amazon for Blood of the Nations, and I thought this album would be worth having. And boy, I am not disappointed. This is a great, hard hitting metal album! Every song on here is great! There isn't a weak track to be found.    This album definitely has me thinking \\"metal album of the year.\\"
B0031ZWZR2|1.0|I'd give the show itself 4 stars.  But the DVD set gets 1 due to the nonexistence of a part 2 DVD set.    Buy this instead:  [[ASIN:B003PGNBO8 FlashForward: The Complete Series]]
0439023491|5.0|I sent \\"Catching Fire\\" to a family member in prison. I had already sent him the first book of the \\"Hunger Games.\\" He begged me to send him this second book of a three book set the \\"Hunger Games Trilogy.\\" The third book is \\"Mockingjay.\\" He said on receiving the \\"Catching Fire\\" he started reading it and couldn't put it down. When he finally had to stop reading and get a little sleep another inmate, who also read his first book \\"The Hunger Games\\" started reading it and would let him have it back until he finished it. The books are so popular that there is a line of seven other inmates that are looking forward to reading all three of the \\"Hunger Games Trilogy\\" They are so interesting it is very hard to put the book down. My daughter is having a birthday this month so I sent her the \\"Hunger Games Trilogy\\" too. I think you will enjoy it!!

B0047C9Y9K|4.0|In this episode of Bones - Bones and special agent Booth appear to be drifing a part in their interest for each other. I have to wonder where their directions are going in this sense. The team appears to be trying to pursuade Bones to appear on a youth television program geared for young scientists. I believe this particular episode was largely influenced by the Halloween season. The counselor, Sweets appears to be taking on new roles - although Bones still harbors disagreement with his methods and his profession. The murderd victim is a bounty hunter - one can only guess who the perpretrator is. The rest I will leave you to discern and enjoy.
B002PEP4SC|1.0|I love the TV series and tried to read this looking for fluffy fiction but entertainment. The book couldn't be worse. It is boring and difficult to read. I don't think anyone would write this under their real name; it's that bad.
044654759X|4.0|This was a great novel, once again, by Nicholas Sparks... but it had a slow start.. it was a little tough to get interested in in the beginning, but then it picked up and I couldnt put the book down... It is a good novel, so if you get it, and you can't quite seem to get into it, just keep reading, it does get much better! :)
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Is it only on the region 1 version of this that you get to see your name in the end credits?  I have a region 2 version and this does not?
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Eric, as I am, is mellowing with age. I enjoy this album again and again. I look forward to the new crossroads DVD. I hope that there will be many more releases. Eric is still On Top Of The World.
B000JQUZCI|3.0|I think if this book were published today it would not have been the success it was. Not only because of the overly ornate prose (no doubt placed in the book by Mary's husband, Percy)but because it has some problems. First, the \\"creation\\" of the monster is done almost out of hand without true explanation (justified by saying it's a secret) or even any real description of how it was done. In little more than a couple of paragraphs, the monster is made. Second, the monster turns out to be able to speak like a Shakespearian actor after roaming alone and hiding for his whole existence. Where did he learn to speak like an Eton grad? No real explantion. (This absurdity is so obvious that the movie industry, upon which the Frankenstein reputation truly rests, made the monster a grunting being, the right thing to do). Third, a large part of the book is spent describing the towns, the cities, etc. that Frankenstein visits while taking a year-long trip before his wedding to Elizabeth. It was like reading a travel magazine.<br /><br />The tale is less a tale about science gone wrong, then a tale about revenge and lonliless. The created monster could just have easily been a child (illegimate child?) of Frankenstein and, if hating his father (instead of creator) done the same things. In fact, the creation aspect, the most famous aspect of the tale, seems to have been just tossed in for dramatic effect, almost as an after thought.
B000FBFN0Q|1.0|the main character is just too stupid to live. She is always lying and completely lacks self-control. I dont understand all the reviewers who actually liked the book. Saw the movie first, was ok. Now I realize it is alot better than the book because it was so different.
B003YUC2FE|1.0|This is a case of having a great idea but being too lazy to execute it and give the best product worthy of the word ultimate.  - blu-ray discs, check  - dvds, check  - digital codes, check  - toy box, sturdy cardboard box.  It's nice and for the price of the trilogy I won't complain    what I will complain about is the fact that the disc are not in jewel cases or circular plastic cases.  The discs are placed in a piece of black foam.  Nothing really special, just slots in the foam for each and every discs.  You know what this is called?  It's called lazy production value.    don't buy this product, you are better off just buying a combo pack sometime down the line.  The Mediocre Toy Story Collection is not worth your money and is not worthy of these great films
0812973992|1.0|I am about 2/3 of the way through this book and I don't think I can bring myself to finish it.  The author is trying to use words in new ways to convey an impression of what he is describing but the words just don't work as intended.  Too many wrong notes are struck.    Any of the sections dealing with computers are complete fantasy and don't lend much authenticity to the rest of his writing.  If he can't be bothered to find out about computers than what does he know about painters, war veterans, hookers and priests?
1416562605|4.0|As someone who has spent more time in Delhi than Adiga, I will start by saying that the book will be liked much more by a western reader than Indians themselves.   Its a story  of hopelessness and misery that Indians see everyday and choose to look away. So when a novel like this one comes along it amounts to exposure of the elite Indian class in ways that make them very uncomfortable. This is evident from some of the bad reviews and the attached comments.     I will say that I was more impressed by the authenticity of Adiga's writing and the underlying reality we see in India, than by his command of the English language. I can say that the story and settings are very real. I was not impressed by the descriptions and clichéd phrases, but lets keep in mind that the book is written as a narrative seen by the eyes of protagonist who is not known for his literary cred.     For me its important that the western world sees this side of India especially because its not something we see in media. Its a country with nearly 1.3+ Billion people in a space about 1/3 the size of US with more than 60% of the population living on less than $2/day. Thats the life where most of the people like car drivers come from.            While glorifying a murder as emancipation makes me feel uncomfortable, there will not be many drivers in India reading this book getting ideas of their own.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Es notable el nivel de humor, alegría y emoción (hasta alguna lágrima en el final de la película) que logra una cinta de animación enfocada básicamente para niños.    Una historia fascinante en la que comienza con una escena de acción a la altura de los grandes clásicos del cine (y de hecho creo que debe ser un homenaje a alguna otra película), luego continuamos parados en una escena del pasado y rápidamente pasamos al \\"presente\\", donde el protagonista (dueño de los juguetes) tiene 17 años y se prepara a abandonarlos.    De aquí en más toda una serie de aventuras en las que siempre se vislumbra esa valoración de la amistad entre este grupo de juguetes.    La aparición de decenas de juguetes nuevos, incluyendo a Barbie y a Ken que realmente son una delicia. Niños de una guardería que les hacen la vida imposible y algún que otro nuevo juguete que hará el papel de malvado.    Si tienen niños es una obligación y si no los tienen no se priven de disfrutarla por \\"ser adultos\\"    spoiler:  Cerca del final me impresionó muchísimo una escena donde basándose en un camión de basura y un triturador de desechos logran una escena de acción realmente increíble.    Un final con drama, emoción, ternura y al terminar la película varias escenas \\"extras\\" que son hilarantes y refrescantes.
B0002BO0HG|5.0|I first heard a track of this CD as background to an episode of the TV series \\"Bones\\".  I searched the internet,found the name of the disc and purchased it immediately.  I have played every track many times and now bore my friends constantly praising the unique quality of this performer and his rich, haunting voice.  A great disc!
1401323952|5.0|After watching Nigella on the Today Show, I wanted to try one of her recipes and so I sent for her books.  I have had great pleasure in trying many of her recipes and have enjoyed them all.  I also shared my purchases with my very talented Granddaughter who has risen to the top cook in the family dynasty.    Nigella is a no nonsense cook who looks for quality and doability when she produces her recipes for the cookbooks.  I have enjoyed many of them.    Fotunately, I have always used Amazon for my books and they came through as usual
B003UERZ88|5.0|Rob and his band put together an excellent effort. This CD is diverse, hard and the songwriting is very good. My first immediate impression was that I heard shades of the Judas Priest Halford in \\"Hell Razor\\" (\\"Stained Class\\") and \\"The Mower\\" (\\"Painkiller\\") and also the present intense, passionate Rob Halford. All of this seemed really cool to me: Like I was hearing three classic periods of Rob's career. Some slow, southern slide guitar and blues on \\"Till the Day I Die\\" surprised me. There are some really cool guitar riffs, they shy away from the maniacal, long, ear-piercing, go-nowhere guitar solos (ie. \\"Resurrection\\"). The band is now super tight, End-of-the-World pounding drums, and the songs are based on a lot of power chords with cool hooks. Rob's voice does so much on this CD with more tones than I've ever heard from his voice and an incredible voice range. \\"Matador\\" is the kind of song you don't hear often, it's a folk song with Spanish flavor put to heavy chunky guitars and reminded me of \\"You've got another thing comin'\\" or \\"Living after midnight\\". This is going to be a classic Halford CD. It is very damn good for a guy who's been banging away at it for 40 years. He should be proud of it. This sounds pretty damn good in good car audio, too.
B000059GEI|5.0|Well made musical starring Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Donald O'Connor, Marilyn Monroe and Mitzi Gaynor.  Although Marilyn is the headliner, Mitzi steals the show. Very entertaining and the big show numbers are real show stoppers.  Would highly recommend.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|GReat movie, although te price was a little high, amazon gaveme later a 5 usd credit after they decided to lower the price two days after the product release. Hopefully next time they give lower price to people that pre-order items.

030726999X|4.0|I almost cried when I finished the last page of this trilogy. I slowed down my reading to a snail's pace to drag out the last few paragraphs knowing that I'd never read another word about Lisbeth or the rest of the wonderful cast of characters created by Stieg Larsson in three fantastic novels that captivated and enthralled me. I was left thinking that there was unfinished business here and that I would always wonder what happened after...<br /><br />This book, the third in the [[ASIN:0307594777 Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Bundle: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]] takes up immediately where [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]] ended -- Lisbeth is mortally wounded and about to undergo surgery for the gunshot into her brain. Her eventual recovery and days spent in hospital are not wasted -- she is always planning her revenge and will accept no compromises in her quest for justice, finally, after years of being a persecuted victim. The reader is drawn into the story quickly and roots for Lisbeth's triumph over her oppressors and wishes her to overcome all the obstacles that have been placed in front of her. No capitulation. She's one of the most interesting heroines in suspense fiction, or perhaps such a finely developed idiosyncratic character has not previously been found in any genre lately! I was at times annoyed by her stoic and total refusal to engage with those who tried to help her as well as to be moved with pity or admiration for the way she dealt with the injustice served her.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series and wish I could have the pleasure of reading yet another story involving Lisbeth Salander. This final novel in the trilogy brought some closure to her story, but there were still some unanswered questions that I believe I will ponder for some time.
0393325172|5.0|I've read all but three of the 18-19 books in this splendid series. But it was this first one, Master and Commander, that captured me. I don't sail, but there I was on a big ship, with a great bow wave, and the white clouds circling over head as miles and miles of sun-bright ocean raced by. And then there was Jack. Yum! And Maturin. Acid wit. What a pair.  I laughed and laughed....and loved a life I cannot know. Kudos to O'Brian, book after book after book.
0596806027|4.0|HTML5: Up and Running by Mark Pilgrim comprehensively begins with a discussion of the ratification process (more interesting than one would expect and enlightening as to why many current misconceptions regarding the standard exist). The book then breaks down each area of interest from the highly discussed (web video) to the obscure (microdata). The examples are concise and understandable. There's also a considerable effort demonstrated in highlighting subtle \\"gotchas\\" that otherwise might be glossed over. And, to Mark Pilgrim's credit, he injects just enough humor over the course of the book to keep the content from becoming too dry. It's a great read and I've got pages full of notes from it for things I need to be using right now.<br /><br />If I did have a concern with HTML5: Up and Running it has to with how gracefully it will age. Tech references already have a notoriously short shelf life. HTML5, at this still highly fluid stage, would seem to only exacerbate the problem. For example, having numerous tables highlighting which browsers currently offer support for the various features is great. However, I'm not sure if I'll be dealing with the same browsers next month, let alone next year.<br /><br />But that's a minor quibble. HTML5: Up and Running is a great introduction for developers wondering just how to incorporate HTML5 with their current practices. Highly recommended.
B003YUC2FE|1.0|I pre-ordered, since I loved the first movie as a child, and my wife, child and I loved the 3rd movie this summer (his recent birthday party was Toy Story themed). However, I want to know, what gives?!? These are children's movies, and they don't give better protection than the discs sitting in foam in a cardboard box? No individual protection, so this set will have to stay out of my child's reach, or I know I'll find an assortment of discs lying around my living room floor. The foam appears to have been made quite lazily, as a couple of the discs don't even sit right. It would've also been nicer if they had either labelled the area where each disc goes or staggered them differently. With the small spacing between discs, it's difficult to select a disc without smudging the others around it, at least if you have fat fingers like yours truly. Also, for an \\"ultimate\\" edition, there appears to be a severe lack of special features discs. I guess this is why the price dropped several times before release? I'm pretty sure this is the worst Pixar product I've seen...
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|They're not like the rest.  First of all, I love this group (duo? crew?). Not just their music, which is amazing and unique, but their personalities and the way they present themselves.  Ninja is an arrogant, no-nonsense rapper from the streets of South Africa. But he's also pretty wise and caring. His main article of clothing is a pair of boxers. He may or may not still live with his parents. Yo-Landi is short and sweet, with an iconic hair-style and an affinity for rats. They both claim they're \\"gangsta\\" and it's almost funny to watch to the untrained eye. Are they really this way? Are they performance artists putting on a show? Hearing their earlier group under the name \\"MaxnormalTv\\", it's a bit hard to tell who they truly are.  I'm not sure which answer I'd like more, but it doesn't really matter. I'm more than happy to go along with it.  Die Antwoord makes popular music today seem boring and typical. Everything Die Antwoord sings about is creative, random, just plain fun, and most have real personal meanings behind them which are usually surprising and interesting.  I've found that if someone doesn't like them at first, should they listen just a few more times, they'll find themselves loving every minute of it.  Not everyone is going to enjoy them, of course, but I'm personally glad they're around.  As far as this CD goes, I would've liked to have seen a few more songs on here, and I'm especially annoyed that they changed the CD release of \\"Evil Boy\\" for the worse.  Over all, it's a great CD for the price and they're a fantastic group.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen...  That's why I bought it...  It arrived quickly...  I will be ordering again in the near future...
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I just watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on BD last night and the transfer is beautiful I mean really what I'd expected from BD all along. Often movies I'd really wanted to see in that format under whelmed, but with this one whoa! Its crispness just grabs your attention throughout and it is a real pleasure from start to finish. I promise you, you will not be satisfied with any other version once you've seen this in BD. My wife kept remarking that \\"this I can watch over and over\\". I agree.
B004A9F9ZI|4.0|Although it starts off kind of slow, it does pick up.  From what i watched it is a very interesting adaptation of the Zombie flicks that arent all about gore.  Some of the parts are a little graphic, might not be the best for young kids but all in all a good show!!!!  Can't wait for more.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|In a very noisy location, (many motors, generators, automobiles & trucks), this braided shielded HDMI connector Cable has done the job.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Joe Satriani storms back to his former great form with BLACK SWANS & WORMHOLE WIZARDS.  Returning to the formula that made [[ASIN:B000002BWH Extremist]], [[ASIN:B00000JQFM Surfing With the Alien]], and [[ASIN:B000002BWJ Time Machine]] such great albums, Satriani delivers a winner with great songwriting, crisp and clear production, and of course, awesome guitars.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Satriani's work and you like rock guitar, you're in for a treat.  This man can make his axe SING, almost literally.  The lyrical strength of his melodies and delivery make human vocals superfluous.  While Satriani's obviously still got the chops to shred, he doesn't spend time needlessly noodling around ludicrous solos.  Every note seems to have a purpose and fit into the song's bigger picture.  This makes his soloing ever more impressive to me than those of the \\"speed kings\\" of guitar.  Joe is fast, but he's also a good composer and on this album he puts on a clinic of the various guitar voices that he can evoke.<br /><br />The multi-layered sound of this album is a blast to behold, and honestly, should be enjoyed in CD format.  If you download (or rip) MP3s of this album, you'll miss out on the fullness of the sonic experience that he's presenting.  For example, on Pyrrhic Victoria, the sheer number of overdubs required to get the fat texture you'll hear on the CD is largely lost, even when ripping the CD at 320K.  (I tried it, just to make sure.  You'll still enjoy the bulk of the music, melodies, bass, etc...  You do, however, miss out on a good deal of sonic nuance that gets lost in the compression.)  If you're intending to download the album (and I can't talk you into the CD), please don't let me discourage you from doing so.  You're still in for a treat.  I just don't want you to miss out on the benefits of a really crisply produced album.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Eric Johnson, or Steve Vai, please do yourself the favor of picking up this album.  If you like melodic rock-n-roll and don't mind a guy/group to stray into a few different musical styles (ie: World Music on \\"The Golden Room\\", or almost spiritual blues on \\"Littleworth Lane\\"), then you're also destined to enjoy BLACK SWANS & WORMHOLE WIZARDS.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Check it out.  It comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Top Tracks (IMHO):  Dream Song - An atmospheric nod-along Satch classic that's subdued but not for a second boring; and Pyrrhic Victoria - Starts off bluesy with a strong lyrical melody line and is the musical equivalent of a 5-layer burrito, then it elevates into the chorus and takes off with soaring intensity.ike melodic rock-n-roll and don't mind a guy/group to stray into a few different musical styles (ie: World Music on \\"The Golden Room\\", or almost spiritual blues on \\"Littleworth Lane\\"), then you're also destined to enjoy BLACK SWANS & WORMHOLE WIZARDS.

1601251505|5.0|It is difficult to build on a roleplaying system. Having attempted on multiple occasions to create something that was like Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 but without all of its numerous flaws, I know where the pitfalls are, where the difficulties lay in creating a system based off of it. Pathfinder, without a doubt, is far superior to that which I was trying to create. Indeed, Pathfinder beats D&D at its own game. Rather than throwing out the 3.5 system (as the people over at Wizards have done for D&D 4.0), the gents at Paizo took it upon themselves to improve the system they and so many others had come to simultaneously love and hate. Pathfinder, without a doubt, has removed this hate. The core races are all there; the core classes are all there - but be ready for some pleasant surprises! They took a cracked system and they mended it, tweaked it, and made it whole. While Pathfinder still has the limitations of a roleplaying system requiring more than one type of die (complicated rules; steeper learning curve than systems utilized in games like Over the Edge or Call of Cthulhu), it is far from the hot mess that was D&D 3.5 (and I won't even BEGIN to compare it to 3.0 or earlier). Pathfinder is wonderful. The system is simplified, the classes have all undergone changes for the better, and the weapon and spell sections are very, very complete. This also contains an entire section just for the Game Master - it's like buying two d&d books for the price of one. All in all, this is a wonderful improvement on a good system, and I am quite satisfied in the purchase.

B001H3TUZK|5.0|This album is amazing. It is from start to finish, a pure genius construction. Every song flows from one to another. The sound is perfect, the picture discs look phenomenal and of course, the album itself is fantastic.    Reading the other reviews, i count myself extremely lucky that i haven't had the same white noise/crackling problems. I'm sure, if they were to have the appropriate quality discs like i have, they would be as satisfied as I am.
B003Y8YXH6|3.0|The original \\"Double Fantasy\\" was John Lennon's complete and fulfilled creative vision...the tragedy happened after it was released.  So why do a new version now, which is less than the original?  This is not a \\"Let it Be...Naked\\" situation, where the Beatles had no control over what originally was put out.  We have heard John's version and it is great!  The \\"stripped down\\" version here just sounds like outtakes and unfinished product.  It is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the work.  As far as the re-mixed original, well it sounds pretty good, hence 3 stars for the overall package.

B000FGGE7C|4.0|This is a comic book movie. And VERY GOOD. All you wanna be film critics are ridiculous. This is a very enjoyable, fast action, eye candy movie with cool film effects. The film has a blended look of reality and anime. The plot of good and bad and the discovery of one's own morale all in a futuristic setting make for a good fantasy movie. It is a fun and exciting flick.

I already have the first blu ray Avatar, and will wait until the 3D version comes out, but I refuse to buy a Panasonic TV just to get the 3D Avatar right now. I find it unethical that these studios double and now triple dip to get us to buy the same movie more then once. Does their greed know no bounds?
B00275EHJQ|4.0|I can't say enough about how cute this movie is and Pixar has always had a gift for making movies just like this. New characters are introduced and are just as entertaining as the original characters. Behind the scenes and special features are nice to watch as well. A movie short called Day and Night is very cute and for some of us that are up there in age, we will recognise the characters in the short film.<br />The story basically is, Andy is grown up and going to college. The toys have been donated to a nursery. The toys just want to get back to Andy but Lots-o-Huggin the bear tries to explain to them that they were given up and should stay. He also tries to convince the toys that they will never be without a kid to play with. Once one group of kids leaves, another group comes in. But..we all know, the toys just want to go home.<br />An interesting twist where the toys find Buzz's \\"Spanish mode\\" is very entertaining. You don't have to understand Spanish to enjoy this part of the movie. In the behind the scenes, the actor who takes over for the Spanish parts explains his inspiration for his performance and it is well done.<br />The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the story has been told a thousand times. The obsticles they face, perils and enemies that rise up are the same old obsticles we've seen before. There is no big twist ending but it still is a typical Pixar ending. This is not so much a bad thing, just..So-so.<br />I still recommend buying this for your collection.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This inspiring true story of Temple Grandin's life is a \\"must see\\" for all people interested in autism.  From her early life, through her learning to cope with being different, her success in gaining education and self-awareness, through her triumph in the field of animal science, and her determination to giving hope and empowerment to others on the autism spectrum, Dr. Grandin's life blazes a trail that gives hope and motivation to everyone.<br /><br />As a grandparent of an autistic child, I took heart in Temple Grandin's story.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I can't believe I purchased this months and months ago and it sat next to my DVD player unused. I put it in this weekend and ended up watching it twice. I love this DVD! So many classics are performed possibly better than you would hear on the cd's and the supporting band is excellent. There just isn't much more to say. If you can download a sample of the music, go for it. This is a must have DVD for blues/Rock, Clapton or Winwood fans!

B001OQCV2E|2.0|This is no award-winning movie, with strengths in acting or story or the like.  It's essentially the latest \\"stuff blowing up\\" movie by Roland Emmerich, who makes these movies regularly, for money.<br /><br />However, something about this movie makes it stand out particularly dreadfully from most others of the same genre.  The introductory sequence of LA breaking apart is full of shots of people in cars as their cars are destroyed, people being killed as stuff knocks them around, and shots of huge skyscrapers crumbling and tumbling, and quick shots of people inside the wreckage, clinging to things helplessly.<br /><br />It's almost impossible for me to watch.  It's too traumatizing, too sickening, and cannot be properly tempered by the fact that it's all just CGI fiction.  The fact is, the shots of people bear a far too striking resemblence to the scenes from September 11th 2001, where we saw people jumping out of the towers to their inevitable deaths.<br /><br />But enough of that.  On the brighter side, as I've noticed with \\"10,000 BC\\", Roland Emmerich is very good with broader storylines, and very bad with smaller storylines involving individual people.  The concept of the Arks and everything after the initial \\"stuff blowing up\\" parts are decent enough, but the individual characters are one-dimensional archetypes you've seen in pretty much all his movies and others.<br /><br />Oliver Platt's character is the stereotypical \\"bad guy\\" because he's the voice of reason, taken to the extreme of cold logic and rationality at the expense of human lives---the Superego.  He justifies the fact that the majority of those being saved in the Arks are the very rich, because without their money supporting it, the project would never have gotten started.  There's Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, the opposite of him, the Id, who mopes constantly and contradicts the \\"bad guy\\" with emotion and humanity.  There's the bumbling fat foreign guy and his trophy wife, whom he betrays and leaves for dead, only to be betrayed in turn by her later on.  There's the dorky science guy, played in the exact same vein as Dr. Phlox from Star Trek Enterprise (obviously it's the same actor) by John Billingsley<br /><br />Amazingly (for a movie like this) there are inklings of contradictions in some characters---tendencies for them to act outside of their archetypes, but these are few and far between.  Speaking of which, plenty of dialogue is stupid and cliche'd, like \\"who would have thought the crazies with the cardboard signs would be right?\\" and the scenes not involving the Arks or the \\"stuff blowing up\\" is largely boring and filler.<br /><br />Amazingly again, just a few superficial changes, particularly involving characterization, would have made this movie uniquely different from others of the same genre, and probably worth 3 or 4 stars out of 5.

While I have always thought the LP sounds Just fine the way JOHN & YOKO Released it Christmas 1980 this version is just so different and does have that Live In The Studio Sound Yoko was shooting for.

0500515328|3.0|The book's text has some major errors in it. Maria was the daughter who left Tobolsk with her parents, journeying on to Ekaterinberg. They then waited for Alexis (the Tsarevitch) and his three sisters, (Anastasia, Olga, and Tatiana) to follow with the rest of the Imperial household. Being an executive director of a history museum, my opinion is that someone with a historical background on the Romanovs should have proofed the text for the author before the book was sent to the publishers. However, the photos of the jewels are undeniably beautiful, and the tasteful design of the book's pages are to be commended. The photographer definitely used all the talents in his possession in conveying the breathtaking beauty of these wonderful, one of a kind, historic artifacts. The pics of the family are really wonderful....bringing to life the history of the tragic family they were connected with.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|This album is the follow up to Merry Christmas released in 1994 and it is just as good! Mariah opens this album with an instrumental version of Santa Clause is Coming to town and it leads us to her New Single \\"Oh Santa\\", she wrote this song and it is full of happy feelings and memories.  The Jazzy drumline chorus and hand clapping instantly put me in a mood to celebrate. Trust me, like \\"all I want for christmas is you\\" this song will put you in a good mood! Another original song she wrote for this album is \\"Christmas time is in the air again\\" and it is a throw back to the 40's and 50's style of orchestrated music.  Her voice is so amazing, she sing's it ala Net King Cole, it will make you feel warm and fuzzy.  The third original song written by her is \\"One Child\\", this takes you to church and back, the children background vocals complement her amazing voice.  Very spiritual, you will get goose bumps while hearing this song!  Her duet with her mother Patricia carey is amazing, if you've never appreciated Mariah's amazing vocal range before, you definitely will after listening to this song....The live version of 'O Holy Night' is beyond awesome, I'm glad she included it in here.  The extra festive Version of \\"All I want for Christmas is you\\", like the original, puts me in such a good mood-because of its lyrics and playful music. The closing song \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" Hapy new year baby is sooooo awesome, she starts it out with just a piano and her powerful full voice, but after the countdown 10 through 1, the dance music kicks in and the party begins. I will be playing this on repeat at my new years party, it's that good...in the middle she ad libs \\"does anybody really know the words\\" and laughs adding \\"might as well sing along\\" which of course you will!!!!     Buy it, you will love it as much as I do!!!!
B00386OWUC|1.0|This is a movie about cruelty in all its aspects. It is a depressing movie to sit through. There are so many characters that it is hard to follow what is going on with whom. Worse yet, the ending is abrupt and disjointed. It is like they suddenly ran out of budget or something and just ended the movie, pronto, leaving me saying, \\"Huh?\\" I often watch indie and foreign films so I am used to them, but White Ribbon is highly over-rated. I am very sorry I bought this, I should have rented it first from NetFlix.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag easily compares to other bags costing twice as much. I was pleasantly surprised at the size and the quality of construction when it arrived. This is a terrific bargain.
B003Y8YXH6|2.0|It is true that throughout the latter part of his solo career, starting with Mind Games, John over-multitracked his vocals and buried them in layers of reverb, often also pushing them down in the mix as well. This reached its nadir on Walls and Bridges, but the tendency was still markedly present on Double Fantasy. Still and all, I've loved his songs on Double Fantasy ever since the album came out, and cordially tolerated most of Yoko's. It was a stroke of genius on her part to remix his songs to focus on the vocals and drop many of the production embellishments; it's great to hear his voice so clear, strong and present. However, the same treatment applied to Yoko's numbers simply reveals further the utter lack of talent that layers of studio production were able to mask on Double Fantasy's original release. This \\"stripped\\" version is a compelling curiosity but it in no way displaces the original. John was not just a singer-songwriter; he was a producer, too, and the way Double Fantasy sounds in its original state is what he intended, a completed work of art with a certain sound.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Absolutely beautiful movie!  Jacques Mayol discusses the movie in his book \\"Homo Delphinus\\".  His relationship with Enzo was not contentious, but was a relationship based on respect of one another.  This part of the movie was dramatized and was fiction.  Jacques Mayol was truly an amazing man that had a special connection to the sea.  For those of us who also feel a connection to the sea, you will easily identify with Jacques and his need to go back again and again.  Its a spiritual experience that is so intimate and a part of some people and even more so  in the real Jacques.
0061433047|5.0|Absolutely amazing! I love the Tiffany Aching books, but this is the best yet.  I have read every book Pratchett has written, and this is definitely in my top three.  Ignore the few negative reviews and read it!  You won't regret it.
B003UYUR10|5.0|As usual, Disney continues to make good quality movies and Prince of Persia:The Sands of Time is solid proof of that. All of the acting is superb and the story is one that follows the 1001 Arabian Nights genure. We all enjoyed this movie and can watch it 100 times and see something new we didn't notice before.  I give this one a 5 star rating in all categories.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|My impression of this film was that it would be an edgy, intelligent take on a scientific issue with thrilling, and frightening, possibilities.  I read several reviews, both positive and negative, and decided that this was exactly the kind of sci-fi that I was looking for on this stormy night.     Boy was I wrong. So many people wrote that it was a film that only an \\"intelligent viewer\\" would \\"get\\" and, honestly, that was the attraction. Here are some examples of how \\"smart\\" and \\"edgy\\" this movie is: (Don't worry about SPOILERS - I couldn't finish it)    This mutant creature is a combination of slug, frog, chicken (I think), fish, a bunch of other things that somehow contributed a venomous tail and an extremely hemispheric skull and these top-notch biochemical engineers deemed it necessary to dress it up in a little girls dress. There is no mention of reproductive organs but with this genetic gumbo I can't see why it would possess any sort of human understanding of gender.  Not just that they call it \\"her\\" but the li'l blue dress wasn't even appropriate for a human girl - unless she is having tea with her governess and Queen Victoria. I guess the director assumed I wouldn't understand that it was a female without a bunch of overblown frills and silk on its grey and embryonic flesh.    Oh - and then there are these world-class, elite biochemical genetic engineers working at the magnus ultra of all gene-splicing facilities - However, this particular cutting-edge research facility is lit up with nightclubby moodlighting and the research fellows are all ultra-hipsters wearin' their goin'out clothes and their hair scruffed juuuuust right (for the lighting in the lab).  When Adrian Brody kicks up his feet and stretches out his skinny jeans while noshing on some take-out Chinese with chopsticks (Of course. Of course chopsticks: he's cool) and he's right in the lab next to the next genesis of Science, well, you know these are not your ordinary biochemical geneticists.  In fact:  If you are slightly smarter than a fifth-grader, you know that these are not scientists at all but actors embarrassed with the contract they got themselves into.    Oh yea! - At one point the mutant \\"child\\" spells out a word using scrabble tiles.  \\"She's making connections!\\" the solitary female researcher exclaims.  To whom did she exclaim this? Nobody else was in the room.  She exclaimed it to me, the viewer, because, despite the fact that I just saw what she did, whoever made this movie figured that if I had been watching it this long then I'm probably too stupid to process basic information without on-screen explanations.     Anyway, that's just a short sampling. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever watched.  Combine the fashion-lighting of \\"CSI\\" with the incoherent pseudoscience of \\"THe X-files\\" and gear it for an MTV-level intellect and you've got \\"Splice\\".
0425220931|5.0|Not much else to say that hasn't already been said.  Just another vote for 5 stars.  I recommend the audio version of the book as its great to hear Victor narrate it ([...] -- a branch of amazon.com) along with the other characters voices, music & sound effects.    This is an experiential journey that is an easy read (or listen) and it kept me constantly engaged.  There are so many gems in this abundant offering!!!     If you love music, love life, and want to use music as a vehicle to connect, inspire, enhance, e-mote, and empower your fellow humans, then this is for you.

0345505387|1.0|I have read every book in the Outlander series, plus some of the Lord John books. Although I don't love everything she does as a writer, Gabaldon is undeniably entertaining.<br /><br />I should admit that I've never been attracted to graphic novels, so perhaps that explains a lot of the problems I have with this publication.  But I don't think that's all of it.<br /><br />First of all, Gabaldon's greatest strength is her language and dialogue, which The Exile can't really leverage.  Secondly, I know we all have different ideas about what these characters look like, but this visual reality bears zero resemblance to the one on my own personal silver screen when I'm reading her stories. If this resembles what Gabaldon sees in *her* head, and if the Outlander stories are ever made into a movie or miniseries, I sincerely hope she is removed altogether from the casting and visual process, because it will end up as a massive disappointment.  (perhaps in the way Pillars of the Earth was; I never read the book but the series clearly could have been much, much better despite the valiant efforts of many good actors.)<br /><br />Finally, the art is just Not Very Good. It is aesthetically unappealing and kind of a confused jumble of styles, like comic art by committee.  Many of the characters look alike and are hard to identify from frame to frame, and as mentioned are badly imagined. It reminds me of some very poorly drawn and awkwardly written Christian \\"comic books\\" given to me by a pious relative hoping to save my soul as a kid, which had the side effect for me of making the sexual content alarming.  And that's another area where The Exile does no justice to Gabaldon's stories, in which she usually makes the sex scenes worth reading.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed seeing the story she is trying to convey here--being the early events of the book as seen from the perspective of the 18th-century inhabitants, especially Jamie--actually written out as a side project, or shown to us another way in future stories.  But the visual aids did it no favors and the extreme compression of what could have been actual Gabaldon storytelling makes it a pointless enterprise, and no doubt an expensive one to produce.<br /><br />My husband very sweetly surprised me with this, probably without looking inside. Whenever he sees something new from Gabaldon in the bookstore he usually picks it up for me, which is how I got the Lord John books.  I am now planning to give The Exile away along with the well-worn mass market paperbacks I have of the first few volumes.  Do Not Want.stories.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|Fans were nervous Mariah couldn't do it again, but from the first note to the last, the best-selling female singer of all time delivers the goods, both traditional and more \\"festive\\" in true Mariah style. An album that plays seamlessly through with her first Christmas album (I've tried it!), and one you'll enjoy for decades to come!
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|I've been reading the Walking Dead comics for quite some time now, and had always thought what a great movie or TV series it would make. And now, it has come to pass!<br />I was very skeptical at first though, when I heard AMC was doing the series. After watching the first episode, all I can say is I am totally blown away. A top notch production, and unbelievably graphic for a made for TV production. It's like the pages of the comic come to life (or is that unlife?). I enjoyed this very much, and am greatly looking forward to future episodes. Highly recommended!
B000026FOA|5.0|\\"Five Leaves Left\\" released in 1969 is the first of only three albums Nick Drake managed to get released in his short lifetime.<br /><br />Several of the album's lyrics suggests a delicate and fragile mind, which might ultimately have led to his untimely death in 1974.<br /><br />Musically Drake's music may at time appear a little reminiscent of Donovan's from the later 1960s. In Drake's case, though, there are strong inspiration from classical music, which is hardly the case with Donovan.<br /><br />The album contains several of Drake's best and most beloved songs. Among them \\"Cello Song,\\" \\"Time Has Told Me,\\" \\"Way to Blue\\" and \\"Thoughts of Mary Jane\\"<br /><br />The Instrumentation is in most cases, sparse, with Drake's beautiful acoustic guitar as the turning point.<br /><br />On the opening track \\"Time Has Told Me,\\" one may recognize Richard Thompson's characteristic electric guitar and the sound of this number is slightly reminiscent of early Fairport Convention. Otherwise, it's Danny Thompson (Pentangle) who appears most frequently on the record. Also Strings-arranger Robert Kirby has put a strong stamp on several of the album's key tracks, \\"Way to Blue\\" Day is Done \\", The Thoughts of Mary Jane\\" and \\"Fruit Tree\\".<br /><br />Summed up this is very fine album that wins for each new listen. If you are not familiar with Drake's music in advance, however, I recommend that you start with the sequel \\"Bryter Layter\\", which is, without being lightweight at all, probably easier to fall for.
B0000009SM|5.0|Wow, One Size Fits All just might be the *ultimate* Frank Zappa experience!  You're treated to a TON of exciting musical ideas, instrumental chops that will leave you begging for more, guitar soloing that destroys most of the competition out there, and songwriting that's just top-notch and superb.      Yup, this is probably the best Zappa album ever.  Though I *am* partial to Over-Nite Sensation, so depending how I feel, I might choose that album over this one, but it's honestly WAY too close to call.    \\"Inca Roads\\" is exactly what makes Zappa such a fascinating musician.  So many unpredictable shifts in direction, this song goes through a TON of adventurous territory.  The vocal melody in the beginning resembles the progressive rock band Camel quite a bit, and it leads way to these memorable Asian-sounding instrumental sections immediately before morphing into one of the best guitar jams I've ever heard.      What makes the jam so good, you ask?  It starts off on a really emotionally moving slow-paced start for a couple minutes until it eventually speeds up and just rocks the house down.  I absolutely love it.  At the songs conclusion you're treated to a pretty good keyboard solo.  What a song!!    \\"Sofa No. 1\\" almost sounds like anthemic 80's rock- an instrumental delight, the guitar playing here is fantastic, and \\"Sofa No. 2\\" is almost as good with the German-like vocal melody sung over the same exact notes heard from \\"Sofa No. 1\\".   What a WEIRD decision to add those particular kind of vocals for the second song!  It's oddly emotional, memorable, and addicting.      Whatever experiments Zappa tried seemed to *always* work back in the early 70's, and these two particular songs are a perfect example of experimenting done intelligently and correctly.    My favorite guitar playing on the entire album is featured in the middle of \\"Po-Jama People\\".  It's *extremely* intense and only lets up in order to return to the original lounge-like vocal melody that began the song.  Such a great track.    The second half of One Size Fits All actually seems somewhat normal in comparison to the first half.  \\"Florentine Pogen\\" contains a wonderful and instantly likeable vocal melody.  This vocal melody is not nearly as challenging as most of Zappa's material.  It's surprising to me personally, but then...    \\"Andy\\" contains soulful vocals and, once again, it's a VERY easy track to get into.  This track definitely sounds like it was influenced by the soul genre, and it shows in all its highly melodic glory.  \\"San Ber'dino\\" feels like a monster-heavy blues rocker with VERY funny lyrics.  Some of the funniest lyrics I've ever heard from a Zappa album in fact.  I was laughing my buns off last night!       No doubt about it- one of Frank Zappa's best albums.

Unfortunately for my reading, I'm older and don't have the time to read as much as I use to, but this book has reminded me how fun it can be. Characters are introduced at a good pace, and I find myself thinking about the different plot lines associated with them even after I'm done reading. The system of magic is setting up nicely and isn't overused. I'm quite excited to see where it goes from here.
044654759X|5.0|I don't even know where to begin on how much I loved this book! I finished reading it 4 days ago and I still can't stop thinking about how well written it was and what an amazing book it is!!! The next book I ordered is \\"The Choice\\" which I heard is also really good :) LOVE YOU SPARKS!!! You truly are talented.
B003YUC2FE|2.0|The disappointment in this item for me was that it was not clear what was on the 10th disc. I assumed since DVD is the most popular format that all the bonus features would be at least available for DVD. And this is not the case. Another disappointment was that there was no booklet at all which would have been nice. I should have done more research first instead of rushing into buying this product.

0385738757|5.0|After reading The Maze Runner by James Dashner earlier this year, it was inevitable that I would hurry to pick up The Scorch Trials.  Before doing so, however, I refreshed my memory with another read-through of The Maze Runner... and I think I liked it even more the second time around.<br /><br />With The Scorch Trials I found it easier to adapt to the world and the \\"variables\\" being thrown at Thomas and his crew, mostly because of how The Maze Runner had prepared me for them.  Dashner does a fantastic job of building the tension and then, just when it gets to the breaking point, throwing in something so random, so out of the blue, that the tension subsides and starts to build in another, different way.<br /><br />What makes The Scorch Trials so different from The Maze Runner is - now that the kids know who WICKED is, they have a bit more knowledge of what is going on - but that still doesn't mean that this book will make complete sense to you, as it doesn't to them.  And that is what makes the book so much fun.<br /><br />There is plenty of action, plenty of excitement and I grew even more attached to these characters, these teenagers struggling in a world where hope seems so dead.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get my hands on the last book in this trilogy and next year cannot come soon enough.  I haven't felt this much anticipation for a book since Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins - and while the books are somewhat similar, I really appreciate the teamwork Dashner has chosen to implement in The Maze Runner trilogy and think he's doing a fantastic job of telling his story.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I ordered this because of the high reviews.  I found it a difficult read with so much incorrect grammar as it is told from a 5 year old boy's view.  I had to push myself to get to the end and was expecting a much more exciting ending.  I was hoping that was where the great reviews came from. Not a very exciting ending either.  Glad to have finished it.
B002R4K6AG|1.0|This is so bad its good.  I want to live in Bob Dylan's bubble.  I spin this with Twisted Sister's Christmas Album, they both capture the horror that Christmas is.
B003EYVXYG|1.0|Romero started the zombie genre that many of us know and love but his last two films have not been deserving of his name and have tarnished his zombie legacy like ali did his boxing legacy. I thought diary was pretty bad and a bad attempt at some blair witch/paranormal activity angle but it was almost watchable however I came very close to not even making it through survival of the dead. I could not have been more disappointed after getting excited upon seeing the words \\"dead\\" and \\"romero\\" on a dvd which conjured up memories of night/dawn/day of the dead and all the great nightmares that I had as a child and still have to this day (often after playing hours of a zombie video game). The only nightmare I got out of this one was the trauma of a child who didn't get their red rider bb gun for christmas, too bad romero didn't hide the real present from mom because I wanted to shoot my eye out.     The special effects were too far over the top and stupid that they detracted from an already bad movie. The story sucked. The directing needed some direction. The acting was an obomination. And there were just so many scenes that left me wondering \\"why this is in the movie\\". For instance, there is a scene where the token military lesbian is masterbating out in the open on a jeep and in front of one of her cohorts. I'm all for throwing in some totally unneccesary nudity, hot naked zombies are a1 in my book, but despite this girl being very attractive this scene wasn't even the least bit titillating. One can justify a scantily clad zombie who just happens to have her clothes torn in all the right places or even a sex scene where two people find a moment to forget about the pending doom around them but this scene just smelled of dirty old man. It was beyond stupid and perverted. Which epitomizes this movie, stupid and a perversion of the romero zombie movie. Why george, why?
B001DDCVCI|5.0|I must say I have never been a big JC fan but after purchasing this I can now say I am a true fan.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|As a big fan of the movie I waited a bit nervously to see the results of the latest restoration of the Sound of Music. Past restorations have fallen quite short, slapping this classic in the face with everything from horrible skin tones to seemingly \\"jumping\\" color palettes mid-shot.     It's truly breathtaking the images, clarity and vividness they were able to restore from not just the picture, but the audio as well. The small details that really come through now  let you get fully immersed in this film. Even the standard DVD included, while obviously not as sharp or stunning as the blu-ray, is a far better release then the last restoration.  This latest edition finally does the justice this classic film deserves.     Do yourself a favor and add this to your movie library.
B004AKCME8|4.0|Based on Kathryn Lasky's children's series ([[ASIN:0545172705 Guardians of Ga'hoole Complete Set, Books 1-15]]), The Legend of the Guardians: the Owls of Ga'hoole is an epic story of good and evil, bravery, betrayal and of doing what's right.<br /><br />Briefly, the story centers around Soren, a young barn owl living in the forest of Tyto, who is enraptured with the tales his father tells of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, the great warriors and protectors of the owl world who have passed into legend. When Soren and his brother Kludd are kidnapped and taken to a deep canyon where young owls are being \\"moon-blinked\\" into mindless slavery by the evil \\"Pure Ones\\", Soren escapes with another young owl and sets out to find the Guardians and plead for their help. Once they find the Guardians, a rescue is planned and the film climaxes with a soaring aerial battle between the Guardians and the Pure Ones.<br /><br />The plot is not new. Fans of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, among others, will recognize many of the story elements and several of the characters common to films and books based on the classic \\"Hero's Journey\\". So, the question becomes - have the filmmakers made this hero's journey one worth seeing? For me, the answer is \\"Yes\\". And that \\"yes\\" comes, in no small part, from how the film looks.<br /><br />Legend of the Guardians is so completely spectacular to look at that I found myself able to ignore some of the issues with the plotting and the script and just sit back and drown in the visual feast. The \\"scenery\\" throughout the entire film - so jaw-droppingly gorgeous in theaters - translates very well to the home screen and the animation looks superb on Blu-ray. The flying sequences are not quite as breathtaking here as they were on the big screen, but all-in-all I think the film has made a successful transition to home viewing. Certainly it remains incredibly beautiful and exciting to look at. I wish all animated films offered the same visual pleasure.<br /><br />Parents should be aware, though, that \\"animated\\" in this case does not translate into \\"kiddie-show\\". While there are moments of warmth and companionship and a few humorous bits, the film has a number of violent scenes and an overall intensity that might frighten or lessen the enjoyment of the under 8 crowd. I will volunteer, though, that my just under 8 year old granddaughter LOVED this film and didn't seem to find it too intense at all. So my age guesstimate might be a bit off. Since parents always know their own children and what they can handle far better than any reviewers do anyway, I offer the \\"8 and over\\" as a sort of jumping off point. :) I'll add, too, that the level of intensity I felt the film possessed on the big screen seemed somewhat lessened when I viewed the film at home.<br /><br />A few additional notes on the film:<br />* There are a lot of characters with unusual names. Unless viewers (kids OR adults) have read the books, they're probably not going to catch or remember them all in a first viewing.<br />* There are a few instances where the dialogue is difficult to understand.<br />* The score suits the film. In parts it incorporates the human voice, as Lord of the Rings did, to effectively evoke an emotional response in the viewer. On the other hand, the song \\"To the Sky\\" (credited to \\"Owl City\\" on the soundtrack CD) was, IMO, the film's most glaring misstep. The chipper tune felt so out of place it actually made me cringe.<br /><br />Some notes on the DVD (I bought the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy version):<br />I'll admit straight off that I am not a techy person, so my comments on the quality of the video can be taken with that in mind. That said, the Blu-ray picture clarity is wonderful, the colors vivid and the sound good. For me, all are completely satisfactory. Navigation is pretty straight-forward and didn't trip me up too often - something I'm thankful for and something I, unfortunately, can't say about all DVDs.<br />The film can be viewed in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese. Subtitles in those same languages are also offered.<br />Special features include:<br />* \\"True Guardians of the Earth\\": The animated character Digger & Rico Rodriguez (Modern Family) host a documentary about owls which presents interesting information in a kid-friendly style.<br />* Maximum \\"Kid\\" Mode - Explore the World of Ga'hoole\\": Soren and other cast members act as guides for this picture-in-picture style viewing of the film. Information is offered on animation and various aspects of filmmaking and storytelling. Well done. Should be particularly interesting to young people interested in behind the scenes stuff and the nuts and bolts of filmmaking. Also included is additional scientific information about owls, their anatomy and their habits.<br />* Legend of the Guardians: Armor up with Soren & Eglantine: Kids can mix and match different types of owl armor.<br />* Match the Owl Treats: A matching game.<br />* \\"Legend of the Guardians: Rise of the Guardians\\": A short film about the Pure Ones and the legendary Battle of the Ice Claws between Metalbeek and Lyze of Kiel.<br />* Looney Tunes \\"Fur of Flying\\": The Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon featured in theaters along with LOTG. (On the 3D version of this DVD, this cartoon is also in 3D.)<br />* Artwork Galleries: stills of some of the lovely artwork from the film.<br />* \\"To the Sky\\" music video by Owl City.<br /><br />For my granddaughter and me, this film was a winner and now that it's part of my home collection, I'm looking forward to sharing it with my other grandchildren over the next few years as they grow old enough to appreciate it. While the plot may be rather familiar, IMO it avoided coming across as tired or trite. That, along with the stunning look of the film, makes it easy for me to recommend it. And I do, happily.<br /><br />Enjoy!s in those same languages are also offered.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|I purchase this item for my Costume as a prop for Comic Con, and I was happy to get as fast as I did before the day I was supposed to get it. Sadly the item I had purchase was not the one on the picture that was shown and that really needs to be fix for future sales. It did not come with the wallet as explained in the Product Features or the Product Details. I am not sure why it would come with the UV pen to write with if they did not sale the wallet to go with it. Otherwise the Sonic Screwdriver itself seems fine I not really going to be playing with it but it dose serve for what I need it for.
B003H8WSLQ|5.0|When i heard Spanish Sahara last spring it blew me away. It's taken me a while to pick up the album since it came out but it lived up to every expectation i had. Less aggressive than it's predecessor [[ASIN:B0014DBZY2 Antidotes]], it's sounds now swirl around and engulf you in layers of music. Where Antidotes' jarring staccato guitar lines urged your feet to move, Total Life Forever's all about the tense build up, most evident on the afore mentioned Spanish Sahara (incidentally the best track on the album imo, and probably one of the best songs released this year).   The bands progression is evident here and I look foreward to whatever they do next with anticipation. In the meantime, what they've made here is a stunning album and not a weak track to be heard. Buy it. And go see them live; ridiculously good.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I felt like this was a great sequel. It ended with lots of questions and I am anxiously awaiting the next book.
B003JYOFIW|4.0|Growing up in the 80's and seeing these guys in concert, Im so glad they put out something new. Im always looking for bands that can capture the 80's sound. Well the Spud boys sound as good if not better now than they did. I love tracks 2 and 5, my favories, but the whole CD is pretty good. Enjoy.....long live 80's music and Devo...hope they tour again.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought the cable so I could hook my laptop to the TV and stream netflix.  It was so easy.  I plugged the cable into the TV, plugged the other end into the laptop and that was it.  It is also long enough to easily reach the coffee table for easy access to the laptop and it works great.
0316069485|1.0|I am a big Connelly fan. Probably couldn't be a bigger fan out there. I have read all the Bosch series and most of the others. This book was advertized a \\"Bosch book\\" by Amazon, and it's not even close. He is in the book as an investigator, but without the nice touchy Bosch stuff like the love for jazz, LA lights scenes the Bosch defiance ect. Bosch fans know what I mean. Very disappointed. It feels like someone else wrote it. No Bosch magic.
0312600844|3.0|I had read raving reviews about Freedom, and had my hopes up. It is not a bad book by any means, but it is a confusing one. Freedom is a smart novel, but without any endearing qualities. I was shocked to not care about the characters - in my opinion, this is the biggest problem with the book. I just didn't like anyone.<br /><br />Overall, the novel has a bleak tone and it suffers from lack of charm. It does succeed in discussing the profoundly problematic, American understanding of the concept of individualism, and what it means for human life. Franzen tackles big themes, and does it coherently, if somewhat coldly.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|It is rare for movies based on books to be as good as the books they're based on. It is even rarer for movies based on books to be better than the books. \\"Matilda\\" is one of these ultra-rarities. They added a whole bunch of stuff to the plot to make it movie-length, which is usually a recipe for disaster, but in this case they made such a fun story in the exact spirit of the book, that they actually improved on the story! And Mara Wilson... nobody could have fitted the Matilda role better, in my opinion.    There are so many good things to say about this story. It's fun for children, and there are many adults who can understand growing up as a nerd in a family full of Luddites, or at least be able to sympathize with having to deal with Luddites in their life. Ms. Trunchbull is also the perfect personification of an overbearing authority which is only out for its own needs and not for the needs of the people \\"beneath\\" that authority. The Trunchbull is exaggerated, but there are sadly far too many people in the education system who, like her, either don't like children or otherwise do not have the temperament or skills to be teaching children, a fact that always makes the ending a little bittersweet for me.    All in all, an excellent movie. I would give it 6 stars if I could.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Was worth watching,  Every Robin Hood movie is different.  This one is more of the story as to how he evolved.  I've always been a Robin Hood fan, from Errol Flynn to Richard Green to Kevin Costner to thus one plus several other adaptations in between.  I've enjoyed them all even Disney's.  If you have a couple hours, enjoy stories of that era, then by all means get this
B003HC8ITI|5.0|The movie itself is worth rewatching, especially for Tim Burton fans. This edition with film cells is a must have for die-hard fans.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I see no cause to add to the chorus of praise for the film itself, which is one of the most enjoyable films ever made. I simply want to mention that the Blu-Ray is stunning. The image is a shade darker than I remember it from the DVD presentations - but this doesn't look to me like artificially boosted contrast. It has a rich, cinematic appearance...full of deep, velvety blues. And the soundtrack. Bernard Herrmann is a complete collaborator here, as he was on Hitchcock's subsequent film, \\"Psycho,\\" and this Blu-Ray renders his stirring music gorgeously. Truly a magnificent presentation of a wonderful film.
B000LB7G00|2.0|A nice design for ergonomics and function,but it was DOA out-of-the-box. Also, it had been previously returned by someone else, as the packing seals were broken and the manual had hand-written notes in it...the notes complained about the problem of not working, which is the same problem I had also. I have used a similar the mouse before and it was nice for saving time.
0962477060|1.0|I purchased this book based on the many positive recommendations on Amazon's web site.  I have been playing guitar for over 40 years, in fits and starts, and just recently decided I wanted to increase my knowledge of the instrument, both in learning the construction of chords and learning to play lead lines and scales.    This book is obviously useful for many people, but I found it confusing and hard to follow.  All I can say is that it lacked the magic \\"switch\\" that I hoped would turn on the logic of the fretboard.  No \\"Oh, yeah, I got it\\" moment for me.      I wasn't looking for a \\"how to play\\" book...I basically know how to play.  I'm just going to keep looking for a better book that's not over my head.  In the meantime, it's being returned to Amazon.  Next time, I'll read more of the 1- and 2-star comments rather than all of the positive comments.
B002VPE1OS|5.0|Exactly what I ordered, simple packaging    this is a MATTE screen cover, just like those sold on eBay, BestBuy, etc. (not glossy)  The matte is of higher quality and better than glossy (according to most iPhone owners)    simple to put on, unless you have big fingers. But no harder or different than any competing screen protector.    Key is to smooth it out with a credit card as you press it against the screen
B0007939NO|5.0|Get away from the here and now to Brigadoon.  This is a classic movie that lets the viewer believe in fantasy for a little while.  Artists like Gene Kelly can move you to a song and a dance.  It will make your day.
0345505387|3.0|This type of book is not my taste.   It was okay as far as the story went.   The drawing of characters was uneven and Claire's face didn't look human.  But the author wanted Claire to look fairy like and she did.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|I received my box set in the mail from the Amazon UK site on Monday 11/1/2010. First off, I was thoroughly impressed with the picture quality & sound quality of Alien & Aliens. I may have been imagining something but I did not FIND the picutre quality of the 3rd & 4th films to be nearly as high definition in contrast to the work done on Alien & Aliens for the Blu-ray discs. Again, it may be my imagination or something with the UK version. I have had no issues using or working with the Blu-ray discs from The UK that I've purchased so far. I found the price to be lower than what this box set sells for on the US Amazon site. I also noticed the additional footage added to Alien 3 when viewing. That was almost an entirely different feel for the film I have seen in Theathres years ago, VHS & cable.<br /><br />I am happy to see this finally on Blu-ray
B001E45XT4|3.0|To preface this review I'm letting you know now that I have not owned a gaming headset before. I only have some experience using other people's headsets.    The headset came packaged in those impossible to open clear plastic casings (the ones for kids toys and stuff). When I got it open I was surprised at how sturdy the plastic was. It was definitely a nice touch seeing as how I spent under 30 bucks for it. The actual headset does fit a little tight. The ear pads are kind of a soft velvety material as opposed to a pleather material. I think I would've preferred the pleather. The comfort level is mediocre. The tightness of the headset does make it seem less comfortable otherwise I would have no problem with it. I have smaller ears so the heat of the ear pads is not an issue but the textured ear pads aren't necessarily the greatest. Lengthening the earpieces does help with the tightness of the headset, but it is still not the best solution.    The only problem I have with the actual use of the headset is that the mic needs to be boosted quite a bit. In all my programs I have the mic boost near max to hear it at a comfortable and useful level.
B002JVWR4A|3.0|really happy that i got the product but very dissapointed about how long it took I paid the extra for it to arrive with in 2days which cost more then the iten its self and it took 9 days to arrive very very dissapointed in that
0762412992|2.0|Charles Dickens was noted for his beautiful descriptions of life in England and in his Christmas Carol he really hit his stride.  He made you see, smell, touch and hear 1843 London.  Sadly this edition has slashed (often badly) whole sections out of the story.  It might be suitable for younger readers as an introduction to Dickens, but adults or those who love the story will be disappointed with the cuts.  The illustrations are nice but they do not make up for the missing parts.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book is phenomenal.  Do not get discouraged by the first couple chapters.  It it truly one of the books that you will not be able to put down!
B001AUAK3G|5.0|When I was first discovering the operas of Wagner in high school and college, this series of Bayreuth recording were considered the \\"gold standard\\" performances.  I had all of these on LP (except for the completely misplaced Levine recording of \\"Parsifal\\"), but unfortunately lost them all in a fire.  I won't regale you with the numerous other versions of all of the Wagner operas I have since added to my collection, but when I found this ebtire set for under $100, I could not resist restoring my first introduction recordings to my library. Almost 20 years after having lost the LPs, I was astounded to discover that these remain amongst my favorite recordings of all times. The only fault I find is the inclusion of a 90s Levine recording of \\"Parsifal\\" vice including the 60s Knappertbusch recording that was part of the original \\"set\\"; maybe it was the only way they could sell the uninspired Levine recording... these are absolute gems for either the neophyte who wants to discover Wagner for the first time, or the serious collector wo could not consider their libraries complete without these iconic performances. BUY THIS!!!

1439133948|3.0|I've been a big fan of the Vorkosigan series, though not of Mrs Bujold's other works.  Which may explain why I didn't find Cryoburn to be particularly interesting.  In fact, I found it to be the least interesting Vorkosigan novel to date.    Miles seemed a very muted character here, with little of the lightening-fast thinking and trickery which has been his trademark.  And little of the physical action which has also been common in this series (and in the genre of space opera in general).  Nor was the planet of Kibou-Dani and its society of particular interest either.     For readers new to the series I would recommend reading one of the earlier books...like The Vor Game or Mirror Dance...before passing judgement on the series.  This particular volume is not typical.    Unfortunately, the ending suggests that this may be the last of the Vorkosigan novels.
1439163146|5.0|First things first, you can't think of Palo Alto as another one of those ghost written celebrity books. Palo Alto is a work of real literature that is written by someone who also just so happens to be an actor. James Franco is the author of this collection of searing short stories and I can't even begin to tell you how impressed I am. He delivers 200 pages of intellectual, harrowing, real and memorable vignettes. I couldn't stop reading, his prose is fluid and memorable and full of economical delight. Think of his writing as a cross between Bret Easton Ellis and Raymond Carver. (In fact, Palo Alto makes a great companion to Ellis' 2010 release [[ASIN:0307266109 Imperial Bedrooms]]) The stories are linked but can stand on their own, each having their own charms but working as an indelible whole. Franco captures the essence of wayward grade and high schoolers in a way that I have rarely come across. He writes them in an unflinching way that is as grotesque as it is human. We only ever see this type of writing when discussing psychology of adult characters, never for children- and for that, Palo Alto is one of my favorite books of 2010.<br /><br />(Certainly, this will be love it or hate it material, but you will be able to judge that for yourself upon reading the first page of the text.)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD about five months ago, and my only regret is that I waited so long to get started on it.  Today ends week 6 for me.  When I started, I needed to lose about 40lbs.  So far, I'm down 17lbs.  I feel, more importantly though, a loss of inches; I went down almost a full two sizes.  I watched what I was eating, but didn't strictly diet...just tried to up my protein and fiber intake.  I did start out with the intention of doing an atkins-type diet, but personally I found I was struggling too much with the workout if I didn't have some energy in my system.      Now to the actual DVD; I have to say that I haven't watched a day of Biggest Loser in my life, so I had no idea who Jillian was.  I've since read/heard from friends she can be really annoying, but I found her to be the best motivator I've ever had on a workout DVD.  She knows the times to shut up and the times when you're going to need a little (or a big!) extra push to get you through that circuit.  I was pretty concerned that my first day would be my last: I was breathing hard after the first set of jumping jacks...and then she makes you do push ups right away? Lord help me...   But I stuck with it, because as she said, it's only 20 minutes a day and it's pretty pathetic if you can't even commit to that.  By the end of week one, I was making it through all of Level 1 and by the end of week three, felt I needed a little more of a challenge.  Level 2 is just that.  I had to work up to it gradually: I'd do two days on level 1 and then one day on level 2, then I alternated every other day, and now I'm up to 3-4 days/week doing half-modifications on level 2 and 2-3 days/week on no-modifications level 1.  I haven't even made it to level 3 yet, but that just means to me that this DVD has great longevity and allows you to mix it up enough to stay interesting.    My biggest caveat is that it is a very high-impact DVD.  People with bad backs/knees may have problems with all of the jumping and lunging.  It's also not overly-awesome for abs, but I see the abs as tertiary to the overall goal of toning and weight loss. I supplemented it with the 10-minute Abs DVD and was very pleased.  Finally, with level 2 I found that there's a lot of 'change in altitude' for a lack of better words.  You go from jump rope, down to the ground in plank position, back and forth, back and forth...and she doesn't let you rest at all in between.  I found myself getting really dizzy if I tried to keep up with that pace, so I either changed up the aerobics sets or paused the DVD for a moment to allow my equilibrium a rest.      I did Weight Watchers and the elliptical machine for 10 weeks before this program and barely lost 3-5lbs. Even though it's '30 day shred' I can see this DVD working for me indefinitely.  I am so pleased with the immediate results, which has provided invaluable motivation to keep me on track for the next 20lbs!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|I know that the main event will forever be marred in people's minds by the events that took place just a few short years after, but in the context of the time, the ending sequence remains one of the classic images of wrestling history. I had lost this DVD before, and had wanted to get a hold of it again, but not the censored version that WWE sells now in the post-Benoit murders world.       Things I remember about this DVD: The Eddie-Kurt Angle match was phenomenal. I saw them live not long after this in a 2 out of 3 falls taped for TV match. Eddie and Kurt are two of the best ever. The ending of this match is clever and fits in perfectly with Eddie's character at the time.        The Victoria- Molly Holly head shaving match reminds of how weak the WWE's women's division is now. Gone are the great workers they had then: Trish, Lita, Molly, Jazz, Victoria, Jacqueline, Ivory. It's a totally different era now, and this match and the final Trish-Lita match are two of the last good matches I've seen in WWE or TNA in many years. At least there's SHIMMER...        I had forgotten that Kane and Undertaker had a match on this card. Now the talk is they might main event Wrestlemania this year. Ugh. This match in 2004 was fine.        The 3 on 2 with Rock and Foley against Evolution was a damn good match and Rock's last match in WWE. Pure wrestling entertainment, in a good way.        The main event was a thing of beauty at the time. Remember that Benoit was coming off of a 60+ minute performance at the Royal Rumble, and he was on fire. Triple H even taps out in the middle clean here. They had a rematch at Backlash the month after where Shawn tapped clean in the middle. I can't fathom how they edited this match  to make it make sense. The guy who wins isn't even in the new version.       Go out of your way to watch the Road to Wrestlemania special in the Extras. It is a documentary on the events leading up to Wrestlemania 19, without the kayfabe. This was the year that Brock Lesnar main evented with Kurt Angle in the main event and Brock almost broke his neck doing a shooting star press. Crazy to think he's been UFC champion since then. The segments with Steve Austin are particularly compelling. At Wrestlemania 19, Rock finally got his win at Wrestlemania over Austin, but that isn't the gritty part of the story. Also in the Extras, Ric Flair puts over his 10 favorite 'Mania matches. He ranks the TLC with the Hardys, E + C, and Dudleys a little high I think, but that was indeed a spectacle.       Overall this is a great DVD, arguably their best Wrestlemania ever, right up there with 3, 17, and 10 in my opinion.
B003XRZZFM|4.0|I'm gonna start out by saying i got into Dimmu with Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia, but I also love Enthrone Darkness Triumphant and Spiritual Black Dimensions. Anyway, Abrahadabra is a breath of fresh air. When In Sorte Diaboli came out, I was incredibly disappointed. The album just sounded boring and uncreative. I always loved the melodic part of Dimmu, which is why i was a little skeptical when Mustis left. When i read that Shagrath said the album was gonna be dark, epic, and primal, I thought sure, it's gonna be just like ISD. Boy was I wrong.    The orchestral arrangements were the perfect thing to take place of Mustis' keyboards. I loved Progenies of the Great Apocalypse, which was one of the few songs that were actually good on DCA. So i was hoping Abrahadabra would give the orchestra a more prominent role, which they did. And now, a song by song review.    1. Xibir: Just an intro with some orchestra parts. They've done better in this area. (Perfection or Vanity, Fear and Wonder) 7/10    2. Born Treacherous: This is a good song with some cool riffs and great orchestral parts. The only thing i didn't like the parts with the chanting of Crowley. Kinda cheesy. 7/10    3. Gateways: Ahh the first single. When i first heard it I was like what the hell? But then it grew on me. I still don't like the female vocals much, but the ending is pretty epic. 7/10    4. Chess with the Abyss: This is my favorite song on the album. Someone said it's a throwaway track, but they're on crack. This song is awesome all the way through. Awesome guitar parts, great orchestra parts, and amazing doublebass. The only part i don't like is Snowy Shaw's vocals. 10/10    5. Dimmu Borgir: When a band has a song that's named after them, it's either gonna be the greatest song ever, or it's gonna suck so bad people will wonder what the band was on when they made it. For me, it's the former. This song is epic and even uplifting, which is different for Dimmu. Second favorite on the album. 9.5/10    6. Ritualist: This song is ok. there are some keyboard parts that sound cool, and a couple cool guitar parts. Other than that, nothing special. 6/10    7. The Demiurge Molecule: I love this song. It's very different and epic. The orchestra has a big part in this one. The drums and guitar at the end are awesome. This song is actually a little dark. Some parts it sounds like the choir is yelling, \\"HEY!\\" which sound kinda cheesy. My third favorite on the album. 8.5/10    8. A Jew(el) Traced Through Coal: There's a part in the middle of this song that sounds kinda cool with the drums and orchestra. It's funny cuz it kind of reminds me of Lord of the Rings. But the keyboard in that part sounds cool too. 7/10    9. Renewal: I'll give this song some more listens, but I've heard it like 20 times or so and i still can't find anything redeeming about this song. There chorus is ok, that's about it. Definitely least favorite. 3/10    10. Endings and Continuations: This is a great ending to a great album. I love the drums, the orchestra, and the awesome guitar riffs. Another GREAT thing about this song: Garm. They should have used him in place of Snowy Shaw on the other songs. Other than that, there are 2 complaints i have about this song: a)Too short. The intro is about a  minute, and the end is 30 seconds of them chanting Abrahadabra. That brings the actually song to a total of 4:30. b) They do chant Abrahadabra a bit too much, though it's not that big of a deal. 8/10    In closing, this is a great cd. Shagrath said it would be dark, epic, and primal. Epic? Yes. Primal? Yes. Dark? Not so much. I still love this cd though. As said before, they should think about Garm a bit more. I could really see him in Dimmu Borgir. This cd is very different than previous releases, but I think Dimmu is heading in a good direction, especially after ISD came out, which sucked.
B0012M4OUW|3.0|This lighter works great and is innovative and cool, but I did have a couple problems with it. It is rather bulky, wider and longer than my normal wick zippo. This makes it especially annoying to keep in your pocket. Also, the flint wheel is significantly smaller than a normal zippo's, at least I thought so. Other than that, it's a cool lighter and works well. As far as service goes, same as always, I've never been disappointed by Amazon's prices, shipping, and customer service.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|I loved this CD and just recently became a KOL fan.  Only by the night was amazing and I downloaded all their other albums and this is top 2 for me.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I loved the DVD version of Kung Fu Hustle, but the Blu ray version I bought was even better.  I watched the movie a day after I received the movie and the action scenes were crisp and clear and the soundtrack was excellent.  Nevertheless, the actor's voices were slightly out of sync, because of the translation to English.  It was too annoying, but it is definitely a hassle adjusting.  The movie was definitely enjoyable for the family.  The fight scenes were well choreographed and it was appropriate for anyone to watch.  Kung Fu Hustle is a great movie for the family to enjoy, not just the parents.
B0048IMZMG|1.0|Just had to do my part in bringing the rating down. I don't want to waste much time all I can say is that this album is terrible. Go buy some Byrds, Willie Nelson heck even Dolly Parton just don't waste your money on this mess.
B001AQT0UY|5.0|Classic movie on digital media.  Should last longer than VHS.  Good upgrade to my movie collection.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I enjoyed this comedy as much as any other I had seen.  After purchasing this set, I was further impressed that every episode had commentary.  This is wholly worth the purchase price.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Excellent movie, Woody Harrellson does a great job as the zombie killer. The picture and sound are both good. Highly recommend this movie.
0446569895|5.0|I purchased this book the minute I found out it came out. I began reading it right when I opened the package from whence it came from. This is an amazing book, Ozzy really bares it all. I have been an Ozzy Osbourne fan ever since I could grow hair on my face, and I've studied him for just as long. I thought I'd heard every Ozzy story there was, but I was wrong, very wrong. He goes into detail about his younger years, how he didn't like school, how he, and his friends would steal from cars, or swipe apples off of their neighbors apple trees. He talked about his time in prison after robbing a department store (wearing a glove with no thumb, leaving perfedt little fingerprints). He also discusses his first marraige, which was very interesting, because as we (Ozzy fans) all know, he doesn't really talk much about her.   Really the only problem I had with the book was the British jargon that Ozzy used. It wasn't much a problem however, most of the stuff I could figure out what he meant. I have had this book for almost a year now, and to date I have read it four times, and well on my way to making it five.  This really is a great book, you can turn to just about any page, and there is a great story on it. If you are an Ozzy fan, a fan of Rock and Roll, or just like a darn good story, I would recommend it! If you haven't bought this book yet, STOP messing around, GET IT! You won't be sorry!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Watch this movie when you need to slow down, stop, and smell the roses.  You'll lose yourself in all the resolved drama and gained wisdom of another man's life.  The Straight Story serenely presents the powerful message that each moment we live, no matter how easy or brutal, lays the foundation for our choices.  The choices we make construct who we become. The message is delivered with such serenity that I was actually shocked it was a film by David Lynch, but I don't believe anyone could have done it better.  The Straight Story is a gentle, quiet masterpiece.
0439023521|5.0|It's been a while since I was so wrapped up in a book.  I quickly purchased the 2nd and 3rd books after finishing the hunger games.  I knew that if I couldin't put that book down, I surely wasn't going to put the others down either. I found myself sneaking away from others to read! :)  great trilogy!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Wide variety of goods for all. Considering doing some of my Christmas shopping here. Thank You very much for your impeccable service.
0805209999|2.0|The only thing I found intriguing about this title was the fact that it was written before the totalitarianism it describes was in full effect.<br /><br />That said, the book offers little else of worth.  It was compiled from a collection of chapters that the author himself never presented in a complete form, and while the overall narrative is engaging enough to keep you paging through till the end, the work as a whole reads very much like a rough draft.  Aside from the protagonist, most other characters are introduced and quickly dropped despite having been set up for further involvement in the plot.<br /><br />Then you can read more about these characters in the 'extra' chapters that the editor simply tacks on to the back of the book...<br /><br />Some folks love Kafka's books just for being so... well, Kafka-esque.  I enjoy his works, but this title receives a lot of undeserved accolades in my opinion, especially when you consider some of his other books.<br /><br />If you're interested in the subject matter rather than the author, check out other books such as Darkness at Noon or We the Living.
0938045768|5.0|I won't write a review about the book for Seppo Vesala has done a great job on this. But I will write about the price that this book is listed for in Amazon. The price of $75.00 dollars, that is simply robbery! You can obtain the book from dragondoor for $39.95, so yes buy it but not for the price offered here.  Edit: July 6, 2011.I see that the prize for this item has dropped from my previous post. If it is more than $39.95 for the softcover edition you are still paying too much.
0307463745|4.0|A no-nonsense, no frills and somewhat renegade take on common personal and business practices, how to arrive at better results by questioning the status quo and asking the right questions. Comprising a collection of easy-read short chapters, examples include the debunking of financial projections as sheer guesswork, and questioning the real utility and value of business expansion etc. Interesting views based on the authors' own success in business that appear deceptively simple but bear serious thinking about; in all a highly recommended read and food for thought in easy snippets.
0439023521|3.0|I am writing this review to inform readers who are looking for a fast paced, action driven, gory, bloody plot, that this is not the book for you. As it tends to gloss over the violence by only alluring to certain events that cause the deaths of the tributes during the hunger games proceedings. But what can you expect from a story written intended for young adults in which the violence is more PG-13 then what is necessary for cult fans of this type of sub-genre. Having said all that, getting to the real point of this review which is to inform you of the Japanese film 'Battle Royale' which is the exact same idea released back in 2000. So if you think this book is violent, than the movie is, well... it's best to think of 'Kill Bill Volume 1' let's just say. To give you another idea, Quentin Tarantino is a big fan of this movie just to let you know what your getting yourself into as certain scenes tend to stay with you.    In response to MIchael A. Behr's review I believe this is yet another unoriginal idea for a novel which has been done many times before. Agreeing with what I have read and heard about this book, the plot does sound a lot like that of 'The running man' which was in fact written by Stephen King under a pseudonym. However, what really gets me is the fact that just because a person is young does not excuse their ignorance when it come to music, film, history or even general knowledge. Too often I have heard the words \\" how am I suppose to know that when it happened before I was born\\" as if all of existence was created at the point of their birth and anything before that is not worth knowing. I understand not having heard of the film references you listed as a matter of lack of interest instead of you being too old. But having no musical heritage, general knowledge or concept of historical events is unforgivable. My/Younger generations are missing out on so much even when it comes to well written music as good songwriters simply don't exist anymore and arewilling to mindlessly consume what is out there simply due to a lack of curiosity and the wiliness to learn new things which in the end is one of the greatest of tragedies.

159102594X|4.0|It's hard to believe this is the author's first published work.  I just finished the first book and am looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />Alright, here's the long and short of it:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Character development:  Each character is memorable in his or her own way.  No small feat considering the myriad of characters introduced.<br />- Dialogue:  Good back and forth between characters.<br />- Setting:  He's able to give vivid descriptions of the scene without getting too wordy about it.<br />- Dark:  No \\"stable-boy grows up to save the world\\" BS here.  You'll find plenty to like and dislike about each character.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Plot:  Fairly straight-forward, not too many twists and turns.  Keeps moving at a good clip.  Just don't expect any shocking revelations.<br />- Fight scenes:  Again, fairly straight-forward.  Enough to keep you interested, but not on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Gutteral sounds:  Petty, but I got rather annoyed by some of \\"sounds\\" made in the book.  Things like \\"Aargh\\" and \\"Unhh\\".  Just tell me \\"he groaned\\" or \\"he got knocked on the head\\".  The first couple chapters are littered with these.<br /><br />Overall, I had fun with this book.  If you're a fan of Tolkien high fantasy, you probably won't enjoy this.  But if you like plenty of \\"dark\\" characters, like in Glen Cook's \\"The Black Company\\", then you'll probably like this quite a bit.<br /><br />Badger
0061997811|5.0|I usually don't review, but I felt I needed to here.  I was weary of buying this book because of the price, $20. However, after recieving it and opening it for the first time, I am 100% certain I made the right decision to buy it. This book is AMAZING. Tons to read, and tons to look at. There are pull-out replicas of certain props, but more importantly is the information to be read on how each movie in the series was made. A VERY special collector's item for anyone who enjoyed any of the movies, I highly recommend this!
B000002UC5|5.0|This order went smoothly, quickly. No hassles and Cd is in good shape.  Thank you!
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Comparisons to the Blair Witch Project are inevitable since this movie also uses the \\"cinema verite\\" trope in which the main characters are also the cinematographers, documenting the supposed phenomena which are occurring around them.  I call Paranormal Activity slightly better than Blair Witch only because more of the footage is from a tripod-mounted camera rather than handheld, thus causing less seasickness in the viewer.    The supernatural scares are essentially the same in both movies:  The characters spend more time scaring themselves than witnessing any actually scary events.  It's got the obligatory cussing and the standard jerk character who doesn't take the manifestations seriously until it's too late.  There are strange noises but very little actually happens onscreen.  I was pleased by the level of \\"authenticity\\" i.e. how similar most of the phenomena were to recorded cases of actual poltergeist hauntings.  It starts out with minor bumps in the night and gradually escalates into stranger and mor frightening disturbances.    The filmmaking style is simple, low-budget, but for the most part effective.  I wish it had stayed cheap and vague throughout, because the few \\"special effects\\" come across as very contrived and disappointing .. except for the last one (I can't say exactly what this is since I don't want to spoil the most exciting part of the movie for those who haven't seen it.)  The DVD version includes an alternate ending which was immensely more satisfying than the goofy theatrical ending (a prop which is seen at the beginning actually pays off in the alternate ending, leading me to believe this is what the director originally intended.)  Though the alternate ending is better, it still deflates the terror by showing too much.  It just seems that - in a movie which relies so heavily on the viewers' imagination - the filmmakers sold themselves short at the end.

You have THE drums. THE guitar. THE bass and voice. THE group. They need each other. I don't have the trading cards, but these guys are the real deal. And they're not afraid of ancient footage. They know where they are from.
1935251740|3.0|Okay, I admit it. I got off to a bad start with this book. I generally read the back cover, inside flaps, etc. first.  This book also had a final page \\"About the Authors.\\" Well. It's no secret who wrote THAT section ... jeesh. He worked with Christian Barnard, and Jonas Salk, and B F Skinner, and several Nobel laureates, and US News and World Report says he's a 'genius' etc etc. I got the distinct feeling that this guy is very taken with himself, a hunch that was borne out while reading this book.     The author presents far too much biographical information about himself in this book. Which I generally don't mind, if it is pertinent to the discussion, gives insight into his thinking etc. But I didn't find that here - I found gratuitous stories that seemed ... pointless. Unless he was 'dropping names' (which he does love to do, as I thought he might) - then I get the point of the story. But I wouldn't be surprised if a full third of this book isn't taken up with his biographical anecdotes.     Another good hunk is taken up by sequentially reiterating the 'principles' of Biocentrism. So at the end of a chapter, he states principle #1, then at the end of his next chapter he states principles #1 and #2, and so on. Filler.     Take out all the filler and the bio stuff, and you've got a very skimpy 'book.' I would classify it as a 'paper' instead.    Re: the content of the book -- I must admit that Lanza gives the clearest explanations I've yet read about quantum mechanics and some of their bizarre experimental results. For that reason alone, this book could be worth a read. The tenets of the book can be summed up as: mind creates matter. Nothing exists outside of the mind - there IS no external reality. Everything that we see, touch, experience is created in the mind - it doesn't actually exist 'out there.' There IS no 'out there.' There IS no time and no space. Everything is Mind.     None of which is new, of course. Jane Roberts, in the '70s, wrote a whole slew of books in which she channeled the spirit entity Seth - and these are her (his?) exact philosophy as well. She didn't have the benefits of quantum theory to bolster her arguments, but she did a great job of explaining in detail (I think she wrote 19 books in all) exactly how reality is created by the individual, etc. Numerous other philosophers have espoused the same thoughts - unfortunately, they're generally so opaque in expressing their thoughts that they're unintelligible.    Lanza, at least, is intelligible. And humorous at times. But he does tend to be dismissive of arguments against his theory with a hearty (arrogant?) \\"but of course, Biocentrism is the only answer\\" or \\"we have shown that Biocentrism conclusively is the correct answer\\" and other such blowhard statements.     I appreciated the quantum theory chapters, but for the rest of it ... meh.

B003YUC2FE|5.0|I am not sure why people are giving this a low rating based on the fact that the DVDs do not come in their individual cases.  Yes they do come in a cheap cardboard box without cases, but that is why they are at a great price! I can't believe people are still complaining and giving this set a low rating when in reality it is a great deal! I don't use the cases to store my DVDs or CDs because it creates too much clutter.  Instead, I store them in a CD book.  They are more portable this way and easier to find.  I love this set, great price! Besides, you shouldn't rate this item on its packaging alone, the movies are what you should be rating and not to mention the price.  If you want the cases, then go pay more and buy Toy Story 1, 2, and 3 on blueray and on regular dvd and see how much money you spend! You would probably spend double what this set costs! I would rather save money and not be so picky about it not having cases! THINK PEOPLE!

0316098337|3.0|Writing a first person narrative from the point of a 5 year old boy is a fascinating idea and was done skillfully overall, but it does not seem to work in places where the boy narrates rather complex dialogue or uses phrases such as \\"jamais vu.\\" I wonder if it wouldn't have been better if Mom had been the narrator in the 2nd part and then Jack could have narrated the final bit. Fowles' [[ASIN:0316290238 The Collector (Back Bay Books)]] has a similar plot, but from the point of view of the kidnapper.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|First,I love and own the DVD set of the HBO show and still watch it, with much enjoyment and appreciation. The four actresses had a chemistry that holds up. But that chemistry between them can do nothing to alter the fact that this movie is all around a bad piece of work, every aspect of it wrong. I am not going to reiterate the story as so many reviewers have done so, but everything about this mess was horrid. From the script and story line to the most hideous clothes I have ever seen, to the pasty harsh makeup, to that hideous kitchen of Carrie and Big's-==the disgusting over-amplified materialism, the way the 4 of them were so enamored by the extravagances at the middle east resort, yet all 4 of these characters are wealthy sophisticated women in Manhattan, not exactly country bumpkins...oh and then throw in the crying children, the \\"jokes\\" hahaha about Samantha's age and hahaha menopause oh so funny I was rolling on the floor ( I am being sarcastic) , not to mention the tacky and horrid wedding at the beginning ( I am pro gay marriage by the way) and this was a wedding from which I would run screaming.<br />Ummmmmm what else....name it, I didn't like it. The stupid scenes in the desert, on the camel, running into Aidan, Charlotte whining, the Irish nanny and her bouncing breasts= what is this , the Hangover?<br />...Basically tasteless, shallow, boring, and with not even a hint of the original series charm and humanness. Why couldn't the 4 women be real? Grow? Change? Stop wearing those hideous dowdy designer clothes...and why oh why, no Manhattan.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this dvd after reading many reviews and was really curious to see how i liked it. Well, I got it and tried it out and Jillian totally kicked my butt! After working out for only 30 minutes I felt like I'd accomplished much more than I usually do during an hour at the gym. This combines cardio with strength training in a way that gives you quick results. I LOVE this workout! One thing I really appreciate about this is it doesnt require a lot of time or equipment. All you need is some dumbells and you're set. I get bored pretty easily and I was afraid that I would lose interest after a week or so, but the 3-2-1 intervals are so short that it's over before you know it and you're moving on to the next thing. I love how energized and awake I feel when I finish it!
B0042FZWC0|4.0|I liked it. I just liked it. I really did.  Some of the material was familiar to me from the website, but it was well put together in the book.   If you are unhappy with the results of living a conventional life, you will find this interesting.   Some parts I could relate to better than others, but overall I think it is a good book.
031603438X|5.0|In the 1960s, music fans were often called upon to take sides: Elvis or the Beatles. The Beatles or the Stones. John or Paul. Then there was Mick or Keith. The latter rivalry was less public at first. Jagger, after all, was the Stones's frontman and vocalist who seemed to thrive on the public's adulation, on stage and off. Keith Richards, though usually regarded as the chief musical power behind the world's greatest rock and roll band, was content to share the spotlight only on stage, hence his only sporadic appearances in the tabloid press. Somewhere along the line, however, Richards turned the tables on the man he described as his best friend and worst enemy. These days, if asked to choose between Mick or Keith, most people, it seems, would choose Keith. In the past decade or so, Richards has emerged as the bigger celebrity, a man whose antics, whether funny (his skirmishes with childhood idol Chuck Berry in Hail, Hail, Rock and Roll), frightening (heroin addiction, excessive use of other illegal substances), or both (falling out of a tree; allegedly snorting his late father's cremated ashes) have helped him eclipse the other half of the Glimmer Twins.<br /><br /> Now Richards has trumped Jagger again with Life, a memoir as addictively readable as its title is bland. You may recall that Jagger once signed a deal to write a book of his own, but had to repay the advance when his manuscript either failed to materialize or was deemed unacceptable by the publisher. Maybe the image-conscious singer couldn't bring himself to be as honest as his readers would have liked. Richards has no such problem, although when reading his or anyone's memoir, it's wise to be aware that honesty and truthfulness are not always the same thing.<br /><br /> As we all did, Richards began life as a child. His life changed upon hearing Elvis Presley's breakthrough hit, \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\" In addition to picking up the guitar, Richards also explored the roots of the music he loved, eventually discovering blues legends like Muddy Waters whose greatest fame would come only after the Stones cited him as an influence. A chance meeting on a train with a childhood playmate named Michael Jagger, who had been similarly smitten with the blues, would lead to the formation of the Rolling Stones.<br /><br /> Richards took to the spotlight better than his doomed bandmate, Brian Jones, but not as well as Jagger, and found relief from the pressures of fame through heroin. He details his misadventures with the needle in fascinating, sometimes horrific passages marked by an unapologetic tone. Richards believes his body is his laboratory to do with as he pleases, but seems blase about the consequences his addictions had on others (such as the late John Phillips, once of the Mamas and the Papas, whom Richards introduced to smack. Phillips, in turn, helped his daughter Mackenzie become an addict). Richards has a lot to say about his bandmates, especially Jagger whose ego sometimes needed reingning in (although it would be interesting to hear Jagger's account of being in business with a junky), but the best moments are when Richards takes us behind the scenes and provides background on the writing of all those songs like \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Jumping Jack Flash,\\" and \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"<br /><br /> Richards has things to say about other rock and roll icons with whom he crossed paths, including those who he revered before becoming famous himself. He's generous in his praise for everyone from Elvis and Roy Orbison to Merle Haggard and George Jones. It's rather touching to read that Richards was moved to know that the late lyricist Sammy Cahn signed his approval for Jagger and Richards to be inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame on his deathbed. More than anything else, it's moments like those that make this book so memorable.<br /><br />Brian W.

0439023513|5.0|I've been waiting to read this book since the day it came out. It's been sitting on my shelf since August. I've been avoiding every little mention of Mockingjay. I've not read any reviews for fear of finding out how it ended. My husband even read the book before me but I made him swear that he would not give me one little hint on what was in this book.  So when I went on vacation last week I took it with me. I started reading it on the drive to the beach. I told my husband and kids not to bother me unless they were bleeding or on fire. I was only half way joking.  What did I think? I thought it was very well written and I was happy with the way it ended. It was a very intense series. I know some of you haven't read the series so I don't want to go into detail. I love this series! So if you haven't read it I recommend you put it on your TBR list.  Well done Suzanne Collins. Well done.
0786868724|4.0|Wonderfully written, sentimental look at the life of Albom's Rabbi, Reb.  Reb, failing in health, asks Albom to deliver his eulogy.  Eight years later, after many, many meetings together, Albom gives that eulogy.  The book describes both Reb's life and Albom's reconnection with the faith of his youth.  The book will stir your emotions and get you to think about your commitment to your own beliefs, but Albom's change seems quite a distance from his Jewish roots.  Though his focus seems to move more outward, away from his career and other ambitions, he still does not seem to embrace the rituals and core beliefs of his faith.  Still, anytime someone examines their world view, it is a positive step.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Celtic Woman until I saw this on PBS.  The voices were good but the productions were of poor quality, this recording will blow you away.  It's about time they got the credit they deserve and are now able to create a great production.  Hopefully they will continue along this vein, I can't wait for more to come out.

0060595183|4.0|I love huxley's fictional work (Island is one of my all time fav books). These two are a bit tougher to read. He says some excellent things, and has a lot of wonderful insights into modern culture, but he writes so pretentiously. I can just picture him with a thesaurus trying to come up with the rarest and juiciest words he can find. Some pages have to be re-red several times over to get through his zany writing style (a single paragraph shouldnt span 3 pages!). These two are certainly worthwhile books for any intellectual philosopher, but one may first need to engage in some of the experiences he refers to before one can understand where he is coming from.
B002WOQFZG|5.0|Percy Jackson is a great series for anyone who likes fantasy / myth based fiction, regardless of age.  My kids loved it and I loved it (maybe as much or more than them!).  The stories are imaginative, colorful, entertaining, and best of all: clean.  Mr. Riordan is a classy writer who understand how to tell a great story without the need to use toilet talk and inappropriate humor.<br /><br />The boxed set is awesome!  The box, unlike some other sets, is fairly sturdy!  It'll hold up forever if treated properly.  Unfortunately, the box must have been abused in transit and was dented in on one corner.  Not a big deal, as the function of holding the books was unhindered.  The books come with dust jackets and the artwork on the books and the box is top-notch.  Overall, a great present or just a great addition to your library.
B003ZSI9YI|4.0|Overall, I like the CD, but it's hard to get used to if you are a die-hard Phil Collins fan, like I consider myself to be.  The instrumentation is spot-on to the original songs.  Phil's voice is not what you are used to hearing.  Sometimes the back-up singers are louder than he is, and his voice seems kind of \\"thin\\" throughout.  Is this due to aging?  However, from interviews and videos that Phil Collins has out to support the CD, he said that this is not the old Phil Collins, but, rather, the new Phil Collins.  He made this CD out of a labor of love, rather than for the purpose of selling millions of records.  Overall, if you enjoy Motown, you will enjoy this album.  I have it on my iPod on \\"shuffle\\" so, for me, hearing the songs sporadically is better than listening to the whole album at once.  I did purchase the Amazon.com \\"exclusive\\" edition, which includes more songs than the basic CD.

0385336950|5.0|We all long for something.  Often, though, it is something hard to define, almost intangible, and just out of reach.  Like a cloud.    Liam Callanan's debut novel is a pitch-perfect portrayal of that longing and how it comes to dominate the life of a man, in this case, the life of Louis Belk, a one time bomb disposal soldier in World War II turned priest.  Deployed to Alaska, one of the more bizarre outposts during the war, Belk is assigned to serve under a crazed officer on the hunt for the elusive Japanese balloon bombs. Along the way, he becomes tangled up in a love triangle with the officer and Lily, a half-Yupik woman of mystery, with strange secrets of her own. The story unfolds through the window of the friendship between the now-priest Belk and a Yupik shaman who is on his deathbed, their years of coexistance as rival holy men in a small Alaska town having made them close.  Belk confesses his mistakes and regrets in hope of finding redemption from the spirit world, whether that of the Church he serves or of the Yupik life of the tundra.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book and cannot praise it highly enough.  It is never once boring or sensational; each word feels perfectly chosen.  Callanan deftly weaves the characters in the present with their past selves without ever dropping a thematic point.  The characters are real even if the situations they are in are fantastical.  In substance if not in style, I am reminded of [[ASIN:0802139256 Peace Like a River]] by Leif Enger.  Both deal with the mystical in the framework of the plain everyday.  In an age when many books written by men about men are either thrillers, murder mysteries, or voyeuristic porn, Callanan has succeeded in creating a classic work of literature.  It is a joy to read such a finely crafted, insightful, and heartfelt work.  I look forward to reading more from him.

0385338910|5.0|A. Have plenty of Kleenex on hand.<br />B. Don't drink anything you don't mind coming out of your nose later.<br />C. Buckle up. It's a bumpy ride.<br />You get the idea. Tropper's talent lies in his ability to make you feel what the characters feel whether you want to or not. Doug, the protagonist, loses his wife a year or so before the book begins. He's 29, aimless, lonesome, pitiful, often stoned and/or drunk, but \\"slim, sad and beautiful\\". Tropper seems to know that despite his flaws, Doug will suck you in just like he does the women in his suburban neighborhood. You almost become one of the characters just by reading about them. This was an engaging story from page 1 and took off from there. It has a great plot, believable, three-dimensional characters, and can't-put-it-downability. There were several passages that I read and reread,(sometimes out loud to the annoyance of my husband and friends)just for the sheer beauty of the writing. A cute but effective side plot-the bunnies, which Doug names but can't stand for being so adorable and content in his yard, while his pain is so intense. I heard this may be made into a movie. See you in line!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Its funny how much attention these books have received.  The reality is that this first volume starts rather slow, and there are some lengthy and deadly dull recitations of financial fraud.  There is a facebook group called \\"Struggling through The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\" for this reason. It took my wife 2 months to actually get into it, and she never would have made it if it wasnt a bestseller -- should would have dropped it with the boring start.<br /><br />That said, it certainly does pick up and the suspense/mystery and even action heats up.  The character depictions are generally excellent in all 3 books, with the possible exception of the romantic relationships which are perhaps not portrayed with as much clarity.<br /><br />I dont see how folks can really rave about this first book because it does have those dull stretches, but in fairness this is a series where books 2 and 3 are stronger.  There are no dead patches in 2 or 3, they move consistently well, and there is greater consistency and coherency to the plotline which builds through books 2 and 3, and the suspense (which wanes in places) is bolstered with quite a bit of action.  I really enjoyed books 2 and 3 and have no problem recommending the series as a whole.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars, but I feel that is a little on the generous side if rating this one book as a stand-alone.

0312600844|2.0|When I reached about page 350 of this novel, my gut said to not waste any more of my time.  But I tend towards obsession, having to finish what I start.  I couldn't help thinking that Mr. Franzen was trying to \\"stick it to\\" Oprah.  You may recall that he refused to have his previous novel, The Corrections, used as an Oprah book club pick, and with this book it seemed that the deal was done beforehand...but I can't help wondering how she felt (if she really has time to read the books) when he describes the nastiness of having someone crap in your mouth, supposedly erotically, and how she felt about the fact that there are no female characters of good integrity.  The women are all portrayed as craving validation from men; the men are either bums or pushovers.  I did like the beginning and got sucked in, and the ending wrapped things up conveniently, conventionally, tidily, but there were huge stretches in the middle that were either disgusting, irrelevant to the story or just plain tedious.

B003V4AK8E|3.0|Physically it's fine.  Triggers are a little firm but that's ok with me.  The D-pad and analog sticks take some getting used to, but they're great once you grow accustomed to them.  The face buttons are more Xbox clicky and less PlayStation squishy, but that's an aesthetic choice really.  The unforgivable thing is that the wireless connection is VERY weak.  If you keep your PS3 in a cabinet, for example, it can lose the connection when you shift how you're sitting (not all the time, but often enough to make it REALLY irritating).  It's a shame, because in a tactile sense it's really a great piece of hardware, but a wireless connection on a controller has to be perfect, and this one is not perfect.  I got it discounted so it was a good deal, but in general I'm waiting for the Nyko Raven to get back in stock.

Anderson<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Paul W.S. Anderson<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Horror<br />Release Date: 10 September 2010<br />Review Date: 25 October 2010<br /><br />Resident Evil: Afterlife is the best Resident Evil yet, by far. Here is a series that has done the complete opposite of most franchises: gotten better with each movie. The first film was at best a disappointment, as it was the farthest thing from the videogame series. But its writer / director, Paul W. S. Anderson, has returned to write and direct this installment, and has redeemed himself quite nicely!<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is back from her bloody crusade of slaying zombies over the course of the last three films, as Alice. We pick up right where we left off back in 2007, and are treated with yet another refreshing voiceover catching us up to speed on what's happened. When you average two to three years between films, this comes in handy.<br /><br />At the end of part three, Alice had threatened the evil Umbrella-corporation-Heads that she would be coming for them with a few of her friends. After destroying one of Umbrella's labs, and releasing several experimental clones of herself, this film starts with her doing just that. It's a shotgun blast to the face as far as action is concerned, and we love it.<br /><br />From there she embarks to a place called Arcadia Alaska where all of her surviving comrades from the last film were headed at its end. However, she becomes keen to the idea that Arcadia Alaska may not exist, and finds only one of them; Claire Redfield (Ali Larter).<br /><br />Claire has suffered some sort of amnesia and no longer remembers Alice, but Alice scoops her up against her will and takes her along to scout the continent for more survivors. Their search leads them to Los Angeles where they hold up in an old prison, hounded by thousands of hungry zombies eagerly waiting outside its gates.<br /><br />They meet a few other characters there, most of whom who will serve as zombie lunch, and the rest of the film plays out like an action-packed videogame, which is exactly what we're looking for in a film of this genre. There is no shortage of brutal violence, zombie attacks, and awesome slow motion shoot-out scenes, ripped right out of The Matrix. But by now, what movie with more than one gun hasn't done this?<br /><br />The film leaves us open for another sequel, but bring it. At this rate, I'm pleased to see what's next. Hopefully Anderson will stick around. He does magic with the camera and wrote some really gruesome material. `Carnage candy', for any horror junkie.n an old prison, hounded by thousands of hungry zombies eagerly waiting outside its gates.

0679405372|5.0|A seafaring beam casts a sliver of light through my curtains piercing the gloom and illuminating a volume on my bookshelf. As I look to see the title the light moves on leaving me in darkness. I sit musing in the murk and the sliver of light returns. I move quickly before the beam moves on and I glimpse the title of the book. It is To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf. Seeing this I am instantly transported to the Scottish isle of Skye to the vacation home of the Ramsay's and friends. Young James Ramsay wants to visit the lighthouse near their home on the morrow but the weather looks to be inclement so the trip doubtful. Thus begins the novel as Woolf with pitch perfect prose begins to describe interior and exterior life on the Isle of Skye. Mr. Ramsay and Mrs. Ramsay take completely different approaches to life: he relies on his reason, while she depends on her emotions. They share the knowledge that the world around them is transient. Mr. Ramsay's overly rational approach makes him inconsiderate of other people at times and he suffers from knowing his work in philosophy may not long outlast himself. Mrs. Ramsay deals with the transient nature of life by trying to make every moment beautiful and memorable. This elegiac novel is divided into three sections The Window, Time Passes, and The Lighthouse. The middle section Time Passes has some of the most sublime evocative descriptive prose I have read: &#34;Night, however, succeeds to night. The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, they darken. Some of them hold aloft clear planets, plates of brightness.&#34; - &#34;while the sun so striped and barred the rooms and filled them with yellow haze that Mrs McNab, when she broke in and lurched about, dusting, sweeping, looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun-lanced waters.&#34; - &#34;Now and again some glass tinkled in the cupboard as if a giant voice had shrieked so loud in its agony that tumblers stood inside a cupboard vibrated too.&#34; There is a boar's head skull tacked up on the wall of the children's room that serves as symbol in the novel of the ephemeral nature of life. Mrs Ramsay is an antithesis to this symbol as she tries to nourish life and beauty and make moments last by seeing them in utter stillness even saying at one point &#34;Life stand still here.&#34; Meanwhile the lighthouse beams light from its great cyclopean eye over their lives on the Isle of Skye seeing beauty and its passing with the same pale indifference.&#34; There is a boar's head skull tacked up on the wall of the children's room that serves as symbol in the novel of the ephemeral nature of life.

B003Z0BSU8|4.0|I got to know this pianist when someone lent me the 1993 Leif Ove Andsnes Grieg Piano Sonta, Lyric Pieces CD recording about 10 years ago. What amazed me was his incredible sensitivity and attention to detail and of course his attractive energetic playing style. One thing unique to him that I've not heard in anyone else yet, is his high awareness of musical voices. For him it's not just the top most melody that's important, but all voices. Listen closely to this Rach recording and you will notice how he brings out the voices throughout the entire range of the keyboard music. He has developed an incredible independance in his technique that when all the notes finally come together it adds an almost surreal dimension to the music.     I do have to say though that this particular interpretation of the Rach 3 is too fast for my taste, it almost sounds like the music is in a hurry. But then again Rachmaninoff himself used to play it too fast for my taste. The thing is when it's played to fast the music tends to sound mechanical, rather than organic.

B000069KGM|5.0|I had the privilege of meeting these guys a time or two in the early 70's and all I can say about this classic work of theirs is it's timeless in its quality.  It really makes me wonder what's happened in music where the acoustical instruments like the horns in recent music have gone.  The licks these guys do, brass and strings and don't forget the drums, are truly amazing and tight.  There's no slop in any of this and it's all first rate stuff.  When it comes to wind instruments one can say it takes breath.  Inspiration.  And inspiration is where this album is at.  Just give another listen to those guitar and bass riffs along with the drums and you'll agree.  No doubt about it!

B003UYUQZW|2.0|\\"Prince of Persia: Sands of Time,\\" is a Walt Disney film.  Too bad.  If they had shown gratuitous female nudity (heroine or in the harem sequence) this film would be a blockbuster epic great.  As it stands, it is way too focused upon ancient Persian warfare weapons in a documentary type impetus, and they allowed many stunts by the main male lead to obviously echoe much of the 1992 Disney animated feature named \\"Aladdin\\" where he gets away over the roof tops and via acrobatics that would only be possible for extremely well trained, very fit athletes who work out frequently and stay on a rigorously proper nutrition, avoiding any frivolous party life.  In other words, this film has the traitorous bad guy lose, the hero gets the girl, there's magic, there's death dealt but deserved so nobody cares.  It's a typical Disney film.  Darts, arrows, knives, swords, spears, hack, hack, stab, stab, assassins so deadly Chuck Norris would hide, but this hero kicks their ass.  Like I said, the film needed some girls to show off their assets.  We need new stuff that hasn't been over-used so much for so many years, or else throw me some eye candy.  I watched this film because Ben Kingsley was in it, and up until now that made me believe any movie had merit.  I'll look closer next time.  The 2004 version of \\"Troy\\" with Brad Pitt has far better sword fights, The 2003 version of \\"Helen of Troy\\" with Sienna Guillory has far better sword fights, \\"Spartacus,\\" \\"Braveheart,\\" \\"The Princess Bride,\\" and the \\"Underworld\\" trilogy with Kate Beckinsale all have better sword fights.  Heroic bravery is better in the movie, \\"300\\" about Thermopylae where in 480 B.C., 300 Spartans blocked hundreds of thousands of Persians for three days.  \\"Prince of Persia: Sands of Time\\" needs to have some substance instead of just so much flash.  If Disney wants to make epic films with real people in ancient history settings of barbaric warring people, the rest of the realism anticipated in those films by the majority is that there will be some female nudity.  Otherwise they should stick to animation, comedies, or nature documentaries.  There should have been graphic beheadings, limbs hacked off, disembowelment, and streams of blood (and female nudity).  It's a battle movie, trying to be a love story, but the only thing brutal about it is how the movie stays so politically correct.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Get this for the Animatrix in HD alone. The transfers and features are all ports, but the jump to HD for the Animatrix is totally worth it alone. Also, if you never had the HD DVD set, get this. This set of movies will test your home theater.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|The third season of Chuck was absolutely outstanding. I was funny, romantic and thrilling. I've really enjoyed watching this series.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|Bruce Beresford is a remarkable Australian director, skilled at nearly every genre (from [[ASIN:B000087F7D Driving Miss Daisy]] to [[ASIN:B001VC99HQ Tender Mercies]], from [[ASIN:1573623903 Black Robe]] to [[ASIN:0792160215 Double Jeopardy]]), but sometimes a project just doesn't quite gel. 2006's \\"The Contract\\" is a case in point.<br /><br />The story of a ex-military-trained paid assassin (Morgan Freeman), leading a team on a high-level 'hit' under orders from 'the Executive Branch' (represented by senior agent Alice Krige), winding up in the middle of the wilderness as the accidental prisoner of an ex-cop/gym teacher (John Cusack) and his son (Jamie Anderson), with good AND bad guys after them, is enjoyable, but simply doesn't hold up to close scrutiny.<br /><br />With the star power involved, a gifted young performer (Anderson), making his acting debut, a crew of brilliant award-winning technicians, and fabulous locations (primarily in Bulgaria's lush wilderness), you would expect something really special. But the script, originally written by the late Stephen Katz, then updated and polished by first-time scribe, John Darrouzet, borrows heavily from many sources (including [[ASIN:0783222149 The River Wild]], [[ASIN:B00008L3UQ Shoot to Kill]], BOTH versions of [[ASIN:B000XR9L50 3:10 to Yuma]], and more), and simply never creates any real tension. The film seems more a series of strung-together moments, than a decisive 'whole'. Many are entertaining (Cusack's lack of enthusiasm about camping, Freeman's remark about the kind of school Cusack would teach at), some are moving (Anderson attempting to explain the rift with his father), some ridiculous (Why would you climb down a mountain in a rainstorm? And how do two killers and Cusack ALL arrive at the exact same location, at the same instance?), some gratuitous (poor Megan Dodd, the closest thing to a 'romantic interest' in the film, does a totally unnecessary nude scene when she first appears).<br /><br />Apparently, financing was a major problem during production (the list of producers in the opening credits is huge), and Beresford invested his own money to finish the film; it then went directly to DVD (I found no box office totals listed for the film). All of which explains why this 2006 release received so little fanfare.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Beresford, Freeman and/or Cusack, I think you'll still enjoy this film (there is a very entertaining 'Making Of' documentary in the Special Features, with their observations), and I admit, I've seen MUCH worse than \\"The Contract\\". Sadly, I've seen much better, as well...ajor problem during production (the list of producers in the opening credits is huge), and Beresford invested his own money to finish the film; it then went directly to DVD (I found no box office totals listed for the film).

0006547745|4.0|This is the perfect book to take along on a trip to the Middle East. Saves hours of research on the history of western religions.Dalrymple's stuborness in getting places even when it puts others at risk can sometimes be exasperating and he has fairly firm opinions on muslims, christians and jews but his writing is witty and fluid and it is a pleasure to share in the excitement of his travels and benefit from his extensive knowledge of religions,art and history.
0316069884|5.0|I've been a vegetarian for nearly 20 years and I've read a few books about the meat industry. So far, this is the best I've read. Foer weaves his personal thoughts and ideas with overwhelming and convincing statistics about factory farming.   His description of chicken slaughter and processing is so revolting that -- even if you don't care at all about what chickens feel -- you'll likely never want to pick up a chicken nugget again (now I can't even think about them without wanting to retch).   Although I don't eat meat, I have been making it for my two children and my husband. The kids love the aforementioned chicken nuggets. After reading this book I realize I must make some changes. I can't continue to serve them animals that definitely lived bleak lives, and that possibly died horrifically. Animals pumped up on antibiotics and hormones, eating food that's not natural for them. None of this is natural for humans.    Foer makes an excellent case for vegetarianism and even veganism.    I wish everyone would read this book -- and then stop eating meat.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Iron Man 2 is a great follow-up to the first.  Definitly recommend buying if you liked Iron Man.
B003UYUR10|5.0|Its hard to find movies that are worth it, that enthrall and entertain.  The movie Prince of Persia delivers. Its faithful to its gaming roots, the action is solid and the story is just good. Too many movies rely on effects to draw crowds, too many use gimmicks like 3D now-a-days; not this film.  It does have really good effects, but the characters and story drive it.      Its just good. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.
1438509480|2.0|If you want a single, good translation of the Meditations, this is not the one to get. The translation is awkward, unwieldy, and outdated with lots of \\"thou dost\\"-type phrasings. I've ordered the Penguin version after being very impressed with their highly readable translation of Seneca's \\"Letters from a Stoic\\". I may keep this edition around for reference and comparison but I can't recommend it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I had recently read the book for the first time, and was astonished how much I loved it.  I was skeptical that this movie would be any good but surprisingly I loved it.  Though they cut out a few scenes I would really have enjoyed I thought the overall feel of the movie was akin to what I felt with the book, and it was a good way to relive the story without having to re-read the whole thing.  Overall I absolutely loved it.  The only scenes I wish they had included was more of Miss Bingley teasing Darcy, those were some of my favorites scenes in the book.
B000021Y77|4.0|I first saw this film in a film class in college and from that point on I knew I had to have it. It probably isn't one of the best films out there, but it is worth the watch. I'd go over more about the movie, but I'd end up giving to much away.
0316010669|2.0|If I had the ability to judge a book's quality at a blink, I would not have bought this book.  The book has some interesting facts, and interesting facts are all that the book has.   Its logic is incomplete and thus its conclusion can be misleading.  Furthermore, it fails to analyze or explain the reasons of those interesting facts.  I got an \\"ok, so what?\\" feeling after reading the book.     Here's an example.  The author's argument is that we can judge a person we have never met before in a nanosecond and still tend to be correct.   He uses the evident of college students judging their professors at their first class.  The logic is: because students are good at judging new teachers, people are good at judging strangers.  This is a very biased example - students are experts in judging teachers.  Students have been studying and judging their teachers since kinder garden and their teachers are usually from similar culture background as the students.  As a result, each student has a huge database of what they like and whether a specific teacher would meet their requirements.   However, if you want a student in a completely different culture or a person who has been home-schooling to judge a stranger teacher in 3 minutes of lecturing time, I think the result is more likely to be off.   The author cannot safely draw the same conclusion.     Yes, we tend to make quick judgment of people, and yes, we tend to think we are right (please note the difference between \\"think we are right\\" and \\"are actually right\\").  Yet this book fails to make neither a good point nor a good explanation.   If you are new to the topic of decision-making neurology and interested in a quick reading, I recommend \\"How We Decide\\" by Jonah Lehrer.  It's easy, interesting, and actually informative.
B003NSPUOC|5.0|Great easy reading.  Well written.  Stories move along with interesting characters. I really enjoyed these three books.  Best if read in order.
0312600844|4.0|I wasn't crazy about the characters.. at times I got a bit weary of their lives.  I tired of reading about their sex lives but the ending of the book sucked me in. The book made me do alot of thinking about families and raising children.  Also made me wonder how anyone grows up somewhat normal....    I do recommend this book. Was an easy read. And while I was irritated with the characters, I could not put the book down. Finished it in less than a week.

031262820X|4.0|Ok, so this is not great literature.  I still think it is a good story with good characters.  It moved along quickly and always kept my interest.  I think readers of both Ms. Wickham and Ms. Kinsella have to realize - 2 different names, 2 different styles of writing.  I recommend this book for a fun escape.
0385340575|4.0|I've always enjoyed Lee Child books.  I enjoyed reading Gone Tomorrow very much but a glaring mistake in his research needed to be pointed out.  The Sig P220 that was so prominently highlighted during the end battle is a .45 ACP caliber, not 9mm.  It's very obvious with a little research he could have not made such galring mistake.  That's like saying a Corvette has a lawn mower engine in it.
B00000IMTE|5.0|Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (1975) is their best album, in my opinion. This debut album has 2 classic numbers, MAN ON THE SILVER MOUNTAIN, and CATCH THE RAINBOW. The latter is a slower, methodical, almost trancelike song that is my favorite from this band. Dio is the perfect fit for this album, with its many different sounds and speeds. He's one of just a few singers who have the ability to adjust their tone accordingly. The last track, STILL I'M SAD, is an instrumental that finishes the album on a very high note. This album was the springboard for Dio's awesome career that followed, with successful stints in this band, as well as Black Sabbath and his solo career. The album cover says it all: This is the world of Dio.....a master of fusing fantasy with heavy metal. Get this album--it's very nostalgic and classic. 9/10
B000CPGZHA|5.0|This is one of Kylie Minogue's best concert DVDs; superb showmanship and energy throughout.  High energy tracks and a fun concert to watch - glad I got this one.  I just wish I'd heard about Kylie years ago, I just started watching her concerts recently; this one is one of her best (her Manchester and Sydney concert dvds are excellent as well).<br /><br />Update: Dec 2011.. A year after I bought this, I like it now even more than ever; I watch some songs from it at least a couple of times a month, it's outstanding.  One of my favorite concert DVDs, fresh, energetic, good choreography and plenty of enthusiasm and style. Definitely a winner!<br /><br />-k
0316077054|3.0|BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS is a worthy sequel to Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl's bestselling debut novel, Beautiful Creatures. Everything that fans loved in the first book appear here as well: the lush Southern atmosphere, comfortable teen speak, forces of good and evil battling, and a romance that triumphs over impossible obstacles.<br /><br />Ethan Wate knew that his romance with powerful Caster girl Lena Duchannes was never going to be easy. But, in the wake of Lena's uncle's death, things seem almost impossibly difficult. Lena is pulling away from Ethan and hanging out with her Dark cousin, Ridley, and a mysterious boy who is but is not quite an Incubus. Even worse, old and new nemeses return, struggling to stake a claim on Lena and her Caster powers.<br /><br />With the help of his best friend, a new Keeper in town, and an unexpected Caster ally, Ethan sets off on a journey through mortal and Caster worlds, chasing a Caster myth that may or may not hold the answer to Lena's changes.<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS occurs on what could be considered a grander scale than Beautiful Creatures. Stakes are higher, adventures are more far-reaching. Events unfold at the same almost maddeningly leisurely pace as the first book, but past the first 150 pages, I found myself absorbed by the epicness of Ethan's struggles. I loved that the plot takes you miles across Southeastern US and beyond that, in the Caster realm. The physical movement of the characters in BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS now matches the sprawling grandiosity of this series' premise--something that BC fans will devour.<br /><br />The second book reveals to us more of the core group of characters' inner turmoils, from Ethan and Lena's conflicting emotions and dedication towards one another, to Link and Ridley's evolutions; introduces several compelling new characters; and adds mysterious depth to some already larger-than-life Gatlin residents. A more or less successful web of characters and their development set this series apart from most other paranormal romances.<br /><br />The Caster Chronicles works, for me, on the most basic level of sweeping good vs. evil conflicts and romances that conquer all. It is, to be honest, not great writing. I find Ethan's voice to be generally unconvincing, a boy lacking in truly attractive distinction. All too often the writing contains sentences that make points that the average reader will be able to infer for him- or herself: \\"duh\\" reactions to events or revelations. The magical element of this series is still a bit murky for me; I feel like it relies mostly on the characters' insistence of its malevolence for its impact (or lack thereof). Critical revelations occur with insufficient forewarning, and I was left scratching my head and wrinkling my forehead sometimes in confusion and disbelief.<br /><br />Those points being made, BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS and the first book have accomplished what the series set out to do: create a slightly different paranormal romance world that Twilight fans will greedily devour. If you're not too hampered by a need for literary sophistication, then this is one of the most entertaining and epic paranormal series out there.romances.

B000005JA8|5.0|I have read a lot of 'incomprehensible', 'hard to swallow', 'difficult music', 'dissonance', 'chaotic', 'out there','atonal', etc.,etc. and while i listen to it right now i do not understand why this completely composed and detailed music is so abrasive to most ears. It is just complex blues-rock with a heavy injection of the absurd, humor & balls. And as for the reviewer who said this is an engineers nightmare don't let that scare you. This was recorded by David Kunc and Zappa and it sounds great! warm analogue detailed spectrum (keep in mind  this was recorded in 69!). E_X_C_E_L_L_E_N_T !!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This was such a good book. I couldn't hardly put it down, and it did surprise me in places with the plot twists. I thought it was well documented, factual and well done. Dan Brown just gets better and better. And I soooo enjoy the fun and games trying to solve the riddles, codes and mysteries that usually surround his books... Very Clever!!
B0000033IS|5.0|Sometimes the music gods make reviewing so easy. Sometimes  I want to explain the obvious. Sometimes, though I spend my time writing in musically obscure subways, I just have to review something, just because I love it so much.<br /><br />I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You is the essence of this sometimes. \\"Respect\\" begins this 1967 album by Aretha Franklin, and is one of those ten or thereabouts pieces of music the whole world knows. It is an Otis Redding Tune, and his version would be the classic if Franklin did not define it as HER classic.  With grits and butter, but melody and flesh, Aretha sings to her lover that all she is asking \\"is for a little respect.\\"<br /><br />We know \\"Respect\\" so well it has the commonality of a ad jingle--not the fault of Franklin but of over exposure in a world that plays way to little of its own music. But in 1967, \\"Respect.\\" was melodic soul sung with guts with a women with a voice that both resonated with power and was as matter of fact as air. Franklin demanded respect from her lover, but in '67, the civil rights era still in full bloom, subtext meant everything, as much as a black women demanding \\"Respect\\" with such no nonsense.<br /><br />\\"Respect\\" was a classic song when soul was a singles medium, and could make ANY album a classic. But for those of you who just brought the seven inch in 1967, or have downloaded \\"Respect\\" today, you have the chance to buy this brilliant album and experience this amazing song in new context. Listen to \\"Do Right Women,\\" any of the hits, or the non hits, like the gleaming bossa nova  \\"Don't Let Me Lose This Feeling,\\" or the unaffected balladry of \\"Soul Sarenade.\\"<br /><br />Soul, gospel, funk, bossa, it is all woven here into a perfect album. The thread that binds, is, of course, Aretha Franklin; her voice so powerful, she need do nothing but utter the words. Think about that in a world of Dusty Springfield Drama, Leslie Gore schoolgirling and Diana Ross prettiness.<br /><br />It was Otis Redding who released [[ASIN:B000002JO2 The Otis Redding Dictionary Of Soul : Complete & Unbelievable]].

B0026P3G12|5.0|I knew I loved Susan's voice but had my reservations if I would like the song choices.  It was wonderful to have my concerns laid to rest when I first heard this cd.  While some of the songs are not ones I would have chosen, many I had not even heard of, they were all great songs.  The words of many of the songs spoke to me personally.  My mother loved this cd.  She suffered from severe insomnia and would often listen to it all night.  She was an entertainer all her life and had a long list of favorite songs and performers, but when she passed away at the age of 83 she requested that Susan's cd be played. Thanks Susan for filling my mom's sleepless nights with beautiful music.  I know she will be listening to the Holiday cd right along with me.

0143118420|5.0|Whether or not you agree with Elizabeth Gilbert's religious perspectives or life choices, this much is undeniable: she is a hugely likeable woman.  Her way of writing is chatty, confessional and warm-hearted and you never doubt for a second that she really cares for and connects with everyone she crosses paths with.  Spiritual journey aside, this is just an amazing adventure for anyone who's ever wished they could just pick up and start again someplace new.
B00005JKNC|4.0|Beyond the concept of the movie or the serious acting of Jim Carrey, or the back drop of the loss of the sons of the town of Lawson, or the US committee on Un-American Activities, the precise thing that makes this movie great for me, the very thing that drew my emotions is the presence and acting of Martin Landau.  The character, Harry Trimble, the owner of the Majestic, the father of Luke, is the sauce that this story stews in.  Martin Landau did a wonderful job playing Harry.  I loved every minute of his acting.  Jim Carrey was lucky to have him.

030745455X|5.0|What a fun ride!!  While \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is hardly James Joyce, its clearly not intended to be.  Instead, its a rollicking, intriguing way to spend 700 pages.  The characters are colorful (though at times cartoonishly so), the action fast paced, the mysteries compelling, the stories so complex and interwoven that its frankly hard to put it down.  There's no question you have to suspend disbelief and \\"go with it,\\" but if you are willing and able to do that, I promise you a fun ride.

B003NFM3JU|3.0|Mr. Zemeckis may know that the great animation comes from a solid story. So it is good that he adopted a story from Charles Dickens. But for the performance side, it is still something apart from the industry standard animation in his animated movies. I felt that it's really not understandable why his previous films such as Polar Express,  Monster House,  and Beowolf are motion-captured animated films that give me some scary uncanny valley experience. I would say he should use the most great merit for the animation medium, simplifying the movement to tell the story efficiently. Unfortunately, mocap animation doesn't give that simplicity and gives scareness to the audience, this film failed again to sell a legendary story to the audience because of the technology.
B003OCWF6I|3.0|What works:  Fine performances by Idris Elba, Zoe Saldana, Columbus Short, and Chris Evans.  They sell the movie to me, when the other actors can't.  The stylized action is good for the most part, and pieces of the script are rock solid.  The general feel of the movie is fun, without taking itself too seriously or too silly.<br /><br />What doesn't work: Source material was already bad, and unfortunately the movie doesn't make it that much better.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives a lazy performance as does Max the villain.  Having this unthreatening comedian play the villain, put a major damper on the suspense.  Some of the one-liners are embarassing.  And while the action scenes as a whole are entertaining, the gunfights are less than exciting.<br /><br />There's loads more good and bad things about this film, but generally it stands mediocre.  It wasn't a great comic, and that may be why it's not a great film.  If you're an espionage fan, this may interest you more, but as a common moviegoer, it doesn't do a whole lot for me.  With a better lead and villain, this film may have became a favorite of mine.  It didn't have a lot going for it, and it didn't make the best of it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|first off this book was AMAZING everything from the percy jackson series and more!!!!!!!! congratulations riordan you are my favoritest writer ever!!!! second off people who are writing reviews stop spoiling the story to the people who read reviews. they might not have read the book and you could have just ruined an experiance they hadnt had the chance to grasp. it makes you look like a jerk. if you want to tell someone about the book tell a friend who read it and strike up a conversation. well after that comment all i have to say is riordan thank you for sharing your gift of writing and i cant wait until son of neptune comes out. (rick if you see this ps after kane chronicles you should think about writing about norse mythology its a fun subject) :)

B003ES5ZPK|4.0|With the proliferation of HDMI connections in today's home theaters, sometimes there isn't room for a straight-on HDMI connection, especially if the cable is stiff. The AmazonBasics HDMI swivel adapter can help by permitting the cable to approach at a different angle.  If there's limited clearance behind a component, it can make the difference between fitting or not.  Use of a swivel adapter can also relieve stress on connectors and cables.<br /><br />The AmazonBasics adapter is simple but works well.  It swivels a full 180 degrees vertically, and about 120 degrees horizontally, as shown in the product photo.  The female socket gives a tight fit for the cable and the male plug fit snugly into my TV.  I had no trouble with the signal passing through the adapter. A bonus is Amazon's \\"Frustration-free\\" packaging which is simple and 100% recyclable.

0399156577|1.0|I purchased this book on the relaese date and eagerly opened the cover....what was that for? I should start with..I love NR. I have read everything she's written and there has been nothing that I disliked so much that I wasn't able to finish. The characters were flat and predictable and just somehow..un-finished. The heroine was so annoying I just wanted the stalker to kill her and put us out of our misery. The hero was just a jerk. Ms. Roberts has such a nack for getting you to love her characters..for reaching her audience with humor and tension and emotion...this was a miss...big time. There was no chemistry or connection with the couple. The love scenes just seemed vulgar and disjointed. I get what she was going for but it never really got there. The dog training scenes read like a script from the Dog Whisperer (*snore*). I really just couldn'y stomach it anymore and tossed thsi book. (Also the first NR that I didn't keep to re-read). Don't waste your time or you money. I will certianly look forward to the next novel but hope that I never have to endure another tragedy like this.
0771035780|4.0|This book is well worth reading.  If nothing else, you will have a better understanding of why someone who has been in Playboy is deemed more qualified to talk about pediatric medicine than your doctor.<br /><br />Keeping me from giving this 5 stars are not-quite-there writing and something of an obsession with particular individuals.  Granted Matthias Rath is fully deserving of any and all opprobrium heaped upon him (reading about him had steam coming from my ears - again), and the others are well-chosen and notorious dissemblers, but it feels just a little too personal.  OTOH, I might have done the same.

You get a huge array of creatures (which are easy to locate alphabetically or by level) that play different roles in battles, from 1-hit minions to solo skirmishers to artillery, etc. Putting encounters together is really easy, you just look for proper xp and roles, plug them in, and you're ready to go. A final note, as silly as it sounds, the illustrations are actually really inspiring and you can show the pictures to your gaming party and watch them mentally prepare for the pending struggle.

This is a great movie and we loved it and still love it.  I personally like it better than the \\"new\\" Robin Hood.  The actors; Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, Christian Slater and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were well chosen for their parts and did them well.  I truley love a movie that puts a song in my heart, a thrill when watching it, and a over all good feeling when the credits come on.  And Sean Connery still can grab your heart strings.  I highly recommend this Blu-Ray edition.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|As a fan of the Krik Douglas Spartacus I didn't know what to expect of this modern series.<br /><br />Its stop-action sequences, fake blood and gore distracted me from the story, but as the series continued I became accustomed to it and it stopped bothering me.<br /><br />The series grew on me, and I found myself enjoying it more and more. Yes, it's violent and gritty. But it illustrates the age in a way I've never seen before, and although one always has to question historical accuracy in entertainment, it brought a new perspective to the era. It's also a vivid reminder of how lucky we are to live in modern times, in a wealthy country with a wide range of freedoms.<br /><br />The star is knocked off for themes that, though perhaps closer to reality, I do not enjoy watching -- the excess of blood and gore and R-rated (some argue X-rated) material.<br /><br />One thing I really liked was the DVD case, which for 4 discs is slim and convenient. The graphics are impressive. The format of the case is like a book, with a hard cover.

B0015DROBO|3.0|I was really, really looking forward to reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. How could I not? It's been on the best-seller list for ages, and people I know have raved about it over and over again. I guess I was a bit surprised to find that even though I enjoyed it, I wasn't thrilled with the book at all. In fact, the more I thought about it, the less I enjoyed it. A few thoughts:<br /><br />---The main mystery is very, very intriguing and I liked reading about Harriet Vanger's disappearance. There are some interesting twists and turns in this storyline, and it fully kept my attention. My only quibble is that it really doesn't take up very much of the book at all.<br /><br />---I really hated the portions of the novel (basically the entire beginning and ending) that involved Blomkvist and his magazine. Once the mystery is solved, there are about 100 pages devoted to Blomkvist trying to salvage his reputation and get back at his nemesis, Wennerstr&ouml;m (who, strangely enough, we never actually meet in the book; he is only referred to by other people, lessening any impact he could have for the reader). I can't even begin to describe how boring this was for me to read. I found myself scanning page after page, desperately wishing this storyline would come to an end.<br /><br />---There is a very unnecessary rape scene in the book, which I did not expect. I don't mind violence in my reading material, but I felt like this scene was immaterial to the story at hand. There are better ways of showing the vulnerability/revenge tendencies of a character, and the entire thing struck me as gratuitous. I found it painful to read.<br /><br />If you took out the scenes of Blomkvist's business troubles, I think you have a really stellar mystery on your hands; unfortunately, the mystery is sandwiched in between a lot of instances I just couldn't bring myself to care about. Lisbeth Salandar is an interesting character, and I wished that the book focused more on her, as opposed to the exceptionally bland Blomkvist (why are women constantly falling for this beige, boring man?). Still, there is something very intriguing about this book, even though I can't quite put my finger on it, and I just may read the next entry in the trilogy.<br /><br />Note: I bought the Kindle edition and was pleased to see that it was well-formatted and did not contain any major errors.t (why are women constantly falling for this beige, boring man?).

B000TERLEK|4.0|...and not to mention modern music. Previous to this album I had really just enjoyed classic rock and a few random cuts that you hear on the radio...  But then during the opening commercials in a movie theatre in Mesa, Arizona, I heard \\"Talk\\", and was immediately hooked. The song was stuck in my head until the next movie I saw, where I wrote down the artist and bought the album.  I have fond memories of listening to this album in my allergist's waiting room every week.  This album has a chill, genuine feel to it...admittedly it does get a little tiring by track 11...but the first three quarters of the album have lush soundscapes and shows just how great a songwriter Chris Martin is. It also must be noted that the song \\"Kingdom Come\\" was supposed to feature guest vocals from Johnny Cash, who tragically passed shortly before recording...  So now the question...is this worth my Money/Time? If you are new to Coldplay start at \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", my favourite, and also the most critically acclaimed of their albums, and get this one if you enjoyed it.  At the end of the day, it contains a few of my favourite Coldplay tracks, but is hard for me to sit through all 13...
B003L1ZWG2|4.0|Overall, its a good movie and has some suspense to it.  If you enjoyed \\"Open Water\\" you will like this movie
B00102FELM|5.0|This has become my favorite DVD in my collection - and that's saying a lot!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This little bugger is perfect with my D40, when bouncing off ceilings, the pictures are naturally illuminated with great details and contrast.  It recharges quickly and turns itself off when not in use for more than a minute or so; but quickly wakes when you need it.  It is worth every penny.
B000S58428|5.0|Great album. This is one of those few albums that I could see every track being released as a single.  There is not one track that I dislike on this album...  From the kind of menacing opener (Politik), to one of my favourite songs of all time (Amsterdam), and all of the greatness in between.  After you listen through the first time, you will probably gravitate to \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\", but do yourself a favor and try listening a couple times all the way through, eventually songs that you would have skipped before are the ones that are on your playlists...  Ok so who is this album for? If you are just getting into Coldplay, this is the place to start, if you bought Viva La Vida and are looking to expand your Coldplay collection...buy it, its better than Viva...and if you are in need of some music for chilling, or just for the next big thing to listen to, this is an album that you need to buy...
B002RSDW80|1.0|Had this been a movie simply about Julia Child, it could have been great. Instead, more than half of the movie is given over to the tedious narcissist Julie Powell, and the results are predictably horrifying. I know there really are people like this, but I don't need to pay money to watch movies lionizing them. If I could give it zero stars, I would.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Very relaxing movie - no dialogue, no acting, no discernible plot.  My wife and I lasted about 30 minutes into the movie and then left to watch our lawn grow.   BTW - I gave it one star because no stars was not an option.
142311339X|5.0|I just got done reading this book and it was so good I couldn't put it down. I read it all in one day. When I first heard about this book I couldn't believe it. I was so excited I thought I would explode waiting for it (Dionysus's favorite form of torture. lol) And then the Kane Chronicals came out and when I read it, I started to think that Riordan had lost his touch. I didn't have anything to worry about because this story totally kicked ass.      You've got this guy that doesn't know where the hell he is or how he got there, with a supposed kleptomaniac girl Piper and a sarcastic kid Leo that likes tinkering with his hands (Honestly, even before the book came out, just by the hints, I knew who jason's and leo's godly parents were. I wasn't too sure about piper until they started talking about her though) Anyways . . .      Soon you're introduced into a new kind of camp half-blood. There are new enemies, things that you'd have to be very into greek mythology to know they even existed and even now I've got so many unanswered questions in my head it's not even funny. Things are definately changing and its kinda scary. Those of you that thought hera was crazy before (I mean seriously, making cows poop all over the place to torture anabeth? Very mature) you won't believe what's going on now.      I promise that I won't give any spoilers but this book is so . . . amazing. Rick Riordan has definately outdone himself. Oh and for all of you people that said Percy Jackson appears in this book. I am so mad. Percy Jackson is mentioned throughout the book, but he never \\"Appears\\" he's lost. Unfortunately I can't tell you where he is, but as the story progresses, I think you'll figure it out even before they do. I am so scared to find out what happens in \\"Neptune's son\\" because I think it will definately talk about percy and his struggle, but will be chewing my nails until I get some Percy Jackson action! LOL!      This book is definately worth the money, even if it is in hardback. :D
1400049628|5.0|This book is a great book detailing the inevitable. Zombies will arise again, only this book and this book alone will be the tool you use to combat the undead. It is an invaluable book that teaches you about the zombie infection, how to fight, what to do, and where to go. Providing detail to each environment and biome. Need to select a weapon to use against the undead? No problem! This book will tell you the basics of each weapon category, from blunt objects to military grade machine guns.    Ever wonder where you would set up shelter when the infection breaks out? Selecting a shelter would be easy if you had this guide, it tells you where to go and where to stay away from. Highly entertaining and valuable. This is a must buy, it also includes entertaining recorded attacks from B.C. to present times. I highly recommend this book to all ages.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|After years and years and years of watching The Sound of Music on VHS and DVD, I thought I knew every blade of grass and every gust of wind visible in the movie.  How wrong I was! You don't realize how much picture is lost with standard 480p releases until a monumental blu ray transfer like this comes along and provides a home viewing experience that literally feels like seeing the movie for the first time.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this is the best blu ray I own - and not just because The Sound of Music is probably the greatest movie ever made, but because the picture quality is truly that beautiful. And that makes sense, considering the movie was filmed in 70mm and could contain so much more data than ordinary 35mm.  Also, from what I understand, the restoration process was taken extremely seriously and done with the highest technology possible. There's a reason why so many artists are pushing blu ray, and it's because for the first time people can experience their creativity and attention to detail, as it was meant to be seen.  There is SO much detail in this movie.  Seriously, if you loved this movie before you will have your mouth dropped open the entire time you sit through it in high definition.<br /><br />And the Audio quality! I didn't even know it was possible to make ancient audio files sound brand new, but it clearly is.  Every song sounds 1000000x better than my old CD soundtracks.  Add in surround sound... heavenly.<br /><br />OVERALL: I don't care how many VHS or DVD copies you have of this movie sitting around, you NEED this blu ray.  It's not just a restoration, it's a transformation.  You cannot have truly experienced The Sound of Music at home until seeing it in 1080p.  Not to mention it's cram packed with amazing extras that are actually watchable.  In case you can't tell, this BD just makes me so happy.  If you appreciate the movie (or bless you, never seen it before) you MUST experience it on BD!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Great movie, my wife loves it and wanted it on Blu-Ray so it was her Sweetest Day present this year :-)
0385341008|4.0|At first I didn't really latch on to this book. I found the format, a series of letters interchanged between a London-based writer and a literary society based in Guernsey to be difficult to follow, but that changed after a couple of letters and I was hooked. There is actually a narrative, the letters are post-war as Guernsey was apparently completely cut-off during the Nazi occupation of WWII. So that is an element as well, and a compelling story of a young heroine who is too brave for her own good (I won't spoil the story by giving away too many details). As the letters fly fast and furious the plot thickens and becomes difficult to put down. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in historical fiction as well as for anyone who is not.

B000QCS8TW|2.0|This review is for the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones. Were I reviewing the print version of the book, I would give it 4-5 stars. However, the Kindle edition (for iPad) is full of wretched errors in grammar and formatting that destroy the narrative flow. There are floating parenthesis, random-seeing italic text or misplaced commas every dozen pages or less. Considering how engrossing the book is, encountering one of these instances is like hitting tire spikes during a high speed chase. I hope the Kindle edition is re-editted and updated very soon. I hope the later books in the series aren't formatted so poorly.
014241011X|5.0|it's my favorite middle grade book of all time, so we can dispense with the review and get straight to craft. I don't think any children's book ever had a greater beginning than The Witches, so I've decided to reproduce the first page and a half in its entirety:<br /><br />A Note About Witches<br /><br />In fairy-tales, witches always wear silly black hats and black cloaks, and they ride on broomsticks.<br />But this is not a fairy-tale. This is about REAL WITCHES.<br />The most important thing you should know about REAL WITCHES is this. Listen very carefully. Never forget what is coming next.<br />REAL WITCHES dress in ordinary clothes and look very much like ordinary women. They live in ordinary houses and they work in ORDINARY JOBS.<br />That is why they are so hard to catch.<br />A REAL WITCH hates children with a red-hot sizzling hatred that is more sizzling and red-hot than any hatred you could possibly imagine.<br />A REAL WITCH spends all her time plotting to get rid of the children in her particular territory. Her passion is to do away with them, one by one. It is all she thinks about the whole day long. Even if she is working as a cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman or driving round in a fancy car (and she could be doing any of these things), her mind will always be plotting and scheming and churning and burning and whizzing and phizzing with murderous bloodthirsty thoughts.<br />\\"Which child,\\" she says to herself all day long, \\"exactly which child shall I choose for my next squelching?\\"<br />A REAL WITCH gets the same pleasure from squelching a child as you get from eating a plateful of strawberries and thick cream.<br />She reckons on doing away with one child a week. Anything less than that and she becomes grumpy.<br />One child a week is fifty-two a year. Squish them and squiggle them and make them disappear...<br /><br />...She might even--and this will make you jump--she might even be your lovely school-teacher who is reading these words to you at this very moment. Look carefully at that teacher. Perhaps she is smiling at the absurdity of such a suggestion. Don't let that put you off. It could be part of her cleverness.<br />I am not, of course, telling you for one second that your teacher actually is a witch. All I am saying is that she might be one. It is most unlikely. But--and here comes the big \\"but\\"--it it not impossible.<br /><br />Wow, right? Just wow. I don't know of a child whose attention this wouldn't grab. Most young children have not consciously been introduced to conspiracy theories. They're still learning the way the world officially works--aren't we all--let alone how some would claim it works in secret. And yet, children are lied to on a regular basis and at some point they begin to pick up on it.<br /><br />For those children, here is Roald Dahl, an adult willing to say things, metaphorically, it's true, that reveal the world as it is within the relatively safe context of a story. Children are told that adults are nice, that public officials are just and have their best interest at heart (some do), and that they are safe. Adults tell children this because we wish it were true and we reason that they'll have plenty of time to worry over the truth in adulthood.<br /><br />But Dahl says that there are adults, who appear in many ways just like other adults, who want to harm and even murder children. And to be fair, there are. But lest we become morbid, let us focus on harm. I had a grade school teacher who routinely separated children by class. The children from wealthy families who this teacher wanted to associate with were put into special programs and given preferential treatment. The children, like me, who were not, were made to know their place in society from an early age. This was a woman who meant to harm children, but who received several teaching awards and appeared a normal adult to other adults. My father-in-law could tell you stories about the way his White teachers treated him in Mississippi in the 1960s that would make Dahl's witches seem harmless by comparison.<br /><br />In every generation, there are these adults who are bad, and often other adults cannot see it. So long as there are children and adults, there will be this problem, and so The Witches is likely to stay relevant forever. Fortunately, Dahl gives us some clues as to how we can spot them:<br /><br />\\"...a REAL WITCH is certain always to be wearing gloves when you meet her...<br />\\"...Because she doesn't have finger-nails. Instead of finger-nails, she was thin curvy claws, like a cat, and she wears the gloves to hide them.\\"<br /><br />\\"A REAL WITCH always wears a wig to hide her baldness. She wears a first-class wig. And it is impossible to tell a really first-class wig from ordinary hair unless you give it a pull to see if it comes off... you can't go round pulling at the hair of every lady you meet, even if she is wearing gloves. Just you try it and see what happens.\\"<br /><br />\\"Witches have slightly larger nose-holes than ordinary people. The rim of each nose-hole is pink and curvy, like the rim of a certain kind of sea-shell... A REAL WITCH has the most amazing powers of smell.. An absolutely clean child give off the most ghastly stench to a witch... The dirtier you are, the less you smell.\\"<br /><br />\\"Look carefully at the eyes, because the eyes of a REAL WITCH are different from yours and mine. Look in the middle of each eye where there is normally a little black dot. If she is a witch, the black dot will keep changing colour, and you will see fire and you will see ice dancing right in the very centre of the coloured dot. It will send shivers running all over your skin.\\"<br /><br />\\"Witches never have toes... They have just feet... The feet have square ends with no toes on them at all.\\"<br /><br />\\"Their spit is blue.\\"<br /><br />To this day, I do not trust a woman in gloves. I check to see if she has a wig or if her spit is blue or if she has difficulty walking due to a lack of toes. Next week, I'll return to short reviews, but as this is my only post this week and my favorite book, we're going to go a little long.<br /><br />The main character in The Witches, who is also our narrator, is never given a name--a trick that would certainly not work in every book, but is fantastic here. He is a young boy whose parents die--of course they do, this is Roald Dahl and the man just had no patience for parents--and is sent to live with his Grandmamma, a plump old bird who smokes cigars (inspired):<br /><br />\\"Would you like a puff on my cigar?\\" she said.<br />\\"I'm only seven, Grandmamma.\\"<br />\\"I don't care what age you are,\\" she said. \\"You'll never catch a cold if you smoke cigars.\\"<br /><br />Grandmamma is a witch expert and tells our hero all he needs to know to spot witches and comforts him after a near witch attack. And then the story takes a seemingly unrelated turn. The two are looking forward to a vacation in Norway when Grandmamma contracts pneumonia, so they have to settle for a more subdued trip to Hotel Magnificent. It is imperative to the plot that our protagonists travel there, but why doesn't Dahl just have them head there in the first place? Wouldn't that save time? Perhaps, but Dahl is a master, as I've said, and he is focused on two things: character development and misdirection.<br /><br />We feel for this nameless boy who has lost his parents and now might lose his Grandmamma as well. But more important is the misdirection. Roger Ebert once said in a review of The Exorcist that the reason that film is so scary is that it does not want to be a horror movie, meaning that the characters were so well rounded and so focused on their individual lives that even if the scary stuff never came in, they could still have a fascinating story on their own. The detective in The Exorcist was also the basis for Columbo, and he was interesting for season after season without a single possession case to investigate.<br /><br />Horror doesn't work when the characters are nothing more than monster bait waiting around with no purpose except to be menaced at the appropriate time. In order to be effective, a writer must interest us in and compel us to care for their characters and their situation before the monsters come. We care about Grandmamma and her ward and their journey to The Hotel Magnificent is interesting on its own without need of any witches. They get into a scuffle with the hotel manager and the boy trains white mice for a future circus and it is interesting. Just when we would be content to read a story about a boy and his Grandmamma and their travels with a mouse circus, just when things are interesting enough and the reader is comfortable and enjoying a nice story, that is when Dahl and his monsters attack.<br /><br />While our hero is training his mice at the back of a ball room, hidden lest he be discovered with mice by management, the room fills up with a meeting for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Our hero is unable to get out and so must sit through their meeting. And all of those in the meeting are women. Women wearing gloves and hats with slightly irregular nostrils. And do those women eventually smell our hero at the back of the room? I won't say, but I must tell you that this sequence is the most scared I have ever been when reading a book as it was my first real brush with true horror.<br /><br />And that's where we'll leave it. If you're looking for a scary book to read this Halloween, this is the one for you. If you're just looking for a great book for anytime, this is the one for you. I have one more point to make, but I'm going to finish the review here as I have to spoil the book to make it.<br /><br />And now, my last point, which is filled with spoilers. If you haven't read The Witches, stop reading now. Seriously. I'm going to ruin it. Okay, I warned you. My most frequent complaint with horror fiction for kids as a kid was that much of it was condescending. The monsters weren't really scary, they were just lonely. Or the vampire bunny sucked the juice out of veggies instead of people (I love that book, but it isn't scary). No one in those books every really got hurt, and so whatever the monster, it was an empty threat. And even as a child, I knew people did sometimes get hurt and to say otherwise was a lie. Not so with Dahl. He told a great truth within the lie of fiction.<br /><br />The children in this story do get hurt and hurt bad. Several are murdered--in fantastical ways, sure, but still. One boy is drowned by his own father (again, under fantastical circumstances, but still). If I hadn't already talked for so long, we'd explore that event more in depth, but I believe it is one of Dahl's sharpest critiques of parenting. And finally, the protagonist does not come away unscathed. If you've seen the movie version where he gets made into a real boy again, well, that's Hollywood. But Dahl's tale ends with him accepting his impending death within a few years. Harsh, but, but, BUT, true.<br /><br />This is the point that will forever divide readers, I suppose. Some adults will think including these elements in a children's story to be reprehensible. If I read the book for the first time now, I might even agree with them. But when I read this book as a child it endeared Dahl to me forever. Here was a writer brave enough to write the truth and I hung to his every word thereafter because adults lie, but I knew I could trust him.e going to go a little long.

Not so with Dahl. He told a great truth within the lie of fiction.     The children in this story do get hurt and hurt bad. Several are murdered--in fantastical ways, sure, but still. One boy is drowned by his own father (again, under fantastical circumstances, but still). If I hadn't already talked for so long, we'd explore that event more in depth, but I believe it is one of Dahl's sharpest critiques of parenting. And finally, the protagonist does not come away unscathed. If you've seen the movie version where he gets made into a real boy again, well, that's Hollywood. But Dahl's tale ends with him accepting his impending death within a few years. Harsh, but, but, BUT, true.    This is the point that will forever divide readers, I suppose. Some adults will think including these elements in a children's story to be reprehensible. If I read the book for the first time now, I might even agree with them. But when I read this book as a child it endeared Dahl to me forever. Here was a writer brave enough to write the truth and I hung to his every word thereafter because adults lie, but I knew I could trust him.
1591843162|2.0|Wow! I was so excited to download this book from Seth Godin. The first half of this book Seth did a great job and I was really getting into the whole Linchpin thing and is still something I believe in but then half way through his book he lost his way. While trying his best to convert our thinking to the art of life he just can't bring the whole argument around to where it needs to go. He might think I just don't get the whole art argument but art is something I do understand there is a certain philosophy to his thought process. I just think he missed being able to convey the message he holds in his heart. The latter half of this book is poor liberal diatribe, to where he tries so hard to show that Capatalism is an old worn out idea and if you subscribe to that thinking well you have no art in your life and you are certainly out of touch. Obviously he is not a student of economics and has bought into the same bull of Obamanomics, which is really socialism at best. Sorry I wish I could really give this a better rating because I for one think Seth is a very good author but just not this time.

030745455X|2.0|I reviewed the first volume in this series and didn't give it very high marks.  However, there were some compelling bits that kept me reading until I finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, so I decided to give the sequel a chance.  I can't do it.  I just can't read any more about two people who are unlikable, arrogant, and who in many ways are every bit as bad as those they work against.  I was ready to give up when Lisbeth Salander broke into her former work place at 2 in the morning and went through her boss's files.  I did give up when Mikael Blomkvist knocked on the hotel room door of one of his colleagues.  The man sleeps with every woman he meets.  And he feels so bad about the way things ended with Lisbeth.<br /><br />These two have no redeeming qualities and I've just had my fill of them.  For now, I won't finish this book.  Maybe someday, out of curiosity, I'll pick it up again.  But at the moment, that's not very likely.  Brutality and arrogance just aren't my thing.<br /><br />The writing too needs some work.  Where in the world was the editor when the author gives readers such a detailed description of every stick of furniture and furnishing that Lisbeth buys for her new apartment?  When she's in the Caribbean, there is more than one scene where every movement is listed.  \\"She got out of bed.  Washed her face.  Got dressed.  Went downstairs.\\"  I had to start skipping large sections.<br /><br />And there are too many better books to read to waste my time with this one.
B003YUC2FE|2.0|The one downside to this product is the packaging.  This discs come in a cardboard toy box lined with black foam.  I have a two year old son who already knows how to work a DVD player, and it would be a no brainer for him to pull these discs out of the box and scratch or smudge them.  While I love the movies themselves, I really wish that they would have come with cases for the discs for better long-term storage.  You're probably better off waiting for a better trilogy to come out with better storage and protection for the discs.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is currently in the vault; therefore, to have the ability to obtain it through Amazon was great. Not only did it arrive as promised, but it was early and I received a personal email from the distributor informing me of the location of where it was left at the front of my house. Excellent service and great follow up on their part. I would most certainly purchase from this distributor in the future.

You can clearly hear the word pussy HOWEVER... there is a strange effect placed over top of it.  Like a harmony vocal a few seconds behind which tries to BLUR the vocal.  I am curious if the people who say their copy is censored are hearing the same thing or is the whole word censored on their copy???

However, this album is okay.... not like her first Christmas album. Her first one makes me wanna decorate and open presents, this one doesn't really put me in the spirit. It's soul less and hard to understand because her whispering. It's allright. Nothing to write home to mom and pop about.

1401225756|5.0|This is the best graphic novel/comic book I have ever read. I loved Neil Gaiman's work on Angela in the Spawn series and I had heard about The Sandman for a while but hadn't bothered to read it. When they released these new editions with new coloring approved by Neil Gaiman, I finally decided to buy the book and give this series a chance. I am sure glad I did! The book is filled with great, well thought out stories that connect to a larger story. It has really interesting things involving the dream world and the ruler of the dream world named, well, Dream. He gets captured and trapped in the mortal world by Satanists and people into black majick. The book is extremely creative and entertaining. I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am to have found this gem of a book and I highly recommend it to anybody that likes good storytelling.
B002ZG98VE|3.0|- It took enough time to develop the relationship between Robin Hood and Maid Marion. It's more like a drama than an action movie because there were fewer fighting scenes than the one starting Kevin Costner.     - The acting was okay. It had no \\"robbing the rich to give to the poor\\"  theme.  The script was completely different than any other stories about Robin Hood but I did not mind. It has an open ending. Obviously, it's a prelude to a sequel.     - In short, it's worth watching once.
B0042U2HN2|4.0|Arthur Rubinstein often stated that Brahms, not Chopin, was his favorite composer. The pianist was also quick to point out that Brahms was alive until Rubinstein was ten years old, and he approached the composer as a contemporary, rather than as an old master.  It helped that Rubinstein was under the wings of Brahms' close associate Joseph Joachim. Despite advancing age when these recordings were made, Rubinstein played these works with a sense of youthful discovery. This nine disc set contains the bulk of Rubinstein's stereo recordings of Brahms (although it's not complete, to avoid repertoire duplication).  The pieces fall within three categories: concertos, solo works, and chamber music.<br /><br />Concertos:<br />Concerto in D minor, Op. 15:  This was the first stereo recording, taped in 1954, to be made of this Concerto. (It was originally released only in mono, and didn't get a stereo release until 1977.)  It says something for the original producer - the legendary John Pfeiffer - that the sound still holds up very well. The general interpretation could be characterized as \\"Brahms without the beard\\" - the work of a young man full of ardor and passion, and  traumatized by Schumann's suicide attempt.  Fritz Reiner draws sparks from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, with some thrilling woodwind playing in the first movement.  This is the antithesis of the dragged out, pre-maturely aged approach that has more recently tested concert audiences' endurance. Although over half a century old, this is still one of the very few \\"essential\\" recordings for any Brahms collection, along with the Fleischer/Szell and Serkin/Szell performances.  I must point out, however, that Rubinstein's somewhat less well known 1964 recording with Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony (it has only been issued on CD once) coheres a bit better - even if it's a bit less fiery.  As for the 1976 version with Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic: Rubinstein was not in command, and Sony is wise not to give it another CD issue.<br /><br />Concerto in B-flat major, Op. 83: Rubinstein and Reiner had a dramatic parting in 1956, so RCA's plan to record the pianist's complete repertoire with that conductor were shelved.  Josef Krips and RCA's pick-up orchestra are on hand here.  Much as I love Rubinstein, I can't put any of his recordings of this piece on the top shelf with, say, Fleischer/Szell, or Zimerman/Bernstein.  This performance is a bit overly impetuous, with a more vivace approach than this epic, grandeur filled concerto warrants.  There's also a bit of technical bluffing, with some arpeggios unevenly balanced.  That said, this is the best of Rubinstein's four official recordings of the Second Concerto.  (The first, with Barbirolli, is very exciting but sloppy; the last, with Ormandy is bogged down.)<br /><br />Solo works:<br />The F minor Sonata, taped in 1959, was a favorite of Rubinstein's. The first and third movements are particularly arresting here, where his impulsive way with the piece best suits the music. In the second and fourth movements, however, the sense of mystery generated by, say, Perahia, is missing. Nevertheless, this is exciting playing, and Rubinstein is in excellent form in the finale - where too many pianists lose steam (as does the piece itself, frankly).  The Romance and Op. 116 Intermezzo are played with the lovely, unforced poetry, and natural lyricism which were hallmarks of Rubinstein's best playing.<br /><br />The four Ballades and several of the Intermezzi were recorded in 1970 for The Brahms I Love LP (LSC-3186). Rubinstein had, by then, developed a drier, less sentimental approach, emphasized by close-up recording. There are times when the playing is somewhat shorn of contrast - one misses the extremes of tension and repose. At this point, the elder statesman of pianists was more interested in making a clear structural statement than in shade and color.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that Sony did not include the 1953 solo recital (originally on LM-1787) on this set - probably because it was mono.  The playing was excellent, and it included a few pieces (like the Rhapsody in E-flat) that Rubinstein never remade in stereo.<br /><br />Chamber music:<br />Cello Sonatas, Opp. 38 & 99: Rubinstein and Gregor Piatigorsky were friends from 1931 until the cellist's death in 1976. (Legend has it that the easy going cellist was a calming factor in the many quarrels which sprang up between violinist Jascha Heifetz and the pianist during their days as the Million Dollar Trio.) Much of that personal warmth comes through in these performances, which were recorded in 1966. This is cordial, rather than Teutonic Brahms.<br /><br />Violin Sonatas, Opp. 78, 100 & 108: Henryk Szeryng first performed with Rubinstein in the 1950s. Immediately, their musical chemistry evolved into friendship, and this atmosphere suffuses their recorded performances. There is a give-and-take in these performances which recalls the great chamber music recordings of Rachmaninoff and Kreisler. One never gets the sense that Rubinstein and Szeryng are trying to \\"one-up\\" each other (which contrasts with the pianist's recordings with Heifetz).  Everything is in perfect balance.<br /><br />(For information on Rubinstein's Brahms recordings with the Guarneri Quartet, I refer you to Santa Fe Listener's informed reviews.)<br /><br />All recordings here are identical in remastering to BMG's mammoth Rubinstein Collection issued in 1999.  If you already have those, there's no need to get these.  But for those who seek an inexpensive overview of Brahms' music involving the piano, and don't feel the need for a complete set, this issue is an excellent value.cause it was mono.

B003YUC2FE|3.0|If you want the \\"ultimate\\" toy box edition,buyer beware yes you get toy story 1,2  and 3 on blu ray,dvd and digital copy-the only way you get a digital copy of 1 or 2  is here but open it up and there's a foam sheet with slats cut 1 for each disc.    As someone who also owns the dvd ultimate toy box which only has 1 and 2 + a disc of extras the bd set package wise is more like an ultimate letdown.    Disney should've put both toy story 1 and 2 in bd packaging with the bd,dvd and digital copy a 3 disc set for 1 and 2 while toy story 3 would be a 4 disc set in bd packaging and like the first and ONLY QUALITY SET it would also have a high quality  slipcover with real cases inside.    Disney should be ashamed as kids will destroy the wagon in seconds if it doesn't fall apart before your eyes-yes it's that cheap leaving you 10 bare discs with no real cases to call home...getting everything in 1 box set should be great but disney let us all down especially the kids.      In this instance BOO disney-jeers absolutely no cheers for this crapped out set.    THE WORST BOX SET I'VE EVER COME ACROSS-PERIOD. Disney should provide everyone unfortunate enough to believe this edition would hold a candle to it's dvd version  which came out years agao blu ray packaging for each movie with a nice set box to put them in.    Standards must have reached an all time new low at disney as compared with the first ultimate toy box this is garbage,within a week that's where the crapwagon will be and then you'll have no home for 10 discs,BOO BAD DISNEY.

The continuation of the story of Natural Philosophy from the Reformation up to the birth of hackers is a major feat of storytelling, and a joy to read.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I picked up Room by Emma Donoghue because there is a lot of buzz about it lately and the book has recently been shortlisted for the Man Booker prize. Although it's easy to read, the premise is intense and was inspired by the Josef Fritz case where a man locked his daughter in a basement for 24 years. Room is about a young woman, kidnapped and held captive for 7 years in a modified tool shed where she gives birth to a boy she names Jack. It is though his perspective that the book is told. As the book opens, he is five years old and has spent his entire life inside this room. His voice is unique and one you will also find either endearing and poignant or irritating. Personally, it took me a chapter or two before I absorbed the full impact and cleverness of this approach, it softens the blow of a very disturbing topic and provides a fresh unbiased view on reality and life as we know it. The book's primary focus is Jack's limited understanding of the world outside the room. Without giving away any of the book, let me say it's an intimate portrait of a mother's love for her son and the challenges of adapting to one's environment. The book is original, thought provoking and evokes a bevy of emotions
0763644455|5.0|I bought this to read to my kids.  They aren't quite old enough yet to understand it yet, as the language is not modernized for todays children, so I just had a ball reading it myself.  I had some paperback of Treasure Island as a kid with cartoon pictures illustrating it.  This is way more fun.  I loved the illustrations and their style just seems to fit the story.  It adds a lot to this children's classic.  The story itself is a classic, and needs no review.  If you actually like the story, and want to have a copy to read to children or just to look good on your bookshelf, this is the one to get.
B002ZG9940|5.0|Anton Corbijn, who gained fame as a photographer and music video director, crafted a stark and intimate biography of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis in Control, his first feature. Now, in a masterwork of minimalism, he takes George Clooney through the rustic Italian countryside, where he is laying low after an attempt on his life in Sweden. Clooney is Jack (or Edward, or neither), a gun runner- and probable assassin- who gradually realizes he wants something more from his life of shadows and mistrust after coming in contact with a well-meaning preacher and sympathetic prostitute (with whom he falls in love). Jack's cold mental and physical isolation is reflected through the small populace of the village he frequents as well as the serenity of nearby woods...and Clooney is compelling as an amoral (at best) mercenary grappling with the growth of his heart, if not his conscience. Corbijn has managed to update and transplant Jean-Pierre Melville's existential Le Samourai from France to Italy, and it clicks.

0312600844|3.0|Thank goodness I'm not going crazy! After all the hype I heard over this book, I was sure something must be wrong with me when I read it and didn't fall in love with it. So, I felt much better when I came to Amazon and saw I'm not the only one who would rate it 3 stars.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I think Jonathan Franzen is an amazing writer and very good at his craft; I just didn't love the story. The whole time i felt like something was missing. And I kept wondering how Oprah is so obsessed with this book. It just doesn't seem like something she'd love (which characters did she like, anyway??). I think I have a difficult time fully enjoying a book when I don't really like the characters. Especially when the characters seem to have so much potential, but then keep letting you down. To the point you want to shake them! Phew, enough of that.<br /><br />Anyway, I still say it's worth a read for Franzen's writing (and because I always feel the need to read anything that gets hype!) and because it is tied together nicely. It's definitely not in my top 10 books, but I didn't hate it either. Just don't expect too much, like some other people might lead you to believe!
1401216676|5.0|I'd always been interested in 'Batman', but had only seen the tv shows and movies, and dabbled a bit in the video games; I'd never actually 'read' a Batman comic book. So, for my birthday, I found a list of 'the best Batman comics ever!' or something like that, and asked for any of them. I received 'The Killing Joke,' and was excited as I'd heard it was 'really' good, and it was about the Joker! I enjoyed every minute reading it.  Only problem is, when it came to an end, I was severly dissappointed. Not with the quality, rather, the length. Like I said, I hadn't read comics before, but I thought they'd be... longer. Of course, if the Killing Joke had been bad or mediocre, I wouldn't have 'cared', now would I? So, even my disappointment in the length (esp. since there were another 10 pages or so of 'other stuff', so I figured, 'already?') is actually a positive review.  I just have to find that list again and start reading the other (apparently, longer, as well) comic books like 'Long Haloween' and 'Arkham Asylum'.  Also: Did anyone else use the voices from 'Batman: The Animated Series' for everyone? I bet, though, I was the only one who wound up using Jimmy Stewart's voice for pre-transformation Joker.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|This excellent collection, while offering few new morsels for the dedicated, goes a long way in convincing the uninitiated of the worthiness of this band in one's collection.  While skipping over the early years--which based on some people's opinions of the recording quality, is a good thing--this offers the meat and potatoes of Ten Years After's onslaught.  This box contains all the well-known albums, including the stellar Cricklewood Green, and Rock and Roll Music To The World, and with an excellent remixing and remastering job (try cranking \\"Standing At The Station\\"), pretty much sums up their best work.  One can quibble about the missing \\"Positive Vibrations\\" but that was recorded on a different label, hence it's omission.  And if it's been awhile since you've listened to this material, it's refreshing to hear a great British Rock and Roll band at full throttle, with little of the psychedelia, or recording experimentation of the day.  And there's little arguing with the fact, that if you're a fan of lead guitar, Alvin Lee, during this period, is simply rock hard--few frills, few long, noodling solos, just straight ahead shredding, with simply classic fundamentals played at blinding speed.  Highly recommended!
0375842209|5.0|This book is a wonderful read.  I was a little worried when I picked up this book because I tend to stay away from books with a lot of heartbreak and tragedy.  After a page or two, I realized that the narrator was Death and figured we might not be dealing with a happy ending here.  Well, I was immediately drawn in by the portrayal of the character of Death.  Death wasn't the scary or evil grim reaper we think of.  He was personable, someone you could share a drink with.  He was direct, deeply philosophical, comforting, careful.  The story starts of with 9-year-old Leisel who steals her first book, \\"The Gravediggers Handbook\\" on the way to being delivered to a foster family.  I loved meeting all the other characters - her friend Rudy, her foster parents, Max, the mayor's wife.  You really get to know these characters and feel for them.  I cried tears of heartbreak and tears of joy.  I was surprised to find out it's considered a young adult book, rather than an adult book.  The subject matter is pretty mature but I can see how it's a great book for a young adult because it deals with themes of family, friendship, bullying.  And of course it gives a perspective into WWII Germany, the Nazi party, the events of that time and how people, both young and old, were affected and had to make decisions.  This book is beautifully written, with unique perspectives and characters that feel real.  Enjoy!

B004A9F9ZI|4.0|I heard about The Walking Dead series back when the San Diego Comic Con was going on and AMC had released a trailer.  I was blow away this seemed like a drama with zombies.  When I watched the first show I was not disappointed it had drama and zombies and it did not try to over whelm you with either.  I just had a problem with a couple of scenes that it why I thought it was 4.5 stars and not 5.  I won't mention the scenes to keep spoilers out of the review but lets just say that I could not suspend my disbelieve for those two scenes.  If you like your zombie shows with some drama and good acting and action then The Walking Dead is for you.

B00004RF83|4.0|I viewed this film recently and enjoyed it largely because of some good acting, a plot that I found suspenseful and because it doesn't rely on car chases and blowing everything up.  However, I also felt dissatisfied and couldn't put my finger on why until I read the 1-star and 2-star reviews posted here. The script largely presents a good guy / bad guy drama.  (There is a brief flirtation with ambiguity when it is not clear what will hapen to the gerneal's letters, but the resolution of that tension just reinforces the good guy / bad guy structure.)      In my opinion, the film would have been simultaneously more realistic, more satisfying and more disturbing if both the Prez and the General had been given some more subtle ethical shading. As the 1-star review points out, thre was some moral ambiguities in America's global actions at this time that the film entirely ignores (not surprising given the time and the film maker) but that could add to the texture if this film were ever remade.      Burt Lancaster remains entirely on the surface of what could have been a very complex character.  Frederic March was a lot more interesting in his presidential musings but the press corps' rsponse to his oratorical flight in the final scene would be unthinkable in toda's polarized political atmosphere and is almost laughably  unrealistic even for the early 1960s when greater civiliity prevailed.    A note on Ava Gardner's casting and performance: I thought Ava Gardner was playing her characer the way it wa written and did a good job of it.  Some reviewers say she was flat as a femme fatale; I don't see her character as a femme fatale, rather as woman who is being cast aside by life and trying to deal with that fact  The one bit of really interesting ambiguity in the film is whether the Kirk Douglas figure really cares about her or is using her, or both.  If you haven't seen the film a lot of the above may seem unintelligble but I am trying ot avoid out-and-out spoilers.
B003WTE886|5.0|I would think if you are a fan of pop music or pop country that you would love this album as I do.  I really liked a few songs on her previous albums, such as, Tear drops on my Guitar Should of said no from her first and forever and always Breathe, as well as the five other songs that followed Breathe on the album.  Don't get me wrong I generally liked most of the tracks on both CD's but those were the tracks that stood out to me the most.  The problem I had was with the maturity of the lyrics because I not only listen to music for a catchy tune but, I love lyrics I can relate too and since I'm one of her older fans compared to the pre-teens to teens age group that listen to her....Since I'm 26 years old, I was yearning for songs that dealt with more mature situations that actually went passed the age of \\"Fifteen\\", but I still listened, just because I loved her voice and catchy tunes so much.....The upside now is that Speak Now has that same great sound with even catchier tunes and situations I can actually relate to, so if you appreciate her sound and your in my age bracket surely this is worth buying.  I myself, have not bought a CD in 5 years but I felt this was good enough to purchase.  Even if you are not in my age bracket, younger or older and appreciate her sound...  Surely you will also like this CD.  I can't help but speak to the people out there that liked her sound but were yearning for more maturity in the lyrics like me.  So if that is you, trust me this is worth the money, I absolutely love it she just keeps improving!
B00000G3PA|3.0|This is very fun action scifi, with Willis as a macho driller with a heart who sets out to save the Earth from an asteroid crash with his crew.  The special effects are extremely good, with memorable scenes like the destruction of Paris, but also the landing in an alien asteroid field.  For realism, plenty of things go wrong in the desperate gambit.  There is a great subplot, in which his daughter, who stays behind, is engaged to one of his team with Willis' disapproval.  A lot comes out with that little melodrama, which shocks the dad and reveals a funny side that is always present with Willis and makes his films better than most.<br /><br />REcommended.  This is not great scifi with some vision of the future, but it is  adventure as solid as the asteroid core they have to drill through.
142311339X|5.0|I had high hopes for this book, cause the Percy Jackson series (Books 1-5) were amazing, and this book went WAY above my expectations. There's more to the story, new interesting, powerful, and mystereious characters. Plus the plot twists and storyline was so good! I'm also glad that characters from the Percy Jackson books are back as well, and even makes references to past characters. There's also a good amount of comedy as well. I REALLY can't wait for book 2: The Son of Neptune.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />At the risk of committing heresy, I did not like this movie.<br /><br />A child is inspired to dream by a man, who is a world-renowned explorer and zoologist.  The child's future wife is inspired by the same man; who is tangentially responsible for the two meeting.<br /><br />The explorer is then accused of faking a discovery and vows to return with a living specimen or not at all.  The children remain inspired by him, however.<br /><br />Life intrudes for the children who grow up, marry, grow old, and never have the chance go exploring on for themselves.  The wife eventually dies, and her husband is seemingly consigned to a life of no consequence to himself or any other.<br /><br />He seizes one last chance for adventure, though, and through a series of events floats his house (and a young child) down to the location he and his wife always dreamed of.  It is still a remote jungle, full of adventure and excitement.<br /><br />They discover a heretofore undiscovered species of bird, and it what should have been a powerfully emotional moment, they also find the disgraced explorer who originally inspired the now old man.  Instead, this even older man is full of hatred and bitterness for the world that rejected him oh those many years before.<br /><br />And this is what I couldn't get past.  The inspiration behind an entire life is revealed to be an empty shell and nothing is ever as it seems.
B00275EHJG|3.0|My three year old loves the first Toy Story and has no problems with the second one except it doesn't hold his attention for very long. I was excited to purchase Toy Story 3 for him. I regret the purchase now.   I should have watched it by myself first. Instead we watched it together. Big mistake. When Big Baby came out of the bathroom I saw him cringe. It was downhill from there. He started crying when the toys showed their true colors. I had to turn it off.   I watched the rest of it myself later. I tonight maybe I would skip the scary parts for him if we watched it again. Unfortunately even though the movie tugged at my heart strings it is not something I will have my son watch.  The subject matter is too mature and scary. Parents of toddlers and preschoolers beware and watch it by yourself first to determine if your child can handle certain scenes.
B002AWJEU8|4.0|Excellent performance by Steve and Co. Well filmed with excellent audio. Well worth purchasing. Steve's playing at times in almost incomprehensible with regards to technique and execution.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|OK, I admit I never thought I'd listen to this 'type' of music AGAIN in my life, but I have to admit that this girl  has her stuff together!  First, the music has such great beats that you'd think all you are missing is a disco ball in your living room. I HATED disco, but this seems, well... different!   If you really listen to the lyrics (or better yet read them since she includes them on the liner), you can really feel what the songs are about.  They may have some syrupy sweet silly stuff, but who cares?  It's music!!!!    And once you get one of these songs stuck in your head, well, forget it... it's gonna be there a while!  Might as well settle in and JUST DANCE!   I thought Gaga was total fluff until I caught one of her videos on TV and then I really thought... uggghhh, please, been there done that, meaning a total Madonna rip-off, but I was wrong.  This girl can really sing.  Madonna was good, but Gaga is better.  Plain and simple.  And for shock value on the videos, well, where Madonna left off with 'Like A Prayer', et al, Gaga has simply taken it to the next level... fast forwarded 20 years and presto!  So, like all things... fashion and otherwise, everything comes back into style again at some time... and I guess it's time to disco... only now in a techno-fabulous kind of way that disco never had!    Will she last as long as Madonna has?  Well, that's anybodys guess... but I'd say she's got a great shot at it.  For now, I'm just enjoying the music and the videos!!!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Slash has proven his talent at Velvet Revolver with new and creative guitar riffs and solos. It is more clear for me that he was the creative pillar of Guns and Roses songs. He made a record like Santana, inviting singers, but for hard rock fans, Slash is greater than Santana. The diversity of singers turn it a great CD to hear.....
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Dexter Morgan is a monster and a sociopath.  He tells us as much in his own words as he narrates the events that unfold over the twelve episodes of this dark, original and ultimately disturbing serie.  The bigger issue that lies at the heart of this stellar series, the one that makes viewers uncomfortable and conflicted is our reaction to him.  Some will love this show, others will no doubt be repulsed by it.  But there is no way to ignore the questions it raises.<br /><br />Dexter (played superbly by Michael C. Hall) works in the forensics department in the Miami police department as an expert on blood spatter at crime scenes.  But he has a dark secret.  We quickly learn that he is a serial killer who is driven by the need to kill.  He has no explanation for it other than to satisfy a desire that burns deep within himself and to feel some kind of emotion.  In order to fit in and keep his secret hidden, Dexter has learned how to fake human interactions and form relationships in order to appear normal.  He is in a relationship with an emotionally damaged single mother (Julie Benz) and he maintains a close (at least in terms of proximity) relationship with his foster sister, Deborah.  As for his victims, Dexter targets only people who have committed atrocities and slipped through the cracks of the justice system.  This was a set of rules laid down by his foster father who knew about Dexter's dark side and helped him channel it in the most positive manner possible.<br /><br />Yet to justify Dexter's actions as heroic or to consider him a vigilante is to miss the point of this compelling series.  It is clear that Dexter is killing to satisfy his own twisted desires.  He never considers himself a hero and is well aware that if his secret were revealed, it would be the end for him despite the fact that he is killing people who \\"deserve\\" it.  Dexter is always completely aware of who and what he is.  The confusion and confliction is reserved for the viewers.  The show dares us to like him and to root for him as he \\"takes out the trash\\" and looks out for his girlfriend and his foster sister.  As Dexter puts it at one point, he is like each and every one of us, if only in our darkest dreams.<br /><br />As for the plot of season one, it largely focuses on the hunt for a serial killer know as \\"The Ice Truck Killer\\" who for some reason is leaving clues allowing Dexter to discover his identity.  Why?  No spoilers here.  Meanwhile Dexter must struggle to maintain his relatiionships with Rita and Deborah as well as with his co-workers all while keeping his secret hidden.  It's dark and compelling stuff, but always entertaining which may cause viewers to feel even more guilty and torn in their views about the show.  How horrible to be entertained by such a disturbing premise!  But entertained I was, as well as unsettled by my own reaction towards Dexter.  He is no hero.  He is a monster.  What does that say about those of us who can't help but follow his journey to whatever end is in store?him and to root for him as he \\"takes out the trash\\" and looks out for his girlfriend and his foster sister.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I am truly loving this complete series set!  I enjoyed this series years ago, and although it comes on GMC cable channel now, I don't get a chance to catch it everyday.  If you were a Dr. Mike and Sully fan, you have to purchase this series set and share with your family and friends.
B001HN694K|5.0|It's a wonderful tale. Keep your imagination and let the story take you. Awesome in it's muchness!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|The Goonies is a great movie, and the blu-ray transfer is amazing. Quite possibly the best blu-ray transfer I have seen.  Note: be sure to buy the 25th anniversary edition not the UK one which I heard was horrible.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An excellent book. Written for a young adult audience, it nonetheless deals with complex issues and offers a disturbing social critique into our society's treatment of the poor and marginalized, both domestically and abroad.
B003XHLIUS|4.0|This was the last one of this series I bought, because I didn't think this one looked too great. Since I have been burned by NECA's Predator figures before (every time, with issues like missing pieces, two left feet, scraped off paint, etc.) I made sure to look the figure over best I could in the store. I got it out to the car and opened it, to find both feet were on the wrong legs!<br />Luckily, this was easily fixed and I popped them on their correct spots. Now I don't know if NECA is outsourcing and hiring 5-year old Chinese kids to put these together, but their quality control is CRAP! CRAAAAP!<br />That being said, if you are willing to pay good money for a figure that looks good but will have obvious problems, them pick this up.<br />For being my least favorite Predator in the line, not helped buy some bad paint jobs that don't blend the green to yellow, but rater just STOP the colors at the joint, I have to admit this figure looks really, REALLY good on the shelf. I glued the wrist blade in and set it up next to the others (The Classic Predator with off-set paint scheme, and the Berserker Predator with the incompletely molded waist armor) and it looks fantastic. It poses nicely and looks great, which was a welcome surprise.<br />Why NECA skimped on the electronic 'falcon' for this guy I do not know, but in the end it is a kicking figure that is my second favorite in the line.
0316017922|5.0|This book provides a number interesting ideas to ponder--especially the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of experience to reach mastery. Putting that information in the context of star performers, like Tiger Woods and Bill Gates, provides a glimpse into what it took for these individuals to hone their talents to the rate of success that they've achieved.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I know it's more fit for camcorders but I decided to buy it for my Canon 550D T2i and it fits and works great! I love it already. The grip feels great in the hand and it's very comfortable. Definitely worth the money.    Also works great for a simple stabilizer.

0525423842|2.0|I usually pre-read many books for my daughters, ages 8 and 5.  I can judge fairly well whether the book is appropriate for them and whether or not they are likely to enjoy it. I was very excited to get my hands on Theodore Boone, for which I had to wait several months in the library queue. I couldn't finish the book, because I thought it was very dull. However, I am a lawyer myself, so I thought all the explanations about the system, the law, etc. were just too familiar to me, and therefore, not interesting. So, I gave it to my 8 year old to read. In her words, \\"It's so boring!\\" Upon my insistence she did go through 6 chapters, and it did not become more interesting to her.

0865479186|5.0|Bad Science is an excellent entry to the genre of skeptical books that are, in this country, associated with Michael Shermer, James Randi, and Paul Kurtz. It is a pleasure to read, both because Goldacre writes well, and because the books from Shermer, et al, are very similar to each other and this one is in many regards refreshingly different.<br /><br />Part of this stems from its national origin -- this is a very British book. As a result, it has a lot more about the MMR-vaccine-causes-autism nonsense than would have appeared in an American book, as the media panic in the U.K. was much greater than the one here. It similarly has less on faith healing and other topics that loom larger in the American consciousness.<br /><br />But the book also differs in approach. In the quintessential American members of the genre, various bits of nonsense are debunked with a combination of common sense and powerful anecdote. American writers are particularly fond of grand gestures, sneaking into the back room and discovering the wizard hiding behind the curtain. That's not Goldacre's style at all. Instead, his favorite tool is the statistical blobbogram. The main targets of his scorn are holistic healers, vendors of pharmaceuticals and vitamins, who lie and abuse statistical techniques to mislead people into buying products that don't work instead of using ones that do. He similarly rails against the journalists who enable these malefactors.<br /><br />Goldacre is a physician, so he spends most of his time on medical topics, but not all.<br /><br />I enjoyed and appreciated every chapter of this book, and I hope many other people read it too.
B002OB9KPE|1.0|Enough already.  No lyrics on an album are going to convince me that Jesus was an actual historical character.  I'm not worried about the devil either, because he's a mythological character too.  I never want to hear another note from these guys.  The drums are way too busy too.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|\\"Winter's Bone\\" is a compelling and emotional viewing experience. Set in the rural Ozarks in southwestern Missouri, the story centers around 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in an amazing performance)who struggles to keep her family afloat in desperate circumstances. Ree's father Jessup is on the run from the law, having skipped bond, and has left Ree to care for her mentally ill mother as well as a younger brother and sister who are too young to fend for themselves. This is the least of Ree's problems however. The family home has been placed as collateral for Jessup's bond and if he does not turn up for the court appearance, Ree will lose everything.<br /><br />Driven to desperation, Ree decides to risk her own safety and track her father down (she calls it \\"hunting\\" in the movie). This proves to be a great challenge, and most of the movie actually focuses on Ree's attempts to get her neighbors and kin to reveal her father's whereabouts. This includes a taciturn uncle with a cruel streak, Teardrop (John Hawkes in a haunting performance). The fact that Ree's father was a \\"cooker\\" who cooked meth, and that this appears to be an important means of making money for the community which is portrayed in this film, makes things even more dangerous. There appears to be some sort of code of silence surrounding Jessup's whereabouts and fate, and the harder Ree pushes, the more walls she comes up against. The impenetrable veil of silence attests to the strong bonds within the community even when one of their own may lose everything.<br /><br />The movie is a harsh coming-of-age tale as the main character Ree plods through life with stoic determination, refusing to yield even when the situation appears hopeless. Jennifer Lawrence portrays her role with a high level of credibility, with her haunted eyes, and grim appearance. This is a difficult movie to sit through - there is hardly any light-hearted moments, even the scenes of Ree's younger siblings playing around some hay bales is portrayed in grayish and bleak hues. The effect of meth on some of the inhabitants in this region is shown through the gaunt appearances and the undertones of tension and barely suppressed anger/violence.<br /><br />The cinematography is achingly beautiful, so at odds with the grim portrayal of life in these parts. The music is amazing, and perfectly captures the spirit of a paradoxical community - one which sticks close together yet can also turn on each other. \\"Winter's Bones\\" is a beautifully-filmed, and credibly acted drama that illuminates one young girl's journey towards closure and hope.trayed in grayish and bleak hues.

0142501123|5.0|We bought this book during the Halloween season last year but have pulled it off our bookshelf continuously all year long.  My 4yo son loves it and it is enjoyable to read as a parent (hard to come by!)  Wonderful rhyming and a great fun story!
B002C1BHIO|5.0|It was recieved very quick.  Packaged nicely.  The best part about it is that the item works great!  No complaints.
1439177783|5.0|I read this book in less than a day.  It was extremely engaging (in spite of being a little heartbreaking) and I think it will appeal to anyone who has ever had any type of body image self-esteem issues.
B0042JTAI8|3.0|I got this book because I'd read two other books of hers and really liked them, but this book for MY taste was very melancholy, depressing, slow and I actually felt somewhat claustrophobic in some parts which I imagine the author wanted us to feel but I did not enjoy the feeling. The story eventually gives up it's secrets but it was a bit like pulling teeth it took so long and by the time I got to the end I had already guessed all the secrets anyway, (but of course you have to keep reading in case you're wrong). All in all I was not too keen on this story although there were some good descriptive narrative.
B0043A0U94|5.0|I've been listening to Billy Joel's, \\"52nd Street\\" on 24K Gold through all my   sources, the car stereo, in the office and on my home sound system. This is what   I normally do with new purchases - it's my version of a comparison test. I should   say I am a Billy Joel fan and \\"52nd Street\\" ranks high on my list of Joel-favorites.    Over the years I've listened to this classic recording on vinyl (33 1/3 and 45 rpm),   CD (first compact disc Columbia Records ever released) and a number of   different re-releases.   I'll be the first to admit the way I enjoy sound reproduction is subjective, unique to my demands and personal taste. With that said, I will boldly claim the high regard   in which I covett \\"52nd Street\\" allows no room for sub-standard additions to my   collection which is why I'm so pleased to report this current remastered rendition   from Audio Fidelity receives my highest praise.  This 24K Gold CD reveals a completely new listening experience to an album   I've enjoyed for over thirty years. I've never heard my favorite tracks sound as rich, bright and powerful. The familiar hits, 'Honesty,' 'My Life,' 'Big Shot' and 'Until the Night' would be acceptable to many fans in their usual clothing, but this recording elevates these popular tunes and reveals new and inspiring levels of sound design.  The evenness of the dynamic audio reproduction from start to finish,   opening track to final notes, weighs heavily on my conclusions. This may very well   be the most consistently well balanced version I've ever heard of the album -   holding up regardless of the system where it's played.  I should add the package contains a rather tasty, multi-page booklet that includes   all the original album photos, all the song lyrics and the original 12\\" record labels   (great for new fans and collectors).  This award winning album is considered by many one of the Greatest Albums of   All Time - I'll go as far as to claim this particular 24K Gold remaster can take its   place as the best re-release of Billy Joel's, \\"52nd Street\\" of all time.  It jumps to   the top of my list and I'm convinced all Billy Joel fans will share my enthusiasm.   An ear-opening experience reminiscent to the thrill of hearing the album for the   first time. An added bonus is this release has special Limited Edition numbers   attached to the outside box that encases the CD that along with the gold disc will   clearly add to its value for years to come - as if the pure listening pleasure wasn't   reward enough.
0307277453|2.0|I picked up Neil Shubin's book in the hopes of finding an interesting look at the evolutionary lineage of the human body.  And while some parts of the book manage to deliver on that premise, significant amounts of space are either wasted on personal stories, or spent discussing concepts that most with a background in the sciences would already understand well.<br />The standard format for each chapter is an opening vignette about either a professional or field experience (from Professor Shubin's paleontological work) related to some part of the anatomy or physiology of ancient organisms, then elaborating on how that developed, its evolutionary significance, and ultimately relating that to human biology.  It's an interesting topic to be sure, but it feels like the vignettes take up too much space and make the book read more like a memoir, while the science parts are spent educating the audience on basic concepts.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this sharpener recently. I am satisfied with this purchase, because of the following parameters:    1. Quality   2. Easy to use  - the sharpener is very quality, you need to place a blade of your knife in proper section and perform several movements and you can see how sharp your knife is.    3. Multifunctional - for steel, ceramic and serrated knifes.  4. Compact - very small, good to keep in a kitchen drawer or take with you for any outdoor activity.  5. Good price - I bought it for 8,99. In my opinion this is a reasonable price.
B003Y8YXH6|2.0|Take a great first album by a band with a dramatically good lead singer.  Tindersticks, for example.  On the first album, everything was balanced.  Music, vocals, reverb and other effects...all balanced to good effect so that the individual song, as a whole, was the focus.  Second album, gone is the balance.  Its all lead vocals, and the music pushed to the background.  Same here.  On the original mix, Lennon's voice was mixed in the context of the song.  Everything was balanced.  But, on the new remix, its all about Lennon's voice, so anything which might detract from that (background singers, reverb, compression) are all striped away, along with things like character and atmosphere.  The result, to me, is unlistenable.  Yes, I understand that John's voice was good.  I don't need that shoved down my throat (....well, ears) to appreciate that fact.  In particular, given his history of edgy recordings, I think John would have preferred the original mix, with any flaws, to the new declawed version.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|After seeing the movie \\"Avatar\\" in the theater I was absolutely stunned.  I was truely amazed.  I ordered the Blu ray version of the movie and was amazed of the superb and stunning visual effects.  This is the best Blu ray movie I have purchased.  Since I have added a surround sound home theater system to my 40 inch high definition TV, the sound is truely amazing and you get the true theater experience.  In the double disc version you get the regular DVD in addition to the Blu ray disc.  One feature I like about the Blu ray disc is that if you stop the movie at some point during the movie you can resume playback at where you left off so you can resume watching the film at some future time and you don't have to start over at the beginning of the movie.  You can simply resume playback where you left off and can continue watching the film where you left off before.  Furthermore, there is an option on the Blu ray disc for selecting captioning for someone who may be hearing impaired. A friend and I were watching the movie and we were playing around with the remote and we got the captioning to appear on the screen.  The words of what is being said in the film appear in very easy to read yellow wording at the bottom of the screen.  This is an excellent feature of the disc and I have not seen this feature on a disc before.  This captioning feature is great if you know someone who is hearing impaired so they can enjoy the film too.  To select captioning, (at least this is how its done on my Sony Blu ray remote), press the menu button on Blu ray remote, then select \\"setup\\" then select \\"subtitles\\" then select the language you want, (another nice feature) then turn from \\"off\\" to \\"on\\".  This Blu ray disc has so many options that I havent seen on other discs, (at least I havent noticed them on other discs before).    \\"Avatar\\" is fantastically done and the visual special effects are stunning and amazing.  Its a intriguing action packed space sci-fi adventure that takes place on the planet Pandora and the main idea behind the movie is where military and scientific personel try to convince the native humanoid species on Pandora, the Na'vi, to relocate from their \\"Hometree\\" so that the military can mine a very precious mineral that is in large quantities near \\"Hometree\\".  The story line has a spiritual message behind it which I found enlightening since I am quite spiritual myself.  For anyone who has or has not seen \\"Avatar\\" in the theater and is a sci-fi buff, the blu ray version is a must have.  I have always been a true sci-fi fan and in my opinion, \\"Avatar\\" is by far the best movie of its kind that is out there.  If you have a home theater system and high definition TV, you certainly won't be dissapointed in the quality of the sound and picture of the blu ray version and it will blow you away! The movie will enlighten and amaze you and you will be brought to a new home theater experience.
0393325172|4.0|I am most of the way through the Horatio Hornblower series and thought I would take a look at this series since they take place in the exact same timeframe and the hero has almost the same roles.  This is just the first book, but I am favorably impressed.  I still really like the Hornblower series, but there are enough differences in the main characters that I am intrigued enough to continue with this string of novels.<br /><br />I am enjoying getting to know a lot more about the warships of the early 19th century and though I don't know much about sailing, my engineering mind tells me that the problems and solutions in the novels are realistic.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction from this period or for those interested in action and adventure in general.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|When a film attains the success of The Dark Knight, it becomes hard for people to look at the film objectively. This is the third highest grossing film of all time, unanimously praised by critics and audiences alike; if someone calls it overrated, you can hardly blame them. I hadn't seen this film since it's theatrical release and decided to watch it again recently to see if was still as good as I remembered it...It was better.    With Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan brought new life to the Batman franchise. That film was a very strong film, but The Dark Knight is a complete change in tone from it. They could be stand-alone films barely sharing the same genre. The Dark Knight is neither an action film nor is it a traditional comic book film, but a crime-drama more in the vein of Heat and The Departed than Batman Begins.    What struck me about the film watching it again was how well written it is. The script (by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan) is very tight; every scene in the film is absolutely necessary to advance the plot and even with a 2 ½ hour running time, the film never seems long. Since his career began, Nolan has proved himself a born storyteller and The Dark Knight only further validates his ability with dialogue that is at times reminiscent of old Hollywood and scenes that are already iconic only two years after the film's release. As a director, Nolan can do it all and here he balances drama, suspense, and elaborate action sequences (with a remarkable lack of CGI) effortlessly. The film's terrific opening scene shows off Nolan's skill in both of these areas of filmmaking, as it's one of the most memorable opening scenes of the last several years setting the tone for the film and serving as an incredible introduction to the Joker.    The film is extremely well-made with an epic score (by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard), striking cinematography (by Wally Pfister), and an elaborately detailed production design (by Nathan Crowley) particularly standing out.     Much of the cast from Batman Begins returns here and have all settled nicely into their roles. Michael Caine (Alfred) and Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) are as charming and fatherly as ever. Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon is very impressive, bringing a great deal of humanity and likeability to a role that many actors couldn't convey. Cillian Murphy returns briefly as the Scarecrow seemingly to remind people that this film is a direct sequel. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel and has a much meatier role here, one that Holmes likely wouldn't have pulled off as well. Christian Bale solidifies his status as the best Batman to grace the screen balancing the charming, arrogant Bruce Wayne and the angry, violent Batman. Bale shows this character as the haunted soul that he is and really gets under the skin of Bruce Wayne, the man and what drives him. It's an impressive performance of an iconic comic-book character to say the least. While much has been made about his Batman voice (although it seems the blame should be placed more on post-production editing than Bale), I was never bothered by it. Is it excessive at times? Yes. But if a well-known billionaire playboy was also a masked vigilante, he'd probably have to make good and sure no one would recognize his voice.    Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's district attorney Harvey Dent (and later Two-Face, of course) really shines here. Eckhart does an extraordinary job taking a complicated character with an unbelievable character arc and making it believable. He really does not get enough credit for what he's done here.    Now, I must discuss Heath Ledger...Because everyone else has to whether saying anything new or not. Heath Ledger became the second person to win a posthumous Oscar for his performance, which has arguably attracted the most attention to the film. His Oscar win was not a sympathy vote nor does this sympathy play into the unanimous acclaim, nor the endearing popularity of this performance. Dead or alive, Ledger's performance would have been met with the same reaction as its a true revelation. As the most psychopathic, anarchic super-hero movie villain ever Ledger disappears into the role physically and otherwise. It's one of the best, most fascinating screen performances of the last decade. If anyone had attempted what Ledger does here it likely would've seemed campy and over-the-top. Ledger brings such nuance, control, energy, and presence to the screen. Look no further than the fundraiser scene between the Joker and Rachel for evidence. This was an actor who had not even begun to show the world what he was capable of and, in one of his final roles he created one of the most iconic, memorable screen villains in cinematic history.    The Dark Knight is one of the few summer blockbusters that actually stands as a great film, because of brilliant writing and brilliant performances. Ignoring its box-office take and all the hype that still surrounds it, it's clear that the film is not `overrated, it's just go good it can't be ignored. The Dark Knight is a high-minded popcorn movie, but most high-minded dramas aren't even this well-made. Yes, you will read at least one person anywhere talking about how \\"overrated\\" this movie is, but don't let that affect your own opinion of it. It's not one of my favorite films of all time, but it's a very good, very rich film that is a truly masterful piece of filmmaking. It's not a perfect film, but it's a superhero/comic book movie that transcends that genre. Objectively, you'd be hard-pressed to admit that this is not the best superhero movie ever made.    GRADE: A-
0316069485|5.0|The title tells the story.  The past and present clash as an old court case is brought back to the courtroom when new evidence is discovered.  A lawyer is given a unique opportunity as well says the title.<br /><br />Being an avid fan of Michael Connelly books, I wasn't expecting anything but excellence once again from him with THE REVERSAL.  In this book, he blends two of his series and creates a dynamic duo of law and crime.  Alternating points of view guide the reader to understand which character is front-and-center reinforced by his specialty of legal or detective work.  Good, believable plot with good characters holding it up along the way.<br /><br />I have always been a supporter of reading a series in order but I think this book would hold up well for anybody picking up Michael Connelly for the first time.  Sure, Harry Bosch has a bunch of books that help define him to the n'th degree but I think any new reader will get to know Harry really quick in THE REVERSAL.<br /><br />One of my favorites for 2010!
0345509617|5.0|I picked up this book at the local book store...started reading it and couldn't put it down.  There's lots of great art, matte paintings, and model shots that I've never seen before.  There's also quite a few photos of the actors and crew on set which were a lot of fun to look at.  I think one of my favorite things about this book however, is the honest portrayal (and sometimes word for word transcripts) of the conversations between the Director Irvin Kershner and his cast...Hamill, Fisher and Ford.  There's several pages devoted to the filming of the carbon freezing scene which is an absolutely terrific read.  You really get a good understanding of the actors' personalities while seeing the  struggles that the Director and Producers went through to bring this masterpiece to the screen.<br /><br />The book is a very good quality and seems well bound.  The artwork and pictures are printed very well with good color and resolution.  All in all, this is definitely a must have for Empire fans.  Enjoy it.
1439133948|5.0|I finished \\"Cryoburn\\" yesterday. It's the latest installment in the Vorkosigan series. I enjoyed it very much but I've spent a lot of today thinking back over the ending of the book. It's one of those things where you know something is coming but when it does in fact come it hits you like a punch in the gut. You can't go out and read \\"Cryoburn\\" and get that impact without reading the 16 books that precede it. There's a part of me that wishes that I was just being introduced to the Vorkosigan series today. Starting with \\"Shard's of Honor\\" and coming to know Aral and Cordelia and then being introduced to Miles and following his adventures through the series. I find myself tearing up when I have moments of quite. I don't know if Lois will keep the series going or if this is it. I'm hoping there will be more. I've never had a series of books that have moved me the way the Vorkosigan series has.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I've already bought the second book, so it's obvious I liked this Book #1 in the Jack Reacher series well enough. But . . . as others have said, this shrugging business is getting to me. It's obvious Lee Child has a decent vocabulary -- not Shakespeare, but fine for this genre -- so time to find a different way of expressing indecision.<br /><br />And even a very-long-in-the-tooth reader like myself finds Jack attractive. But . . . yeah, there it is again: an apparently gorgeous policewoman is putting her job at considerable risk, jumping into the sack with him at first opportunity, getting him an untraceable gun, shrugging....<br /><br />Still, a good read. Lots of action; some of it highly unlikely and over-the-top, but you won't be bored.
0316067938|3.0|This book left the realm of fantasy and entered the realm of What the Hell Just Happened Here? Bella getting pregnant? Bella drinking blood as a human? Bella being ripped open by Edward? Jacob falling in love with her baby? It's all very strange, though I was entertained enough by it to give it a 3, perhaps I never really cared that much about the characters in the first place.
0316098337|2.0|Okay, I'm not usually this harsh.  But \\"Jack is a normal 5 year old?\\"  Actually, he's exactly the opposite.  I couldn't get through the first chapter of this.  He understands negative numbers and yet can't speak/think in anything nearing a complete sentence?  This makes me certain that either the writer never had kids or has completely forgotten what they're like.  Or simply was trying too hard.  They have trouble with tenses but their language far exceeds their ability with abstract concepts like negatives.  Nitpicking?  Well, the character just felt completely wrong, like an adult trying to make up what they thought a kid was like.      I kept reading enough because my wonder was whether he's supposed to be some sort of savant.  He knows the exact names of these pictures?   But then I looked back again at the synopsis and there is was, \\"Jack is a normal five year old...\\".  Sorry, if you can't get your character even close, you lose me right off.    And honestly, how much of \\"she gets out of Bed and goes to Thermostat to hot the air\\" can someone read?  Maybe if I could I'd love this book and be impressed but I'm afraid I can't.
1847245560|3.0|While the author certainly made me care about the characters in the story there were some parts that I just skimmed over; I think a lot of the book could have been edited away.
1572816112|5.0|While the artistic design of this deck is unlike any other I own or have seen, it is also faithful to the Rider-Waite basics of design and symbolism to ease in reading. I especially like that there are people (?) of color in the mix. Many of the designs have a primitive, tribal feel--and the \\"deviant\\" part is weird enough to really be fun without being a turn-off. These cards are strong and high-quality, with gorgeous, lush coloring and gilded edges. As a professional Tarot reader, I am excited to offer these to my clients as an option.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|\\"Take me to bed, or lose me forever\\" - classic Top Gun. As well, as National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, this is a Christmas special in our household - ensuring we watch it at least once a year. \\"Permission to fly by\\", will normally result in someone pegging a Christmas chocolate at you. The soundtrack is awesome, and Tom Cruise could not be more attractive. An oldie, but a goodie. No DVD collection is complete without this movie.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I am a complete fan of Lost, and I love all of the seasons.  This was an interesting season.  If you like thinking about what you are watching and brainstorming about it, then this show is just right for you.  And everything definately gets more complicated and in depth as you progress through the seasons.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Christmas movie ever made. Our family watches every year at Christmas. It's fantastic. Chevy Chase's efforts to put on a family Christmas are hilarious, and the visiting family really make the movie. Lieing around as a family on Christmas Day, and letting all the good food digest, while laughing at other's misfortunes is perhaps not in the spirit of Christmas, but it's how it works at our house. \\"Drumroll please...\\" and \\"Shitter's full!\\" are hollered across the loungeroom by all always a couple of seconds before the actors say it on screen. A must see Christmas classic!
B000099T3P|5.0|25 years after the making of this little gem I finally sat down to give it a try. I love everything about this movie especially the little terror striking fur balls!!! These little guys pack a hellava punch and turn up in really inopportune times.<br /><br />Aside from the space guys heading to earth in what appears to be a ship made at the last minute on a Hollywood lot somewhere, this film is extremely fun to watch.<br /><br />Lots of gun fire, explosions and shotgun blasted critters in this one...<br /><br />Can't wait to see Critters 2, 3, and 4!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />This film has some serious BALLS.<br /><br />That's right. This kids film is some ballsy stuff. Ballsier than Apocalypse Now. OK, you may eviscerate me now!!<br /><br />Being a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 when I was a kid, I knew I was in for a serious ride when I went to the 4 PM IMAX screening on opening day. As I walked into the the theater, I had to tell myself that this is it, this is the last Toy Story movie ever, that I will never see another Toy Story movie again. So as the movie began playing, I prepared myself to say goodbye to my favorite walking talking toys.<br /><br />This movie is simply a gem. I had anticipated it all the way back when I saw the trailer with Up. The whole theatre went \\"Oh COME ON!!!!\\" when they found out they had to wait a year to see it.<br /><br />Toy Story shows that Andy has grown up now, is going to college. The toys have been donated to a local daycare, which may seem like a happy place to all the other toys, but Woody can't shake the fact that the person he grew up with, Andy, is away from him now. Sunnyside Daycare has rowdy kids though, who do nothing but destroy the toys. Even worse, Lotso Huggin Bear, Ken, all the others seem nice, but are evil and cruel bastards. Furthermore, Buzz has been reprogrammed to be on Lotso's side. Oh no! The toys must reprogram him, and furthermore, get the HELL out of Sunnyside!!!<br /><br />The film is, in a word, spectacular. I was expecting it to suck, but surprise surprise!!! I loved this film. Great voice acting, great direction, animation is spectacular, and the best thing of the film? The darkness. One incredible scene is where the toys face death as they find themselves in the furnace near the end of the film. That scene had me on the edge of my seat, and hit me like a big bag of bricks. Just powerful, incredible stuff. And BOY did I cry like a baby at the end!!!<br /><br />Overall, it's time to say goodbye to Woody and Co, and TS3 is the perfect opportunity to do so.
B0047ZF5VI|5.0|Daniel Lanois, Trixie Whitley, Brian Blade and Daryl Johnson work well together creating excellent music and also a powerful experience. No regrets in getting this.
030726999X|4.0|Lovely book, well written. The names in the first version were quite confusing, and actually stayed that way all through until the end. That being the only downside, after having finished the first half of the first book, I fell in love with the series. They grabbed me and kept me up late at night, as I could not sleep without knowing what was to happen next. I think the second book is my absolute favourite.
0385528752|5.0|If you can believe that someone would have a job like this, my day job is that of a change management specialist, so I read this book with keen interest. I won't recap the points of the book as they're recapped in other reviews, but I will say that I was very impressed with the book.    Just like in [[ASIN:1400064287 Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die]] (the authors' previous work), Dan and Chip Heath draw heavily on psychological research, real-world case studies and personal experience to drive the material in Switch. Right there, I was impressed; most business books rely heavily on personal experience (Lee Iaccoca comes to mind for some reason) or weak research (Good to Great). These guys are simply packaging up existing research and combining it together effectively (a la Malcolm Gladwell). However, they go beyond Gladwell in that they actually create a useful methodology.    I can also say that from surveying other readings on the topic, there are many similarities (although don't let that dissuade your from getting the book). Most of the readings that I've done reduce change into 2 aspects, motivation to change and ability to change, and this book is no exception. What I especially liked about Switch is that it focuses heavily on the motivational side, which is by far the most difficult. In fact, even when it is focusing on increasing the ability to change, it does so in a way that decreases the need for creating motivation.    In terms of the tone and the writing style, the authors make the book very easy to read and digest, following their own advice in \\"Made to Stick\\". Though one reviewer found all the stories more inspirational than practical, I think that the authors are simply drawing on the research in \\"Made to Stick\\" that shows stories to be an effective way to drive action through simulation (as well as being inspirational). I also found the case studies scattered through the book to be an effective teaching tool.    The authors alsomake a number of resources available for free on the website, heathbrothers.com. Buy the book, go to the website, and start using the material if you need to make a change happen!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this film.  It is good entertainment and Jake did a great job as usual.
B003YWUTKM|4.0|Like something from a fan's fantasy, the pairing of David Gilmour and Alex Patterson (with Youth and other talented musicians on hand as well) sounds like a dream come true.  Gilmour's spacy guitar work blends nicely with Patterson's soundscapes--most of the time. There are some places where the transitions are a little jarring and some elements don't quite mix well. But on a whole, this is a really enjoyable album. The two tracks clock in at around 20 minutes each, and they break down into 5 sub-songs that flow from one to next.<br /><br />01 Metallic Side is more Gilmour's while 02 Sphere Side is more The Orb's. These are more soundscapes than true songs but make for great ambient background music. I like to play them on repeat while at work. I never tire of them and find some new elements with just about every listen. The mastering is very well done as one would expect, and headphone sessions are a real treat. I didn't get the deluxe 2-CD version includes an extra disc featuring the new 3D60 process. It allows a 360-degree sound experience on stereo tracks without any special equipment and is supposed to be pretty amazing.<br /><br />Fans of either of these musicians won't be disappointed with Metallic Spheres. While the music isn't groundbreaking, it does show off two artists doing what they do best. Musical noodling never sounded so good!<br />Visit the metallicspheres dot com website for tracks sampling and some extras.
B000E1ZK5A|1.0|This movie was based on the capture of a U - boat during WWII by the Royal Navy who recovered its Enigma machine and prevented the crew informing the Kriegsmarine (Nazi navy) HQ.    As well as historical inaccuracy the acting is hopeless and the sub - plots totally unbelievable.  There is more realism in a Disney cartoon.    Watch \\"Das Boot\\" instead and get a copy of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" (1952) starring Jack Hawkins, Denholm Elliot and Viginia McKenna if you want to see exciting, realistic submarine warfare from above and below the waves.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Very entertaining, great action sequences. Robert Downey Junior is wonderful as Tony Stark, very egotistical; perfect for the part.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|Like many others out there, I loved watching the first `Paranormal Activity', because it was one of the few movies that year that actually scared me, and made me lose sleep for a few nights after viewing it. So I knew I had to go see `Paranormal Activity 2', and this is my review on it.     Synopsis: The Rey family has just moved into their new home. The family consists of Dan (the father), his wife Kristi (who is also the sister of Katie from movie 1), their baby boy Hunter, and Ali, Dan's teenage daughter from his first marriage. As soon as they move in, one day they notice the furniture in most of the rooms wrecked, except Hunter's room, but nothing is stolen as such. They assume it was probably a break-in, and install security cameras around the house to catch anyone trying to break in again.     As the days pass, strange incidents that occurring in the house that no one can explain. Dan doesn't witness any of the paranormal activity as such, and therefore refuses to believe that there is something supernatural happening in the house. Kristi starts experiencing some activities, but Katie tells her not to react on it, or it would just get worse. The only person who really starts taking the activities seriously is Ali, because initially she thinks that her mother is trying to reach her, but after researching further, she figures out what the root cause of the paranormal activities are. Can the Rey family survive whatever's inhibiting the house before its too late?     NOTE: My review below contains quite a few spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know what is going to happen, please skip ahead and read the last paragraph.     Review: Although many people consider Paranormal Activity 2 to be one of those movies that you either love it or hate it, I actually had mixed feelings with this movie. While I liked it for the most part, I felt that there were some aspects to the story that made me slightly disappointed with it.     What I liked: I loved how the story takes place in the timeline that coincides with the first movie, as this answered a lot of my questions as to what happens in the first movie as well. We get to see why Kristi starts experiencing the paranormal activities, and how this in turn affects Katie in the first movie as well. Most of the horror movies sequels that I have watched either take place before or after the first movie's timeline, so I really enjoyed how `Paranormal Activity 2' timeline stars off before the first movie and gradually catches up to it and goes beyond it.     I also enjoyed the fact that the story was paced really well, and staying true to the first movie, we see the activities starting to occur gradually in the house. The cast also did a great job in their performances, and it was great to see Katie and Micah make appearances in this one as well. The house itself looked really lavish, and I also liked the idea viewing the occurrences through security cameras around the house.     What disappointed me (spoiler alert): While the movie had some really terrifying moments to it (like the cupboards all opening at once), I think the major part of the story that ruined my experience was towards the end. I still don't want to give away the scene for those who didn't see the movie yet, but there is a scene where the entire family goes to the basement to basically get rid of the demon. While I can understand that this is one of the main parts that links this movie to its predecessor, it just seemed really unrealistic that Dan, who never believed in any of these things till moments before the end, could suddenly (with the help of Martine the maid) perform an exorcism so easily in around 10 minutes to get the demon transferred to another body. I'm sorry, but this seemed like a lame way to link the two movies together, and it felt that the writers got lazy towards the end and just came up with this idea in the last minute. I would have enjoyed the story better, if say they brought in the psychiatrist (from the first movie who comes to Katie's house regularly), or someone from the church etc. to remove the demon from Kristi. The main idea of the father doing this in the end, and his family still living in the same house after that, and not to mention that we never find out what happened to the maid after that incident etc. just seemed a little ludicrous to me.     Also, because a lot of questions are answered in this movie as to why the paranormal presence is targeting the family (and also Katie's family), this movie didn't have that eerie effect on me like the first movie did, because the first movie had a lot of questions that were unanswered (like why the presence wouldn't let go of Katie), so it left a lot of theories open for interpretation, and I enjoyed this aspect about it. Whereas, in this movie, we find out why everything is happening, so there's no room for interpretation. We just get to see how the family tackles the demon, and while I enjoyed this, it didn't scare me in anyway or make me lose any sleep over it like how the first one did.     Overall, I think if the explanations for the incidents in the story were explained in a better manner, I would have loved this movie, and even considered it better than the first movie. However, because of my problems with the scene mentioned above, `Paranormal Activity 2' still remains a good sequel, but not as good as the first movie.
B00022M518|4.0|Right off the bat, I want to state that I fully acknowledge the genius of Brian Eno. He isn't the best technical player of keyboards/pianos but he is very adept and his ideas rank with some of the other geniuses of the classic rock era such as Dylan, Lennon, and Reed. He really truly does go for an album unlike any other made prior to this one. It's a great debut and maybe the best debut of the mid-70's. However, unless you plan on getting all of his 70's albums, DO NOT start with Here Come the Warm Jets because it is flat-out weird and doesn't represent Eno in all his multifaceted glory. The album is only half-great. The album starts out fantastic: I simply love \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye\\", \\"Paw-Paw Negro Blowtorch\\", and \\"Baby's On Fire\\". These songs are totally mesmerizing and hypnotic. The lyrics on the first song are somewhat hard to decipher, but it's very easy to get caught up in the exuberance of the guitars and synths. \\"Paw-Paw Negro Blowtorch\\" is quintessential Eno because it is equally experimental and listenable at the same time. \\"Baby's On Fire\\" is perhaps the best song on the album because of how it is so uniquely structured and the masterful guitar solo by Robert Fripp. The lyrics are very weird and psychotic but Fripp's excellent guitar work on this song will definitely make you FORGET about the weirdness. What makes Fripp's solo on \\"Baby's On Fire\\" one of the all-time greats is how it manages to combine the technical prowess of Clapton with the emotional intensity of Hendrix into one and I am not totally exaggerating when I say that either. \\"Cindy Tells Me\\" is okay but \\"Driving Me Backwards\\" is not. \\"Driving Me Backwards\\" is extremely experimental and if you are not in the mood for this kind of music, it might come across to you as nails on a chalkboard. \\"Blank Frank\\" is an example of a successful experiment. It is uptempo and not too weird and has good imagery (you can actually picture this character in your mind while listening to the song). \\"Dead Finks Don't Talk\\" is one of Eno's best melodies ever, backed by serene drum beats and elegant singing. The song can be described as an experimental ballad, melancholy yet enjoyable. \\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\" is a superb album closer that builds and builds and then fades away in precise Eno fashion. My overall feelings on the album is that I wish Eno kept things uptempo the way he did on \\"Needles In the Camel's Eye\\" and \\"Blank Frank\\". The only bad song really is \\"Driving Me Backwards\\" and it's really not that bad. Get this as your first Eno album ONLY if you plan on buying all of his 70's output. However, if you do not plan on getting all of his 70's output, start with Before and After Science or Another Green World instead. Those two masterpieces are much more accomplished and enjoyable, although maybe not quite as visionary or influential as this one.Finks Don't Talk\\" is one of Eno's best melodies ever, backed by serene drum beats and elegant singing.

0321344758|5.0|Practicing what he preaches throughout his 2nd edition of \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" Krug gives the reader a quick yet deep change in perspective on how one perceives the web, in a book that can be completed on a short flight.  Even the text layout itself is presented by Krug in a `satisficable' format, as if in a branding effort similar to that of a site.  The idea of `satisficing' - scanning for the first reasonable option as opposed to taking the time to find the `best option' before clicking, is one of the first major common senses Krug emphasizes.  The conversational flow of content adds to the ease at which one absorbs these points, especially because as you read through, you feel as if you're sitting at a coffee shop with your favorite professor while he casually tells you how he really feels on the topic.    While starting off, seemingly, as a broad overview of general usability, one questions whether or not this fun-to-read looking book will actually have anything other than fluff to offer - once you read a bit more, you realize that in its simplicity, major back-to-the-beginning lessons are going to become very salient points.  This in itself is essentially his point.  A website should be easy to understand, `muddle through,' and should only have the absolute essential information on it.  Krug demonstrates these overall points himself: he breaks everything down in plain English, organizes the ride in a way that makes sense, and keeps it to 200 pages. This is a major lesson: get rid of half of what is on the page, and then get rid of half of what is left.  This of course seems impossible, but once you work through some of his examples, and review his interpretation a few pages later, you realize how obvious this actually is.  Many of his points hit home in a similar vein.    One of the major `aha' moments for me happened after a few chapters of the baby boomer culture references Krug consistently makes use of (i.e. comparing some sites to a letter from Publisher's Clearing House, or comparing browsing to standing in Sears).  These `dated' references explain things in a way that my parents would understand, which made me realize, particularly after reading the testing chapter (which may be the best example of overlooked common sense), that designers completely forget to make their design appropriate for the older generation, and users with little web familiarity.  Basically, if your mom, who still thinks yahoo is the internet, can understand your site, then you've got a winner.  How easy is that?      While Krug's lessons can be interpreted as classically Norman and Nielsen reminiscent in an underlying manner (i.e. his section on why tabs work), his points are always easy to understand immediately as a novice.  It's sometimes as if you already knew all of this somewhere in the back of your head.  This is a great introduction on usability and testing with minimal technical implications, which gives the reader a sense of what there is to learn about the subject as a whole, while providing the tools and recommended further reading to dig deeper once finished as added value.      Posting this review on Amazon will hopefully greatly please Krug, who nearly gives the site a perfect usability score.  Probably because it is the only site my mom would ever muddle through successfully to a review of any book.
1400052173|5.0|This book is a wonderful combination of a heartbreaking story of one woman and her family, the science behind the world of tissue culture, and the ethics surrounding the advances in science in today's society. As someone who is actively involved in medical research and who has worked with HeLa cells in the past, I never considered where the cell lines that I was working with came from. This book made me realize how many things we scientists take for granted. Today, there are many regulations and guidelines regarding ethics in medicine and science research in general--rules for how to treat human research subjects, human embryos, stem cells, and laboratory animals. However, it wasn't always so and this book serves as a reminder to those in the medical and science fields, and those that will eventually reap the benefits of such research (in the form of medicine, fertility treatments, vaccines, etc.), that research ethics must be an ever-present concern throughout the research process. HeLa cells have contributed to huge advances in medicine, as explained in the book (like the polio vaccine, AIDS treatments, Parkinson's treatments, and more), and we should be ever indebted to Henrietta Lacks and her unknowing contribution to what science and medicine are today.
B002WY65VU|4.0|There's something fascinating about a zombie. The flesh-eating, unstoppable undead provide a medium to laugh at, pity, and fear. When I became aware of the Zombieland movie, it was one that I knew I'd have to see.<br /><br />The film is typical of any other zombie film: plague turns people into zombies and leave only a small remnant of survivors, all trying to cope with the affects of Zombie Apocalypse. The characters--the college loner Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), the Twinkie seeking zombie slayer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and the Pacific Playland Bound Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin)--are all fun to watch interact with each other, and their onscreen chemistry is easily noticeable.<br /><br />Much of the movie is simple and straightforward. It is narrated by Columbus, who has a set of rules he's gone by to stay alive. When Columbus meets Tallahassee, the real sparks begin to fly, and Harrelson steals nearly every scene. I found myself rolling many times at some of the jokes that were said.<br /><br />While Zombieland deals with scary elements, the film is mostly light-hearted and funny. However, there were a few times when I jumped from suspense, which made the film even more enjoyable. The characters' backgrounds are revealed through dialogue and flashbacks, and these are really the parts of the film that are sobering. By adding in a taste of humanity, the film invokes pity and sorrow for the characters, which can work as a good or bad thing for the movie.<br /><br />This is not a film I would recommend for children, nor for people that want to avoid swearing and gore. (In yesterday's post I mentioned how I don't like gore, but for some reason zombie gore doesn't seem to bother me one bit.) Zombie blood and zombie sick was a-plenty, and if you like the thrill of hewing down a zombie, you'll like this movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was really fun to watch and experience. A famous celebrity made a cameo that was hysterical, and most of the banter between characters was hilarious. If you're looking for a stiff-hearted, post-apocalyptic zombie film, filled with intense and scary moments, then this is not the movie for you. If, on the other hand, you'd rather laugh with (and at) the undead, then I heartily recommend it. Like the words of Columbus' Rule #32: \\"Enjoy the little things,\\" and enjoy the movie.arious.

0399156577|3.0|I was actually afraid to buy this book on Kindle because of the reviews that I read beforehand.  To touch on a couple comments by other reviewers that gave me pause- I did not find this book to be a glorified dog training manual as some have said.  Fiona's whole life revolves around her work as a trainer and search & rescue team member and the whole premise behind her meeting Simon and Jaws is training him so it would be really weird if there was not a lot of training techniques and info built into this book.  I found it realistic and well-researched and something that did not detract at all from my enjoyment of the book.  The other major theme in the reviews was what a jerk Simon was and how his relationship with Fiona was unrealistic.  On that point I do kind of agree.  There were several times where NR was actually justifying his behavior by having Fiona state his motivation and how much it helped her through whatever situation they were in at the time.  It just didn't ring true to me.  He was a jerk and over the top about it at times and I doubt any self-respecting female would simper over his behavior as Fiona did.      The story was good but not great.  The mystery was ho-hum and I did find that Simon and Fiona were way too able to see into the mind of the killers for being mere civilians.  They acted more like profilers.  By the end the story was kind of dragging for me.  It was not suspenseful and did not have me on the edge of my seat at all.  What majorly detracted from this book for me was the absolutely foul language that regularly flew out of the mouths of these characters.  Simon in particular, but also Fiona.  Why it is necessary to throw the \\"f\\" bomb around so much I don't know, but I think Nora must have forgotten she was not writing an \\"In Death\\" book here.  I cringed way too much while reading this book and am sad she feels the need to use that kind of language.  Overall I did like it for the most part, but I do think the Kindle price was too highfor the quality of this book.  I kind of wish I would have just checked it out from the library.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|To be fair, I've never watched a single episode or movie of the Star Trek franchise. What I know about it (\\"Beam me up, Scotty,\\" phasers, \\"Live Long and Prosper,\\" and Klingon) all comes from being ingrained into pop-culture. Plus, as a lifetime STAR WARS fan, I just assumed Star Trek was my arch-enemy. That said, I now offer my review of the newest franchise film.<br /><br />Star Trek begins with an exciting action sequence, filled with beautiful space imagery and fantastic technology. This spectacular display of future technology does not cease throughout the film, and it doesn't get old, either. The Starfleet spacecraft U.S.S. Enterprise, as well as the Romulun ship the Narada, are both visually stunning. The special effects throughout the film were all well done and only slightly cheesy a few times (a green-skinned woman? What?). Watching the fate of Vulcan was mesmerizing. Overall, I found the imagery of the movie Grade A eye candy.<br /><br />The second aspect of the film I enjoyed was the intense action scenes. The few battle scenes between individuals, especially when the Starfleet crew arrived at Vulcan, were all entertaining to watch (albeit not as exciting as a lightsaber duel, but that's a different matter entirely). Abrams pumped adrenaline throughout the movie, and anyone seeking an action movie would surely enjoy this film.<br /><br />For the most part the plot of the film was enjoyable, too, but not completely. To remain spoiler free there was a large problem with physics and continuity and reality that I felt would have been better explained using a different mechanism. The red-matter technology had some cool stuff to it, but the implications regarding timelines felt a bit too much. Sometimes this mechanism works (like Lost) and sometimes it doesn't (like Heroes). Besides this, the story of Kirk and Spock were both intriguing, and if you could forget about some things the conquest of the Romulans was cool, too.<br /><br />In the end, Star Trek was a worthwhile movie to watch. I was entertained and thought the special effects were amazing. The story was good, but not great, due to a few fickle things I didn't like. Keisha, on the other hand, had no problems with it, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. If you're looking for a thrill-ride, sci-fi, eye-pleasing movie to watch during the Christmas season that's available on DVD, I'd recommend Star Trek.entertained and thought the special effects were amazing.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent to Ashecliff Hospital to investigate the disappearance of a patient.  The hospital is a unique institution, the only one of its kind in the world.  It houses the most severe of the criminally insane and is located on an island twelve miles from the nearest shore.<br /><br />I was expecting a lot from this movie.  Many of the reviews I've read have hailed it as a true horror movie, but after seeing the film I'm not so sure about that assessment.  While there were some suspenseful scenes, I think I only jumped one time, and that was just because the speakers were way too loud.<br /><br />Perhaps the problem with tagging Shutter Island as a horror movie is that there is no accepted definition for \\"horror.\\"  What may terrify one person might make another laugh.  There are things in the movie that are creepy, macabre, strange, even ghostly, all the elements of a classic horror motif, but I failed to have any real fear.<br /><br />That's not to say that the movie is bad.  No, in fact, I enjoyed the movie, with reservations.  The meat of the story (though somewhat predictable... I had one character pegged from the moment I first saw him) centers on guilt.  Teddy served during WWII and helped liberate a death camp and he has severe post-war trauma.  His wife died while he was at work and he feels responsible for that.  Teddy is a walking bag of mixed emotions, trying to come to grips with life and accept it.  This, truly, is the main story, but even it was not altogether engrossing.<br /><br />The best thing about Shutter Island was the island itself.  The set design was beautiful.  The film takes place in 1954, and Scorsese's directorial eye captured this time period gracefully.  The Ashecliff hospital's grounds are beautiful and well manicured.  The buildings are old but attractive.  The costumes are perfect.  Then there's the darker side of the island.  The prison side.  Ward C, an old Civil War-era building that's home to the most violent of the patients, was definitely the creepiest part of the film.  The lighthouse and its mystery.  The caves.<br /><br />Indeed, watching the film was enjoyable.  I think I went in expecting something grand, and my sights were set to high.  I felt the conclusion was underwhelming, and I was certainly prepared for it.  The film was slow at times, especially Teddy's flashbacks to the War, but there was just enough intrigue to keep me watching.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Shutter Island, but at the same time I was a little disappointed.  The acting was superb.  The set was beautiful.  The sounds were pleasant.  The plot, however, the main crux of any movie, dropped the ball.  I can recommend seeing the movie, but waiting for a matinee or the DVD release wouldn't be a bad idea.that's home to the most violent of the patients, was definitely the creepiest part of the film.

B003XX2PD6|5.0|4th album from Atlanta, Georgia band whose appeal continues to grow.  \\"Halcyon Digest\\" has<br />  some amazingly understated/orchestrated exploratory indie pop/rock that manages to be<br />  consistently surprising & innovative, while maintaining a primitive, gut-level appeal.  These are<br />  absolutely gorgeous, insanely beguiling, dreamy pop songs, with a fresh feel of naturally<br />  serendipitous authenticity.  It's as though Bradford Cox isn't trying to write great songs; he just<br />  processes the world around him & this is what happens.  There is an abundance of perfectly<br />  placed guitars threaded around the subtly affecting vocals, and surrounded by an assortment of<br />  strange, oddly warm sounds.  Includes members of Atlas Sound, Lotus Plaza.  Another contender<br />  for this year's best!
B003XKPPOU|4.0|I should preface this post by saying that it's been a long time since I've seen Toy Story or Toy Story 2.  I do remember that I enjoyed them both, finding their stories entertaining and their humor satisfying.  Plus, the characters are memorable and iconic.  That said, I had a certain expectation for Toy Story 3, namely that I would laugh and that I would get a good story.  Did the movie achieve these things for me?<br /><br />Toy Story 3 takes place several years after the first two films.  Andy is getting ready to head off to College (not some unnamed university or college, but College).  His childhood toys--Woody, Buzz, the Potatoheads, etc.--have all been left behind and stored in a toy box for years.  As Andy grew up, he stopped playing with them, and now that he's going off to College he no longer needs them.<br /><br />The film opens with a glorious battle between the toys in their play universe.  All the favorites are there.  The action is high.  The fun is great.  But then when real life hits, when we find that the toys are desperate for attention once again, all the fun seems to stop.  By accident, the toys end up at a daycare where things aren't as happy as they seemed.  The kids there are rough and hard on toys, uncaring that they break or are damaged.  The daycare serves as the main plot for the movie, introducing new characters with exciting potential.<br /><br />A lot of stuff happens, things that test friendship, loyalty, and self-importance, and the toys (namely Woody) end up changed.  The conclusion was a sappy, probably unrealistic scene that tried to jerk at tears that I didn't feel like shedding.  Am I heartless?  No.  It succeeded in that it had me thinking about my childhood, waxing nostalgic, but I never had a favorite toy that I cared deeply about, let along a sack full.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  Toy Story 3 offers a great adventure story.  There were times when I was unsure how the toys were going to manage.  The plot is fun and original.  But what was missing was the humor.  Long has Pixar been a studio that produces films of exceptional stories and high comedic values.  I laughed once or twice, but nothing like I've done with past Pixar films.  And that is where the film suffers.  If there was more clever humor, more oddball funny situations, I might have enjoyed it better, but sadly there was not.<br /><br />On a plus note, the animation was beautiful.  The junkyard scenes were fantastic.  The characters are seamless and smooth.  Even the human characters are better looking, still maintaining their CG animated characteristics but looking more realistic while not crossing the line into Realism.  And the toys were all well crafted and created.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 let me down.  Perhaps it's because it's been a while since I've seen the last ones.  Perhaps it's because I had my standards too high.  Maybe I'm not the target audience?  Whatever it is, I can only recommend this movie to diehard Pixar fans (I'm a fan, but I don't think diehard is a word I'd use to describe my devotion) or Toy Story fans.  Of course, I couldn't expect Pixar to never mess up, and after a dozen mostly-fantastic films, this one blip isn't going to change my opinion of them.  I'm sure they'll be back with a new, grand story, and when it's there, I'll watch it happily.<br /><br />(Note: I saw the 2d version.  I still don't understand the fascination with 3d cinema, and I hope by not purchasing the 3d tickets I'm sending a small message to somebody that I don't want that technology to stick around.  Sadly, I'd say I'm in for a rude awakening.)the humor.  Long has Pixar been a studio that produces films of exceptional stories and high comedic values.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up is probably one of the funniest Pixar films, and I had to wipe my eyes frequently to clear the tears of laughter. There are three reasons why Up was supremely satisfying.<br /><br />First, the movie is visually breathtaking. I watched the film in 3-d, which meant that I wore the goofy glasses. This was the first movie I have ever seen in 3-d, and it was awesome. I was like a little kid seeing a lightsaber fight for the first time. In addition to 3-d, the storyboards and animation was beautiful. Vibrant colors and exotic scenes dominated the screen, and I was completely absorbed in the art.<br /><br />The second reason Up was a great movie was the humor in the movie. As I've already mentioned, the film was hilarious. Not just a few laughs, mind you, but whole-theatre laugh-out-loud-for-several-moments funny. The main two characters, grumpy old Mr. Fredricksen and young and clumsy Russell, are wonderfully dynamic with each other, each completing the others comedy. Plus, Kevin and Dug are hysterical.<br /><br />Finally, Up succeeds because of the story. Like books, movies often fail if the story is weak. The writers for Up created a heart-wrenching but soul-laughing story, and the director knew where and when to stir each emotion. Mr. Fredricksen is a widower and Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer looking to earn a badge for his scout troop, and the two form an unlikely duo. The development of their relationship propels the plot with a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Overall, this was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I'll even confess that not all of the tears that came to my eyes were from laughter. The film was fantastic, especially in 3-d, and I urge you all to go and watch it. Take your special someone, your kids, your friends, or your robot-nanny and watch it. Unless you have a heart of stone, I guarantee you'll feel your emotions tugged, too.
0698116496|1.0|Don't get me wrong, the actual story and illustrations are amazing! Our son has the hard bound version of this book and we've read it to him probably 100+ times. We ordered this book to give as a birthday present. It's the soft bound version, which normally isn't an issue. The color and print quality are poor and it looks as if it's been color copied. There's a strange white border around all the inside pages and there are also oddly designed end sheets that add to the \\"home made\\" feel. I was embarrassed to have to give this book as a gift.
B00164KYV4|3.0|HJSNTIY is a girl movie at heart, so I was biased from the get-go. However, as the film unfolded I found myself drawn in, like a puppy to a bowl of 'forbidden' food. The movie follows several different characters as they search for true love. One couple is married (Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper). One couple doesn't necessarily believe in marriage (Ben Afleck and Jennifer Anniston). Two girls just want to be a couple (Gennifer Goodwin and Drew Barrymore). Two guys also want to be couples, though they don't know it yet (Kevin Connolly and Justin Long). And then there's one girl (Scarlett Johansson) that's just disgusting in her actions. And that's not all of the stars that are in the movie, but you get the point.<br /><br />Anyway, the film is basically a mosaic at first, presenting the viewer with a quote that happens to set the scene for what's coming up. This mosaic introduces you to the many, many different characters that are all indirectly inter-related. People start to date or fall apart or whatever. And then the second half of the movie throws the \\"quote\\" thing out the window and follows the choices the people have made.<br /><br />My problem with this movie was that there were too many characters, or too many connections. I can handle that when it's presented over a long bout of time (like in Lost), but when it's crammed into a 2-hour spot it's too much. It's like A and B are together, but B falls for C, who happens to be with D, who is best friends with E. F and G are in a relationship, and G is B's best friend. H is looking for a relationship and gets help and advice from her co-workers, A and F. And that's not even half of it. I'm sure the creators used some sort of flow chart or matrix to work everything out. Overall, the plot was semi-interesting, but I only really cared about a few of the characters. Nothing fantastic with this one.

I have 3 biographies of Keith and 15 Stones books, but this is by far the best and most informative.  Love his writing style - it feels like you are having a personal converstion with Keith.  The highlight of my year, bookwise.  Read it! You won't be sorry.
B00288KNL8|4.0|I recently rented and watched Coraline, the movie adapted from a Neil Gaiman novel by the same name. I was pretty impressed with the film, and it was quite pleasing to watch and experience.<br /><br />The movie is about a young girl, Coraline, who moves into a new apartment-house. Her parents are both very busy working on their gardening catalog, which they hope to sell and make lots of money, so Coraline is left seeking parental love. She's also bored in her new place, surrounded by strange and quirky neighbors. A neighborhood kid gives her a doll that happens to look a lot like her, though it has buttons for eyes.<br /><br />Things start getting strange for Coraline, and the line between reality and fantasy is blurred masterfully. The way the movie is filmed is aesthetically beautiful, yet slightly strange and twisted, reminiscent of Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride.<br /><br />All in all, I liked the movie. The visual effects were amazing, the accompanying music fitting, and the story intriguing. It seems like a great movie for a child, as I imagine their eyes would be wide with wonder at what they are seeing. The movie is available in 3-d, if you happen to have glasses or something to watch it in, which could make it even more enjoyable. I can easily recommend this movie to you for a family film, or simply as a snuggle-up-and-watch-a-movie-together film, too.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|I was really excited to go see District 9 in the theater. The movie had a lot of hype, with the viral advertising and crazy-awesome website. The producer is also Peter Jackson, the genius behind the Lord of the Rings films. Plus, the story is about aliens and humans, and their interaction, which I thought sounded interesting.<br /><br />Basically, twenty years ago the alien ship came to rest directly over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. After some time, the human race decided to enter the vessel, thereupon discovering the malnourished alien specie. Thus, District 9 was established in the country, serving as a refugee camp for the stranded aliens.<br /><br />As you can imagine, living conditions grew tense between the humans and the non-humans. The derogatory term \\"prawn\\" was given to the aliens, as they resembled the bottom-feeders of the fish aquarium in appearance and mannerisms. Often violence would erupt between humans and the prawns.<br /><br />District 9 was a tremendous movie, and it is very easy to see the true theme of the film. It explores the issue of racism in an extreme, but still relevant, way. The unspoken question is should non-humans be treated the same as humans?<br /><br />Naturally, I cannot answer this question for you. However, after watching the movie, I feel that anyone with a heart would answer the question with a vehement \\"YES\\". While on the surface this seems slightly silly, at a deeper level it mirrors apartheid racial struggle of South Africa, and more generally the racial issues of the world.<br /><br />The special affects in the movie are beautiful, and I really could not get enough of the human body exploding into tiny bits and pieces. The aliens are remarkable, and their emotions are clearly portrayed on their face. The backdrop setting of Johannesburg and the refugee camp are completely believable.<br /><br />Also, the filming style of this movie really pulls the audience in. It is shot like a documentary at times, and at other points like a traditional film. The documentary scenes look rather real, more so than Blair Witch or Cloverfield. The traditional filming style is also well shot.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the plot. I barely scratched the surface of what's going on. On one of the trailers for the movie you can hear someone saying \\"There's a lot of secrets in District 9.\\" Suffice it to say that this is true, and these secrets propel the movie at a fast and ruthless pace, toying with the audiences emotions. At times I felt disgusted, other times repulsed, and many times saddened.<br /><br />I like a good movie that knows how to play with my emotions, making me uncertain what to believe and where things are going. I did not know what to expect for the conclusion of District 9, but I was thoroughly satisfied when the film went off. I can easily recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a different kind of movie and be taken along for a wild and crazy ride. This movie works on multiple levels, and I really enjoyed it quite a bit.<br /><br />Note: If you are easily grossed out and the site of blood, vomit, torture, etc. makes you squirm, you may find it difficult to watch this film at some parts. But if you can get through it, you shouldn't be disappointed.ary scenes look rather real, more so than Blair Witch or Cloverfield. The traditional filming style is also well shot.

0596804822|3.0|I bought the book thinking it would help me jump start in OpenGL. It certainly does but not in the way I was expecting. Each new example in the book starts by removing all the generated resources that Xcode creates for you when you choose an OpenGL ES project! As a developer with over 20 years of Objective-C behind my belt, this is highly counter-intuitive. I want to write OpenGL apps on the iPhone, not write a portable renderer in C++. I'm not planning to port any app to any other platform anytime soon. So, in addition of learning OpenGL, I now have to become closely familiar with C++, which I don't have any desire to do. One step at a time, please!    So, if you're planning to write an OpenGL app that you want to port to multiple platforms, already know C++ quite a bit, and optionally want to have your app working on the iPhone, that book is for you. Otherwise, do like me and look somewhere else.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There's something buried within Radiohead's Hail to the Thief on every level. On the surface, you get a collection of strangely titled songs, like \\"Backdrifts (Honeymoon is Over)\\" or \\"2+2=5 (The Lukewarm)\\". As you go deeper into the album you discover unimaginably catchy beats and a wide range of instruments. And, perhaps at the deepest layer of all there is some semblance of meaning and understanding.<br /><br />Hail to the Thief is Radiohead's sixth studio album. It has 14 tracks and runs for almost an hour in length. Radiohead is a British alternative rock band consisting of Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, Colin Greenwood, and Phil Selway.<br /><br />Part of the curse with this album, and part of the reason it ranks so highly, is that it contains so many songs that easily wedge their way into your brain and stay there, forcing your mind to run the segment over and over and over again and again. On almost any given day I can have \\"Myxomatosis\\" in my head or \\"We Suck Young Blood.\\" The words run on repeat in my head, and yet I can't fathom them.<br /><br />That is the beautiful problem with Hail to the Thief, or practically any other Radiohead album. In general, I don't know what they're talking about. Obviously Yorke doesn't literally mean what he says all the time, but the metaphors are too deep, too complex, too good, too smart. Combining deep-thought with a slightly difficult ear to actually understand the words themselves yields only a slightly confused, albeit happy, listener.<br /><br />The album flows well together, with an appropriate mix of varied tempos and instruments. And, being Radiohead, the rock is definitely not traditional rock-n-roll, but much more alternative, contemporary, borderline-electronica rock. All this makes for an interesting, delightful album.<br /><br />Some people really like Radiohead, while others can't stand the group. Personally, I love every album they've produced. They're unique in the rock world, and they definitely have found their niche. That said, if you've never heard a full Radiohead album, I would recommend starting with Hail to the Thief, OK Computer, or In Rainbows. These are all similar in style, but each has its own life, too.<br /><br />One of my favorite songs on the album is \\"Myxomatosis\\", it's beats heavy and loud. \\"2+2=5\\" is another great song, and the video is amazing (but a little cartoonish-risque), especially if you like Orwell's 1984. You can listen to every song from the album on YouTube, though there may not be an official video.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this album because of the way it pulls you back to listening to it. Catchy music and clever songwriting makes Hail to the Thief an excellent Radiohead album.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|In 1968 the Beatles released their eponymous album The Beatles, but it is commonly known as the White Album. It's a double album, contains 30 tracks, and has a running time of 93:35.<br /><br />For many years I have been a fan of the Beatles. Their songs are everywhere, and everybody knows them. The impact they had on culture and music is unfathomable, and their expansive catalog is truly magnificent. Out of all of the Beatles albums, my favorite is without a doubt the White Album.<br /><br />One of the joys from the White Album is the large mix and range of song styles available. You have a classic Beatles sound opening the album with \\"Back in the USSR,\\" but most of the other songs do not resemble the earlier music of the Four. In fact, it seems that each song is in itself its own entity, expressing something independent and surreal. But, somehow, there exists a residue of cohesion. All of these seemingly random songs join together and form a unified album with eclectic tastes and styles.<br /><br />It's impossible to pick a favorite song from the album, and it seems to vary with mood and season. \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" has always been one of my favorite tracks, due to the many changes in tempo and unusual lyrics. \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La Da\\" is a super fun and brilliant song. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is an instant classic. \\"Blackbird\\" is soothing and gentle. \\"Rocky Racoon\\" is dark but brilliant. \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" are both loud, raunchy, and fun. \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" and \\"Good Night\\" can both be lullaby's. There are so many wonderful songs from this album, it's just too tough to pick any one out to recommend.<br /><br />The only bad song on this album is the penultimate track, \\"Revolution 9.\\" If it wasn't so long, it wouldn't be so bad. Essentially it's a collage of sounds, blending together for unexplained reasons. I find it atrocious to listen to, and suffering through the eight minutes is almost unbearable. It's too avant-garde, too abstract, for me to like or appreciate, and I can heartily recommend skipping this one.<br /><br />My wife bought me the newly remastered Beatles White Album three days ago. Since then, I've listened to it three or four times. I think the traditional cd releases of the Beatles catalog are fine to listen to, but once you hear the remastered stuff, your ears start to glow and you get this grin for some reason. All I can say is that if the remastered White Album is indicative of the rest of the remastered catalog, I will be buying me the set over time. Truly amazing.<br /><br />Whether you're a Beatles fan or not, the White Album is brilliant. The song writing is compelling and thought-provoking, slightly humorous, and well written. The music ranges from extremely simple to mega-complex. This album really showcases the individual band member's talents and offers a treat to anyone who cares to listen. Odds are, you've probably heard some of these songs, and if you're contemplating buying one of the new remastered albums, I recommend this one.e or appreciate, and I can heartily recommend skipping this one.

Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />Richard Mayhew is just your everyday Average Joe who moved to London to procure a number-crunching job. He meets a girl and becomes engaged. Life seems to be great. However, Richard is an absent-minded person. He forgets his keys, loses track of time, etc... On the way to dinner with his fiancee (with a reservation he forgot to confirm), where he was supposed to impress her boss, Richard stops by a rag girl who is exhausted, frightened and hurt. Jessica (who is most definitely a woman who prefers her way or the highway) demands he leave her for someone else to take care of. And when he picks up the girl to take her home, Jessica (her name isn't Jess) threatens to end their engagement. Richard disregards her statement and takes the girl home to mend. Little did he know how bad life was about to get.<br /><br />\\"Door\\" can open doorways without keys, can open doors where there are none. It was her ability that helped her escape her would-be assassins, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, and brought her to London Above. But Richard doesn't understand her meaning. No worries, reluctantly, he soon will. Her would-be assasssins manage to track her down, but Richard manages to get rid of them. With her face now plastered on Missing posters throughout the neighborhood, Door sends Richard for help and he brings back the Marquis de Carabas. As she leaves, she apologizes. Little does Richard know how deep that apology actually goes. For Richard's life, as he knows it, is now over. Jessica broke their engagement and refuses to see or talk to him. When he arrives at work, his possessions are removed from his desk. His flat is leased to another couple - while he's in the tub! Richard is gone. It's as if he never existed. He can be seen, but is immediately forgotten. Throwing some of his belongings into a duffle bag, he sets off to find Door, wanting answers, wanting his life back. There's only one way he figures he can find her. Start with the very place she'd sent him before for help.<br /><br />And help he gets - from unlikely characters. For under London lies London Below, filled with shady characters, talking animals, tunnels, sewers, hidden passageways and a mysterious market that's never held in the same place twice. A market that provides, but people barter, and not with money. Money means nothing in London Below. For Richard, this isn't reality. He wants to go home.<br /><br />Door is on her own quest. She wants to find her family's muderer. She wants to know why. And only the Angel Islington can help. But after finally finding him, she is sent on a quest to retrieve a certain key, and when she returns, he will tell her all she needs to know. Richard, reluctantly, is along for the ride, for afterwards, the promise is he'll be sent home and his life will be as it was.<br /><br />But Door was warned; they have a traitor in their mists. The Hunter is hired to bodyguard her from the assassins who are after her. Richard deals with more than he bargained for. And just when they think they have the story right, how wrong they were.<br /><br />An enjoyable read, it was an adventure. Places where people have no business being. Strange and shady characters, some you enjoy, some you dispise. A solid mystery that leaves you asking questions until you finally get the answers you seek. For me, it was missing just that little \\"oomph\\", that little \\"spark\\" to make the story completely believable. While I could picture a different world of London Below, I couldn't really picture some of the characters and what they did. I enjoyed the banter with Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar.

0545265355|5.0|I am in my 60's but read all genres - even young adult especially when they garner the reviews that this Hunger Games trilogy has.  I've only read the first book so far but what a treat.  I at first thought it had to do with teenage eating disorders and was going to pass it by but picked up the first volume any way.  What a thrilling and believable tale even though it is in the scifi fantasy realm.  The world in disarray and people fighting for survival and teenagers forced into gladiator roles.  I loved the first volume so much, I ordered the whole trilogy (at a great price) on Amazon.  Note:  this Trilogy is still for sale in the bookstores for $54 and I only paid over the internet via Amazon $28 with no mailing fees.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|I am extremely selective in choosing DVDs for my library. In fact, I own a total of four. When I saw Micmacs at the cinema my friend told me to settle down, I was laughing so hard. The French have done it again, the way only they can...
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is simply the BEST horror film of the past decade.  It is a must have for any horror aficionado.
1932907009|5.0|I've read about half a dozen books on screenwriting, but most of those books focused on selling the screenplay.  For some reason I've always been hesitant to read books that tell you how to write.  But, this book got such fantastic reviews that I took a chance.    And boy, am I ever glad I did!!  Far from telling you 'how to write' Snyder instead focuses on why screenplays must be structured the way they are, how to pump up your story, how to find problem areas and how to fix them.      Snyder starts at the beginning and takes you all the way through the edits up to \\"query.\\"  He discusses a little bit about the query process, but the focus is really on the structuring of the screenplay.    What I found especially helpful was Snyder's 'four act' screenplay, breaking down the sequence of events into four acts instead of three - it made total sense to me and really helped me organize my scenes.    Also, this book flows so well and so seamlessly that I hardly ever (if ever) stumbled over the words or the ideas.  It was almost like, as I was reading the book, I kept thinking, \\"well, I know *that* - but then again, did I really?\\"  The points Snyder makes about storytelling are really common sense, things that we \\"know\\" as movie viewers, but that are hard to recognize as movie writers.  We all kind of know if we thought a movie worked or didn't, if we felt connected to the characters or not, but what Snyder does is let us know how to pin-point the *why* and then, how to fix it!  (The title of the book alone is brilliant, and a perfect example of Snyder's common sense approach.  And don't worry, he explains it pretty early on).    I've tried my hand at both screenplays and novels and even though this book is for screenwriters, I think any fiction writer would find this book insightful.    \\"Save the Cat\\" isn't really telling you what story you should tell, but how to tell the story you already have.  I almost feel like I want to read the book every time I work on a new story, reading all the checks and recommendations with respect to that specific script.      Really, I can't recommend this book enough!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I somehow managed to avoid Big Bang Theory early on.  Thank goodness my geeky friends were persistent on trying to convert me(knock-knock-knock, Leonard).  I love all of the jokes targeted at comic-book loving, convention-going, game-playing geeks like me.  The show embraces its pocket-protector roots, all the while poking fun at our eccentricities.      Chances are you know that roommates Sheldon and Leonard are two peas out of the same invasion-of-the body-snatchers-pod.  In season one Leonard seeks to walk both sides of the fence wanting to hang on to his original season BSG flight suit, all the while wooing gorgeous neighbor Penny.   Co-conspirators include Howard the horn-dog, and Raj - who can't say two words to the opposite sex.    The guys are great together.  Whether playing Halo or discussing the paradoxes associated with time travel, there's always a snarky good-natured ribbing just around the corner.  Penny is equally joyous as she both seeks to understand this nerdvana and to draw the guys out into `the real world'.  If you dig Planet of the Apes, mint-condition action figures, or a good natured discussion of Schrodinger's Cat - you'll love The Big Bang Theory.
B002ZG9846|5.0|No problems, fast delivery, great movie- be aware, this movie is darker and gorier than the previews would lead you to believe. I really like it, but it is not really a \\"light-hearted comedy\\" if that is what you are looking for :)
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The writing and actors in Castle are excellent.  I did not find any of the individual weekly productions that I wouldn't recommend for viewing.
0439023513|3.0|One of the most anticipated and disappointing books I've read all year.  The last volume of The Hunger Games trilogy fails to deliver on the promise of the first two volumes.  What started strong with \\"The Hunger Games\\" runs out of creative steam here.  The triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale disappoints, and the ending of the story was flat, clichéd, and generally unfulfilling.  Read the series - but read it for the first two volumes.  Evidently it is far easier to start a high concept story than it is to end a high concept story.

She loved and the other girls did also.  Some had read the book and some didn't and the movie was equally as good for both of them.

B0037QGS0A|4.0|I'm a sucker for any film with Julianne Moore ([[ASIN:B002VECLVO A Single Man]]), and I'm a Liam Neeson fan, too, as in [[ASIN:B001TODCII Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)]].  After watching Amanda Seyfried in [[ASIN:B001GKJ2DY Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)]], I became intrigued by her skills as well.<br /><br />I thought about the aspects of this film that appealed to me the most.  I noticed that Julianne Moore's characterization of the wife suspecting her husband was somewhat unusual.  She was detached, unemotional, and almost as if she were totally unaffected by the outcome, whatever it might be.<br /><br />But as we drew further into her psyche and her connections, I began to realize that this somewhat \\"scientific\\" approach was in character for Catherine, the doctor; the woman, the betrayed wife, would appear later.  At that time, we would see her feelings, her insecurities, and how much she mourned the connection she once had with her husband.<br /><br />What we do learn, too, is that Chloe's version of events, as she describes them to Catherine, are not necessarily the truth.  Perhaps it is the truth as she sees it. We come to understand her motivations more as we near the end of the story.<br /><br />Psychological suspense keeps this film moving, taking us to some unexpected places.<br /><br />What will Chloe do in the end to ratchet up the thrills for the viewers?  And how far will Catherine go to protect what is hers?<br /><br />This is not a movie for the faint of heart or those who like pretty Hollywood endings.  But I was not bored during any part of this one, and as the thrills unfolded, I was excited and rooting for more.<br /><br />I loved the settings, too, and could tell right away that this was not an American city.  At the end, I learned that it was filmed in Toronto.<br /><br />I would give [[ASIN:B0037QGS0A Chloe]] four stars.

B002ZG9846|3.0|\\"Kick-Ass\\" was entertaining and fun.  However, I wanted something a little different than what I got.  I wanted something over the top and fast paced.  Instead, \\"Kick-Ass,\\" while certainly over the top, is not fast paced at all.  Rather, it is two completely different movies shoehorned into one, that are only tied together at the very end.  The first movie is the story of a schlubby teen who becomes Kick-Ass out of a love of comic books and sense of idealism.  The second movie is the story of Big Daddy and his daughter Hit Girl, who are far more successful superheroes.  Oddly, the story of Kick-Ass is less serious than the story of Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  \\"Kick-Ass\\" suffers from jarring tonal shifts as well as a very slow moving first act.  If you can wade through the first 20-30 minutes, the better stuff kicks in.<br /><br />However, at 2 hours this movie was too long for its own good.  The length is attributable to the fact that there are two different jammed-together stories to tell.  Paradoxically, even with the 2-hour length, the narrative seems thin and not fully fleshed out.<br /><br />Hit Girl is awesome, and is without a doubt the best part of this movie.  I would have preferred that the movie be called \\"Hit Girl\\" and that it was 90 minutes with her.  That's one sequel I can enthusiastically await!<br /><br />\\"Kick Ass\\" is at least worth a rent, but I doubt you will want to own this unless you are a comic book movie completist.
B003XKPPOU|3.0|A caution to those of you who plan to put Toy Story 3 on their Iphones/Ipods using Digital Copy: the file was encoded with mono sound!  That's right, there is no separation in the audio channels, effectively castrating the incredible sound mix done for this film.  Shame on the authoring guy who made the file for this set. It's not like this for \\"UP\\" for example.
0618918248|5.0|I picked out this book in audio format at the library thinking that I would only listen to a bit.  I am already an atheist so, I thought, what was the point?  I should have known that I would love it and would savor every last word.  I picked up The Ancestor's Tale (also by Dawkins) at a book sale thinking that it would be a good book to refer to.  In the end, I read every word of The Ancestor's Tale twice. I love Dawkins' writing.<br /><br />I listened to The God Delusion on CD. It was read by Dawkins and his wife, Laila Ward (of Dr Who fame - what fun!).  It was sometimes difficult to follow when it switched between the two readers. It was also sometimes difficult to follow all the quotations. In spite of these complications, I would recommend the audio version.  Dawkins' scathing comments about the \\"American Tailban\\" are soo funny.  Dawkins' passion and love for life comes through twice as well in the audio version.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The production of this Masterpiece is the most outstanding true story I have ever seen or heard, being a student of the Pacific war for 40 + years I am so happy that these mens stories were finally told, Stephan Speilburg is the only person in Hollywood who could have brought this epic to life the way he did.   I do know parts of their stories were not told in detail, you will have to read their books to obtain the full impact of their ordeal, John Basolone for instance served in the U.S.army in the Philippines prior to Pearl Harbor and had many friends on the Bataan Death March, his time in the Philippines   was barely mentioned in this series, the fall of Bataan and Wake Island likewise not mentioned at all.  other than that the work was superb,speilburg was outstanding in his authenticity of the backdrop, the equipment the marines used, and was historically accurate in every detail.  hats off to the whole production crew and artists that were involved in showing this generation how the price of real freedom was extracted by that \\"Greatest Generation\\" in more ways that one.

Thank you BeeGees for this great music!
B001F9Y2CM|3.0|I'm surprised that noboby has to date reported that these are not the *original* studio albums. (and I'm not talking about them missing the Spanish language album)    What they have given us is the sleeves of the original 8 studio albums which all include a list of the tracks on those original albums, yet the tracks on the CDs provided in those first two album sleeves do not match the list of tracks the sleeves say are in them.    The completely unbelievable decision has been made to remove the two Swedish language tracks from the first two albums (and put them on the \\"bonus\\" CD). In the case of the first album, Ring Ring in Swedish has been replaced by \\"My Kind of Girl\\" and in the case of the second album they have dropped Waterloo in Swedish which started that album and instead start the album with Waterloo in English which on the original album completed the album. (For this removal there is no replacement).    The key thing with the Waterloo album is that it was issued after they had won the European Song Contest with Waterloo sung (as the rules then insisted) in Swedish and they had then when they sung it again as winners had (for the first time in the history of that competition (?)) an English language version already available which they therefore (to the extra applause of the audience) sang.    In other words for that album - labelled \\"Grand Prix of the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest\\" - the presence of both langauge versions IS important.    Having a Swedish language version of Ring Ring is less important but again that otherwise English language original album included both language versions (with again the Swedish language version as the first track) so any box claiming to have the original albums should have that as first track on the CD.    One consequence of having different songs on 2 of the 8 albums than those listed on the album sleeves means that lots of space is wasted in the booklet by repeating the albums' front sides with lists of the tracks thatare actually on the CDs.    This means that no space is left for useful information on a track-by-track basis of for instance who is the first (and second etc.) female solo singer on each track. [I suggest the broschure makers look at the Crosby, Stills, Nash box set's broschure which has background information (mainly from Graham Nash) on each track)    Otherwise I agree with most of the posters about the quality (still) of the music. I've for a long time had Abba Gold on my IPod but until I bought this set thought that most of the \\"non-Gold\\" stuff was pretty poor in comparison. Well some is (mainly from the early albums) but not as much as I expected.    I don't agree with the comments on the sleeves. As we don't have a vinyl box available, the best you can do is scaled down sleeves and for me there's nothing wrong with the quality of these.    There was also an earlier comment about the quality of the re-mastering. My first hearing was of a \\"start of late period\\" album and there it struck me how well the music responded to the re-mastering, but since then I've not been as impressed so I think we can say that the re-mastering is OK and better in parts than in others.    But despite the only three stars (caused mainly by me being so annoyed that the Waterloo album (which is the only one I listened to often soon after it came out, but never bought) isn't as I remember it to be (and for anyone who cares I didn't live in Sweden at that time but in another (non-Nordic) European country), I'm still very glad I bought this set.

1595825045|5.0|This book is amazing! Right of the bat it's beautiful just to look at - would make a great coffee table book. Also, for any serious Avatar: The Last Airbender fan it's a great book. It is by the original creators and is based on the amazing show (not on the horrible movie). The book starts with the very first sketch that lead to the whole idea for the Avatar universe. The creators tell the story themselves, using their sketches from development to move it along. The original sketches are awesome! You get to see the earliest versions of Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko and a lot of more minor characters! There's a lot of detail from the show as well as little tidbits of information you didn't get from the show. Absolutely amazing (and beautiful) book for anyone that enjoys Avatar or art (or both)!
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This is one of those rare and delightful films that gets noir and also has no problem whatsoever stretching the genre and making fun of it.  Kilmer and Downey are unusually well paired in their love/hate relationship.  But the best part is the narrative flow and how it ties into the story yet is still surprising and/or humorous.  This isn't a movie you can watch while doing something else.  It will require your full attention if you wish to spot all the nuances.  Lots of jokes about LA people, especially women in entertainment.  Mostly true.  WHEN WATCHED: August 2010; MY GRADE: A minus.
0312600844|5.0|Jonathan Franzen's latest novel is worthy of the hype.  Freedom is more than just the story of a midwest couple in the throes of midlife crisis- it is a critical examination of the American conscience, consumer culture, and the hypocrisies and odd juxtapositions that exist in modern America.  Franzen's prose is breathtaking, insightful, and taps into the reader's very soul.  The point of the story isn't really the story.  Instead, the point of the story (as I see it) is its brutal assessment of American culture and what it forces every reader to admit to him or herself- that we are all a part of the madness in one way or another.<br /><br />The careful examination of Patty and Walter Burgland, their children, and their life-long friend, Richard Katz causes us to look at modern relationships, love, and family in an entirely new way.  Franzen has a keen understanding of how people really are, and this understanding gives these characters an astounding depth.  I was not prepared to be this impressed, but this book has stayed with me for a while now.  And that, to me, is the greatest compliment any novel could receive.
1592402038|5.0|I got this book at a local library thinking that it would be one of those books you get and return without having read, but from the first sentence on, I was hooked. For one thing, it was first published in England, and -- being a complete Anglophile -- I loved that whole aspect. Lynne Truss is incredibly hilarious and sarcastic. She devotes a whole chapter to each precious punctuation mark so overlooked by the modern reader (and even writer) and gives countless examples of the misuse of each, as well as the proper usage. This was one of my favorite books of all time. Am I supposed to put complaints? I haven't any. The only thing is that I now have an urge to use the completely misunderstood '--' and scream whenever someone uses 'it's' as a possessive pronoun.
0743497465|5.0|I'm a fan of most of Brown's books but this is my favorite by far. The involvement of religion in his other work makes for a heavier read with lots of personal reflection and this book is just the opposite. All you need to enjoy it is a high school science education and a willingness to be pulled into a wonderfully told story. Vivid imagery, well developed characters, and just enough twists to keep you guessing without giving you a headache!

0142403873|5.0|There aren't too many books that I would say SHOULD be in your child's library. This is one of them. The story is ingeniously told and quite impactful. My son couldn't get enough of the book with the mouse! We've read it at least 10 times in the 2 days since receiving it. We already had The Snail and the Whale in our library. I am happy that we read The Gruffalo second because I think I would have been disappointed the other way around. As it is, we love both books and now will be adding Room on the Broom as well to round out our Julia Donaldson collection.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I put off watching the movie in the theater because of the awful reviews and when I finally went to see it, I seriously regretted waiting so long. Exactly what show did you people think this was based on? Over the top fashion was always a part of the show! I don't understand why so many reviewers are complaining about the over the top wardrobe. It's Sex and the City and the costumes in the movie were nothing short of stunning. Also, I love the fact that they went to the Middle East. The cinematography was breath taking! I loved the arabian nights scenery.  Did you not get enough NYC during the six seaons of the the show and the first movie? I thought changing the location was a great idea. Why not have them go some place different and have an adventure? Out of the four characters, Samantha made this movie for me. She had me laughing to the point of tears! I enjoyed the movie more than I was expecting and I honestly feel that the horrible reviews from fans and critics were way over the top. It wasn't that bad! My only complaint was the whole Aiden/Carrie scenerio. I have to admit, that was just too contrived! Overall, I enjoyed seeing the girls again and I enjoyed each persons storyline: Carrie adjusting to married life, Miranda dealing with a tyrant boss, Charlotte trying to balance two kids and Samantha handling menopause. All problems most women will encounter at some point in their lives!
B00005JKNC|5.0|I'm sure this movie would have been more well-received if it had been released six months earlier than it was.  But three months after the destruction of the World Trade Center, America was in no mood to consider the justness of war, or to question the infallibility of its Government.  But the course of events in the years following its release have shown The Majestic to be far more timely than anyone could have guessed.  Another misfortune that precluded critical acclaim for this movie is that few people are willing to see beyond Jim Carrey's astonishing talent for crude physical comedy, at which he is an unparalleled genius.  But he is also one of the best dramatic actors film makers have ever had the good luck to discover, and his performance by itself would make this one of the best movies hollywood has ever created, and yet there's more.  Each person in this movie is giving what is probably the best performance of their own career, and the movie itself is without doubt one of the best written and best filmed movies ever made.

B002BG6H9O|5.0|Radiohead is my favorite band. That said, Muse is considered an \\"immitator\\" band by most diehart Radiohead fans. I don't agree with that.   Take the intensity of Rage Against The Machines guitar and bass, put it over some of the best falsetto singing done of anyone on the planet, sprinkle in some space themes and have a little touch of Radiohead flavor and you have this album.   The whole album is very cohesive, unlike Muse's other albums.  The only problems I have with the album are the sometimes inelegant lyrics (they don't seem to rhyme very well some of the time)but it doesn't really bother me. The main problem is some of the album has slightly lower recording quality then the rest (Citizen Erased is a good example).  That said, buy the album. If you like rock, you will not be disappointed. I'm disappointed that Muse has gone on to be so pretentious, as if you watch any live performances of these songs, they are bleeding with intensity.

B000LC3ID8|1.0|If the torture horror genre is on life support, the Saw series is probably the reason it hasn't flatlined yet.  Not because the Saw movies are indicative of good filmmaking -- on the contrary, they are putrid exercises in rehashing a stale formula that didn't really work to begin with.  However, they do achieve some level of financial success, even if that is waning.<br /><br />The Saw series was never great -- even the first two movies are second-tier at best, however, it wasn't until Saw 3 that the series began its descent into self-parody.<br /><br />Leigh Whannell's screenplay is assinine, using the approach of \\"the more plot twists, the better\\".  By the time the third one rolls around, eyerolling commences, not just because they all seem to occur outside the realm of reality, but because they don't allow any of them time to marinate before they start stewing the next one.<br /><br />Acting, of course, is as over the top as you expect, and the frights are few and far between -- been there, tortured that.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a movie for college fratboys.
B0043RSIUK|5.0|Previous to this book by Ken Follett I had read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End and enjoyed both thoroughly. This is definitely just as good and maybe even better. It is the first book that I downloaded on my Kindle and I can't put it down. Really good storyline and not so many characters that you loose track of them. Ken Follett has a unique way of reminding you of past events and people without you hardly noticing. Looking forward to the other 2 boods in the trilogy.
B003VS0CYC|1.0|My wife picked up the first episode at Costco on a coupon (not the trilogy) and she even complained how bad this looked.  Her question to me was, \\"I thought Blu-Ray was supposed to be a spectacular image?\\".  I replied, they obviously did not remaster since the Laser Disc. Now I read the Trilogy just packaged the three movies without re-mastering DVD.  I think the Laser Disc looked better (I don't have the DVD).  This is an example of how not to release a movie on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />After this fiasco I was concerned when I ordered Cocoon & Star Man Blu-Ray editions, but they did remaster them for Hi-Def and did a good job.  I am reluctant purchasing older movies however after this experience.  I plan to give my copy away, since there is no reason to watch it again.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|With Bruce now over sixty and some of us nearing that number as well, it's great to have a full recent concert professionally recorded...with the Darkness box set and live performances DVD, as well as the Hammersmith show from 1975, we oldsters have a good record of the Boss and the Band at their heyday in the 70s...and the 80s and the 90s and now 2000s...good thing too because we don't how much longer we've got...but Bruce will probably be performing long after I'm gone...It is a great show...but Jungleland was better at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame show...just sayin'...
B003YP7N9O|4.0|There is no need to restate what the other reviewers have already pointed out; that this is a first class reissue and well worth the investment. I would add that disc three is a bit unnecessary as the whole surround sound treatment doesn't add much to this show and the \\"music in the round\\" trend that returned with DVD-A a few years back has all but gone the way of Quad by now.     The Carnegie Hall show is a great one, recorded less than a month after my own personal first Tull show, which basically established Tull as my favorite live band for years afterwards. This disc also rights a wrong from Living in the Past by giving us the full With You There to Help Me, as opposed to just the \\"By Kind Permission Of...\\" piano solo which was excerpted for LITP.    My only quibble is the timing..... 2010 would properly be the 40 year anniversary of Benefit; as Stand Up was from 1969. And... the Carnegie Hall live shows are from the end of the Benefit tour, well past the Stand Up time frame. Not a real complaint, as I'm glad to finally have this show all cleaned up and all, but it is odd nonetheless. Big difference between the Stand Up and Benefit tours was the addition of John Evan, who had nothing to do with Stand Up or it's following tours.     One last correction to another review... Glen Cornick does appear on Benefit and stayed on through the end of the 1970 tour. He doesn't drop off until Aqualung, along with Clive Bunker.
B000RZIGYU|5.0|The problem was that, the item I bougthed was DVD-HD , and that format you have to have an special player and I dindn't haven't, result I have my item but I don't have used for that.Was my mistake .Thanks any way
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Enjoyed the 6th season -- better than several in the past--especially the 2 hour season finale!
B0013K6WLM|4.0|I often wish that this band would just keep pumping out the raw and untamed sound of the first album. I miss it and no one else makes music like that. That said, I am sure I would be griping that it had gotten stale if they just continued to retread that sound. It took me a while, but I love this album. It represents growth and change and encouraged me to get Brothers. I had to learn to love this, but it was good school.
B00002SSKI|3.0|John Locke's novel, Now and Then, is superbly developed with a strong storyline. The novel presents diverse elements of mystery, revenge, and historical background. The author has cleverly began the novel as a modern thrilling tale. However, he weaves within a depiction of a rare gift passed from generation to generation.
0375701427|5.0|As a newcomer to Roth, I am constantly amazed at the layers of storytelling he is capable of working into a book while still keeping the reader engaged and compelled to find out how the story concludes.  This is a story centering on Swede Levov-told by glimpses through Nathan Zuckerman and the Swede's brother, Jerry and eventually by the Swede himself.  The tale takes the reader through the optimistic 1950's riding on the expectations of the immigrant generation and then slams head on into the chaos of the 1960's. The Swede comes of age in the 1950's acquiring the perfect wife, Dawn, Miss New Jersey, setting up house in the country to raise their beautiful daughter Merry.  Merry grows up into a radical teenager fighting against authority, the Vietnam war and LBJ.  She  slams into the Levov family ushering it's deconstruction in the same way the 1960's restructured American culture-from the family unit to it's politics.      Roth is able to personalize the struggle of the average American in the 1960's through a Jewish businessman who wants to just be a good person.  He also forces the reader to look at what the protests and riots of the 1960's did to the individual.  It is difficult to not personalize a riot destroying property literally around you in Newark when a person has fought to remain in Newark to give the very rioters a job and keep his business alive.  Extreme political views and personalities have a personal side beyond footnotes in history.  The extremist has a family and in Roth's tale they are left in tatters.    American Pastoral is an absolute must read for anyone interested in Roth's work-it is a should read for everyone else.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|This album is AAAAAMMMMAZZZZING from start to finish!!! The best tracks are \\"Bone Broke\\" and \\"Little Cream Soda\\", yet this album as a whole is a revelation for WS fans. Jack White and his \\"sister\\" Meg may be all about making old seem new again, but this album is as modern sounding as it will get for the White Stripes. I could the pitter-patter of a keyboard in a lot of the songs (cue the shock & horror of many WS fans who like theis blues-inspired rock pure & simple!!) Yet the keyb never overpowers the songs; instead, they fit right in them perfectly. Blues-rock purists may call this album the worst of the WS arsenal, but actually, I'll say it again: it's a REVELATION.
0143058592|5.0|I have many books on The Beatles. When I recieved this book for Christmas, the year it came out, I could not put it down. When I got to the last page, I turned back to the first page and started it again. I read this book around every four months. I just love the way Geoff relates his story. I have bought this book for several of my friends. I have been a Beatle fan for 47 years.

B003MZ0I84|3.0|Personal issues have pushed me back to listening to Maroon5 recently and I kind of had my hopes up for this one.  I had my hopes up in 2007 for It Won't Be Soon Before Long as well only to have them let down.  As I said, personal issues have pushed me back to listening to Maroon5 again and I actually like their second album right now.  Hands All Over, though, feels like a bit of a let down.  I've been listening to the cd in my car for the past 3 days, and the only songs that have really stuck with me are Misery, Never Gonna Leave This Bed, How, and If I Ain't Got You (which doesn't really count because it's a cover of the Alicia Keys single).  One of the things I first loved about Maroon5 was their smooth, laid-back kind of vibe.  They pulled away from that with their second album to a more Pop-feel but I have come to appreciate it more.  Hands All Over just feels... all over.  Most of the songs are forgettable.  Yes, you can listen to it as background music, but it's not something that really captivates you.  Who knows, maybe 3 years from now I'll love it.  Right now, not so much.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|What can I say? I'm hooked. Great writing, great storylines....WOW. Rare to see quality like this. I cannot wait to see more.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This Cup holder/organizer is great! I use it with a baby jogger city select and it looks great and works superbly.

B003ZUTVJS|5.0|I'm surprised I hadn't heard more about this film, as I watch a lot of movies. If anything, the film was really really inspiring. As a parent of a newly diagnosed 3 year-old autistic son, I was looking for a film that I could better understand the issues that my son will go through. He is like Temple Grandin in a lot of ways, as he isn't talking, but seeing the world through solving complex puzzles. If you want to better understand what autism is through an autistic person's point-of-view, see this film. I honestly think it's one of the best films I've ever seen.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|For those who once insulted Ben Affleck's ability as an actor and Oscar-winning screenwriter, the actor is now getting the best kind of revenge at those harsh critics: he's shut them up by becoming an accomplished director, making the superb [[ASIN:B0010ZR160 Gone Baby Gone]] (an adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel). And his latest, The Town, based on the novel [[ASIN:1416554904 Prince of Thieves: A Novel]] by Chuck Hogan, is no exception. The acting is really good, especially from Affleck, Rebecca Hall ([[ASIN:B001DJ7PR8 Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]), Jon Hamm (AMC's [[ASIN:B003E7HAPY Mad Men: Seasons 1-3]], [[ASIN:B0038M2AOG Mad Men: Season Four]]), and Jeremy Renner ([[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]]) -- along with special appearances by Pete Postlethwaite ([[ASIN:B00005V9HH The Usual Suspects (Special Editon)]]) and Chris Cooper ([[ASIN:B00005JMCN Seabiscuit (Widescreen Edition)]]). However, what stands out most is the film's production and direction, with which Affleck should also be given accolades.<br /><br />When I reviewed [[ASIN:B002ZG980U Inception]], I called it the best film of the year, citing this film and David Fincher's \\"The Social Network\\" as the only possible films that could trump Christopher Nolan's sci-fi stunner. While I wasn't as blown away with \\"The Town\\" as I was with \\"Inception\\" to make it the best of the year, it still comes in at a very close second. Nevertheless, throughout this crime heist thriller, I couldn't help but be reminded of a 1995 film that paved the way for films like this, Michael Mann's [[ASIN:B0017HRJ04 Heat [Blu-ray]]]. While \\"The Town\\"'s plot is nowhere as intricately expanded as \\"Heat,\\" the main character of Doug MacRay (Affleck) reminds me a lot of Heat's main character, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). Both are master thieves who long for a better life, and see that possibility in the form of a woman. Like Amy Brenneman's character in Heat, Rebecca Hall provides the motivation for Affleck's protagonist to want a new life - one that's free from crime. It's the classic hero's journey -- as popularized by mythology maestro Joseph Campbell -- with a protagonist who's not so innocent, looking to better his life. At first, Affleck's MacRay simply sees their hostage (Hall) from their latest heist as a means to an end; he's to check on her and make sure she doesn't talk to the Feds. However, it is through their relationship that he genuinely starts to fall in love with her (of course!).<br /><br />Like I previously stated, the acting is all good. But the one who really hits it out of the park is Rebecca Hall. Where did this actress come from? She's been in a few hits but this is definitely her breakout role! On the other hand, while Blake Lively does better than anything she's done on her guilty-pleasure television hit \\"Gossip Girl,\\" her performance here doesn't rank with any of her other co-stars here (let's hope she does better in \\"Green Lantern\\"). The other great thing about the film is the setting itself. Boston and its surrounding areas are itself a character in this film and it adds great depth. Unfortunately, it's not the best of the year, but it's awfully close. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film - and even the ending, I guess - but it didn't fill me with that same viewing pleasure as Inception did. From a technical, overall aspect, there was something slightly amiss just with the ending. I won't give anything away, but I will say it doesn't exactly follow through with the realistic closure.<br /><br />In a year that has failed to impress me with many standout films, \\"The Town\\" is one of the best this year, but, then again, it doesn't have much competition. That doesn't sully all of the great reviews for the film nor the film itself. Affleck seems to have found his niche in directing. It's affected his acting for the better and I think we have more to see from this impressive director. \\"The Town\\" is good entertainment and one of the best films of the year (not the best, though), and I won't be surprised to see it pick up a bunch of nominations come awards season.rprised to see it pick up a bunch of nominations come awards season.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I was in Universal Studios Orlando a while back and saw this Hello Kitty in one of the arcades. You had to play to win, and I was quite unsuccessful. So, I went to Amazon.com to see if I could find it and got pretty lucky! It's absolutely adorable. I really love it and am ordering a second just to have on hand in case anything happens to the first one. Would highly recommend if you like Hello Kitty, or kitties in general :)<br />I'd imagine that kids would quite like it as well.
B001U0D786|4.0|This film is a melodrama about selfish people and selfless people, whose lives intertwine during the end of World War II. Karma comes into play.<br /><br />Many viewers were put off by the central plot of the film, which involves marital infidelity, while others took issue with some apparent historical inaccuracies, so if you are sensitive to these things, then maybe the movie isn't for you. Me, I just want to be entertained. If you are a fan of Ralph Fiennes and/or Juliette Binoche, then you should give this picture a try.<br /><br />Of course, given the age of the film, you are probably already a fan or foe of this movie.<br /><br />If you are a fan and considering upgrading to the Blu-ray version, you should be aware that there are a couple transfers currently out there - the one you will most likely come across is the pressing from a company in Canada called Alliance. It's a 1080i transfer and it pretty much stinks.<br />There is a terrible amount of grain in most of the shadow/night scenes, and there is even a few seconds where a vertical scratch in the original source film is visible. There is a German version at 1080p that is supposed to be better, but I haven't seen it. Anyway, you should hang on to your original DVD version of the film until Miramax gets it right...<br /><br />****Update 4/15/2012****<br /><br />Miramax/Lionsgate finally released this film in 1080p, and it is a big improvement over the first copy I bought. This new transfer pretty much eliminates the annoying amount of grain that plagued the earlier Blu Ray release. If you buy this disc new, I suggest you look at the case before removing the shrinkwrap - if it says \\"Miramax\\" in the lower right on the face of the case (Miramax/Lionsgate on the spine), you are good to go. If it says \\"Alliance\\" in the lower right on the face of the case, don't open it and get a refund/exchange, because it's that crappy transfer.

If you're only familiar with the Jabs version of the Scorps do yourself a favor<br />and get this album. This album, along with UFO's Strangers In The Night, Thin Lizzy's Live and Dangerous and Deep Purple's Made in Japan<br />are must have live albums. Yes, I know, there are others as well.

1595141979|5.0|My Thoughts: Shadow Kiss is the 3rd book in the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead, and even though Richelle Mead gives a quick summary of everything that has taken place in the first two books, you just have to read those to fully appreciate Shadow Kiss.     The choice of title is perfect: once you have finished reading the 3rd book you'll understand exactly why this title fits perfectly and how it describes the story.    Shadow Kiss is the most intense novel of the series so far: the emotional intensity and depth Richelle Mead makes Rose explore are extraordinary.    In my opinion Shadow Kiss was the best book in the series (so far): the plot was layered and I enjoyed that there were several storylines, the characters who got \\"screentime\\" really made the most of it (Adrian is a fantastic new, funny and original character) though I would have liked to see even more Christian/Rose scenes (I have a feeling these two are so similar they should become great friends). The relationship between Dimitri and Rose evolves and I loved the intensity of Dimitri's feelings, something we got more and more glimpses of all through this 3rd book.    One of the major concepts aside (that Rose is becoming crazy and that's why she's seeing ghosts), it was nice to see Rose so grounded and maturely trying to process her hardships. Rose has come a long way since the 1st book, she has matured and grown emotionally so much, and seeing how Shadow Kiss ended, I bet she still has a long way to go...     I very much enjoyed how in Shadow Kiss Richelle Mead spent some time on vampire politics and exploring different ideas about reform. Rose did some (self) examination of guardians and dhampirs and her own role and life within the system she has known, and was good to see her question some of the things/facts she grew up with. And finally Lissa managed to redeem herself after the big disappointment and anger she caused to me in Frostbite. :-) Even though she wasn't a character I was particularly interested in, in Shadow Kiss Richelle Mead spent more time developing Lissa's character and showing us tidbits of her personality, thoughts and feelings, and I have to say, I found her interesting!    When trying to choose which character I particularly liked, I discovered that I have many favourite characters: I loved reading every scene Christian was in, especially his bantering with Rose, that was a high of the novel; then there is Adrian, another extremely entertaining character, whose flirting with Rose I was always looking forward to, just loved reading Rose's sarcastic dry comments to his chivalrous, charming ones :-D Even though I'm all for Dimitri, I would like to see more of Adrian as I think he is a very exciting and complex character, and I would love if Richelle Mead explored him in more deatil.     Then there is of course Dimitri. Strong, powerful, solid rock to Rose Dimitri, who is opening up more and accepting his love for Rose. The conclusion of Rose and Dimitri's love was beautiful. At the end of Shadow Kiss I had the exact same feeling I had when seeing the last episodes of Season 2 of Buffy. The heartache, the sorrow and the resignation to surmount the pain just for a little more. My heart broke to see Rose having to go through another devastating grief so soon after *he who shall not be named for spoiler reasons*!    What I enjoyed the most in Shadow Kiss was the emotional intensity: Rose's fears about not being able to handle the side effects of Lissa's magic, her guilt over Mason, her growing love for Dimitri and then the ultimate heartbreak and devastation (which I'm sure Richelle Mead will still be able to up in the next book) were wonderfully done, it took the reader on an overwhelming emotional journey.     Shadow Kiss was an addictive read, not only I gobbled it up in 2 days, but I lived and breathed with the characters.    Plot: 8/10  Characters: 9/10  Ending: 9/10  Writing: 8/10  Cover: 8/10

Not only is this book extremely well-written, but it also has thought-provoking content that will give you a new perspective to look at in terms of \\"outliers.\\" Malcolm Gladwell presents many people and situations that form certain sociological patterns. He then takes that information and develops theories to explain them in ways that are unlike the ideas that most of society holds. Overall, this is a great read; you won't regret purchasing it and you will recommend it to your friends.
B000001DZM|5.0|Few can ever forget the movie \\"Priscilla: Queen Of The Desert\\". From the great costumes (the film won the Oscar for Best Costume Design of 1994), it's innovative story, and compelling performances, the movie's icing-on-the-cake was its wonderful soundtrack. Music from the 1960's to the 1990's was used as the film's backdrop and really helped to enhance the story as \\"Priscilla...\\" is about three drag queens who venture to Alice Springs, Australia from Sydney to perform their cabaret act up north.<br /><br /> The highlight of songs include the opening number \\"I've Never Been To Me\\", Gloria Gaynor's cover of \\"I Will Survive\\", and the Abba hit \\"Mamma Mia\\".<br /><br /> A great film, you will love owning this splendid soundtrack to the best motion picture about drag queens ever produced!<br /><br /> There are a total of 19 tracks that include remixes of \\"I Will Survive\\" and \\"I Love The Nightlife\\".

But I still enjoy all the others & the Amazon Marketplace price was good for this Ultimate Edition 2 ($19.48 incl shpg).  They are all so rich in details.  I always notice something new every time I watch them.  Price of the Ultimate Editions 1 & 2 dropped dramatically once 3 & 4 were about to be released (Reg $39.98).  I wouldn't pay more than $20 each for these Ultimate Ed sets but the case & other extras, like the Photo Book, are BEAUTIFUL, so long as you have the shelf space knowing there will be 6 more after these 1st two.  Discs 1 & 2 (of 4) are rather redundant, Theatrical version & the Extended version.  Disc 3 has interesting set details but sort of annoying having to click-click-click everywhere (interactive exploring).  I myself DO enjoy all the bonus featurettes \\"Creating the World of Harry Potter\\", this has Part 2: The Characters.  I like the interviews & behind scenes productions that are put together in a way that's more than just an after thought to sell as a Bonus disc.  But if you the type satisfied w/ the single Blockbuster-type DVD, there are plenty around for $5-10.  Oh, one tip about Harry Potter movies.  If you haven't read the books (like me) & find parts of the films that don't quite make sense, Google some H.P. blogs.  There's usually an explanation.

B002ZG98LO|5.0|The first two reviews here are excellent and should be read and given positive votes. I don't suggest paying to much attention to those indicating it is unoriginal. In a nutshell if you are a fan of the original [[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]] you should definitely see this movie. That said, this is not the original. There are key differences in the storylines. Here are a few of the differences:<br /><br />1. There are some experienced jungle fighters in this group that have never seen this jungle.<br />2. They are not a crack merc team that have worked together for years that have maps and a common mission.<br />3. They are not in search of another military unit gone missing.<br />4. They were not dropped in the jungle by the US government under false pretenses, in fact they have no idea how they got where they are and who dropped them.<br />5. The thrown together group is made of people that have never met before ranging from experienced merc to off the street serial killer.<br />6. They were dropped separately along with other alien species.<br />7. There are traps set by the new group, by others in previous drops, and the Predators as well.<br />8. There are more Predators and they aren't all the same type.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer I was intriqued but sceptical considering the poor writing, directing, casting, et cetera of the last film in the series, [[ASIN:B00147F8Z0 Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem (Extreme Unrated Set + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]. I rented [[ASIN:B0040YFR1Y Predators ( + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]] on demand through my cable company and was on the edge of my seat throughout. After reading reviews here I'm glad to see people are in agreement of the need to return to tried and true style. My only question is why didn't the studio jump on this story by Robert Rodriguez long ago? I'm glad it finally came to fruition as it is well worth adding to your library. I was happy to see an ending that leaves itself open to a sequel and cross my fingers that Rodriguez will write it and produce it as well.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|[[ASIN:B003ITZBW2 Batman: Under the Red Hood (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] , combining the best-selling graphic novels, [[ASIN:1401225160 Batman: A Death in the Family (DC Comics Classic Library)]], and [[ASIN:1401207561 Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1]] and [[ASIN:1401209017 Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 2]], is, arguably, the best-ever direct-to-DVD animated DC feature. Combining the tragedy of the loss of a Robin (Jason Todd) at the hands of a homocidal Joker, the pain of Batman in failing to prevent the murder, the emergence of a major new force in the Gotham underworld, and the unpredictable impact and moral code of nearly-immortal Ra's al Ghul, the surprisingly short feature melds all these elements into a literate, well-crafted and exciting 'whole'.<br /><br />The voice talents are superb, although, as a long-time Batman fan, I'd have loved hearing Kevin Conroy voice the Caped Crusader, in this production. Neil Patrick Harris makes a very credible adult Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Harris is making quite a career voicing young DC heroes...I loved him as Flash in [[ASIN:B000PFSYO4 Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], as well!) Jensen Ackles is equally good as the youthful Red Hood, as is Jason Isaacs' portrayal of Ghul. Truthfully, I felt John DiMaggio's Joker lacked the edge of Mark Hamill's interpretation, but I'm partial to Hamill's portrayal, and you can judge for yourself...<br /><br />The artwork is simply incredible; just pop in a Warner/DC-produced DVD from a few years back, and you will be amazed at how much the definition, line-quality, and overall appearance has improved! This is certainly movie screen-caliber stuff.<br /><br />I always love Bruce Timm's 'picks' as additional features, from over a decade of animated Batman TV episodes; they touch upon the themes of the feature, offering an earlier 'take', geared to the younger TV demographic. Fascinating stuff! The history of Robin feature is fun, too, if a bit superficial. I wasn't as thrilled by the Jonah Hex short, which didn't fit in with the rest of the material, and clearly served as a plug to the live-action film (which bombed, sorry, guys!)...but overall, the DVD is top-notch.<br /><br />Great work, DC!nah Hex short, which didn't fit in with the rest of the material, and clearly served as a plug to the live-action film (which bombed, sorry, guys!)...but overall, the DVD is top-notch.

0596009208|5.0|I'm a software developer for more than 20 years. I did important projects using C, C++ and C# on Mac as well as PC but I never had the opportunity to use Java. Today I have. So, because I had some nice experience with 'Head First' releases in the past I picked up this book and started reading. Being quite familiar with other (OO-) languages already, it took me 10 hours to browse through almost 700 pages. Of course, I didn't do any exercise and some parts I did skip. Nevertheless I enjoyed this book very much because it presents a lot of information in such a way it never gets boring and it isn't to difficult to grasp. Although I'm already familiar with the OO terminology in this book it was still interesting to discover how Java provides these things compared to C#. The book doesn't indeed tell all details. It just tells enough: for real OO starters so that they are not overwhelmed as well as for people trying to get a good overview of an extra language. The book its style is really the Head First way. This does not need any discussion I think: you love it or you don't. Again, this book pleased me.

0316066524|2.0|I honestly don't think I have ever regretted reading a book before, until this one.  Usually, even for books that I dislike, my dislike has some intellectual basis, but I'm always glad to have experienced the book.  Here, it's just pure dislike and disappointment.  The experience of the book was not worth the time and effort.      I've read many books in my life, and some of them much longer than Infinite Jest (Proust, e.g.). But I have never struggled to finish a book, or dreaded having to pick it up and slog through a few more pages before I got too bored and had to put it down.  This happened time after time with this book.  It was a lot of work for very little reward.  Obviously, there are a lot of pages to get through.  That would be a minor issue if the story narrative and character development were compelling enough.  They are not.  Granted, there are some interesting things in this book.  Interesting ideas, interesting stories, etc.  But they are so few and far between, so chopped up and spread so thin, that it's just not worth it.      I love DFW's essays.  They are smart, really insightful, and often quite funny.  This book is pretty smart, occasionally insightful, but rarely funny.  This is so despite countless attempts at humor.  A lot of the \\"humorous\\" scenes painted here are just stupid, in my humble opinion.  One almost listens for a rim shot at the end of some of the more blatant attempts at humor.      Finally, if you're at all into books that provide some sort of closure to the 1,000 pages of character development you've just suffered through, this book is not for you.  We don't know what ends up happening to the main characters or the main plot lines.  But the ignorance we are left in has no clear literary significance (at least not to me).  It almost seems like DFW just stopped writing.      So it's not funny even though it tries to be, it's too long for the content, and we're left hanging in a meaningless way.  The book is not stupid.  It's verycomplex.  It must have taken so much work by a clearly brilliant guy to write it.  It's just not that good.  Two stars.      If you're thinking about reading this book, think hard before you start it.  If you're like me, you won't stop until you are finished, if only out of pure stubbornness.  And for any daunting book like this one, once you have read it you have a perverse incentive to think highly of it.  This reinforces the feeling that you have experienced something exclusively great.  I think that explains a lot of the positive reviews.  The rest must just have drastically different taste than I do.
0812550706|3.0|It's easy to understand the enduring appeal of \\"Ender's Game\\" for precocious youth.  A six-year old boy genius is recruited into Battle School, where is manipulated by devious and amoral adults who are determined to use the boy's genius to destroy an alien species.  The boy is smart and sensitive, and unbearably alone who must shoulder the fate of the human race.  And ultimately who is manipulated into using his genius to do an act of unspeakable evil, and he must spend the rest of his life searching for salvation and redemption.      These themes are, of course, present in all popular children's fiction, ranging from Roald Dahl to Tolkien, except I find these these writers to be much more creative than Orson Scott Card.  In his introduction, Card writes that he has received loving fan mail from the precocious youth who worship him (which is what he sort of expected), but he's also received mail from adults who \\"loathed\\" \\"Ender's Game.\\"  It's also easy to see why adults would loathe the novel:  the writing is terrible, the plot silly and incredible, and Ender a boy you would want to slap and kick in the butt.        I read Isaac Asimov vociferously when I was a teenager, but now that I'm in my thirties I find his writing turgid and wooden, and can no longer read him.  Orson Scott Card is probably the same for most people; \\"Ender's Game\\" is teenage science fiction.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|What would life be like if someone else was in control of your life? How does one live not knowing for sure if he is making his own decision or not?    \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is about IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell). He has a very routine based life. For example, his life is entirely based on his wristwatch. Harold is assigned to audit Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). She is purposely not paying her taxes, because she simply does not believe in paying taxes. During this process, Harold hears a women's voice. Every time he does something that is routine, he can hear the lady's voice. He is unable to communicate with the voice. In being concerned about this, Harold decides to see university professor Jules Hilbert (Justin Hoffman). Jules comes to the same conclusion that a psychologist would come to. Harold's life is so dull; it is unlikely for it appear in any novels. Jules encourages Harold to determine (if indeed his life is a character from a novel) if he is a work of tragedy or comedy, to help find the author.  As Harold audits Ana, slowly he falls in love with her, and she also. However, when Ana offers cookies to Harold, he refuses saying they could not be used on the count of bribe. Ana is angered by this, and she tells him to leave.  Harold returns to his apartment and while he is watching TV, a crane crashes through his apartment symbolizing that he has no control of his life.    Overall, \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is a great film, that is writing wonderfully well by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Forster.
B000065U1N|1.0|Talk about the virtues of being a \\"hero\\" in practically any civilised nation today, and you are sure to become the laughing stock of whatever social environment you find yourself within. Only in the good ole U.S. of A. does this anachronistic term still carry some value, as showcased abundantly in films like \\"Private Ryan\\" or this high-tech drivel about a disasterous American operation in 1990s Somalia.<br /><br />So what exactly can describe today's all-American hero as we see him in this movie? Well, recruitment office statistics may show that about a third of applicants are practically illiterate, yet the all-American FILM hero is as well-spoken as anyone who ever graduated from acting school. Mentally and morally, he is pretty much just like any other guy. The fact that for years he has been trained to kill people in various \\"professional\\" ways, as well as to avoid being killed himself, has not stunted him emotionally in any way. Oh no. He is a warm guy, conscientious and responsible, a good father and husband, and though he may retort to some mild swearing in combat situations, he is never really foul-mouthed. His relationship with his superiors is relaxed and comradely, more so than in a normal civilian job. In fact, that is all the American hero of today does: he carries out \\"a job\\".<br /><br />And what kind of a job is that then? Well, often he is sent out on missions in far-off countries. This is a good thing, because it means he will only be killing non-Americans. (Whether that includes for instance British soldiers, of which more were killed by American \\"friendly fire\\" in the First Gulf War than by the Iraqis, is an issue these movies rarely delve into.) Whilst in a foreign land populated by foreign people, the all-American hero is sent out on a Special Mission! Wow! This mission is basically inspired by someone \\"upstairs\\" watching too many James Bond movies with soldiers sliding down ropes from helicopters and fast cars racing in and out. It always works for Bond, but unfortunately things don't go quite as well in the real word. To everyone's surprise the enemy not only fires back, he also hits his target. Black Hawk Down.<br /><br />The moment that happens, the brain of our all-American hero short-circuits completely. He develops what might be diagnosed as the Black Hawk Down's Syndrome. He is a full-time professional, meaning that the army is his home and his comrades are his REAL family. This new and completely unexpected situation, for which he is entirely unprepared, now comes before anything else, including the \\"job\\" he is sent out to perform. Suddenly, our hero as well as his superiors have only one thing on their mind: to save their comrades who have been hit. It doesn't matter that in doing so they will inevitably sustain more casualties who are, of course, also their comrades that must be rescued at any price, causing more casualties again in what soon develops into a rapidly accelerating chain reaction of gushing blood and splintered bones. And, of course, it doesn't matter that during this process a thousand locals are wiped out by the American troops.<br /><br />Really, I hear you saying, a thousand? Yes, a thousand locals were killed during this operation, not only militia but also many innocent civilians. The American losses were nineteen dead. Having watched the movie to the end this low number comes as a very surprising bit of concluding statistics. According to the film makers the Americans were constantly under very intense fire from automatic weapons, mainly fired from rooftops whilst they themselves moved though the streets below either on foot or in unarmoured vehicles. You have to ask yourself if this really is a true rendition of what happened on that day, or if the truth is that someone went on a killing spree, thinking they were members of the cast in \\"The Wild Bunch\\"? Oh well, never mind.<br /><br />The thing I find most idiotic about this movie is that though it does not refrain from depicting this blatant display of American incompetence, it still strives to come across as a recruitment promotion film, as if adding a bit of warmongering background music and a few John Wayne sound bites can hide the fact this was a disaster from beginning to end, and the only reason that the Americans weren't massacred completely was that a nearby Pakistani UN unit came to their rescue. Just imagine that. The American Delta Force and Rangers saved at the eleventh hour by Pakistani cavalry! I suppose every cloud has a silver lining after all.<br /><br />The immense popularity of this utter piece of rubbish is hard to understand until you remember it was made in the aftermath of the World Trade Center tragedy. Surely, the sight of US soldiers mowing down a thousand Muslims right in the centre of their own city must have brought a sweet feeling of revenge to a number of viewers.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I certainly don't disagree with the overall political purpose of this mission. But it is not the only one of its kind to fail miserably and cause heavy civilian casualties, and the conclusion must be for the UN to never ever leave such \\"jobs\\" for the US army. Let the British SAS do it, or the Foreign Legion, or the Danish Jaegers, or some German or Finnish special units (surely their quarantine for what they did in WWII must now have run out) - let someone do it who knows their job and let John Wayne stay behind telling stories about heroes by the campfire.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you really want to see a fantastic film about professional army personnel pitted against militias and innocent civilians, watch \\"Bloody Sunday\\", an intelligent and thought-provoking movie.incompetence, it still strives to come across as a recruitment promotion film, as if adding a bit of warmongering background music and a few John Wayne sound bites can hide the fact this was a disaster from beginning to end, and the only reason that the Americans weren't massacred completely was that a nearby Pakistani UN unit came to their rescue.

B003SI9WYG|5.0|I rented this on Video on Demand from Amazon.com. As I was watching it, I had to keep restarting the movie because the playback kept freezing. I didn't say anything, or even write any angry e-mails to customer service because I assumed it was my own computer's fault. Today I got a message from Amazon. They refunded my VOD rental because they noticed I had playback issues! That's GREAT customer service.   I wanted to put this in some kind of general review for Amazon's VOD but there doesn't seem to be one, so I thought it would be appropriate to put it under the movie I rented.    As far as the film goes, Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic. If you haven't seen it, your life is not complete!

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Superhero films represent an area of compromise at our house: I like good ones while my better half generally doesn't bother with them at all.  The hype around the release of \\"The Dark Knight\\" not only tempted Cindy into watching - it colored both of our perceptions while watching it during the original release.<br /><br />See - the hype told us that Heath Ledger had given a once-in-a-lifetime performance that was dark - VERY dark - as The Joker.  Then, just before the release Mr. Ledger died suddenly from an accidental drug overdose, and there seemed to be a between-the-lines insinuation that he had taken the dark portrayal of The Joker to an emotional place where, perhaps, the drug-related death wasn't accidental.<br /><br />So when we first viewed the film in 2008 we couldn't help but wonder if we weren't watching a man careening toward self-destruction, and our stomachs were twisted into knots.  We agreed that the hype was correct - his performance is electric - and no one was surprised a few months later when Ledger joined the exclusive club of actors who earn the Academy Award posthumously.  But we weren't eager for another viewing.<br /><br />Nearly two years later I was ready to view The Dark Knight again, and I came away with a new appreciation not only of Ledger's performance, but of the entire film.  It is interesting that Ledger completely re-invented a characterization of a role previously blistered by Jack Nicholson.  Twenty years ago who would have thought that someone could give us another vision of The Joker that was more disturbing and vivid than the Nicholson who burns Jack Palance alive in the original Batman?<br /><br />Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, and the dual nature of Billionaire Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego are even more pronounced in this version than in \\"Batman Returns\\" as Batman has many fans for his vigilante crime-stopping activities, but he also knows that his activities are squarely outside of legal law enforcement.  But this Gotham City is dark - very dark - and Citizen Bruce Wayne knows that the People need someone they can believe in who doesn't wear a mask.  Gary Oldman returns as James Gordon, en route to becoming the familiar commissioner and apparently the only honest cop in Gotham City.  Aaron Eckhart is brilliant as Harvey Dent, an equally rare uncorrupt District Attorney.  Dent's willingness to take personal risks combating Gotham City's organized crime figures makes him something of a white knight in the city's consciousness, and Bruce Wayne is plenty willing to let Dent be the hero.  Katie Holmes is ably replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, childhood friend of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City Assistant D.A., and one of the key sequences of the film involves Batman and the police being placed into a position of choosing between saving the D.A. or his assistant.  Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine return as trusted Bruce Wayne employees Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox.  Both actors are incapable of a bad performance, and both lend weight and wisdom to their respective roles: Fox becomes uneasy when Wayne turns all Gotham cell-phones into eavesdropping mechanisms in an attempt to flush out the Joker and Alfred acts as a trusted carrier of a letter between Rachel and Bruce.<br /><br />The villains are again formidable here: Eric Roberts' Sal Maroni has taken over the old Falcone mob.  Ng Chin Han plays Lau, a mob accountant who takes it upon himself to spirit away the mob's money to Hong Kong just ahead of closing lawmen.  Cillian Murphy returns as Scarecrow.<br /><br />But all villains collectively take a back seat to the force of nature of Ledger's Joker.  Ledger's performance is so unhinged it seemed that the other actors were truly frightened of him, especially when armed with a knife.<br /><br />On a second viewing \\"The Dark Knight\\" becomes so much more than a superhero movie.  It is the best crime drama since \\"The Departed\\" and the fact that Bruce Wayne is a well-armed costumed vigilante barely impinges on the \\"real\\" elements of the film.  By the end of The Dark Knight I was still gasping for breath.  And I still wish Heath Ledger were with us.real\\" elements of the film.  By the end of The Dark Knight I was still gasping for breath.

031603438X|3.0|The audiobook version of Keith Richard's *Life* has Keith reading chapter titles and the introduction.  The rest of the book is read by Johnny Depp and singer/songwriter Joe Hurley.<br /><br />Depp's reading is great. He lets the content speak for itself.  If you're interested in Keith Richards or the Rolling Stones or Rock and Roll, you'll love the stories in this book.  However...<br /><br />Joe Hurley is THE ABSOLUTE WORST READER I HAVE EVER HEARD.  I think he decided to try to sound and act like Keith Richards but instead he sounds like an ignorant Jack Sparrow (Depps character from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies).  Keith does laugh in interviews, but it's because he's Keith.  Joe Hurley laughs at the worst possible times, and it often changes the meaning of what he's reading.<br /><br />Also, I think he's trying to read it like he's drunk so he's often adding words and that messes with the content.<br /><br />I'm so upset at Joe Hurley's performance of this.  I feel like turning it off but can't because I'm interested in Keith and his life.
