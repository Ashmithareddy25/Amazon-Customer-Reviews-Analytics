0143038419|1.0|I may have missed it, since there are so many reviews, but has anyone said this book was just not well written?  I read non-fiction as I would fiction - I want good writing to go with a good story. This is neither. I know she's telling her own story, blemishes and all, but, my god, she is annoying. Her insights are shallow (cleansing the stones at the ashram is like cleansing her heart? I read that three times to find the punchline), her style of writing is too slick (someone mentioned \\"Sex and the City - good comparison), her humor is self-indulgent. mostly too cute and coy.   I have no problem with people exploring other spiritual paths, indulging in food, or exploring their sexuality. And maybe she came to some spiritual understanding of herself. She just didn't express it well. Not a good writer.

0345505387|4.0|I am an Outlander fan, obsessed really, and I can't get enough of it. I looked forward to receiving the graphic novel. If you are a fan of Diana Gabaldon's, and a fan of the Outlander series you will enjoy this book. I think, however, that you have to read it more than once to appreciate it. Some of the artwork is beautiful, some of it is inconsistent, which bothered me, but not enough to prevent me from enjoying the story. There are a few new twists to the story, and some interesting backstory details. I don't know though, if you didnt read Outlander if you would understand The Exile. Read Outlander first, then read the next 6 books, then come back for Exile.

1881273156|5.0|This book should be read by all married couples.  This is also a good resource for small groups.
0307592839|5.0|With this book, Jennifer Egan took me places I didn't know I wanted to go - into the minds of people whose flaws are just like mine only more interesting, and even into the future. Her writing is evocative in the best sense - I recognize that I have been there.  The book seemed as though it would be hard to read because of the variety of narrators and styles, but in fact, it wasn't - it has an emotional flow that drew me smoothly through.
0312600844|2.0|This would be a book that Oprah would love because it is about people using their Freedom to make selfish choices that simply feed their egos all the while thinking they are a great service to the world. It is about people with huge amounts of money condemning other people with huge amounts of money.  It is about people who rape and pillage Freedom while condemning Freedom and the American way of life.  It is about hypocrisy of the highest level.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I have been an avid Dexter fan since the very beginning.  Michael C. Hall's acting always has been the brightest spot of the show.  Season four takes Dexter to a whole new level.  The seasons have gotten better and better as they have come and this season is no different.  In my opinion, this season pulls on every emotional string known and it even made me feel like I was losing control along with Dexter.  The writing is top notch and the character development is done to perfection.  I am trying to be as unspecific as possible as to not give away anything that happens.  If you are a Dexter fan, extreme or casual, this season is a must have and will keep you thoroughly entertained.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|What a surprise.  A super group that really lives up to the hype.  Amazing musicianship and chemistry between these 4 guys.  Awesome rock songs with all the pyrotechnics you could want (Bonamassa is the king on guitar) and great riffs aplenty.  The whole cd is great, but I'm partial to Black Country, The Great Divide, and Song of Yesterday.  These guys are special and I look forward to seeing them on tour in the coming months.  Two thumbs way up.
0679882820|5.0|We bought this book when our son was 6 months old.  We still read it even now that he is 2 1/2. The board book is small and great for travel to Grandma's house.
0316098337|5.0|I can't say enough wonderful things about this book.  It kept me up late two nights in a row because it was nearly impossible to put down.  It was heartbreaking and joyful and beautiful and believable.  The narrative voice is ASTOUNDING -- I've been fortunate enough to have two precocious 5-year-olds and Jack's voice is spot-on.<br /><br />I went into it completely spoiler-free and recommend that approach for anyone.<br /><br />Just such a great book!

B002Q7JYPC|5.0|Yes, the Eagles are getting old but not only can they make light of their situation but their music is like a fine wine. I wonder how many of today's musicians will still be relevent and selling out arena's almost 40 yrs from today! I saw the the eagles 30 yrs ago at giants stadium (with Heart & The little River band) and just recently saw them again in Dallas TX. (A 3 hr show). They sound as good as ever and in many ways have become the soundtrack of my life. They deserve their renewed success and truely seem to appreciate the fact that their fans (and new generations of fans) still appreciate their incredible songwriting and vocal talents. Their newest album has many  songs worthy of the eagles songbook!
B00382S9V4|5.0|I really hate how Amazon lumps in VHS, DVD and Blu-ray together. Often, Blu-ray films have unique problems that occur with transferring, given the technology is fairly recent.  You then end up browsing all of the reviews (tossing aside the DVD Ebert reviewers out there) to figure out:<br /><br />1) Is it worth getting on blu-ray if I already own it?<br />and<br />2) How is the quality of the Blu-ray?<br /><br />The second being most important, I can say that even though reviewers like A.Dent complain that the Blu-ray \\"skips\\" or is juddery in some fashion, I can assure you it is not (or at least not in the disc by design). I believe that the people on here who complain of skipping either 1) received faulty discs or 2) the manufacturer re-processed it since to fix the errors and I ended up with that version. I almost didn't purchase this on Blu-ray based on what A.Dent and one other reviewer stated, and I want to ease people's minds: the Blu-ray version is great and mine plays flawlessly. Seeing Brosnan's minute facial features/smirks/fake-surprise in high-def really gets you into his character that much more.<br /><br />To the former question of is it worth getting on Blu-ray, I can't tell you. We all know action movies are always worth the upgrade, but I honestly just believe you're going to be replacing it at some point and I'm somewhat of an HD purist and notice the difference even in up-converted DVDs. So if you already own it, maybe another movie you don't own is a priority. But it's only $11.99 (or so, depending on the day), so it's not a gigantic investment. Many of us are Blu-ray-ifying all of our old libraries, and this movie is one that's worth keeping around for a while. (I have several movies that I don't like enough to even own on DVD -- don't ask why I own them -- that I'll let sink into the great beyond of cassette tapes VHS).<br /><br />This movie is one of the few that appeals to both sexes without one taking a sacrifice. Every bachelor pad should have it in stock!
B0000071GA|5.0|Interesting thing about Headhunter: This album is better than any possible greatest hits package that could be produced from it. It's like Journey in that Infinity is so good, it makes their G.H. album look ridiculous. Same here. A Krokus G.H. album should have all these tunes, plus Heatstrokes and a few others. This album is a standard setter, like High n' Dry by Def Lep or Cat Scratch Fever by Ted Nugent.
B003WSFXKY|4.0|first of all, read the title of the album, it's called \\"guitar heaven\\" for it's guitar standards and carlos' guitar input and influence, he really puts his all in this album, as any carlos santana fan would say, this album is simply for music appreciators of carlos' style of playing his music, this isn't his versions of how he would've played these songs.... they are all versions of his GUITAR input, AFTER these songs are ALREADY established classics

B000H6FE1M|5.0|If you're a little kid looking for an \\"AWESOMETASTIC\\" toy, then this is not what you want. If you're a person who collects figurines or schleich figurines(Like me), then this is the perfect addition to your collection! Personally, I use my collection of 60 or so Schleich animals for anatomy guiance while drawing. It's a very useful thing to have :) This cute hedgehog is very durable. The detail put into it is great and looks like it had care put into it. I would reccomment buying this animal :)

B003TML0VO|4.0|Most of the tracks are great and great the way they're performed.  However none are originaly by carlos santana who is featured on the cover of the album and all of its advertising.  That's sort of a misrepresentation.  The video is a documentory showing no performance.  That was a disapointment because of the time and money I spent getting the deluxe version instead of the standard.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|YES! THIS ALBUM IS DEFINTELY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS! AN I DO WISH IT WOULD OF BEEN MORE OF A HYRID THEORY/METEORA TYPE OF ALBUM, BUT THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!!!! THE LYRICS ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! THE MUSIC MAY NOT BE THE BEST (BEING THAT THIS ALBUM IS WAAAY MORE SOFT THAN THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS) BUT I PERSONALLY THINK THAT CHESTER'S VOICE IN SOFT SONGS SOUNDS GREAT!. WHEN I FIRST HEARD \\"THE CATALYST\\" I WAS LIKE \\"WOW! THIS IS NOT LINKIN PARK!\\". IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO LIKE THIS SONG, AND WHEN I HEARD THE ENTIRE ALBUM I WAS JUST TRIPPING OUT ON HOW DIFFERENT THEIR MUSIC WAS NOW. BUT AFTER LISTENING TO IT FOR A COUPLE OF TIMES, I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS CD! I HAVE BEEN A LP FAN SINCE HYBRID THEORY AND I CAN TRULY SAY THAT I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD! LP FANS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR MUSIC WILL NOT ALWAYS BE THE SAME (IT WOULD BE KIND OF BORING IF YOU ASK ME) SO LETS STOP CRITICIZING AND APPRECIATE REAL MUSIC!

B0036EH3XE|4.0|Lost was always a great show, but not a perfect one. It was always entertaining. It always had great acting. It was frequently heartfelt, and often truly interesting. But it took shortcuts. It contained elements that were there for no reason but creating short-term dramatic interest. Elements that were never followed through in a satisfactory way.    An example is the sequence of numbers that had to be typed in every 108 minutes. If you've seen the last episodes, you know where those numbers came from. But there is no explanation as to why a computer was programmed to require those particular numbers to be typed in, or who programmed it that way.    So, Lost was always a bit lacking in integrity. To me, it was clear that such questions as the reason those numbers had to be typed in would never be answered. It just really didn't make sense, and wasn't going to ever have an answer that was satisfying and complete and resonated with everything else. They cheated a bit in order to add short-term dramatic interest.    The way I dealt with such elements all along was to say: \\"Hey, it's not perfect. I accept that the writers cheat a bit. But, if I forgive them for that, and look past those elements, there is a whole heck of a lot to enjoy.\\"    Many people hate the last season because so much is unexplained. But I submit to you: it was clear all along that there was much that was not going to be explained. Much that was going to turn out to be nothing but short-term dramatic manipulation. No one should have expected the last season to be different than it was, in that sense.    With that background, I will say this about the finale: It was lovely and haunting. It was like a poem. It shouldn't be taken too literally. <The next sentence is a spoiler, so skip to the next paragraph if you haven't seen it.> The image of Jack walking by the stream at the end, while the joyful, healing reunion was somehow going on in some other dimension, outside of time so that others who died atother times could also be there, allowing him to finally let go, moved me to tears. Other elements of the ending had the same effect as I reflected on it, in a fairly blissed-out blur, for 45 minutes after the last episode. That's certainly one of the strongest responses I've ever had to anything I've ever seen on screen. (In fact, the poetic, non-literal nature of the ending actually reminded me a bit of a couple of Stanley Kubrick's films...)    Another reviewer reports that right before the sixth season, it came out that \\"Matthew Fox says Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse will prove they knew where they were going all along when the show ends in 'an incredibly powerful, very sad and beautiful way. I think is going to be pretty awesome.'\\"     That reviewer disagreed with Fox so strongly that he gave the sixth season 1 star. But for me, Fox was pretty much right, so I gave it 5 stars the first time I wrote this review.    But on further reflection, due to the cheating the writers resorted to, I can't quite give the season, or the series, a 5. But even so, the very best of the series is a 5+. It's well worth watching. Just don't expect every loose end to be tied up.
0316067598|4.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" was recommended to me by a friend who was a Navy hospital corpsman. I thought it a compelling story, but perhaps dwelling overly long on SEAL training -- I appreciate the rigors a SEAL candidate must endure, but a little goes a long way in describing them. The story of the mission itself was concise, graphic, and compelling. I admire those who give of themselves, even to giving their life, in service to our country.<br /><br /> Larry
B003MTGW80|5.0|I hate when Amazon does not list the contents of CDs, especially box sets. Anyway, for Giulini fans, these are classic recordings at a fabulous price.

B000002UD0|5.0|If you ever wonder why music fans want to shoot music critics, come with me............<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004WGEL Plastic Ono Band]] is recognized universally as a definitive rock album, and it is. A Beatle literally ripping himself apart and putting himself back together in public was a gripping, frightening sight. Rock stars in 1970 just didn't do this. Lennon did. Any artist that does a \\"confessional\\" album is probably referencing this album, know it or not.<br /><br />A lot of Plastic  Ono Band felt like raw proto punk, and if it was not in sound, it was in spirit. Walls and Bridges is slick, 1970s rock.<br /><br />It is also, I feel in a lot of ways, more naked, more vulnerable, then Plastic Ono. If the more produced structures on Walls And Bridges are lost on the punk obsessed music pressed elete, this does not surprise me. There is a rule that you have to hate Yes and love The Velvet Underground to REALLY understand music, and most rock writing stems from that premise<br /><br />Which is why these imbeciles will 'never get the importance of Walls and Bridges. When a Beatle, an Icon, a God, does no intro, no lead in, but starts an album \\"Got to get down/down on my knees.\\" something is up. Hello, Mr/Mrs. Critic. Anyone HOME in there?<br /><br />\\"Going Down On Love,\\" is the track. The track one of the two best songwriters, a maker of late 20th Century culture, writes when he has been SUCH a bad boy, his wife kicks him out. A King, banished to LA, wants nothing more than to be forgiven.<br /><br />What amazing courage. Not since 1954, when Frank Sinatra made [[ASIN:B000006OHD In the Wee Small Hours]] has a major star let us see him this broken.

Two bookends of the same wild party.<br /><br />\\"What Ya' Got,\\" could have actually been off Plastic Ono Band. \\"You Don't Know What You Got, Until You Lose it,\\" Lennon screams, on perhaps his most blistering rock. It is about as fun as alcohol detox for Lennon, who bellows \\"Oh Baby baby baby give me one more chance.\\" He is taking standard puppy love rock lines and turning them into emotional brutality. Our idol, our Beatle, is in pain, and we can do nothing but listen to it. It's searing.<br /><br />I really don't need to explain \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out,\\" or the rest of Walls and Bridges. If you listen and don't hear, I can't help you.<br /><br />But for those that can, this album is essential for any understanding of Lennon and his story.

0920668372|5.0|I first heard this story when my kids were small. They are now adults. I bought this recently for a friend who has small children. She was as touched by the story as I was many years ago. It may seem a little corny, but it is a timeless description of a mother's love for her children that endures.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|The SB-900 is much easier to operate than the previous model, SB800, and much more reliable.  I really appreciate the ease of switching from on camera to remote without having to dig deep into the menus.  It still gets fussy about brands of battery.  I prefer NiMH for the fast recycle time, but just like the SB-800, I have to determine which brand works best.  Meanwhile I am using Alkaline for the number of flashes I can get before replacing them.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick Ass is just an amazing movie about a bunch of normal people who parade around in costumes busting up crime. The movie is quite funny at times, absolutely filled with satire, and has some of the most ridiculous superhero scenes ever shot. I was very surprised to find out this was actually a low budget Indy movie, as it was very well done and has more of a summer blockbuster feeling.     This set comes with a Blue Ray, Digital Copy, DVD  copy, and a Director Commentary (where you find out they really had no budget).
B002A4Q652|5.0|I've been introduced to some new music this year, Within Temptation and Delain.  I'm completely in love with these chicks!  April Rain is a fast paced-roller coaster of keyboard heavy metal, jammed packed with thunderous guitars, and the voice of an angel.      I can see how some people can call them \\"too commercial\\", but don't let that fool you.  Delain is a long-ways away from American crap radio music!      April Rain is one of the best CD's I've ever purchased and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B002ZG9968|4.0|This movie showed how versatile Alex O'Loughlin can be.  I love romantic comedy films and the characters were portrayed very well.  If you are still a romantic at heart, watch this movie.   I am a Moonlight fan so I hope to see Alex do more movies in the near future.
B003IY47JK|4.0|Delain is incredible.  A great mix of keyboard and thunderous metal guitars.  Most songs are very well composed and feature vocalist Charlotte Wessels.  The only songs I don't enjoy are the ones that introduce other singers.  I question why would they put a microphone in front of anyone other than Charlotte.  Such a rare mix and beauty and talent, why have a growling/shrieking barbarian backing her up?      Make sure you pick up a copy with bonus tracks.  The acoustic versions are completely unique, sounding completely different than the originals.  Also I prefer the \\"Charlotte only\\" version of No Compliance.  Overall I prefer April Rain to this album, but this is certainly a great addition to any collection.
1582701709|4.0|All of the endless debates playing out in this book's review section are a waste of time.<br />I find it sad to think that so many people have given up the ability to imagine that there are forces at work in our daily lives and that we can have, at least, some modicum of control over them.<br />The Secret is merely a reminder that there are more important things in life to think about than data and cold 'conclusions'. It reminds us that love is a concept that permeates every known area of society, has been written about more extensively than any other subject ever. Yet, in this modern era, we so easily ignore it, devalue it and overlook it. The very idea that science can and does explain everything is the height of arrogance and nothing less. It is the same as pretending to know the mind of God (another sad phenomenon among human species).<br />I read The Secret and The Power. I also have both books on my ipod as audiobooks. I listen to them and try to practice the methods presented simply because they help me to remember love in my daily life. They help me to keep the principles of exercising love involved in my normal behavior. Is that a bad thing? A problem? No, it is not.<br />Lighten-up folks. Life is not a legal brief nor are we lab rats. We're people who can think for ourselves. We are human beings who have mastered the use of tools in all aspects of our lives. The Secret is a tool. Use it if you think it will help you regardless of what the \\"scientists\\" would have us believe.<br />Thanks for helping me define my opinion.
B0006VBFM0|3.0|The watch looks great, I love the colours, the size, the design of the hands.  It works fine and seems very water resistant.  I have been wearing it constantly for five months, I have been swimming and the beach alot, I also wear it for a heated yoga class and when running, so it has been exposed to sweat, sea water, chlorine, sand and sunscreen.  A clear plastic coating on the strap has started to peel off.  The other thing is it has a loud tick. My husband insisted I buy a new watch as he cannot stand it!

0321647440|5.0|I am not sure how I managed without the book for several months. I am so far only scratching the surface but have learnt so many new things that I just couldn't figure out by myself. The hands-on approach working with the pictures on the CD is of course the obvious way of teaching how to use a photo management program, but yet I am very impressed by the structure of the learning. I like the attempt to teach the use of shortcuts and how they are repeated so you do memorise them. The book is highly recommended.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|I didn't know it was coming from Canada. It took for ever to get it. Then it would not play because the DVD player said it was dirty. No more used items for me. Plus there are more and more unscrupulous people doing business on Amazon.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|As soon as I heard Disney was going to do a traditionally-animated film I knew I had to see it. Then when I learned it was based on the fairy-tale \\"The Prince Frog\\", I got even more excited. Well, imagine how happy I was when I realized it was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements (of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Aladdin\\"). So after seeing it, I can safely say it is a sweet and enjoyable film that is probably better than any 2D crap the studio has released since Tarzan in 1999. But the film still lacks. Nothing about it stands out. It doesn't touch you like the old classics. When I went to see \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in the theater 20 years ago, I was struck by its innovative animation, grandiose music and most of all - its sheer heart. It touched me like no other Disney classic had. Here I felt like I was watching something that had already been done better in the past. To sum it up: The Princess and the Frog is a fun movie that evokes old Disney magic but it's a far cry from the superiority of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".
B002JVWRAO|3.0|I own all seasons to date and overall I think \\"Supernatural\\" is a good show.  However, I remain very disappointed with the treatment of minorities in the episodes.  Thus far, one can predict with reasonable certainty that the African American male characters will either be evil or killed off... usually both.  Every \\"angel\\" of brown skin thus far has been evil, with the one exception of the Black gardener \\"Joshua.\\" It seems even in \\"Heaven\\" African American men are relegated to roles of servitude and maintenance, or are just \\"bad elements.\\"<br /><br />I still enjoy the suspense and creativity of the show, although season 5 was mostly gory and corny. So far, however, the heroes are just good old boys... Dean, Sam, Bobby, and Castiel, the \\"angel.\\" The writers can do a much better job conveying the message that good and evil, smart and dumb, come in all colors.  For once, please, let us see a strong, intelligent African American man on the show who is honorable, good, and capable of staying alive. We do exist in real life, you know.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Flying pirate ships and human stars seem like they border on the ridiculous as plot elements, yet they work to create an entertaining fairy tale in [[ASIN:B001AQR3IU Stardust]]. The movie has an A-list cast and strong acting, especially for a \\"fairy tale\\" movie. There are some really delightful scenes, such as De Niro (as Capt. Shakespeare) giving Charlie Cox and Claire Danes lessons in fencing and dancing, respectively. There are also some really original twists on cliched scenes, such as the sword fight with the corpse (it sounds odd, but looks great in practice). It might not be the next Lord of the Rings, but it's pretty fun.

I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to advance their valuation skill set and general corporate finance knowledge.
0439023491|5.0|I hate dystopias. It is my least favorite genre of literature. Despite this, I love the Hunger Games series. I put off reading Catching Fire for a long time, choosing instead to read books in genres I preferred. But I wanted to read Mockingjay, so I had to read Catching Fire. At first, the book was a bit of a chore, not because it was uninteresting, but because the oppressiveness of the government depressed me.<br /><br />A year after Katniss and Peeta's unexpected joint win of the Hunger Games, life has returned somewhat to normal for Katniss. She's more wealthy now, but still goes out to hunt with Gale every Sunday. Her relationships with Gale and Peeta are suffering though. They are both in love with her. She is not in love with either of them; she doesn't really know what she feels. Katniss and Peeta take a brief detour from their home lives by going on the Victory Tour, a required publicity stunt through each district. There, they realize that citizen discontent is simmering and rapidly rising to a boil. Life after the victory tour quickly becomes more difficult as the government will do anything and everything to keep its citizens in check.<br /><br />Catching Fire is anything but hard to read. Even though I hadn't read Hunger Games in a few years, I was immediately familiar with Katniss's world. Collins does a great job of getting you up to speed without feeling like the first few chapters are just a recap. The book is full of action, one painful cliff hanger after another. The book never feels like it's dragging. When there isn't a heartpounding moment of action, you're reading about the details of Katniss's fashion and make-up or experiencing every day life in her village. The Hunger Games fantasy world is richly described. Even without all the action, Katniss's world would make a fascinating book.<br /><br />I love all the characters in this series. Katniss is a three-dimensional character. We see so many of her flaws. She is uncomfortable, awkward, and doesn't allow people in. She often seems to survive on dumb luck alone. But she is also fiercely loyal to her family and friends, brave, smart, and ultimately, good. In Hunger Games, I was thoroughly Team Gale. Now, I am Team Peeta. He is just so wonderful, kind, smart, well-spoken. He is everything that awkward Katniss is not; they play off one another perfectly. But you really can't go wrong with Gale either. Katniss has two fabulous guys to choose from, which makes her life even more difficult. The secondary characters are drawn well. Haymitch is a hardened drunk who is a brilliant and protective mentor when he's sober. Katniss's prep crew are hilarious, yet also far smarter and more knowledgeable than they appear on the surface. I especially like Cinna.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a fabulous book that causes me to forget that I hate dystopias. I cannot wait for Mockingjay.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 / 5esn't allow people in.

0156027321|5.0|This is just a really fun book.  It held my attention for several hours and made me smile.  The interaction between the boy and the tiger is fascinating, and the description of his life at the zoo before his grand adventure is delightful.  Yann Martel is a great writer, and he certainly captivated this reader's imagination.

B003NX6ZDC|3.0|This debut has been classified by some as another Killer's album.  Eh...not really.  Brandon's vocals are top notch here, but the cohesion of Killer's feels absent.  This hits more than it misses.  If you enjoy Killer's music, than you should probably check this out.  But it's not a must have.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson made his name by picking up where Jordan left off.  Since then I've gone back and read everything he wrote.  I'll just say this:  everything he's written has been a page-turner.  This new series has me hooked already.  The Way of Kings is an incredible voyage with great characters that you almost instantly connect to.  I hope he doesn't take the Jordan/Martin route and take 2-3 years between book releases.
034544678X|5.0|unlike many books on \\"dog training\\", this book forces you to confront your own simian behavior which is confusing to your dog.  Once you learn to speak \\"dog\\", life becomes so much better.  I had read other books to little avail, and this one really opened my eyes to my own behavior in relation to communicating effectively with my dog.  I have recommended in person to many other dog owners and all have thanked me for doing so. Do yourself a favor, if you have a dog, get this book NOW.
0385340540|1.0|I picked this up at my parents' house. It is mildly interesting for me having learned Italian and lived in both Treviso and Bologna. And usually I find Grisham's best feature is his plot. But the plot in this is boring, and it beggars belief that in a novel where the central character is learning Italian, and where Grisham is careful to include and translate much of that Italian, that he can't be bothered to get the Italian checked. Such elementary howlers, such as switching from the \\"tu\\" (informal) form to the Lei (formal) in the same sentence and back again, and having an Italian teacher address his new student as \\"tu\\" as an opener (that would not happen). Then things like \\"Possiamo studiare a camminando.\\" Wrong. Or, even more embarrassingly, a basic error such as \\"dov'é lavora?\\" (where is he works?) instead of \\"dove lavora?\\" (where does he work). Annoying sloppiness and it has put me off bothering to finish it.
078322737X|5.0|If your teenage years were during this period of time, you know why this movie is the greatest.
1932907009|4.0|I really wanted to give this book five stars, because Blake Snyder has some great insight on movie structure - I'm always watching for a \\"Save the Cat\\" scene and paying attention to the time-beats when I watch movies now.    The only problem I found was that Snyder loves his own genre too much. When grasping for examples, he turns to \\"Legally Blonde\\" as a good movie while tearing down M. Night Shyamalan's \\"Signs\\" and Sam Raimi's \\"Spiderman\\" as not-so-great movies. Because the author doesn't seek out the appeal of his audience by giving examples from more popular genres, his points are harder to get across and make the book a less enjoyable read.    However, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a simple how-to guide, whether you plan on writing screenplays yourself or if you just want to have better insight when judging a good movie. Also, this is certainly NOT the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need. If you're serious about screenwriting, you're going to need to read many more books on storytelling, pitching, writing, and attend a few seminars.    Don't do as Mr. Snyder does, do as he says, and you'll gain a lot of valuable insight from this book.

0689835604|2.0|I bought this for my 11-month-old granddaughter after reading high ratings and it lasted all of 10 minutes before a flap was torn off.  She loves the pictures and it's a good book for learning parts of the body, but not one for a baby to handle if you want it to stay intact.

0345505387|4.0|I totally enjoyed this new format for Diana Gabaldon. I did have a little trouble following who was speaking and felt like some of the faces - Jamie's especially - evolved into something that wasn't quite right.<br /><br />But still, I really enjoyed this addition to the Outlander Series. I was entertained and did not feel like the characters looked Asian as others have said...I'm not sure why people felt that way.<br /><br />This was my first graphic novel and for the most part I took this as the gift it was to pass the time until book 8 comes out!
B003OFHMKO|5.0|Esperanza Spaulding shot off like a rocket with her eponymous debut album in 2008.  Yet, for as impressive a young jazz artist as she is, the program there seemed a bit unfocussed.  Where was she going to take her unique and most promising talent?<br /><br />I surmised from the first album that she would probably end up in a \\"post bop-fusion\\" mode, exploring and taking off from the early '70's works of such artists as Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and Miles Davis.  The live concert of Ms. Spaulding on PBS' \\"Austin City Limits\\" seemed to confirm this direction.<br /><br />But like Miles Davis, Esperanza Spaulding is much too creative and headstrong a musician ever to be pigeonholed; rather, she appears to be one to lead rather than to follow.  And this perception is confirmed by this stunning second c.d.<br /><br />I have listened to it over and over, and not only am I not tired of it, I find myself picking up something new with each listen.  Immediately, I'm captivated by the charming duet with another young vocal lioness, Gretchen Parlato, on track 10, Jobim's \\"Intuil Paisagem.\\"  (Incidentally, one of the few non-originals.  Really, the only standard is \\"Wild Is the Wind,\\" track 5, but even it doesn't sound like what you may be used to at all).  Likewise, the duet with the immortal Milton Nasciemento, \\"Apple Blossom,\\" track 6, is captivating.<br /><br />But the ouerve of this disc is chamber music, really, and the recording belongs more than anything to the combo of Ms. Spaulding's bass, David Eggar's cello, Entho Todorov's violin and Lois Martin's viola.  Jazz and string quartets?  It absolutely works here.  Kudos to executive producer, Gil Goldstein, one of the best in the business, as well of course to co-producer Esperanza.<br /><br />And Leo Genovese likewise does amazing work on piano.  Check out his solo on track 9, \\"Winter Sun,\\" for example.<br /><br />I predict a Grammy nomination for this c.d.  Granted, the Grammies in jazz (aka the \\"Shammies\\") are generally reserved for talent who has made it.  But Esperanza Spaulding has already received an hellacious amount of recognition for such a young artist.  She richly deserves it, and would deserve the nomination.<br /><br />I call this \\"Music for the Intellect,\\" or \\"Music for the Head.\\"  It won't make it on American Bandstand; you won't give it a 95, because you can't really dance to it.  But this disc is one of the most intelligent, intellectually challenging recordings I have heard in a long time.  Very highly recommended.  RC<br /><br />p.s. - 1/2/11 - This was the only vocal jazz disc of 2010 to make it into Jazz Times' top 40 c.d.'s.  (#34)  I would have predicted that, in terms of it being #1.  Esperanza Spaulding was also nominated as the top new artist.  However, the c.d. was not nominated for a Grammy in the vocal jazz category.  Can't get 'em all correct....RCe it.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:  Great sound quality and incredible bass ! And when I say bass trust me, bass is there.  It can be slightly muddy in very rare occasions but only compared to a really tight real subwoofer.      Great in game sound both from microphone and headphones. Crystal Clear ! Surround option is very nice for horror / thriller games or intense coops (ie. Left 4 Dead / Gears Of War )  Also you can turn of surround sound just with flick of switch on headphones if you dont like the effect in that particular game or movie.    If movie or game supports dolby or dts t, you hit the jack pot. A surround that nearly matches my analog 7.1 speakers comes out of these headphones.    Great interface both by software and hardware.Software uses very little ram whilist giving you lots of features like adjusting dolby surround effect of particular positions or creating g-key or voice morphing profiles.    Very simple hardware interface.\\"Big fat\\" and  \\"easy to find with your left\\" volume slider.Above that the g-keys and just at the back of your hand dolby swith and on / off switch.  Really great wireless base with extension/charge cable that gives the freedom of wireless even if you are out of battery which takes more than 8 hours with hardcore using.    Great isolation.You hear very little of outside and thats good because you can still hear very lightly if your phone or door ring although it may be hard to hear while in a gunfight.  Nonetheless great isolation !    Very good range even through walls.    Cons:  Maybe feel like little tight at first and takes time to adjust but after that you feel good.    Logitech should offer ready to download g-key profiles for games and apps like they did with their gamepads, keyboards and mouse.    Logitech also should rearrange their forums for people to gather and talk about their products more easyly.  There is no established community because of this.      Overall  Definitely Recommended for :  you to buy for yourself or as a gift.
B003XL6EKS|2.0|I remember watching The Killers on a late night tv appearance. Brandon Flowers was singing, \\"I got soul...\\", with his body moving in that weird, stiff, uptight, and awkward Ian Curtis fashion. He was trying so hard to clap his hands and keep singing. It was more like Don \\"No Soul\\" Simmons. On top of that comedic effort, he was also singing out of tune. Did anyone really expect this album to be any better?    Flowers sings here with his typical heavy handed, takes-himself-way-too-seriously, \\"I'm being introspective now, guys\\" style, complete with the false emotion and lackluster attempts at \\"bravado\\" that we're used to cringing at from The Killers. And yes, he continues the bad, out of tune, feeble singing.    Other than being horrible, the album actually sounds pretty good, as far as recording quality, balance, and production. But it does sound a bit empty, which we often see on records featuring frontpeople-gone-solo. It's supposed to make the singer's voice stand on it's own, so we can see the power of his or her raw talent and emotion in the most intimate way possible. But, this is often just an excuse for bad songwriting, or a possible indication that the singer doesn't have that much musical talent after all, since there just isn't that much music going on there.     The songs are simplistic, and I would call them underdeveloped, but I can't say for sure that all of these were even decent songs to begin with. This album reminds me of a print-out of a rough draft. As in, \\"Ok, I'm going to write a song. What things do I need to put in it?\\" But he just copied the example and didn't add any touches. You can still see the \\"Insert Name Goes Here\\", \\"Insert Title Here\\", form boxes in the tunes. If you like radio music, you still might find this utterly boring and devoid of emotion and traces of humanity. It might make you physically ill, like it did to me. Good luck.

1439181780|5.0|Now here's a book that some might find pretentious in it's subject but I assure you that just opening up (yourself and the book) to what the message says will give you a higher level understanding, awareness and state of being. Those of you who have read the first book will find a continued flow of the already universal message that Rhonda has put on paper for the greater good, I simply find it universally good. There are things about which we should have different opinions, that's what makes the world so interesting, but there are also universal laws that apply to everyone, regardless if you think they are correct or not. It's like gravity, or electricity; perhaps you might want to understand fully how it works or perhaps you don't care, no matter.....it works for all of us. Anywhere, anytime, anyhow. Get this book and pass it on!
B002ZG9788|2.0|Nearly 30 years after the original \\"Clash of the Titans\\" graced the silver screen, Hollywood has chosen to resurrect the gods of Greek mythology under the direction of action director Louis Letterier (\\"The Incredible Hulk\\").    \\"Clash of the Titans\\" follows a man named Perseus (Sam Worthington), who unbeknownst to him is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), as he travels in search of taking vengeance upon the dark god Hades (Ralph Fiennes). To complete his quest, Perseus will join forces with a group of warriors to face off against some of the fiercest creatures imaginable and prove that even a god can bleed.    With technology at a point where these legendary figures and monsters can look more realistic, awe-inspiring and/or terrifying than ever before, now seems like a fitting time to revisit this classic tale. Yet, with all of the visual spectacle on display and a director known for fast-paced, adrenaline pumping features, does this newest iteration live up to its obviously dated predecessor?    The answer...surprisingly, is no! For all of its visual panache those responsible for this film were far too preoccupied with wowing audiences with as much spectacle in under two hours as possible that the story got lost right from the start.    What little story there is, which by the way merely exists for the sole purpose of carrying the various characters and the audience from one fight to another, is written by the writing duo of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (the writers responsible for the utterly lackluster \\"Aeon Flux\\"). This paper-thin imitation of a screenplay is an insult to not only fans of the original film hoping for a modern day update with terrific storytelling and awesome visuals, but to the enduring myths that spawned these legendary characters in the first place.    How exactly is this film's story insulting? Well, let's start with the biggest part of the film, which is the human story. This aspect of the story is rushed along at an incredibly fast pace, which somewhat works to the film's advantage in that the audience doesn't really have time to see its faults. Yet, at the same time it's detrimental in that one never really gets a sense as to why we should even remotely care for the people on screen. There is next to nothing in terms of character development, both on Earth and on Olympus, and the various character motivations are so weak that I never once believed any of them would actually go to such great lengths to succeed in their mission.    When a movie deals with such otherworldly themes, it is vital that the human element be presented as strongly as possible to ground the movie in some semblance of a reality. Not to mention allow for the audience to connect with the various characters so we can actually become enthralled by their journey. This aspect is never given time to develop and as a result there is zero emotional investment, leaving the audience numb to the experience.    Another major issue facing this film's plot is that the gods themselves are ancillary characters that receive only marginal screen time. The original (if memory serves) featured numerous sequences focusing solely on the gods of Olympus overseeing us mere mortals on Earth. Due to the merely passing glimpses we receive of the gods, we're left with the main crux driving the godly portion of the story being relegated to the opening 90 seconds of the film.    This approach to exposition is fine when handling a remake of a film only a few years old where audiences don't need a lot of rehash (i.e. Louis Letterier's remake/reboot of 2003's \\"Hulk\\" with 2008's \\"The Incredible Hulk\\"); however, this is not the method to use for the redo of a nearly 30-year old property where a good old fashioned refresher course is warranted.    Fans of these classic tales want more depth, and the Greek myths demand more substance to coincide with all of the flash that modern day visual effects houses can provide. The stories surrounding these legendary figures shouldnot be mentioned only in passing, I mean the story elements at your disposal could have sustained a two to three hour Hollywood epic (which is what this film should have been all along).    Not to mention we receive nary a glimpse at any of the gods' powers in use, an aspect I thought would possibly run the risk of being over-used instead of little to none. Aside from the releasing of the infamous Kraken (as was so heavily touted in the myriad of trailers for this film) only Medusa and Hades are given time to display some of their abilities.    Come on Louis, you skimmed over the mythological history of these characters, the least you could have delivered to us is a smorgasbord of their powers and abilities on display throughout. Seriously, how great would it have been to see Zeus unleashed or Poseidon or (insert your choice here). What were you thinking not going crazy with some massive display of power from the inhabitants of Olympus? Something like that seems like it would be a visual effects wizard's dream come true. But I digress.    While on the topic of the film's visuals, the various effects houses in charge of bringing these elements to life produced a surprisingly mixed bag of results. For the most part, the visuals are quite impressive, some even borderline stunning, while others look too obvious or even cartoonish in nature. Personally, despite some weak spots, I enjoyed the updated visuals that are featured in this incarnation over those of Ray Harryhausen from the original, simply because most look so much more life-like and realistic than anything that stop-motion animation could ever even dream of achieving.    One particular segment that I found to be well done was the giant scorpion fights (another sequence that was heavily shown in the previews). This long fight scene was visually impressive and generally entertaining; although, maybe we could have shortened that sequence by a couple of minutes to make room for showcasing some of the other gods' powers.    It really is a shame that instead of capitalizing on the technology at their fingertips to create awesome visuals worthy of the Greek myths, we're left with gods who simply stood around and talked all day long. Not to mention, an overly long giant scorpion fight that became far too repetitive before it finally came to a close.    Now, I must turn my disappointment towards the cast of this forgettable remake. Headlining the cast, despite his limited acting range and number of roles under his belt, is the ever stoic Sam Worthington. As Perseus, Sam is basically asked to combine the strongest, athletic, and action-oriented parts of his previous notable roles from \\"Terminator: Salvation\\" and \\"Avatar\\" and channel them into this character. Even with his limited talent pool in terms of dramatic acting, I will say that Sam at least put forth an effort in his previous performances; however, in this film his acting is on action movie autopilot.    This time around the only facial expressions Sam displays are anger, a few moments of laughter, and poorly conveyed sadness; of course, I can't forget, the look that comprised the majority of his screen time, namely his go-to expression...the stern, blank stare. As for the other facets of his performance, his line readings were as bland and wooden as ever, although in his defense, it didn't appear that the script really called for much more effort. Beyond those two sub-par aspects of his performance, not surprisingly Sam delivered on the action-oriented side of the role. While he won't be nominated for any Academy Awards for his \\"dramatic\\" work on this film, Sam should be a guaranteed nominee for the MTV Movie Awards' \\"Best Action Star\\" award.    In the primary supporting roles are three extremely talented actors, Liam Neeson (\\"Taken\\"), Ralph Fiennes (\\"Harry Potter\\" films), and the man who portrayed one of the best James Bond villains in quite some time, Mads Mikkelson (\\"007: Casino Royale\\"). Personally, I'm extremely disappointed in Liam and Ralph for even taking part in this film. Because at this point in their careers they have enough clout in Hollywood (not to mention money) that they could have either demanded a better script (one with dare I say...character development) or just walked away in order to save face. As for Mads, well he probably doesn't have the clout or as much money, so his participation could be better understood.    Still, all of the above actors possess acting talent far superior to what they put on display in this film. Truth be told though, it was their involvement in this movie that gave the proceedings some credibility, albeit ever so slightly.    One last bit of gripes about the cast. The two prominent female roles in this film were either completely thankless (Gemma Arterton's role of Io) or nothing more than a plot device (Alexa Davalos as Andromeda). Both actresses have shown considerable acting chops in previous work, yet as with everyone else in this film, there's nothing worthy of note in their performances here.    The only thing I can figure for why these actors and actresses signed on to this movie was the chance to be a part of a burgeoning Hollywood franchise. Now, that statement does not apply to Sam Worthington. I believe that for him any chance to play a role that calls for little to no emotion is an opportunity that he's going to jump at with gusto. But, for the others, that's the only excuse I can come up with. At least the temptation of a franchise is something I can understand; if it turns out to be anything else, then they should all be ashamed.    Sadly, despite all of this film's potential to become an incredible epic blockbuster, all that those involved in the project managed to cultivate was just another silly summer popcorn movie. Granted, I have enjoyed many a silly summer popcorn movie, but this one wasn't even all that entertaining.    Despite my obvious disdain for this remake, the movie managed to make plenty of money. So, thepowers-that-be are moving full-steam ahead on a second installment. Hopefully, they'll correct some of the glaring mistakes from this opening chapter, and make a movie truly worthy of the mythological characters inhabiting this series' universe.    \\"Clash of the Titans\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.
0765326353|5.0|This book is great. This series has been hailed as the new Wheel of Time, although this first book felt more like The Shadow Rising with fewer characters than The Eye of the World. The world is intriguing and the book feels short (despite being over a thousand pages) because it's hard to stop reading. If you are any kind of fan of epic fantasy, the Stormlight Archive is not a series to miss.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I enjoyed watching the season 6 DVDs and I am on the side that liked the Finale but my only complaint was the amount of extra content. I wished there were more commentaries as this is the last season and would have like to hear more opinions from the cast and crew.  All in all still 5 stars.
0545310601|5.0|This book was UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!  Granted the story line was fiction but her verbal depiction of the life of a soldier in cantonment, training and battle was uncannily accurate for anyone without military experience and exposure to hostile action.  I could not believe the accuracy (having been there and done that).  The barracks life, the training, the interaction amongst the soldiers (i.e.: the main and other characters) and the description of the battles were so accurate.  She even worked in the old adage that goes, \\"no matter how careful the battle plan it will go awry in the first five minutes\\".<br />One just cannot believe that one is reading fiction.  Granted some of the scenarios might have weapons and opponents that are science fiction but the flavor and reality of battle shine through.<br />This book, indeed the whole series, is one of the best set of books I have ever read.  If you don't buy. or at least read the entire series, if you are even remotely interested in the realities of military life and combat as well as a great and believable plot, then, in the words of Mr. T, you are a FOOL!

B0009X766Y|5.0|I first watched this in the theatre when it was released in 1973.  It hasn't lost any of its appeal.  The performances by Redford, Newman, Shaw and Durning are brilliant, as are the supporting actors.  Great set design, wonderful ragtime music arranged by M. Hamlisch.  This edition of the DVD has brilliant colors, excellent sound and appealing packaging, making it a gem in my movie collection.

Can't stop listening to it..actually listening now :) Dont hesitate to buy if you like any of the singles or the EP ! They're also amazing live!!

B001GCUO5M|3.0|It wasn't terribly challenging to figure out where this film was going.  Don't be deterred, though.  It was nicely creepy and evenly dramatic.  DiCaprio and Ruffalo were a great team.  The story flowed well and drew the audience in.  Parts of it were a bit far-fetched, and tempering those may have contributed to a better, less obvious ending.  The story gets a bit convoluted, and as a result its enigmatic ending just comes out muddy.  If you like mysteries, it's an interesting story, just not a terribly mysterious one...
0439023513|5.0|To me, The Hunger Games series, has been more than just another young adult book series, and Mocking Jay was filled with just as much action as both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Mocking Jay is just as dark as the other books too. There is all out war, and Katniss must decide is she is going to be the Mocking Jay and rally the other districts. She is also torn between the love of her life-long friend Gail and her hunger games partner, Peeta. You will either love or hate the conclusion to this story, there is no in between, enjoy!
B001FB5634|3.0|The premise of this film was interesting, but it never really went anywhere.  The pace was incredibly slow.  It seemed to want to build some level of empathy with the characters, sympathy for their experiences.  In the end, it only dulled what could have been an original and compelling plot.  The overprotective stance of \\"Man\\" grew as stale as \\"Boy's\\" inability to mature and step up into his own power.  This film may be a curiosity for die hard Mortensen fans, but it wasn't anything special.
044654759X|5.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and have read all of his books.  I have felt mad, happy, and sad, with some of his books, but they are all amazing.  I think this is one of his best.  DO NOT peek at the ending of this one.  I have a friend that does this and to me it ruins the entire book....any book, but holds true especially for this one.  I will not go into the story, as some do on here, because again that can ruin it.  You will not be disappointed in Safe Haven.  Many conflicts and battles within the characters, and you will most likely relate to at least one of them.  Again the ending is awesome.  This is one you will remember, I know I will.  Sparks just keeps getting better and better.
B00275EGWY|3.0|Criticism around the facts of the story behind this film I can't speak to.  That aside, the film sold itself on stress, which I'm sure I can't imagine what wartime is really like, but I do know it takes more than stress to convey a compelling story.  While the technical aspects and direction of the film were impressive, the acting wasn't anything to write home about.  It's clear that this film got a lot of attention due to its timeliness and controversy.  It's not because it was that great.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Gotta love this young man and his music. He channels essentially everyone and distills them into what is now his own style.    Good picture, terrific audio. I even enjoyed the bus interview where he describes and plays the different blues genres.     Buy it, put it on, turn up the audio system.
B002ZG99N6|3.0|The premise of this film was good, but overall the story fell short.  Well-directed and well-acted, there was no lack of talent behind or in front of the camera.  However, I didn't feel like there was any chemistry between them all to show for it.  It was as if they were each in their own little movie, not really finding cohesion with each other.  Several holes in the plot left huge leaps, or lacks, in logic on MacRay's part, as well as in the overall assumption around the thieves' skills.  It's one thing to establish the premise that Charlestown creates the world's most accomplished thieves, but that they carry automatic weapons, leap rooftop to rooftop to escape an entire precinct of cops, etc, is a bit fantastic.  In places it can't decide to go for drama or action, all the while trying to be a thriller.  All-in-all the film was well shot and keeps your attention, just don't expect more than that.
0802473156|5.0|I believe Dr. Chapman captured the essence of what was totally wrong in my past relationship.  I have learned from mistakes from this book and though I am in no rush to get back in to my past relationship or with someone new, I feel empowered by this book to look a my relationships in a new way and willing to start out speaking the right love language now instead of trying to be reactive with the tools in the book after I have a problem.  I do feel that you have to make sure your spouse is willing to read the book as well to engage him or her in what you are trying to change in the relationship though Dr. Chapman does provide one relationship example where the husband never meets Dr. Chapman the wife has sessions with him alone and the husband never reads the book, yet they still find a way to love again through the wife's efforts.  I think that is very difficult but possible.  Good luck readers I hope this helps.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|Im afraid as much as the films graphics and sound were a work of brilliance.  Unfortunetly Sam Worthington's abilities as an actor are non existant.  How this guy keeps getting work is beyond me?  The only convincing act he does is of a man with no talent.  Why they thought a neanderthalic Australian accent would pass as a Greek demi-god is beyond conception.  so I say this film is Bollocks.      Sam Worthington's acting is as bad as my spelling, and thats saying something.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I really enjoy the Dexter series, sorry Rita died. Not sure what will happen next. She added alot to the show, grounded the Dexter character.
0439023513|4.0|The third book is more graphic / violent than the first two. There is more pain, more death. You will hate Katniss for at least half the book. I feel like there is a lot of insanity going on--every other person goes mad. Nonetheless, the story is still excellent. It definitely moves your emotions. The book addresses the questions, \\"What is worth fighting for? Is liberty indeed more valuable than life?\\" And while I believe it also answers, \\"yes,\\" nothing is rammed down your throat.<br /><br />The final ten pages are exquisitely written.<br /><br />It is a painful read, but excellent.

0439023513|4.0|My favorite book in this series is still the Hunger Games.  This last installment was decent, but didn't hold my attention like the first one.  But it could be that I've had a year to hype this book up and anything rarely lives up to that.
B000C13Y2S|4.0|Neat light! Gives great, bright beam, the tripod legs are sturdy, and the adjustment for the head is firm.     Only two issues I've had:     1: It's a bit big for a keychain, and it's easy to accidentally flick the light on after a couple weeks of pocket use.     2: When the tripod is deployed, the base of the keychain is juuust long enough that it's only ever sitting on two legs, so it isn't quite as stable as it could be.     I got this as a gift. I'm not certain I'd buy it for myself, but it's quite nice to have.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|If you are just now looking into watching the TV Series LOST for the first time, I might suggest you NOT purchase this. Unless, of course, you are a Bluray fanatic and you purchase television programs at random. This show is one of the few to be so successful when each episode built off of the previous episodes in the series. It was not a show that could simply be picked up at random spots and understood. Show like, THE BIG BANG THEORY, while good, can be generally watched at any point in the series and past events either don't matter, or are blatantly obvious so that the audience is never lost to the episodes storyline. With this down, I encourage new-comers to LOST to rent/netflix the first couple discs of season 1 and determine if you like the show. Things change drastically through season two and three in a very sci-fi way, but I found it to be incredibly enjoyable. Once you know you love LOST, this purchase will be worth your while.    LOST feels at home in the 1080p glory of bluray with the lush tropic island environments (filmed in Hawaii I believe) and the characters feeling that much closer to your heart. If you are a long time LOST fan you should do yourself a favor, and go bluray. It looks, sounds, and feels better than the DVD so don't skimp on the cash difference between the formats. I mean seriously, its LOST, that in itself should be enough for you to purchase it if you always loved the series. Some people freaked out about Season 6 not going the way THEY wanted it to go. Oh well to them I suppose, they just spent 6 seasons of their life just to be peeved off.    Quick Summary:  New to LOST? ----> Rent/Netflix and determine if you like it, then buy Bluray if you do.    Longtime LOST fan? ----> Don't skimp, go Bluray so you know you got the best quality product and experience on such an awesome show. Seriously, IT'S LOST!    Easily peeved off when endings don't go the way you had planned them out to go? ----> Stop after Season 5, or watch all of it anddon't whine online after Season 6.    Other Thoughts:   The extended series finale was a welcome addition. The goodies in the box were charming and really added to the nostalgic sense of the show I had loved so much... Shame they're so worthless in the end that I won't care if the dog gets ahold of them.. Then again, isn't that the feeling you get 99.8% of the time when you get goodies in some electronic purchase (game or movie/show)?    Five Stars from me, buy wisely friends.

What in the world can't people see in the high school drama team sets and the totally sick portrayals of people in the aftermath of a plane wreck. This has got to be one of the most stupid overrated series of all times.

B003UYV08E|3.0|Let's get this straight: If it hadn't been for THE DARK KNIGHT coming out a couple months later, IRON MAN would have been THE superhero movie of 2008.  It's still one of the best entries in the genre, with a complex plot, superior special effects, and the quick wit and sharp poignancy of Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />The sequel, while featuring all three, is a letdown; while I knew to lower my expectations, they still weren't met.  The problems here are two-fold: miscasting, and a script that doesn't dare to be dark enough.  For the miscasting: obviously, Downey is still in fine form, though he doesn't get to ad-lib as much here.  Mickey Rourke doesn't have a whole lot to do; he and Downey share one (and only one) non-combat scene together, which is indeed a highlight of the film, even with minimal dialogue--proof that, when you put two great actors together alone in a room, you'll get great things.  Don Cheadle simply does not have Terrence Howard's charisma; he's a fine actor, but the role of Rhodey calls for more than mere talent.  Scarlett Johansson is utterly wasted; she's an amazing actress, but she's here for eye candy and nothing but.  Gwyneth Paltrow is as charming here as she was in the first film; and Sam Rockwell, in an utterly two-dimensional villainous role, does the best with what he's got.  Sam Jackson does his Sam Jackson thing as Nick Fury; take it or leave it, unfortunately his character isn't that essential to the film.<br /><br />Now for the script, from otherwise-talented scribe (and actor) Justin Theroux.  It's not deep; it's not dark.  And yet it tries to be both.  Is Rourke's Ivan Vanko justified in his anger towards Tony Stark?  Was Stark's father maybe not the paragon of virtue that Tony always thought?  How is Stark coping with the fact that he's dying (not a spoiler, by the way; you find out early enough)?  These are deep, penetrating issues, which promised to elevate IRON MAN 2 to an almost DARK KNIGHT level.  Instead, when a problem arises, we have an answer within a few minutes, miraculously provided by a minor character.  The movie doesn't deal with issues--it avoids them like the plague.  The first IRON MAN had a dark underbelly; it was never overly prominent, but it was there, lending the film an edge usually missing from the genre.  IRON MAN 2 is more family-friendly; it's meant to be a pleasing popcorn flick and nothing more.  It should have been more, which is why the film comes off as so disappointing.  For a film with such talent behind it--director, writer, cast--IRON MAN 2 fizzles halfway through, never reaching its potential, never being what we all wanted it to be.  It's less than the sum of its parts; it's still entertaining (hence the 3 Stars), and it's worth a repeated viewing or two, but in a post-IRON MAN/DARK KNIGHT world, we need more from our superhero movies than guys in costumes finding other guys in costumes.  We need depth, and you won't find much here.  The most poignant thing here is Vanko's love for his bird; for avian enthusiasts, maybe that's enough.answer within a few minutes, miraculously provided by a minor character.

B001FB55L2|5.0|I absolutely loved this film. I saw it in theaters and got it on DVD when it came out. It's a very moving film and it does leave you very..emotional. It's a really strong film in the sense that all the acting was top notch and the ending was superb.  While I agree with the 1star reviewers that it was stupid *spoiler* when he beat his partner to death, because I don't think a real soldier would have done that. But that's no reason to slash it down to a 1star. It helped add to the emotion of the film and developed a plot for the ending.  Anyway great film. Gives me chills every time I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone that's mature enough to take it all in.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|So I realize that I am about a year later reviewing Mayer's fourth true LP (skipping other aside albums etc, starting with [[ASIN:B00005OAIE Room for Squares]]), but it was an album most might admit they slept on.  Why? Anyone who heard \\"Who Says,\\" the promotion single knew that Mayer was returning back to his adult contemporary side as opposed to continuing his bluesier side a la Continuum. I personally prefer Continuum over efforts such as [[ASIN:B0000ALSDR Heavier Things]]  (2003) and [[ASIN:B002QEXN2K Battle Studies]], but there are virtues to the \\"poppier\\" side of Mayer.  No matter the style, the platinum-certified 'Battle Studies' is a solid album, though it doesn't eclipse the double platinum juggernaut 'Continuum' by any means.<br /><br />\\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" is the first signal on 'Battle Studies' that this is NOT `Continuum 2.' The opening cut is reminiscent of 2003's 'Heavier Things' opener \\"Clarity\\" as opposed to \\"Waiting on the World To Change.\\"  Nonetheless, it is a solid cut exhibiting fine songwriting and nice vocals by Mayer.  Similarly, follow-up cut \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\" highlights Mayer's limited, but pleasant vocals very well.  As always, the guitar playing is phenomenal, with a nice solo around the 2:50 mark.  The ending may be the best part;  \\"All We Have To Do Is Say Goodbye\\" is a favorite cut of mine.<br /><br />\\"Half of My Heart,\\" features Taylor Swift (though only minimally) and restores a faster tempo after the balladry of \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye.\\" Again, \\"Half of my Heart,\\" like the previous numbers, benefits from good songwriting and a catchy, enjoyable hook (\\"half of my heart has a grip on the situation, half of my heart takes time...\\" First single \\"Who Says\\" was not a conventional choice for a Mayer single, and definitely threw off fans.  That said, the 276,000 copies of 'Battle Studies' sold the first week was only a small 24,000 off of the opening of 'Continuum.' The songwriting is clever and \\"Who Says\\" proves to be a welcome departure for Mayer.<br /><br />\\"Perfectly Lonely\\" may be more traditional Mayer, finding the singer adding more of a soulful, bluesy vibe - one of few moments that sound as if they could've appeared on 2006's Continuum.  Mayer's vocals are clear and present, and the mid-tempo nature of this cut is a  nice \\"look\\" for Mayer.  \\"Assassin\\" destroys a bit of the momentum, given its clunkiness.  Only at the 2:10 mark does the track begin to make some sense, and even afterwards it is only Mayer's prodigious guitar playing that saves it.  \\"Assassin\\" sounds like an experiment, but not as fully as developed as I would have liked;  he doesn't quite unite it perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Crossroads,\\" composed by the legendary Robert Johnson, finds Mayer putting his own sound spin on this cut.  \\"Crossroads\\" eliminates any bad blood leftover from \\"Assassin.\\" \\"War of My Life\\" isn't bad, but nothing new is tread that hasn't been expressed in similar cuts such as the stronger \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" or \\"Half of My Heart.\\" \\"Edge of Desire\\" proves better finding Mayer supported by a nice six feel which features stupendous drum production (big sounding drums with the tom timbre especially fine tuned by the engineer).  What makes \\"Edge of Desire\\" a better cut is that Mayer relies more on his bluesy side.<br />\\"Do You Know Me\\" is a nice low key cut and brief, though not particularly memorable in the scheme of the entire album.  \\"Friends, Lovers, or Nothing\\" closes the album solidly, with great vocals from Mayer and bluesy guitar work.<br /><br />Essentially, as I said when I bought it a year ago (and slept on it), this album is simply not as good as 'Continuum.'  With that said, it is enjoyable, though not revolutionary.  Above average by all means. 3.5 stars.arture for Mayer.     \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" may be more traditional Mayer, finding the singer adding more of a soulful, bluesy vibe - one of few moments that sound as if they could've appeared on 2006's Continuum.

The one thing I'm disappointed about, is they're all region-free except for season 4 (and possibly season 3, I haven't checked those disks yet). So be warned, if you don't have a player that plays all regions, you'll miss out on much of season 4's greatness. Pretty annoyed since this wasn't written about at all on the product description.

630314473X|5.0|The Director's Cut of \\"Streetcar\\" adds back little snippets (such as Brando's \\"Tiger, tiger, drop that bottle top\\") that were removed because of a strict Production Code.<br /><br />A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE ran for two years on Broadway (855 performances). The only member of the opening night's main cast of 10 to not appear in the film was Jessica Tandy. She was replaced by Vivien Leigh to add \\"star power\\" to a company of relative unknowns.<br /><br />It's said that John Garfield refused the role of Stanley as he didn't want to be outshone by the female lead. Marlon Brando proved that fear very wrong. He's just brilliant as the animalistic Kowalski. It's an overpowering and unforgettable performance. For Miss Leigh, playing Blanche was typecasting.

0143118420|5.0|I'm in the middle of this book right now and I couldn't wait to come online and tell you how wonderful and inspiring Elizabeth Gilbert is.  Her gritty down-to-earth prose is so enthralling I can't put it down.  I feel like I just found my new \\"best friend\\".  I bought her earlier works because I know she'll keep me enchanted.  There's no wonder why this book sits atop the nonfiction best seller lists.  I haven't seen the movie as I want to finish the book first.  I don't think a movie can touch Elizabeth's Midas touch with words.  I laugh out loud, read passages to my husband, who also laughs out loud.  Thank you Elizabeth for changing my life and giving me pleasurable hours of happy reading.
B00383YC2S|3.0|Une Enfant Du Siecle is the latest CD from Alizee and marks a change from all of her previous recordings.  I'd describe the musical style as a return to late 20th century European synth-pop.  Don't get me wrong, Alizee's voice is as beautiful as ever, but the music sounds dated.  You will be hard pressed to hear a guitar, piano or even real drum sounds on this recording. I've listened to this album for a couple weeks and it pales in comparison to all of her previous recordings.  I eventually removed it from my CD player and replaced it with her previous recordings.  Just look at Alizee's picture on the cover of the cd.  The way she's looking at you and the way she is covering her ears should be warning enough. If you love any of Alizee's previous recordings, think long and hard before you spend money on this one.
0399536108|5.0|My life verse is Romans 12:2 ... Do not conform to the pattern of the world, but instead be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Chris Guillebeau's book is supportive of transformation. Based on Chris' stories about himself and his family throughout the book, he walks the talk.     As director of a Small Business Development Center, I encourage people to create a job instead of looking for one. While not everyone is equipped or interested in being an entrepreneur, many are but never gave it much thought. Chris says \\"Creating a job is less risky than trusting someone else to give you a job.\\"     I also agree with Chris' statement that most small businesses can be started with less than $1,000. Most people ask for a grant or a loan. Because I am personnally debt free, I tend to encourage people to find methods other than debt to start a business. Making a sale to your first customer is great way to finance a business start-up.     I enjoyed and benefited from this book and highly recommend it.

B001P9EQH8|3.0|I really didn't have high hopes for this little amp, but for the past year or three I've read enough glowing comments about this little guy that cemented the notion that I had to sample one.<br /><br />The reality is that the FiiO E5 fits in with only a select grouping of headphones, ones that have relatively high impedance ratings. I didn't know that going in, but after dogged listening sessions with all sorts of cans from my own stash--from basic OE units for the Zune HD and iPod Touch to my usual portable-use Sennheiser IE-8 and Koss PortaPros to my in-home use Senn HD-650 and HD-800 and many units in-between, it was clear to me that the E5 doesn't have enough power within it diminutive chassis to do the usual low impedance portable head and earphones any tangible favors. Using either a Touch or Zune HD as the source, the E5 struggled with pretty much every set of cans that had a rating of under 100 ohms or thereabouts. It wasn't until I hooked up my HD-650 (300 ohms) with its own set of aftermarket cables (Stefan Audio Art Equinox)--one of the few high impedance units I have left in this world of low impedance portability--that there was any measure of uptick in SQ. Here at least the E5 was making a positive difference, where as with the Shure SE530, Senn PX-100 and others it just sounded wretchedly overmatched and severely underpowered.<br /><br />With the HD-650 (and later the HD-800, what I consider the best set of cans I currently own), the E5 perceptively improved low-end depth and punch, while also smoothing out midrange sound and adding enough power to heighten sonic detail into the upper frequencies (well, at least as high as my near five decade-old ears will go these days). Vocals sound more lush and full, horns have a deeper, more complete timbre than was ever capable when relying solely on the base amplification circuitry housed within the Touch or Zune HD. It's not to say that the E5 is sonically perfect, only that it's BETTER. The E5 still doesn't have enough juice to really make either of the big Sennheisers truly sing, but for a shade north of twenty bucks it does account for itself quite well within the confines of this company of equipment.<br /><br />But that's were I really have a problem with the whole purpose of the E5. As positive an effect that it had with my big Sennheiser cans, those are EXACTLY the sort of headphones that I WOULDN'T USE on the go. The clip-on nature of this FiiO amp makes it abundantly clear that it's intended for portable use, yet most headphone sets designed specifically for that use don't have the sort of high impedance rating that allows them to benefit from the E5. This paradox makes owning an E5 rather pointless for most DAP and PMP owners, unless of course they happen to be running around with a fairly inefficient headphone set. It's not to say that those sorts of portable cans don't exist, but headphone makers as a whole know full well that they're catering to all the iPods, Walkmans, Zens, Zunes and Sansas (and all the rest) of the world; they're going to make their products WORK within that environment and function from the word go, and that makes the usefulness of this little FiiO E5 more than a bit superfluous.<br /><br />So despite my discovery that the E5 really does make certain headphones sound better, it's not an add-on amp that I can recommend to most users of portable MP3 devices. Even amongst my big, inefficient cans I have significant better sounding headphone amps to choose from that have superior power and last longer on a charge, and several that--relatively speaking--didn't cost all that much more than the FiiO E5. And I suspect that most people with similar gear will be thinking--and doing--the same.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars.
0811870413|5.0|The first half of the book describes his unique technique for excellent breads. It's not the bread bible with every possible bread listed. It's better. It's an in-depth account of how to make this great bread. If you want a quick zucchini bread, this isn't it. If you want a great bread, and really learn about bread-making, you lucked out.   The second half of the book includes recipes using bread, making the book practical for anyone, breadmaker or not. Tartine Bakery has an incredible aesthetic and this book shows it off well.   I'm pretty excited about this book and would compare it to Judy Rodger's seminal Zuni Cafe cookbook. It's the difference between EZ fun recipes and actually learning cooking techniques from real pros.

You all should be proud of this effort.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I picked this up at Gamestop a few days ago.  This is a controller you should use if you enjoy using analogue sticks similar to the xbox 360 or you have large hands and frequently bump your thumbs on the Dualshock3.  Here is what I've liked/disliked about the controller since picking it up.    Like:  -Wireless  -6-axis Support, along with rumble function  -Bulkier controller  -Hand Grips work well for sweaty palms and those with \\"hand salsa\\" problems  -Touch-Sensitive Triggers  -Battery life is same as standard PS3 controller  -Excellent D-Pad    Dislike:  -Led Lights are worthless, cannot tell the player number whatsoever  -Analogue sticks have a sticky adhesive on them, could eventually transfer to the buttons and make them stick too      Initially I got the dreaded \\"dead zone\\" in the analogue sticks similar to what other reviewers got.  However once I followed directions and synced the controller to the receiver, the dead zone was gone. I played MW2, Bad Company 2, and Borderlands without a hitch in multi-player.  My scores were generally the same as before, however in Borderlands, I noticed the controller required a bit more finesse when turning left.  I'm not sure if this is a software or hardware issue, as Bad Company and MW2 didn't have this problem.    I was really skeptical about purchasing this controller due to all the reviews about the dead zone, however I think it just boils down to not syncing the controller correctly, and kids expecting 3rd party products to magically turn them into better competitive gamers.  While this doesn't surpass the quality of the original dual shock, it definitely works well enough for a 360 clone.
B003P5CBNG|2.0|The audio and video was clear on this Glee episode, but the video kept stopping.  The audio would continue when the video froze on a screen so it was like watching still photos with the sound from the show playing.  One time it froze on one screen  and wouldn't move on so we had to start it over.   I gave it 2 stars because we were at least able to hear the entire show so we didn't miss any plot points in the series since they didn't replay the \\"Funk\\" episode during the summer reruns.

0553805371|2.0|I'd rather hear Mr Hawking words alone. I'm not liking the idea that he's not written his last two books on his own. I have to wonder how many of these were his words, his ideas. Lately I've become more and more disillusioned with astronomers, and physicists. We have solved a great deal of the easier problems and are left with the most difficult. And for those we get theories. Theories are not facts They are educated guesses. For all these reasons we need to take what is contained in this book as just adding to the theoretical base that already exists. This book doesn't answer any questions just proposes more theories; many of which will later be disproved.<br />I hope Mr Hawking will turn out another book on his own in the near future. I want to hear what's on his mind, unfiltered and not added to.

B002ZG9788|4.0|Clash of the Titans turned out to be a pretty fun action flick.  I have always been a fan of the original, and thought that even though there were some major changes made in the remake, the general story line was the same.  It's also true that there was no real character development and the dialogue was not the most engaging, but I don't think you would necessarily be looking for that out of this movie to begin with.  I expected great action scenes and special effects, and that's what I got.  The new creatures (especially the Kraken) looked great, and all fight scenes turned out to be exciting.  The movie is fun, fast-paced, and I would definitely recommend if you want to to watch a thrilling action-adventure flick.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Here's a reunion of sorts that I don't think anyone really thought would come about.    After years of being broken up, the band got back together with original singer Udo Dirkschneider for a tour but when it came about that the other members wanted to do a new album, Udo had no interest.    Enter new singer (their third, the other was David Reece) Mark Tornillo and now they have really set themselves a path back to the hearts of metal fans.    Packaging: The high glossy cd case and booklet indicate a real effort to give a high class backing to the new album. The standard song lyrics and photos of the band members are included. I did like the thematic approach of the identifying dog tags for the members though. Also included are two stories. One how the band came to be as it is now constituted and the other one is about the songwriting for the band in the past and now. I was really pleased with how the packaging turned out.    The Music:    If you were worried that Accept was going to hire some high powered smooth as silk voice, let me allay your fears. While Mark Tornillo isn't nearly as gravelly voiced as Udo, he holds his own quite nicely in the whiskey and razorblades throaty vocals.    To be honest I had never heard of him before but this guy just kicked my butt.    Producer Andy Sneap crafted the band's sound to maximum effect. One of the stories in the CD booklet gives an insight how he helped the band to focus on writing all killer no filler songs.    The anthemic nature of Accept's past is alive and well on Blood of the Nations. The high gear is hit from the opening track \\"Beat The Bastards\\". The band's first \\"single\\" \\"Teutonic Terror\\" is a bit slower in tempo as track number 2 but no less heavy. (It also turned out a pretty decent performance video).    \\"The Abyss\\" was a pretty solid rocker but I did think when the song dropped into a slower delivery, it kind of stalled the song. The title track was utterly fantastic. The big backing vocal on the chorus was a plus.    \\"Shades of Death\\" was decent and \\"Locked and Loaded\\" was a total speeding down the highway kind of rocker.    \\"Time Machine\\" has a sly sneaky feel to it, the main lyrical verses start off with a free and easy delivery and then as it moves towards the bridge and chorus it gets heavier and a bit of that vicious metal growl works its way in.     I have to say that guitarists Wolf Hoffman and Herman Frank seems to be having a rollicking good time on this disc. The guitar work is solid (no surprise) and spectacular (again no surprise). Hoffman's got the flash of a guitar hero but the chops of the seasoned veteran who knows how to craft the power riffs necessary to capture the listener's ear.    \\"Kill The Pain\\" was the band's \\"ballad\\" track and while I am not opposed to ballads or slower softer type of songs, I do have a higher standard for them. I want them to be GREAT not just good. Unfortunately for me, I just did not get into or connect with this track at all.    The band kicked back into speedy rock and roll with \\"Rolling Thunder\\" and Tornillo blasted through the lyrics while the band kept the beat and pace musically. You can say the same for the succeeding track \\"Pandemic\\".    \\"New World Comin\\" was a solid track, I liked the guitar work mostly on this one. It was more of a mid tempo track but with that muscular backing sound that keeps the song from falling into schlock.     \\"No Shelter\\" was another uptempo rocker I found to be good.    The bonus track \\"Bucketful of Hate\\" stars off with an intro that reminds one of a sing-along nursery rhyme and then the power chords kick in to blow that image from your mind. And what a killer song they chose to end the CD on. It just tears at your throat and doesn't let you go until the final notes.    When a band gets back together it is always a bit worrisome. Will they be able to put out something worthy to their glory days or will it be an exercise in futility that makes you question why you ever liked the band inthe first place.     I'm happy to say that Accept has hit it out of the park. They got a superb replacement for Udo Dirkschneider and came up with an album that taken as a whole stands up fine alongside Metal Heart and Balls to the Wall.    For me the only misstep is the ballad \\"Kill The Pain\\". Otherwise, call this a 9 1/2 out of 10, 4 1/2 stars out of 5, or Grade: A    This is what we as music lovers should expect from musical heroes of our past coming back for another run at the brass ring!    Favorite tracks: Beat the Bastards, Blood of the Nations, Time Machine, Pandemic, Bucketful of Hate.
B001HN6940|2.0|While searching for their next big hit  The Disney honchos said,  \\"Alice\\" is a property  To raise up from the dead.  Tim Burton can revive it  Through his visionary head.    The forces all were marshaled.  A screenplay was commissioned  From Woolverton, who'd proved her worth.  She had the Disney frisson;  With Belle and Simba in her past,  Now Alice was her mission.    A two hundred million budget  For every C.G.I. step.  Led by Burton's whimsical genius,   At FX he is adept.  And for a box office guarantee...  A Mad Hatter they call Depp.    A blonde young lass in the title role,  An unknown known as Mia.  Surround her with a cast of greats  And the folks will come to see her.  But it's really Depp that draws the crowds  From Spain to South Korea.    To play the part of the mean Red Queen  The director cast his wife.  Though they never really married,  Together they've built a life.  With her outsized head and bitchy flair  Helena's mouth cuts like a knife.    In London town they slaved away  With mo-cap, opticals and green screen  From Dodgson's book, Burton made  A world that's never been seen.  The problem is his story's like  An undernourished cuisine.    For, truth to tell, I have to say  And say it without malice,  I didn't give a fig about  The plight of brave, dear Alice.  Even fighting off the Jabberwock  Outside the Red Queen's palace.    But who am I, a lowly scribe  To argue with the millions  Who shelled out dollars, euros, yen  To gross over a billion?  And don't forget, the poor real,  The currency Brazilian.    Did they all love this \\"Alice\\" film,  Or was it the one they had to go see?  Paying out the extra bucks  For lame post-production 3D.  But in Hollywood, a hit's a hit  With sequels guaranteed.    With shortened window, it now arrives  On DVD and Blu-ray,  Where it looks and sounds just wonderful  On my big screen, but I must say  I really felt most unengaged  Despite the hi-tech display.    So, if you long for Burton, Depp  And worlds that are fantastic  My words may seem like curdled milk,  My attitude sarcastic.  But this \\"Alice\\" iteration makes me  Unenthusiastic.

0439023513|3.0|I was looking forward to reading the last book of the Hunger Games Trilogy because the other two books were so good. While the story is interesting, I was not as impressed with it as I was with The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. The ending left me a little flat and confused. With that being said, it is a must read after having read books one and two, to follow the story full circle of the girl named Katniss.
1439181780|5.0|This book not only contained tools and \\"games\\" to play to further instill the concept, but also included quotes from great people of the past and personal stories to back it.  I can honestly say I enjoyed it every bit as much as The Secret.  Both books were a friendly reminder that we are in charge of our lives as well as our destiny.
1416583432|1.0|I bought this book with the hope that it would contain useful and important insights reflecting the title and subtitle. It does not and I am disappointed at the author's deception.    The author's credibility for offering valuable insights about dog behavior and psychology are tarnished by a very noticeable lack of data to support ANY of her claims. She repeatedly sites her dog Pumpernickel and his behaviors. Consequently, way too many pages contain watered-down anecdotes instead of meaty study and research findings. But nowhere is there any quantitative support for a single observation about dogs. Pathetic! Nowhere does she give credit for the fact that dogs of different breads act and react in different ways. Dogs are lumped together as just \\"dogs.\\" This is an irresponsible omission and again, torpedoes her credibility.     Much of the content is couched in absolutes or hedging adjectives. Plus, a number of things she says make no sense at all. Horowitz states that dogs do not like to watch television because they cannot smell what they see. Both my Westies negate that observation any night of the week, and I know of a half dozen or more dogs who have the interest and patience to sit through movies. She says that dogs really don't care what surface they are walking on; whether it be stone, or grass or concrete. That makes no sense given the sensitivity of the paw pads and the fact that some breeds react differently than others, not to mention individual differences between dogs. She makes the claim that dogs lick the face of their owner in hopes tit will prompt you to regurgitate.\\" And of course, there is NO support for making such outlandish and non-instructional statements.    Her depth of observation is best captured in this direct quote: \\"Dogs approach the friendly and avoid the unfriendly.\\" Is that the kind of deep insights you were waiting for in a book on dog behavior? Reading that kind of drivel does not justify a book that retails for $27. She not only fails to make specific, meaningful observations about dogs, but drags in comments about chimps, paramecium, wolves, chickadees, bumblebees, and pigeons. See where this book is headed? The donation box.    A quote from page 24 captures perfectly the flawed aptitude of the author, both as author and professional in her field: \\"In an attempt to get inside the dog, we gather small facts about their sensory capabilities, and build large inferences from them.\\" On page 244 she shares the revelation, \\"Few dogs are human height.\\" And on page 248 there is this break-through comment of similar shallow depth: \\"The dog defines the world by the ways he can act on the world.\\"    Scribner must really be desperate for publishing titles these days.
B003DEMV1Q|4.0|As one who is not a major follower of Mr. Raymond, I was pleasantly surprised as to how much I enjoy this album.  Having heard some of the hits on the radio, including the monster smash \\"Papers,\\" I found the rest of the album to be equally as listenable.<br /><br />The Atlanta native has crafted an album in which he reveals a maturity that is appealing to fans of \\"old school\\" while maintaining enough of the contemporary sound to keep his younger fan base.<br /><br />Those who have complained about the album's \\"edits\\" will sway those \\"number one fans\\" who have not yet purchased the album. For the \\"uninitiated\\" and middling fans, like myself, however, I recommend the album from a young man who has many years of success ahead of him if he continues to release albums, representing a cross-section of musical interests.

I was really amazed at how well Santana didn't just cover all these tracks; he reinvented them as his.  Admittedly, the first two songs I heard (Sunshine of your Love & Little Wing) are in the top of what this album has to offer.  As a huge Clapton fan, I wasn't expecting Santana to do it 'better' but he succeeds with this album by doing them in his unique style.  With one possible exception (track #4), I loved this album.

B00319ECC4|5.0|Where do I start, A buddy of mine tells me you hear the new FF yet and due to what I felt to be nothing but lackluster releases after Dino left no offense Raymond and Christian I gave him a HUH. Oh boy was that retort stuffed in my pants and kicked squarely back where it came from, He put that in and well to cut the story short two people left that garage winded from moshing to what is nothing short of a masterpeice. I mean this album is exactly what FF is about loud, angry, relentless, and unforgiving metal, I'm sorry but no one can touch Dino when he brings his A game, And Burton absolutly reignites the lyrical ferousity and content to the likes we haven't heard in a while not to mention the vocals are still some of the best in the genre. I knew of Byron and Gene from SYL but man they stepped it up for this gig, Byron's always on point but those last few albums Raymond sounded like he wasn't even trying know don't get me wrong from Demanufacture to Digimortal saw some of his best work. Work that outside of Gene I feel no one else could replicate or even manage to be in the same vein skill wise, But oh man does Gene deliver and the some.         On to the album, Mechanize starts out the way an album with this much revitalized talent should striaght n' to the point Mechanize, and Industrial Discipline get the ball off to a brutal and punishing start. Now in comes Fear Campaign a song that to me is a high point amongst an awesome album but lyrically this track stands taller, On to Powershifter which keeps this monster devistating to Christploitation now this is where the album reaches an apex to me. Because I am an athiest and this song conveys my ideas, views, and thoughts about the concept of a god this song aswell as pisschrist are my hymns, Moving On Oxidizer, Controlled Demolition, and Designing The Enemy never let up on this auditory onslaught. We then come to a classic FF end a groovy little instrumental Metallic Division takes us to Final Exit a song the harkens to a close the way all the other greats do.         What ever you do old school FF fans do not pass this up it will rekindle that love that died after digimortal

0393072231|5.0|So what caused the financial meltdown of our lifetime?    There was that incompetence and indifference, conflict of interest and corruption of the ratings agencies (the very ones designed to protect investors, and was the system's first safeguard).  Then there are the investment houses that used their awesome influence, capital, and power to rig the market in their favor, creating Ponzi schemes that were so complicated and abstruse that they eventually fell victim to their own lies and schemes.  Then there were the schemers and manipulators who sought to inflate the market in order to capture commissions.  And finally there was the lack of government oversight (John Cassidy explains this point very well in his \\"How Markets Fail\\").      These are reasons and causes that Michael Lewis discusses in his book, but he blames ultimately how the interests of the individuals who ran the investment houses diverged from the shareholders they were supposed to represent.  In this way, the book is a sequel to \\"Liar's Poker,\\" the book that made Lewis' writing career.  Indeed, at the end of the book, Lewis comes full circle and has a reckoning of sorts with John Gutfreund, Lewis' former boss at Salomon Brothers and the man partly responsible for ushering in the era of American crony capitalism.  (But because they're both rich and famous, the reckoning is a polite lunch at an expensive Manhattan restaurant.)      But the main story is about the social misfits/financial entrepreneurs who predicted the sub-prime crash.  So there are similarities to \\"Moneyball,\\" Lewis' brilliant book about the general manager of the Oakland A's who correctly believed that teams grossly \\"mispriced\\" players.  \\"Moneyball\\" had a happy ending, and unfortunately \\"The Big Short\\" does not.    Michael Lewis focuses on a money manager with Asperger's, an unhappy lawyer turned recalcitrant stock analyst turned unforgiving cynic, and two guys who operated their own fund out of a garage.  Like \\"The Fountainhead's\\"Howard Roark, these individualists fought against everything and everyone as they clung mightily to their belief that Wall Street was full of morons and crooks, and that the sub-prime market would collapse.  As things were falling apart, their lives became more stressed, and when everything did fall apart, they fell apart as well:  one of them, Mike Burry, would force his investors to stay with his gamble, and when the gamble paid off handsomely, not only did his investors not thank him, but they immediately withdrew from his fund.  Yes, they made a lot of money, but it seemed that everyone made a lot of money (the winners pocketed the winnings from their bet and the losers got bailed out by the government), and everyone became unhappy because of it (the cynics because they were proven right and the believers because they were proven wrong).    I believe there are two messages that can be derived from Lewis' excellent and entertaining book.  One, it's better to go with the flow than to be right:  those who followed the system also got saved by the system.  In the end, the government bailed out the investment houses because they had made leveraged bets well in excess of their capital that they threatened to bring down the entire economy.  So you can in fact cheat, lie, and steal (which is in fact what Wall Street did) as long as you do it in a way that the consequences of punishing you are too high and no one can figure out how exactly you cheated, lied, and stole (even a writer as gifted as Lewis could not explain the financial instruments behind the sub-prime crisis).  And even though the cynics and skeptics were proven right, everyone hated them for it.    Two, it's not the choice of the cynics and skeptics to be so -- it's just in their nature.  Normally cynics and skeptics just sit in their parents' basement and blog about how terrible the world is (I am one example), but for whatever reason a few cynics and skeptics found themselves on Wall Street, where giventhe right opportunity they can make a lot of money.    The ultimate tragedy is that even despite the financial meltdown nothing's changed.  Yes, some companies have gone bankrupt, but the cast of characters have stayed the same -- with the same motivation and the same freedom to do wrong.  You would think after \\"Liar's Poker,\\" \\"Den of Thieves,\\" and now \\"The Big Short\\" people would awake to how out of control our financial system has become.      But it's too easy and too common to just be amenable and agreeable.  Isn't it so nice that we all just get along?

1453837736|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B000002P2W|5.0|In my humble opinion this is the best album of the best rock-n-roll band of all time.  When I was 17 my friend's older brother had this album back-to-back with Odds & Sods on a cassette tape.  Discovering all the concentrated greatness on that cassette was one of my fondest teen-age experiences.  In these 2 albums The Who really captured all the stupidity, wonder, frustration, angst, and joy of being a teen boy.      Both of these albums were released in the musical hinterland of the mid-70s, well after the hype of the late 60s rock boom when anyone could have sold a song.  Furthermore, neither of these albums was associated with the pretense of Pete's rock operas.  My point is that The Who By Numbers and Odds & Sods are the simplest, purest, most unaffected offerings of the band.  Between both they generated only 1 hit single and yet every song is a masterpiece.  Finally, Nicky Hopkins' unbelievable piano work is crucial to the sound, and the icing on the cake is Glyn Johns' production.  Exquisite.  \\"GIMME THE KEY!!!\\"
0345505387|4.0|I can't believe the number of people who are whining about having gotten a \\"comic book.\\"  How long does it take to look up the phrase \\"graphic novel,\\" for pity's sake?  My experience with graphic novels is somewhat limited, I must admit, but I was a diehard comic book reader for over 20 years, and I know the difference between the two.  This is not a comic book.<br /><br />The Exile stands on its own quite nicely, but like other reviewers I think the story makes a lot more sense if one has read Outlander first. The limitations of the graphic-novel format don't allow for a lot of backstory and subtleties (although there are quite a few important clues in the artwork that are very easy to miss if one's not paying attention--I overlooked a couple of really significant things the first time through).<br /><br />Like others, I take issue with some of the choices artist Hoang Nguyen made (especially the unneccessarily confusing similarity among the male characters) but I'd be the first to sing his praises as an artist.  The illustrations are gorgeously done and with an incredible attention to detail. The super-realistic portraits of Jamie and Claire in the beginning (to satisfy the readers' curiosity) morph into simpler likenesses far more suitable for portraying the action and emotion of the story, which is something that often happens in graphic novels.  Once you've seen the details your mind can concentrate on the story.  And The Exile tells a good story, one that even rabid fans of Outlander have never seen before.  It's well worth reading more than once.

B003PGNBO8|3.0|I've noticed a growing trend in network television over the last few years and it bodes ill for both their revenues and the satisfaction of the viewing audience. \\"Flash Forward\\" is just another example of this trend but it isn't the first example of it.    Does anyone remember that very breifly run series \\"Vanished\\" about the Senator's wife who gets kidnapped? It shares a problematic element with \\"Flash Forward\\" or the new series \\"The Event\\". And until the networks realize this element is a series killer, they will continue to pump out more and more of these type shows, only to watch them quickly wither and die.    Most new dramatic tv series contain a few common elements, based on the success of certain existing shows that have grown, flourished and even become classics. Think of \\"Lost\\", \\"Alias\\", \\"Supernatural\\", \\"Fringe\\" among others. One element they all share is the \\"season-long story arc\\". While individual episodes might have a more or less complete story, they all feed into a single over-arching story arc that lasts for an entire season. Some mystery or danger is introduced in the first episode of the season and that element is developed slowly, episode by episode, right to the very end of the season where it is finally paid off. It may link to yet another mystery which can be left as a cliffhanger, preparing the audience for the next season but the primary questions about that particular tale are essentially answered.     Shows that follow this structure run a grave risk, one that caused \\"Flash Forward\\" to suffer an unexpected demise.     I believe the key to whether or not such shows survive is firmly rooted in whether or not that \\"overall mystery\\" is narrow or broad. If it is broad, as in the case of \\"Lost\\", \\"Supernatural\\" and others, it can pretty much go on forever. However if it is too narrow, such as \\"Flash Forward\\", it is essentially doomed.    The thing that made \\"Lost\\", \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Fringe\\" successful is that rather than a single narrow mysterythey present an overall sense of the mystery, one that must first be clarified before it can be \\"solved\\". For example, with \\"Lost\\" the overall mystery was 'what is the island and what are those people doing there'. This is broad enough that new episodes can go off in a number of directions, provide hints at an answer that are really only hints about that particular season's specific mystery.    \\"Flash Forward\\", unfortunately, was based on a novel with a single clear throughline pointing toward a single solution. Certainly the tv series contained other elements, primarily the little mysteries that were all bits and pieces of that main question 'what was the flash foward, who caused it and why', but aside from those the only other focus was the relationships of the characters, and that sort of focus doesn't fit very well with a mystery show where the focus is the mystery itself. Do we really care if the tormented ex-alcoholic FBI agent is going to wind up having his doctor wife in another mans' bed? Not particularly. Do we care if the Asian FBI agent's fiance foresaw his wedding or his funeral? Naaaa. What we watch the show for, what we watch all mysteries for is 'what is the answer to the mystery'. And therein lies the problem.    With so much choice for viewers at the touch of a fingertip we have grown a little picky, more focused on instant gratification than in the depth of any particular story. We want it now, not when the network feels like getting around to giving it to us. And when all you've got to offer is a single big mystery that shows no hint of being \\"solved\\" any time soon, viewers get bored and annoyed and tune out. The brand new series \\"The Event\\" seems to be following that same formula, and I predict its quick demise because of that.    Because when all you've really got to offer is one big mystery, and everything you show is geared toward that mystery, then you are stuck. If the show is a success (i.e., making you lots of money) you want to keep itgoing as long as possible. But if all it has is that one big mystery, then you can't move straight toward it because the moment you provide that answer the show is over. Done. Finished. So instead you treat it like a sailboat. Instead of heading straight toward it, like you would have to do if it was a theatrical film, you tend to \\"tack\\", slowly moving toward the answer but at an angle, going to other places, other ideas. Then you tack back and move a bit further toward that answer but not directly, taking another path so you can visit another smaller mystery first. And you keep doing this, season by season, gaining a tiny bit of ground toward that big mystery but never enough so that you find yourself commited to moving straight toward it. And your audience sits there thinking \\"are we THERE yet??\\" and getting annoyed and bored.    Unfortunately for \\"Flash Forward\\" it had little else to offer other than that one big mystery and audiences picked up on this very quickly and tuned out. Which is a shame because the novel on which it was based was actually quite interesting and I'm sure they could have squeezed a second season out of it in order to tell the entire story if they'd wanted to. But they'd have been wasting money because by that time the audience was long gone, moved on to other things that would supply their need for immediate gratification. (Watch for the same thing to happen with \\"The Event\\", if the mystery turns out to be too narrowly focused.)    As for \\"Flash Forward\\" itself, it wasn't bad. Not outstanding, much of it following a tried and true tv fomula (the same momentary crises we've seen on tv a thousand times before) but it was well produced, very professionally done. But like those other \\"one mystery\\" shows, it only had a single thing to offer, and took far too long in giving the audience what it craved, the \\"answer\\". Too much time with the barker doing his \\"hurry, hurry, hurry, see it on the inside!\\" before they started letting the suckers into the tent. Most of them got tired of waiting and went off to get some cotton candy instead.    Right now I'm concerned that one of my favorite new shows \\"Fringe\\", going into its third season, has decided to narrow down its focus to that \\"one big mystery\\" and will go the same way. Which would be a shame. X-Files managed to keep us on the hook for nine seasons, because it told us there was a mystery but then teasingly danced away from even defining what that mystery was. It kept us on the edge of our seats for a long time. \\"Flash Forward\\" totally lost us because they wouldn't \\"get on with it\\". And alas, they couldn't do that because that would have been the end for it. Instead it just ended because we got bored and wandered away. And I doubt it will be much missed. There's too much out there to capture our attention.    Until tv networks learn the lessons of \\"Lost\\" and \\"X-Files\\" we'll see a lot more of these type shows, propelled along by one big mystery they don't dare pay out if they want to keep the show alive. And because of that, those shows will quickly strangle on their own inability to progress toward the big payoff.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|I'm usually fairly easy going when it comes to popcorn flicks that serve no real purpose except to exist as breezy, silly fun. I love [[ASIN:B00000JQB5 The Mummy]] and [[ASIN:B000ARXF96 The Mask of Zorro]], [[ASIN:B001BKZD7S Pirates of the Caribbean]] and [[ASIN:B001OQCV6A Sherlock Holmes]], particularly since you can tell the writers, cast and crew have embraced the idea of making a film that has sheer entertainment as its fundamental goal. These types of movies have been around for a long time, not excepting the original [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans]] film. Sometimes you're just in the mood to sit back, turn off your brain, and enjoy the action that unfolds in front of you.<br /><br />But then there are movies that require an extra amount of brain-power just to understand the convoluted events of the plot, and which leave you feeling frustrated and drained at how little sense it makes. Thus we have the remake of \\"Clash of the Titans\\", which is really an excuse for one hundred and six minutes of CGI monsters, with a vague plot, non-existent characterization, and semi-passable fight scenes on the side. Of course, this all may still float your boat, but if you prefer to have some *semblance* of coherence in your popcorn flicks then either stick with the campy fun of the original, or skip it altogether.<br /><br />As an infant Perseus is found by a fisherman floating in a sea-chest alongside his dead mother, and grows up without any knowledge of his origins: that he's actually the son of the god Zeus. Now an adult, Perseus is witness to the death of his foster father, mother and little sister when a group of soldiers from Argos destroy a statue of Zeus and pay the hefty consequences of hubris. For reasons best known to themselves, human beings have decided that ticking off deities is a really good idea, and the Olympian gods respond with releasing an onslaught of monsters in order to increase the prayers that they need to retain their immortality. Why not just call a summit meeting?<br /><br />Due to this nonsensical state of affairs, Perseus and a group of interchangeable soldiers who exist only as cannon fodder head out on a mission to kill some monsters, accumulate some weapons, and walk across impressive panning shots of the countryside, which will somehow help them defeat the kraken that Hades, Lord of the Underworld, has promised to unleash on Argos if they do not sacrifice Princess Andromeda within ten days. Joining them is Io, an immortal hottie burdened with the terrible curse of being young and beautiful forever, a character that in the original Greek mythology was turned into a cow, tortured by a gadfly, and had nothing whatsoever to do with Perseus. I suppose these days a female isn't considered a worthy love interest unless she tags along with the boys on their adventure, but she never does much to help and her inclusion renders Andromeda's role largely pointless.<br /><br />They also pick up an eastern-style character who is called a Djinn but which looks like Pinocchio's deformed brother, and a couple of guys who I think are meant to be the comic relief, except that they never actually tell any jokes.<br /><br />Throughout the running time, the movie seems to want to make some sort of point about humanity and the gods, but it keeps changing its mind on what exactly this point is. The population of Argos is arrogant and sinful for rejecting the gods; but then the gods are petty and corrupt in their dealings with humanity. Zeus gives Hades permission to \\"set an example\\" for those who oppose them, but then tries to help Perseus in his god-defying quest to prevent Hades from destroying Argos. Draco (one of Perseus's mates) demands in one scene that Perseus accept Zeus as his father in order to spare the lives of his men, and in the next he says: \\"I'll smile when I spit in the face of the gods.\\" Io solemnly tells the men the tragic tale of Medusa, who was raped by Poseidon and then cruelly cursed by Athena, which is followed by a scene in which Perseus pep-talks his men outside her lair by telling them to: \\"kill this bitch.\\" Perseus rejects his godly heritage (though he doesn't pass on the flying horse, immortal girlfriend or built-in demigod powers) and declares to anyone who'll listen that mortality is superior to godhood, even though there's not much evidence of that.<br /><br />Despite all the railing against the gods and the rah-rah cheerleading for Team Humankind, the movie ends with an odd reestablishing of the pecking order, in which Zeus and Perseus are reconciled, Hades is sent back to Hades and Io is magically resurrected because.... hey, why not? There's some sort of message here, in which the writers desperately want to tell us something about the nature of humanity and its relationship to gods, if only they could figure out what that message was.<br /><br />It's been a while since I've watched the original [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans]], but there's no doubt that it's a superior film to this, even discounting the nostalgia quotient that leaves me with fond memories of its inherent campiness and stop-motion monsters. Not only does it boast finer actors and a more faithful adaptation of the Perseus legend, but it is also nobler in content and theme.

Despite all the railing against the gods and the rah-rah cheerleading for Team Humankind, the movie ends with an odd reestablishing of the pecking order, in which Zeus and Perseus are reconciled, Hades is sent back to Hades and Io is magically resurrected because.... hey, why not? There's some sort of message here, in which the writers desperately want to tell us something about the nature of humanity and its relationship to gods, if only they could figure out what that message was.    It's been a while since I've watched the original [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans]], but there's no doubt that it's a superior film to this, even discounting the nostalgia quotient that leaves me with fond memories of its inherent campiness and stop-motion monsters. Not only does it boast finer actors and a more faithful adaptation of the Perseus legend, but it is also nobler in content and theme. There, Perseus was on a heroic quest to save innocent people and win the love of a princess. Here, he's just after vengeance, a far less worthy goal.

0345505387|1.0|I was so disappointed with this glorified cartoon! I am a devoted fan of Diana Gabaldon, but this was a terrible interpretation of a beautiful historical fiction novel. PLEASE, tell me there is another edition coming following An Echo In The Bone....and no more \\"cheesey\\" cartoons!
B002VECLVO|2.0|I excitedly approached Tom Ford's film with full knowledge of Tom Ford design and his radiant talent. Unfortunately, this review isn't based an original, Gucci horsebit handbag still in the box in my closet, but on his first film. In Ford's film, beauty takes center stage and depth is transparent. Ford seems all too accustomed to lifeless, pale, teenage models on and off the runway. Quite sadly, this film makes me ponder Ford's depth in all regards. After all, the pieces which speak to me in film, art, or fashion carry stories, history and even our humanity. Take note Ford.

B002VPE1XE|4.0|This simple nylon bag holds compact cameras of various sizes. I have a Canon SD1300 and it fits in the bag with room to spare. The soft inner lining and padded inserts prevents it from getting dinged up, which is of course the point of the bag.<br /><br />Other features include:<br /><br />a padded flap with velcro to keep the camera from falling out,<br /><br />a velcro loop in the back for attaching to belts, bags, and other items,<br /><br />a hand/wrist strap,<br /><br />and a zippered front pocket for storing extra batteries, memory cards, and other items.<br /><br />The flap covers the front pocket, offering a small degree of protection to its contents.<br /><br />The only real issue is the zipper tab, which is flimsy rubber which is easily torn. A simple metal tab would have worked a lot better and lasted much longer. This is easy for the buyer to fix, however, so it's a pretty minor complaint.
0545310601|4.0|My one main problem with this book is the ending with Peeta and Gale. It's not who she chose - that really doesn't bother me. It's that SC just tossed Gale off to the side with a poorly constructed, nonsensical reason, just so Katniss wouldn't have to make a choice. The ending is far too short, too - just a few pages long to wrap up what should have taken more.    One plot theme that I thought should have been more explicitly stated is the idea of the Hunger Games for the Capitol children. It seemed to me that the idea was that if they had happened, the new government would be no better than the old one. But that simply wasn't clear. In fact, that was a nagging idea throughout the whole book - the strict harshness of life in 13, with just a few people controlling everyone else, and the brutal capture of Katniss' prep team near the beginning.    The many character deaths were sad, but necessary (Finnick! I was rooting for you.) But of course, SC can't really be blamed for that. Part of war stories, or big battles, means important characters have to die. That's why the 7th Harry Potter was satisfying and Breaking Dawn wasn't. The consistent violence was also a bit grisly at times, but also necessary to stay consistent with what has been already established. (In fact, I thought ehe no-nonsese approach to it was one of the highlights of the book.)    The creativity is still as vibrant as ever. So all in all, Mockingjay was satisfying in most regards, but the poor resolution of the love triangle left  an unsatisfying, hasty conclusion.
159448385X|5.0|I read this book in a about two days because it was such a page-turner.  Although I had also loved The Kite Runner, I think that A Thousand Splendid Suns shows that Hosseini has grown as a writer and produced a piece of art even more beautiful than his first work.  I feel that this book may have also been perhaps more difficult for him to write because it is from the point of view of Afghani women and thus is a perspective that he has never experienced himself.    Briefly, A Thousand Splendid Suns follow the hardships of two different women - Mariam and Laila, whose lives become intertwined as they live through the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and then the subsequent rule of the Taliban.  The book manages to be extremely successful in mixing together the historical significance of Afghanistan during this time period and the fiction created from Hosseini's head.    I really liked The Kite Runner but I feel as though the character development and humanity of the characters is even better than The Kite Runner.  Mariam is enduring, constantly looking for love and approval in her life, timid, and obedient.  Laila is the perfect compliment to her - strong-willed, intelligent, and determined.  Mariam grows stronger and more confident throughout the book as though drawing energy from Laila.  Rasheed, the villian, is a more believable villian than Assef in The Kite Runner.  Rasheed is cruel  and unyielding, yes, but we see moments of humanity in him when he is with his son.  To me, it seems as though Rasheed is mostly the way he is because of societal traditions - he has almost been taught to hate women and treat them poorly.  But like most real abusive spouses, his behavior seems to get worse and worse throughout the course of the book.    A Thousand Splendid Suns is almost a borderline feminist book.  It exhibits the strength of women and how necessary they are to the progress of society.  You will probably need a box of tissues to get through this but the end is bittersweet.  It certainly leaves you with thoughts about the future of Afghanistan.
B0026P40NU|5.0|I really enjoyed this series a lot. Yes, there is a lot of sex, so you shouldn't probably not watch this with children, but it is a genuinely interesting look at the lives of these artists.  The acting is superb, and the scenery and costumes beautiful and lavish.  I can highly recommend this show about what was essentially a story about love and art.
0061438294|5.0|This is extremely informative book, full of real life examples. It teaches you how to observe, read and interpret people body language and then use that information in your favor. The author is a highly knowledgeable FBI agent who knows what he is talking about and shares his years of experience with us in this book. I find it both fascinating and informative what techniques, authorities use when interviewing suspects and this helps me better identify when people are honest or full of it. I am a person who takes no nonsense from anybody and in order to assure that, I needed to develope my body language and social skills and reading this book served this purpose perfectly for me.<br /><br />There are many photos used in this book which are greatly educational and make the points clear. Reading this book gives you practical knowledge of human body language; then it's up to you how to utilize that knowledge. Practical knowledge is always a power and never forget that with great power comes great responsibility.<br />I personally believe that body language is more important than verbal language, more honest, more convincing, more real and more reliable. It is our natural way of communication that goes beyond the boundaries of times and places. This book teaches you very well about it. Once you learned the basics, you can use it at work, at home, with friends,... or basically anywhere there is another person around you.<br /><br />I have only one criticism to this book and that is the frequent use of uncommon words which I find unnecessary and pointless. Here are some examples:<br /><br />.....but to the unknowing they may look erroneously benign<br />.....Be astute and don't linger<br />...  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the nonverbal cues<br /><br />You will have no problem finding more examples of this type. Meanwhile I can understand (or at least guess) why this is happening. Mr. Navarro, the author is a Cuban born immigrant who has learned English as the second language. The problem is sometimes when foreigners learn English, they over do it. They use words and verbs that are rarely used in daily conversations among English speaking people. Or maybe they just open up a dictionary and choose an equivalent that is barely used and less common. My suggestion is this book gets edited by a person whom English is the first language and can offer better alternatives.<br /><br />Well I think I put more emphasize on this negative point than necessary. As for the positive points and what this book can teach you, just go ahead and buy it, and I guarantee what you will learn is well worth the $ 9 on Amazon or  $ 19.00 I paid in Barn's and Noble store.<br /><br />The good news is once you mastered the body language; you can easily and effectively use it to better your life and those around you.when foreigners learn English, they over do it.

B000JCETC4|5.0|As a long time Pink Floyd fan, this is a welcome addition to my music collection. Most of this material is clearly Gilmour's talent coming out again. Since many of the folks from his PF tours are on this album, along with Rick Wright's last tour before his death, this album also touches some sadness & loss but the music is still there. I also have the DVD & it's the reason I bought this album. If you're a fan of either Gilmour or PF, this is a must.
B00006JDS4|1.0|bought the \\"DVD\\" millennium edition and watched it on (a now old) DVD player a few years ago.<br />This evening I tried to watch it again on my new-ish PS3 and it would not get past Dolby ad.<br />Windows 7 laptop stalls one third the way through.. While this is not a film I love to see, I did<br />want to watch it once more as a re-make is out soon. Shame, my comparison is spoiled by what seems<br />to be a bootleg, bought on Amazon. Beware.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I haven't had a book engage me this much since the first time I picked up Eye of the World by Robert Jordon.  It's fitting that Brandon Sanderson is finishing up the Wheel of Time series.  After reading this book (the first I've read by Sanderson) I can see why Mr. Jordon and his family felt that Sanderson was up to the task.  He builds an entirely new world right in front of your eyes and what a world it is!  I'll be looking forward to the continuation of the series, though as another reviewer posted, it will probably be decades in the making.      I finished this in two days of travel and it was simply because I could not put it down.  If you like high fantasy with a well fleshed-out world and characters, pick this one up.  You won't regret it!

B001LF4IA6|2.0|....gotta agree, very reluctantly ,with the other 3 reviews here (i'm ignoring the 5 star waffle). The production makes all the tracks sound entirely too similar, a great band is buried in the mix. I,m not blaming Brendan O' Brien however, i'm sure Bruce got exactly what he wanted, and if he does'nt want to re-visit old ground, that is, perhaps , laudable. However, for my part, what i love most about the E Street Band (tellingly not credited as such here), is that they are a brilliantly tight outfit, but they also shine individually. Not here they don't. Especially missed in the mish-mash are the distinct sounds and styles of Clarence, Roy, Max and Nils. As for my favourite guitarist in the band, Bruce, well he seems to have turned up at the studio without any instruments whatsoever, which really is disappointing, because those of you with a good memory will surely recall that he is also pretty handy harmonica player. Obviously i adore the 70's & 80's albums, but i also think that both, The Rising & Magic are wonderful albums. 10/10 each. As i was buying this new album this morning,i said to two friends of mine, \\"if its even half as good as Magic, i will be happy\\". So,as it turns out,i will stick with that,i'm happy (enough), as it is exactly half as good as 'Magic'.
1416972250|4.0|This is the final book in the 3 book series.  I did enjoy this story, however - I felt like I was reading one big book, but cut up into thirds.  From the very beginning \\"City of Bones\\", I wanted to know why she wouldn't have gone to City of Glass in the first place.  For being the daughter or possible daughter of Valentine - you would have thought they would have wanted her right away!  Regardless of that, there were a few twists in the end, and the build up was good- I was left satisfied in the end.<br /><br />For a teen book, this story had a few mature content to this book.  Not really wanting to give the story line away, I wont go into detail.  What I mean by mature; Firstly, it's still PG-13, but a few of the love stories are morally controversial and leaves the door open for \\"this is a perfectly normal\\" idea that I wasn't sure if I would want my teen to open too.  Because of that is why only gave the book 4 stars.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy aspects of this story - found it funny and full of adventure.  I was entertained - and would recommend the book.  And plan on reading her new series too!
0634022296|5.0|A most awesome book for the guitar playing Beatle lover.  Easy to follow and fun to learn. If you play guitar and you love the Beatles this is a must buy.
B002ZG98VE|3.0|I am a loyal fan of Ridley Scott since his first \\"The Duelist\\" with Jeremy Irons and Harvey Kietel.<br />The first 45 mins of this film was great, with authentic (seems) art direction, costume and vigorous<br />action set pieces like the assault of the castle.  Soon after Robin Hood returned to England as an<br />impostor, the film fell apart.  The remaining of the film seemed that the script writer couldn't decide which<br />way to go and what kind of adventure story to tell.  Russell Crowe as always did a good job giving a<br />measured performance as the folk hero, in this prequel!  Cate Blanchett as Marian was cold and unattractive.<br />Towards the end when Robin Hood told her, \\"I love you!\\", it just seems false and unmoving.<br />If the film makers(including producers) want to start a successful film franchise, they should at least make<br />the first one great.  The major flaw of this film is the story and the script.<br />A post script:  Increasingly I find many movies received unwarranted lengthy rave reviews.<br />I wonder if there is a reward for writing favorable reviews.

1433502410|5.0|I purchased the leather bound ESV Study Bible and have not been disappointed. I will start with the cosmetics. First of all, the binding is top notch. So is the genuine leather in the leather bound edition. The pages are the highest quality of Bible paper that I have seen(and I have seen many). The box it came in said that this bible is guaranteed to last a lifetime. Now onto the content. The actual Bible text is in a single column format which I actually prefer more than the double column. The are 40 full color ink drawings of towns, places, and archeology spread out throughout the Bible. The book introductions are very informative, some of them being up to 7 pages in length. In the back, there are over 50 large articles on essentially Bible topics. These differentiate from how to understand Hebrew and Greek to more worldly topics such as Homosexuality. There are also over 200 full color maps in the pages of the Bible itself. They are very helpful.    I will note though, if you intend to buy this bible, I would recommend getting this Bible cover. It's the one I have and it's a perfect fit. http://www.amazon.com/Isaiah-40-Luxleather-Bible-Cover/dp/B003010POM/ref=sr_1_1?s=gateway&ie=UTF8&qid=1285427150&sr=8-1.
B00007KWI9|5.0|After owning this album on vinyl for 25 years , but not having a turntable for the past 7 years...i finally bought it on cd. It's even better than i remember, an absolutely stunning collection of songs, played with a flair to match any of the later albums by the 'definitive' Yes line-up. Jon anderson's voice is ,as always,simply beautiful. Chris Squire's bass,is, as mentioned by another reviewer forward in the mix,but that can only be a good thing right ?, he drives these songs along brilliantly.Bill Bruford was always in and out of the various line -ups,and we all know how good he is,and here he excels himself during both the subtle moments and the times when these songs simply rock. Tony Kaye's organ ,whilst sounding it's age,(this was 1969 remember),is all the better for it, it just sounds so 'real',and not at all the product of an expensive studio,as keyboard instruments often do.Indeed this entire album is pretty raw,and Peter Bank's agressive guitar style (as opposed to my favourite guitarist,Steve Howe's generally more jazzy,experimental style) is the icing on the cake. Thanks to Banks ,YES ,sound almost like a conventional rock band here,at times,but i said almost, and rest assured, this is bold and daring music. Sure enough as others have mentioned,they cover The Beatles here, but it's two minutes plus into that song, before the vocal starts, the intro is a group of top class musicians , having a great time , and this is most definitely passed on to the listener. It's joyous and infectious.<br />I'm rambling, this is a wonderous debut album, if you like YES even a little, you need this record. PS- This is one of the few cd's i have bought where the bonus tracks are truly deserving of mention, but they are that special ,i believe this should have been a double vinyl all those years ago.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Long time Van Halen fan, since 84. Fair Warning is an excellent album. Mean Streets is perhaps one of Van Halen's most dynamic songs, it's clean and raw. This was the last album before VH's sound became more 'polished', kind of like Metallica's 'Master of Puppets'.

Diane, if you are listening...no we do not find Lord John interesting. It was quite clear in the last book that our beloved authoress no longer finds her own characters interesting and can't figure out what to do with them.I have been reading these books obsessively for the past 18 years , I put the last one down after 3 chapters bored and upset that she was writing about Lord John again!!!! He is an ancillary character only, interesting only when Jaime and Claire are around.  The illustrations are silly.....he obviously thinks caucasins are fox faced, big boobed , well...i could go on but as before, don't bother.

0439023513|3.0|Okay. So I wasn't expecting Katniss to be a hero and save the country. I was actually either thinking that the rebellion's attempts would end in a cataclysm or that another bad regime would replace another.    But I did expect her to be a likable protagonist, something that I found a lack of throughout the book. I liked the focus on the effects of war and tragedy on a young teenager, and I appreciated that in her position, there wasn't a lot that could be done except in the space of a single moment, which she took advantage of brilliantly. She has some extremely good moments, in which she risks her life to empathize with others, in understanding that the cycle of revenge can't be reignited, in allowing fragility to show beyond her tough exterior. But she essentially gives up on everyone she cares about--besides Prim--at one point or another in the book. Yes, she should have weak moments, and arguably be psychologically incapacitated. But there's a story to be had, and this Mockingjay needed to rise to the occasion more often.    In the end, she became the Girl on Fire--but not in a way that Cinna would have appreciated.

B003L20IE2|5.0|Fantastically fun film that did not get the recognition it deserves while in theaters. I for one will definitely be picking up a copy in support of such a fresh and unique movie.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|I just watched it on Amazon demand, it is an awesome movie. I don't understand how anyone can give it an low rating. I never felt like the movie was lacking anything. Russell and Cate's acting is very good. They give you that quiet strength you would have to have in that life. The actors who play the Merry Men are so funny. You can't help but love there acting out.(party scene!)I hope they make a sequel. I plan on purchasing the DVD this weekend.
0439023483|5.0|Okay, when I first read the plot, I immediately pictured an American book rendition of \\"Battle Royale.\\" For those of you who don't know what the heck that is, it's an old Japanese movie set in the far future in which every year a class of high school students is drugged, strapped with explosive GPS tags, and is sent to a deserted island to battle it to the death with a time limit imposed to blow all survivors left should there be more than one. Of course, a boy and a girl band together, manage to outwit the powers that be, and end the movie living on the run, supporting one another.    In a sense, the overall plot wasn't much more imaginative than Battle Royale. But Suzanne Collins took this story with a vague background and enriched it with detail, emotion, and characters who were much more likable and/or hated than the crazy veteran guy who was killing everyone and the somewhat dull protagonists. Collins works extremely hard to ensure that this book is more than a reality show, with her realistic depictions of starvation, pain, and moral/emotional turmoil. Katniss becomes a unique female protagonist who is essentially the underdog--she has a rough and kind of unpleasant start, but her talents and ability to draw other people to her help her become a likable lead. And she outsmarts, outwits, and outplays everybody, including her companion Peeta, who starts out as a mere possible love interest and becomes a beloved character.    The fact that their actions in the Arena erupt into a boiling mess of politics only intrigued me. If you like survival stories enhanced with an excellent writing style, I suggest diving into this awesome trilogy.

0767834739|4.0|RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is the second film in what is so far a four-film franchise, and it takes the first movie and ramps it up by several notches. And, cripes, that T-Virus sure is a real mother. The sitch as this sequel opens is this: a zombie plague has scoured Raccoon City, thanks to the ill dealings of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's largest pharmaceutical agency and just possibly the most diabolical global entity, like, ever. Precautions have been taken. Raccoon City has been entirely sealed off, the sun setting on a population left to fend for itself, probably feed on itself. Throughout the city, measures have been taken to ensure the evacuation of Umbrella Corporation's key personnel. The scientist who invented the T-Virus, for one, gets out safely. But his young daughter doesn't. At sunrise, Raccoon City is scheduled for a tactical nuclear strike. Some really heavy sunscreen is recommended.<br /><br />The story tracks a tiny band of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to escape the city limits. It helps that this group is made up primarily of highly skilled operatives from the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) unit and also from an Umbrella strike force. It also helps that the scientist who invented the T-virus is willing to guide them to safety, provided they rescue his young child. The odds for survival increase dramatically with the arrival of Alice, former head of security for an underground Umbrella complex. But it's a slightly different Alice than from what we remember in the first movie. She's been experimented on by the Umbrella think tank and she now demonstrates super powers. Another survivor from the first movie figures in APOCALYPSE, except that he'd been tweaked and probed and genetically engineered into becoming the terrifying Nemesis program. And no surprise that even with a city apocalypse going down, there are still fiendish Umbrella asshats bent on pursuing their messed-up experiments - such as pitting the Nemesis Program and Alice against each other, in a backstreet brawl, just to see who'd come out on top.<br /><br />Plot, sphlot. This is survival horror cinema, so one shouldn't expect too much verisimilitude or texture. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE was designed with crunching zombie kills and gory special effects in mind. Sexy Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr step into the fray as two uber-capable action heroes in their own right. But Milla Jovovich owns this franchise, and she again lends her fantastic looks and her palpable physicality. Milla is fearless when it comes to committing to her action sequences, and she performs a lot of her own stunts, including rappelling 60 feet down the side of a high rise edifice. She really anchors the film, drives most of the spectacular action set pieces.<br /><br />Plenty of gamers complained that the first film strayed too far from the video game, and here's APOCALYPSE attempting to atone. Consequently, game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory), Carlos Olivera (Fehr), and Nicholai Ginovaef are introduced, and the hulking Nemesis program is the featured Big Bad. The character of Alice was, of course, originally invented for the film franchise. The lickers are back, as are the gore hounds. Plenty for our good guys to shoot to bits.

B000FSBWQ8|3.0|I'll just say it now: I'm a n00b to the Final Fantasy series. However, a while back, I saw Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.     STORY: The story starts out with a voice of a young girl explaining the history of the SOLDIERs and Sephiroth, and mentions the Shinra Electric Company's plans. The backstory is good, but after that, it gets really, REALLY confusing. If you haven't played the game (as I haven't), chances are, you'll be VERY confused throughout the majority of the film.    CGI: Advent Children is ALL CGI animation. It's extremely impressive, and is just as good, if not way better than, Pixar standards. How good IS it? Well, at points, you can see individual hairs on Cloud Strife's head. (For those who don't know, he is the main character).    VOICE-ACTING: You can watch the film in English or Japanese, with a LOT of subtitle languages to choose from. Here's how the voice-acting is:  JAPANESE: very good. All characters - Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, and more have impressive voice work. Good emotion, good script, and all-around impressive.  ENGLISH: Average. Granted, like many Japanese to English dubs in anime/movies, the voice acting isn't ear-bleedingly bad. In fact, quite the contrary. Cloud and Sephiroth have good voices that work well for their personas. CONS: monotones. At one point, Cloud says to Sephiroth: \\"I pity you. You just don't get it at all. THERE'S NOT A THING I DON'T CHERISH!\\". This is a good piece of dialogue, but his English voice-actor doesn't put enough emotion into it. It just sounds... bland.    ACTION: Let's just say, that if you like anime-style, over-the-top (WAAAAY over), action, this movie is great for you. From everything to a motorcycle chase scene at the beginning to Cloud's final fight with Sephiroth, this movie has TONS of action. Sadly, it seems to replace the story in some cases.    If you're a die-hard Final Fantasy VII fan, you might get a kick out of this movie. If not, you will probably be extremely confused by the weak/poorly structured story.
0439023513|5.0|The book's condition was perfect, the cover wasn't torn or ripped at all. The story however...I didn't like the ending. But the physical state was good.
B004132HZS|5.0|I was able to watch this before its release in the US.  It is pretty amazing!  If you are a Holmes fan it's a must have!  It was very entertaining to watch \\"what would Holmes and Watson be like if they lived today?\\"  The stories were well thought out.  I can't wait till the series comes out on PBS! If you buy this you won't be able to wait either.  :)
B00064WSNW|5.0|King Crimson is one of the best bands ever.  This album is so unique and the instrumentation is unequaled.
B00005NWLO|5.0|The Amazon description of this cd is not accurate.  This is not a Japan release.  Also, the reviews of all the editions are mixed up with each other.  But here's what I think of the three different releases of this legendary, essential album.  Mixing/Frequency response:   1990 -- Limited by lackluster original, early cd mastering  1996 -- Much improved by remaster, but somewhat harsh, AND--THIS IS BIG--the rhythm guitar is buried in the mix!  For large parts of the song, all you hear from the band is piano, bass and drums!  2001 -- Improved, but sounds light, and high hat is annoyingly prominent  Imaging/Separation:  1990 -- Sounds good, but could be fuller  1996 -- Great separation, but bad, flat imaging  2001 -- Great separation; imaging warm but unnaturally full  Sequencing/Bonus tracks:  1990 -- Original album sequence, but with Traveling Man and T for Texas missing   1996 -- The \\"actual\\" order, but with a 2nd Sweet Home Alabama awkwardly inserted  2001 -- Several alternate takes, the actual Free Bird solo, and more stage banter  Bottom line:  1990 -- I'll stick with this one.  This version is the most soothing to me, because--even though it could definitely use improvement--it sounds \\"right\\".  I'm annoyed by resequencing of classic live albums to the \\"original\\" live order.  I don't care what order they actually played the songs -- I care about the order they were in on the album that I've heard hundreds of times.  Also, the original cd release, despite its limitations, sounds more like the lp to me than either remaster.  My vintage receiver, outboard d/a converter, and equalizer more than compensate for any sonic defects in this version.  (but I hate not having those two missing songs.)  1996 -- This is enjoyable in terms of how clean it sounds, but having the guitar buried just destroys this version.  You get the two missing songs and the clarity is improved, but at too high of a price.  Skip this.  2001 -- I don't like this one either.  The extra banter and bonus tracks are cool, but the mix sounds terrible to me.  It's got no power, and the high hat dominates the sound.  I also don't like that the Free Bird solo is different than the original album.  If the lp version was included with the \\"original solo\\" version and the alternate take that would be fine, but I want to hear the solo that I know note for note, not a historical artifact.  Overall, this is a failed effort.  They need to try releasing this one more time--with the original lp order and a mastering job that has improved frequency response but is faithful to the original lp mix and overall sound.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I love Anastacia. She's so talented.    Her music is a competent mix of some styles that amazes me.    I listen the songs over and over and just can't feel tired.    I strongly recommend this cd. Good material!!    God bless Anastacia. She deserves all the success.....
0345505387|5.0|I am a long-time fan of Diana Gabaldon and her Outlander novels. I'm very casual fan of graphic novels, having read a few, but not all that many. When I first heard that Outlander was going to be \\"re-made\\" and released in graphic novel form, I was skeptical. However, as time passed and we received some sneak peeks at some of the illustrations via the author's blog and heard that there would be new twists to the storyline, I became more and more intrigued.    All of that said, I took the plunge and bought The Exile. The illustrations by Hoang Nguyen are beautiful! His use of color and light, the depth and detail in each frame, and the facial expressions and body language of the characters added immensely to the story. In my limited experience with this genre, his attention to detail and his clear collaboration with the author really stood out when comparing The Exile to other graphic novels, which now look incredibly flat and somewhat lifeless. I'm sure that there will be criticisms of the artwork, but I felt that the overall effect was really stunning, and I had no trouble overlooking any inconsistencies from frame to frame. These are, after all, illustrations and are not meant to be photograph-like renderings or frame-captures from a movie. I think he was allowed some artistic license and used it to very good effect!     As far as the story itself, the main twist is that this is told from Murtagh's point of view. Murtagh was Jamie's godfather. Essentially, this story related some of what went on behind Claire's back, whereas Outlander had been told entirely from Claire's point of view. I won't reveal any spoilers here, except to say that there are a number of revelations in this graphic novel that weren't in the original. As usual, Diana Gabaldon treated us to her trademark humor and deft storytelling, but did so this time in a format which is very uncharacteristically, and necessarily, brief. It was no less engaging, however, though perhaps not as completely satisfying for her big-book-readers as the depth and detail that come with her traditional releases. I think the reader does need to approach this new book with that in mind. To expect that a graphic novel, even one of this length, to encompass the same amount of detail as one of her regular books is simply unrealistic.    Together, the storyline and the illustrations took me right back into the world of Jamie and Claire. As a long-time fan, that's all I ask for. I was thrilled to read some new twists on the tale, and I thought it was fun to experience the story in a different genre and to see it through different eyes. Approach this book with realistic expectations, and it won't disappoint. It's a fabulous addition to the collection!

This book needs to be read by everyone as it provides a fabulous outlook on how great our lives can be with the power.  I'm into it for the second reading.

0061673730|5.0|I think the following passage captures Pirsig's theme:<br />>  \\"A screw sticks, for example, on a side cover assembly...<br />><br />>  \\"If you're experienced you'd probably apply a penetrating liquid and an<br />>  impact driver at this point. But suppose you're inexperienced and you attach a<br />>  self-locking plier wrench to the shank of your screwdriver and really twist it<br />>  hard, a procedure you've had success with in the past, but which this time<br />>  succeeds only in tearing the slot of the screw.<br />><br />>  \\"Your mind was already thinking ahead to what you would do when the cover<br />>  plate was off, and so it takes a little time to realize that this irritating minor<br />>  annoyance of a torn screw slot isn't just irritating and minor. You're stuck...<br />><br />>  \\"It's a miserable experience emotionally. You're losing time. You're incompetent.<br />>  You don't know what you're doing. You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take the machine to a real mechanic who >  knows how to figure these things out.\\"  - Ch. 24, pg. 271 [out of 402]<br /><br />  Pirsig builds of this common feeling of stuckness--lost keys, test questions that we can't quite remember, computers that don't do what we are telling it, etc. The book opens on a road trip that the author is making with his son Chris, and John and Sylvia, a likable couple who are friends of Pirsig. Chris is riding on the back of his father's motorcycle, John and Sylvia on their BMW. Pirsig knows his bike inside and out, observant of every mechanical nuance that might be a clue toward keeping the motor in top condition. John and Sylvia, however, both are \\"stuck\\" when it comes to technology (BMW cylces are known for having few mechanical problems on the road), and leave even the smallest jobs to a paid mechanic. Finally Pirsig comprehends why: \\"To get away from technology out into the country in the fresh air and sunshine is why they are on the motorcycle in the first place. For me to bring it back to them just at the point and place where they think they have finally escaped it just frosts both of them, tremendously.\\" (Ch. 1, pg. 8)<br /><br /> Pirsig's book presents a theory about the source of John's and Sylvia's exasperation with technology and outlines the foundations for a solution. At this point I feel it necessary to issue a disclaimer. You may be thinking this book sounds like both an enjoyable and illuminating read. And for the first 100 pages you'd be right! The core of the book shifts in style, though it's not necessarily a change for the worse. My disclaimer: \\"This book was written for people who like to struggle with ideas.\\" Pirsig, who also spent four years teaching rhetoric in the Montana and Illinois university systems, admits as much at this point within the book--\\"I suppose if I were a novelist rather than a Chautauqua orator I'd try to 'develop the characters' of John and Sylvia and Chris... That would be quite a novel, but for some reason I don't feel quite up to it.\\" (Ch. 12, pg. 129)<br /><br /> Webster's defines a Chautauqua as: \\"a traveling show or local assembly that flourished in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that provided popular education combined with entertainment in the form of lectures, [among other activities].\\" This book was written precisely for those individuals who feel excited by the idea of a Chautauqua.<br /><br /> The rest of the book is more an autobiography of the author's journey through Western thought than a novel, although it retains many literary elements. Pirsig's insights continued to surprise me through the whole 373 pages. His main concern is the question \\"What values does scientific thinking teach us?\\" He comes to doubt society's commonly-accepted viewpoint that science teaches only morally-neutral, objective analysis.<br /><br /> Pirsig is not satisfied with this answer because for him, science is a means to Truth rather than a means to utilitarian application. Utilitarian application may satisfy most, but Pirsig invested too much in the pursuit of deeper Truth to stop there. To him, the near universal acceptance of utilitarian application as a validation of science, at the expense of the pursuit of a single absolute truth, becomes a ghost that haunts his whole way of thinking. \\"Great minds struggle to cure diseases so that people may live longer, but only madmen ask why. One lives longer in order that he may live longer. There is no other purpose. That is what the ghost says.\\" (Ch. 7, pg. 85)<br /><br /> The problem, as he sees it, is that there are infinite possible applications of science, and indeed an infinite number of truths that experimentation can prove.  We treat scientific knowledge as an end worthy in itself, but there is no ultimate completeness to be found there. \\"It is science itself that is leading mankind from single absolute truths to multiple, indeterminate, relative ones... Science itself is producing the indeterminacy of thought and values that rational knowledge is supposed to eliminate.\\" (Ch. 10, pg. 108)<br /><br /> In this way, science and technology become every bit as subjective as musical taste or religious belief. We use science to extend lifespans and rearrange the elements of the earth into any number of products for physical comfort or electronically-produced amusement in the same way that one prefers Beethoven over Mozart, or Catholicism over Baptists.<br /><br /> To avoid facing this inconsistency, Western thought has petrified, insisting that Classicism and Romanticism are mutually exclusive spheres rather than two approaches toward the same end.  There's the \\"hard\\" sectors of science and business, which are ruled by objectivity, and then everything else--the arts, volunteer work, religion.  In fact these spheres are different, but it is wrong to think think they have nothing to do with each other, and that the \\"hard\\" sphere should be controlled only by objective analysis.  Classicism develops out of our social predisposition to use language--to learn the accepted name everything and conform to one's cultural grouping.  Romanticism comes from humanity's evolutionary, biological need to experiment and experience until arriving at the behavior that feels most right.  It is the interaction of these competing worlds that created and has the ability to expand humanity's consciousness.  Pirsig explores this fundamental duality of consciousness through the lens of Western philosophical thought, using motorcycle maintenance to explain the Classical mode of dividing and classifying knowledge, and Zen, the Romantic holistic approach.<br /><br /> This book is for those who enjoy wrestling with these sort of ideas. In one of the more revealing autobiographical segments, Pirsig employs a quote from Albert Einstein describing an angel who expels the egoists and utilitarians from the Temple of Science. All that remain, \\"those who have found favor with the angel,\\" are those whose \\"finely tempered nature longs to escape from his noisy cramped surroundings into the silence of the mountains where the eye ranges freely through the still pure air and fondly traces out the restful contours apparently built for eternity.\\" (Ch. 10, pg. 104) For these, I could not recommend ZAMM highly enough.t of deeper Truth to stop there.

B0002XMF5S|4.0|This recording rocks! The Title track \\"Seventh Star\\" is one of Tony's best -- TOTALLY good vibe, epic guitar, and Glenn Hughes singing his guts out! Tony's best \\"solo\\" CD IMO. Tony got an excellent group together for these 9 tracks and his inspiration shines through. Black Sabbath fans who think the band is just about the heavy and the dark have overlooked the fact that Tony Iommi wears the Cross. \\"Only the wounded know how to bind up wounds\\" (Fulton Sheen). Tony suffered deeply early on when his finger tip was severed by a sheet metal cutter, which forced him to adopt a new playing style. Eventually his career took off. Tony has heart. This CD is his sojourn in the wilderness, inspired, no doubt, by Jesus and St. Anthony of Egypt who initiated him into the mysteries of the Seventh Star.
0393072231|5.0|Somehow Lewis is able to describe some very complex financial instruments in a way that non-Wall Streeters will understand. I thought this book was great-who would have thought that a book about Wall Street could be such a page-turner. The characters were interesting and enigmatic-particularly Michael Burry.  If you have even the slightest interest in Wall Street and want to understand how the financial collapse occurred, I think this book is a must-read.

I'm interested in Eastern religions, so I was looking forward to the India section, but the thing that really rang true to me was: \\"...People follow different paths....and all reach You, just as rivers enter the ocean.\\" But overall, I was pretty bored with this book.

I mean it wasn't completely terrible but if this was going to be the ending I'd of stopped at book two. Hopefully, Collins readers influence will encourage her to do this book over.

0312600844|5.0|Funny how most of the deeply negative reviews here are written by right wing Tea Party types (\\"disrespectful to the United States Constitution\\"??  \\"a ranting manifesto\\"??) who clearly don't get what a profoundly patriotic novel this is.  A number of these critics seem to think that Franzen thinks that freedom is \\"evil\\" and responsible for our current national problems.  They've got it completely ass-backwards.  Franzen obviously believes that true freedom (not fake, monetized \\"freedom\\") carries with it a huge responsibility, one which we have lost track of in our breathless haste to get our slice of the American pie before it disappears.  The very curdled rage and bewilderment which he captures with such sorrow, love and disappointment in the book, is what many of the hair-trigger rage-aholics writing negative reviews here embody. Of course you're entitled not to like this book if you think it's badly written.  But if you're actually THREATENED by it to the point of sputtering rage then you're probably part of the problem he delineates with such masterly grace. In any case, I just finished reading the book an hour ago and already know that its seemingly simple complexities will resonate with me for a long long time.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|IS WHAT THIS ALBUM IS. For the uninitiated, one of SCI-FI author Phillip K. Dick's literary devices consisted of something he reffered to as a \\"disinhibiting stimulus\\". This basically amounts to some COSMIC TRIGGERING STIMULUS (which could manifest in most any form) which brings about radical revelation, radical change and dramatic shifts in the flow of the narrative. In fact, the \\"ARCHANDROID\\" is a textbook example as it is explained that the stimulus in question could as likely show up in the form of POP CULTURE as opposed to some lofty utterance or leaden tome. Laughably (for those other than the self-initiated) Dick's works were largely held to be \\"trash litertaure\\" during his day.<br /><br />In this instance, its OVER-AWEING, and fulfills Dick's Precognitive EDICT...Janelle Monae would herself be the disinhibiting stimulus who has transformed the transmission vehicle of POP EXPRESSIONISM into a highly distilled sublime utterance...taking in the great swath of all periods of the 20th century in a grand summation of all that was GREAT about it all. Thus utilizing her alchemic gifts to SWITCH US ALL ON. Her immediate precursors, it seems to this humble listener, are/were Cab Calloway, Lena Horne, Janet Baker, Sun Ra & George Clinton (AMONG OTHERS!)<br /><br />Turn on, tune in and TONE UP...
0609610570|3.0|I bought this book five years ago, but never took it out of the plastic wrap. How ironic is that?
0312600844|4.0|I found Freedom a fine accounting of what can happen in dysfunctional American and world societies where greed and personal excesses rule.  Although sometimes tedious  reading, a better description of our decaying human values would be hard to find and comprehend, especially when it comes to the real dangers of overpopulation and destruction of our environment, both areas where apathy abounds and realistic debate on solutions is almost totally absent.  We should thank the author for his efforts to expose this through the weaknesses, excesses and sometimes raw behavior of his main characters.  Although some may find the characters' actions unrealistic, I believe the author  programmed them that way in order to strengthen his thought-provoking message that hopefully will awaken readers.
B0025KVLRO|4.0|This review is largely based around technical details of the music itself.    First, a word about the different releases. A comparison between the 1987 CD releases with the new 2009 Beatles Remasters is interesting in the context of this album because of the varied nature of the releases. The 87 CDs weren't necessarily bad for their time, however the sound content was still somewhat muffled. Listeners vastly preferred (and in some cases still do) the older vinyl recordings because they had a warmer and more present sound. Thankfully, the clarity of the music has come through in the new remastered releases. Believe me, they are worth every penny.    An oddity, though, is that a comparison between the 87 release, and the 2009 STEREO release of Please Please Me is not entirely fair. The 87 CD was actually the MONO (where the sound is held in one channel) mix of the album vs. this release in STEREO (where the sound is spread between two channels). Now, you might ask, why should this matter?     Please Please Me was originally recorded on a 2-track machine (for non music techies, a track is essentially space where you put the sound). Modern STEREO albums often have as many as 24-tracks to house the sound. The result of limited track space often means a doubling or tripling of different sound effects (vocals, guitars, percussion, etc.) between just one or two tracks, which will ultimately result in a more muffled sound. To add to this problem, STEREO in 1962 was still in its infancy. Instead of being able to spread different sound effects around between the left and right channels to maintain a good balance, music producers were forced to more or less isolated 95% of a song's various parts to just one track or the other. This is true with, among other things, the vocals in Please Please Me, which are entirely pushed to the right channel.    Personally for me, this can be somewhat annoying to listen to. It really sounds like there is too much space between the music heardin the left and right channels and detracts slightly from an otherwise enjoyable experience. If I had to choose between the 87' release and the 2009 STEREO of Please Please Me, I would opt for the 87', primarily because it is in MONO. This is also true for many of the earlier Beatles albums. But again, this is just me. On the sound quality itself, all the STEREO remasters are superb.     The 2009 MONO remaster of the Beatles music is a different story. I have both the 2009 MONO and the STEREO box sets, and for most of the albums, up to Magical Mystery Tour, I usually opt for the MONO remaster. It's a much more balanced sound and doesn't have the persistent problem with hard audio panning in the earlier albums like the STEREO releases.    For that reason, I rate this album 4/5. The musical content is outstanding, but if you're buying the STEREO beware of audio panning.

I am plus-sized and they did not fit my calves as I had hoped.  In the pictures they looked plenty large, and even possibly adjustable, but what appears to be a strap at the top is just texture - the tops don't adjust at all.      If you're normally able to fit into calf-high boots, I'm sure these will fit you just fine, but if your calves are large like mine, beware.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I loved One Republic's first album.  When I bought this one, I knew right away it was even better.  Truly amazing songs.  My favorite is the title track \\"Waking Up\\".  Starts kind of sounding like a U2 song - and then turns into this emotionally charged and beautiful piece of music in the end.  It makes me cry every time I hear it.  Honestly, music has never effected me that way unless accompanied by a sad/powerful movie.      One Republic has such a variety of sounds.  Musically/Instrumentally, they are so diverse.  It's like a classical, pop, hip-hop, electronica and rock album all rolled into one.  Ryan Tedder's vocals are really unsurpassed.  There aren't many dudes that can hit notes like that.  \\"All the Right Moves\\" is tough to do live, yet he has managed to do it quite well.  The cello/violin melodies just lure me in everytime - and yet somehow so do the more upbeat and muscially more conventional melodies they have on the album.  It's just all good.    Ryan Tedder is musical genius.  He is a God in our household...
0439023513|4.0|I love the entire series. This book was great. It has a well thought out ending for the series.  But I was disappointed with some of the parts written. There was one occasion where the writing seemed copied. I got a sense of déjà vu. (I won't say from what book.) And personally the ending seemed a bit rushed...     Other than that it was great, I truly loved it. I would read it again. And I would recommend it to friends...
B001993Y3G|4.0|Loved watching again with some extra added scenes that give a little more depth to this storyline of Robin Hood.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|I've never been a fan of Westerns but I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman.  I read that this movie received 4 Academy Awards so I decided to purchase the bluray.  I enjoyed the movie very much.  It has a good, compelling story and excellent performances by Eastwood, Freeman and Gene Hackman.  Plus it's a steal at $10.
B003DT19F0|5.0|My 5 year old daughter was bored with the other Tinkerbell movies.  When I bought her this one, I had to MAKE her watch it with me.  She loved it and now watches it 2-3 times per day!  It's a great story and we both loved Lizzie and her Dad.  Awesome show!
0439023513|5.0|spoiler alert<br />There is a reason the books in this series are best sellers.  The conclusion is worth every cent and exactly what I was expecting.  I think enough time has passed and everyone knows the ending.  Katniss finds she is a pawn of the resistance movement and accepts it and uses it to her advantage.  I was surprised that she ends up living in peace with Peeta.  There it is out.  I was a Team Gale girl all the way.  There is not much to write about this one that hasn't been written.  Yes, you need to read this series.

B003MZ0I84|5.0|VERY good album, and amazon has the best price by far for the deluxe edition, which has 5 additional songs.  I paid 9.99 for it, which was the same price as the non deluxe edition.  The songs are all very good, from the first single \\"Misery\\", to \\"I can't lie\\", \\"How\\" and \\"No Curtain Call\\".  I haven't stopped listening to this cd since I got it.
B0011WMHRK|4.0|When Can first emerged, they were both an oddity and a continuation of what was established in the tradition of underground rock in the latter half of the 1960s. An oddity, because they were all (except Michael Karoli) born before the Baby Boom, were originally student of avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen and were from West Germany, a country which had not produced any rock bands of significance beforehand except for the latter-discovered and then-unknown [[ASIN:B001Q8FRNA Monks]]. A continuation, because the members of Can had their introduction to rock via such seminal bands as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Velvet Underground and the Mothers of Invention.<br /><br />On their first two albums with demented African-American vocalist Malcolm Mooney, Can had shown themselves a unique group with hypnotic grooves that, however, generally lacked melody in sufficient quantity to be easily listenable. There was on these early albums nothing of the tightening of such hypnotic rhythms that in later years was to make the \\"post-rock\\" sound so amazing to listen to. After [[ASIN:B0000067X4 Monster Movie]], Mooney left Can and was replaced by the even more eccentric Japanese traveller Kenji \\"Damo\\" Suzuki. Can's second official album, [[ASIN:B0000067X8 Soundtracks]] featured both vocalists and was certainly a major step forward from their earliest recordings because the band was tightening its sound and making \\"waves of melody\\" in a manner not seen beforehand.<br /><br />\\"Tago Mago\\", their third album, was an epic four-sided set that was ambitious even by the standards of the time. It set the bar higher even than had been found on their first two albums, from the opening of \\"Paperhouse\\" with its synthesised birdsong and the more dramatic mood shifts than had been seen previously. Depending on one's mood, \\"Paperhouse\\" can seem either soothing or fierce, which in its own way is certainly a feat even if the song is not quite so memorable as one would wish because the parts do not link up in watertight fashion. This, too, in spite of a high-tempo instrumental section where Jaki Liebzeit shows what a drummer he really was and Czukay provides a bass solo like no others. Second track \\"Mushroom\\" is shorter, but probably superior to \\"Paperhouse\\" because it is so memorable and even tight. the opening is one of the most singular in rock history and I would say the first proof Can really were one of rock's greats. The keyboards, on the other had, reveal themselves with close listening.<br /><br />Third track \\"Oh Yeah\\" opens as pure electronic funk: indeed it maintains its solid funky groove for the entire seven minutes and the manner by which it increases in volume does not equal \\"Future Days\\" but certainly can be seen to show Can evolving in the direction of that piece. \\"Oh Yeah\\" is particularly impressive in the manner by which it increases in volume whilst maintaining quite surprising solidity. However, the following two tracks, on which \\"Tago Mago\\"'s lofty reputation is based, are ones which I have never been able to get into. Often \\"Halleluwah\\" and especially \\"Aumgn\\" seem so loose that it is difficult to see how Can really were working together during their construction. The abtractions of the latter track especially go rather too far to be seriously listenable. Even \\"Peking O\\", the first track on the fourth side of the original vinyl, is not an easy listen but, more than the previous two tracks it shows how intense the two-track production of Can could be and there are some really dramatic parts. Closer \\"Bring Me Coffee or Tea\\" is soothing and beautiful, if not so intertwined as the amazing [[ASIN:B00151HZMO Future Days]]. More than that, its dramatic middle section predates the earliest \\"power ballads\\" by half a decade: indeed many elements of Can's sound on \\"Tago Mago\\" and later albums do this and one has mixed, but overall positive, emotions thereabout.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Tago Mago\\" is very hard to listen and at times does wander unnecessarily, but still it shows a band developing into one of the best rock groups of the 1970s.er unnecessarily, but still it shows a band developing into one of the best rock groups of the 1970s.
0596806027|4.0|This is an overall good introductory book to HTML5 for existing web developers. If you are completely new to HTML and want to start with HTML5, then this is not the one you should read. This is not a step-by-step book, but it introduces the background, the rationales, and the new features of HTML5 with appropriate amount of depth to get started.    The book only has around 200 pages, it does not go very deep into any topic it introduces, but the amount of information it gives is enough as a starting point. At the end of each chapter, it also gives a pointer for further readings. A lot of contents are of very high value, not only teaching how to do, but also telling the reasons. And it's very thoughtful to include the matrix for browser support for the features it introduces.    In general, for any existing front-end developer, learning and accepting the concepts of HTML5 shouldn't really be particularly hard with the right information, and this is a book I recommend.
B00006JKOM|3.0|i received the product in a timely manor but, the volume i really low. have to turn it up loud.
B003UYUR10|4.0|Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) must clear his name when the King who treated him like a son is murdered by a gift he gave him. While his uncle Nizam, (Ben Kingsley) will stop at nothing to get his hands on a very special time turning dagger that's in Dastan's possession. At Dastan's side is Tamina (Gemma Arterton), the protector of the dagger.<br /><br />  Prince of Persia is a fun guilty pleasure type of film like the Mummy, except I think it's better. The Mummy probably has better effects though. The CGI is the weak point of Prince of Persia, you always know when you're looking at a CGI version of Gyllenhaal for instance. Still, I think the movie is better than a lot of the disappointing 2010 summer releases and also much better than all of the other video game adaptions so far.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is the best CD for anyone who is collecting music from the Beach Boy era. Has all their best hits and some included are the ones that are hard to find. They are all this single album. Also they are the original cuts.

B003PIUC02|5.0|The series alone is awesome. But it got to me a lot faster than expected. I ordered it on September 18 and got it to me on the 23rd. I was surprised at the dvd packaging. I thought it was going to be in a standard Blu-Ray case but it came in a mini book style format, not complaining it's pretty cool. This series MUST be view in Blu-Ray.
B003KUSUG8|1.0|I got this CD and at least 3 songs skipped. I returned it and got a credit
0307266303|4.0|I checked this book out from one of our public libraries because it looked intriguing.  I will say that for the most part, it was a fun read.  Very informative and entertaining.  The racing was exciting; the information on the Tarahumara Indians was facinating; the runners bizarre.  I appreciated the information on chia seeds, pinole, and barefoot/minimal shoe running.  But, I did have three issues with the book.    1.  I really don't like cursing - either in movies or books.  This is a personal thing with me, obviously, especially using the f-bomb.  I don't think it adds a thing to a book or movie.  However, since I am sure the author was directly quoting those who were speaking, there isn't much to be done about that.    2.  The chapter on evolution I wound up skipping after reading a couple of pages because it was so ridiculous that I couldn't stomache it.  So I skipped it, and it did not affect the rest of the book.    3.  There was no epilogue.  I would like to know what happened to Scott, Billy & Jenn, Barefoot Ted, the author, etc. after the race.  It just seemed to end so abruptly.    Otherwise, terrific book.
B003INBOEC|5.0|Probably the best Kung-Fu movie that I've seen. Some of the fight scenes literally made my mouth drop. None of that BS flyiing over treetop Kung Fu crap, just some very well choreohraphed fight scenes.
0061714372|5.0|Not much of a reviewer but here goes...  I love rock Bio's especially since The Dirt by Crue.  To hear of a Metal Bio with an Iconic personality such as Mustaine it was good to read and it filled in a lot of blanks and made me appreciate Megadeth more, I sorta gave up on them after Youthansia it was an Ok album, I tried them again with United Abdominations it was good but Endgame and this book are Killers!!!  Yes his voice isn't that spectular but neither was Jimi Hendrix or Lemmy from Motorhead but they've got their unique styles just like Dangerous Dave.    Definetely recommend this book excellent reading only downfall is that it was soo much fun to read and then it was all over, it coulda' been a bit longer.
B00104W8T6|5.0|I loved the movie and had to have the soundtrack.  Not an album to listen to constantly but very fun to listen to when you need a pick me up.  I love signing with the songs on the way to work.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I heard this show was good, but then I watched it and it was REALLY good, awesome show. Great actors, plot and all the setting. Only minus side wat that it was short. And it was definately nice to watch in HD, if you're able to watch it on blu-ray or DVD, pick the blu-ray edition. And also while you're at it get the movie Serenity too, it wraps this show up.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I am an across the board Foo Fighters fan meaning I enjoy all of their music. However I was compelled to purchase this because it is an accoustic performance. This is truly Foo Fighters at their best. It says a lot when a band can morph from their metal performance to a more mellow performance without skipping a beat. Dave Grohl as usual demonstrates his guitar skills as well as great vocal ranges. Taylor Hawkins is showcased in \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" and he gives a fantastic vocal performance. \\"Hero\\" is one of my favorites as it takes on a hauntingly smooth tone.If I could have changed anything it may have been the selection of songs on the CD. Before long I will have my collection completed. This will be a favorite.
B00005KARK|5.0|this was a difficult DVD to find.  we wanted it for my grandson.  to say it is outstanding and great aren't enough.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Every season this show gets better! This is the only TV series I have spent money on. I can re-watch episodes endlessly and they continue to knock my socks off. Hilarious. If you like quirky, awkward situations, and science-nerd humor, this is right up your alley!
B0026IQFS0|1.0|Now look: I am an avid reader. I enjoy from a light airy read to a dense thought-provoking novel. Words are no strangers to me. But the words Patrick O'Brian uses on his celebrated novels read like a notaries' account of a naval court-martial. There really should be an annotated version of this book so people eager to get into the series can be eased into the terminology. A previous reviewer suggested \\"skipping over\\" the dense nautical jargon, sound advice for some but I can't read in this fashion. I really wanted to love these books but I had to pause so many times to go look on the internet what the hell the man was writing about I gave up on the first 100 pages or so. Kudos to those that are into them (I envy you guys) but be warned: Mr. O'Brian uses a LOT of dense nautical terms to describe what's going on so disorientation sets in and doesn't leave (at least the first 100 pager or so, wouldn't know about afterwards). It's like trying to watch a french film with no subtitles, some non-french-speaking people may enjoy it but I'd rather understand what's going on.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This is truly an epic set. The packaging alone can keep you busy for hours, the 36 discs are filled to the brim with episodes that have never looked better and extras that are informative and fun to watch.    Definitely worth the money if LOST is your kind of show.
1400063515|4.0|Excellent and truly original book. Nevertheless I think that the best book by Nassim Taleb remains \\"Dynamic Hedging\\" that I read more than ten years ago and that opened the mind of several people, me included.
B003FSTN52|5.0|This is what you call great television! This show is smart and brilliantly written. They provide us with a good balance between the legal drama while also giving us a little insight into the life of Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) Give The Good Wife a chance and I doubt you will be disappointed. Amazing television indeed.

0393072231|5.0|One of the best writers of financial world presented a very clear picture of what goes inside the investment banks, focusing on the period just before the crash of 2007. A funny and complete story of how greed gave rise to the crisis and how fear of some people (Mike Burry, Jamie, Charlie and Eisman) helped them make a fortune from the greed of others. Big Short is about the mortgage business of 2005 - 2006 and Mike explains very well the inner complex functioning of exotic derivatives.    Reader will find how anyone by just being in some kind of business related to mortgage industry, no matter how remotely that business was associated with mortgage business, was making staggering amounts of money; how a stripper, strawberry picker or a nurse was given money to buy up to five homes without even asking their annual income.    Mike targets the rating agencies as according to him they had no idea of what they were doing and were asking investment banks to explain to them how to rate the securities investment banks were producing. So, it was like Goldman telling Moody's what rating Goldman's CDO deserved.    Mike connects all the stories in a great way and makes the book quick to read.
B000002UVX|5.0|Amazing album and a fascinating departure from earlier Hendrix. Blues meets psychedelic rock riffs.  If hadn't died we can only imagine the great stuff that was coming down the pipeline...
B003HLM2QO|5.0|This time I 'd like to be brief. This album follows in the footsteps of Black Rain Ozzy still packs a punch with this effort and then some!     From the onstart with Let It Die, Let Me Hear You Scream, & the f#*!!strange Soul Sucker, to the relentless rocker I Want It More (What fantastic riffs!)/etc..Scream is well worth more than another average effort from another vetran rocker!    Great all around effort by Oz & his latest band lineup of R. Blasko(bass), Tommy Clufetos(formerly w./Ted THE NUGE)(drums), new greek guitar sensation Gus G, and Adam Wakeman on the keys! Scream is just what it says/go get it & & let the the madness continue!

B001D2AYCI|5.0|This set includes a lot of fun with Black Sabbath's Paranoid. You should know the music already as this is a special edition with extras for the legion of fans that this classic Heavy Metal album enjoys. First, you get a remastered cd. It sounds as if the master tape has aged just a bit like all of us, but the remastering gives the music a firm foundation in the bass and drums. Nothing too spectacular here, but the cd sounds fine.<br /><br />The cream of this crop lies in the disc you play in your dvd player. There you get the choice of a higher sampling rate for the stereo mix or a higher sampling rate of the quadraphonic mix from 1970! The high resoloution stereo is really happening! You will hear a rounder, deeper version of the album. It sounds a lot like vinyl, just no pops or clicks! The highs are more extended, the bass goes deeper, and the dynamic range (the contrast between the quiet and loud sections of the music) is greater. There is just more jump to the music.<br /><br />The quad mix is a hoot! You never know where Ozzy will be singing in your surround set up. One on song his voice floated in the middle of the room! The guitars come at you from all sides as well. There is no real consistency to the mixes, each takes a different approach as to how to use the surrounds. The guitars are highlighted, Ozzy seems a little further back in the mix, but man it is FUN to listen to!<br /><br />But wait, there's more! Also included is a cd of alternate version to two of the songs and instrumental versions of the rest. Well, they are not versions, just the track with no vocals. These are amazing. You can hear the band so well, the little intricacies that you miss when the vocals are included are a lot of fun to listen to. The alternate vocals are worth skipping frankly, but the \\"backing\\" tracks are killer. Just try to not sing Paranoid or War Pigs with the backing tracks cranked!<br /><br />The set costs a bit, but if you love this album, purchasing the set is like giving the album a new shot of adrenaline. Buy, crank it, and listen loud.drenaline. Buy, crank it, and listen loud.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This is one of the only movies where I don't prefer the book it's based on.  I love this movie.  The actress playing Matilda manages to come across as very smart without being obnoxious and the other actors are great too.  This movie also sticks really closely to the book.  The only huge change is that it doesn't take place in England.
0674049160|5.0|Jane Austen scholar Patricia Meyer Spacks has written many books, but none so lush and lovely as Pride and Prejudice: An Annotated Edition. Not only will this beautiful annotated edition of Jane Austen's beloved novel look fabulous on your coffee table, but after reading it you will feel that you've come to understand Pride and Prejudice as you never have before.<br /><br />Dr. Spacks's definitions, descriptions, and clarifications of arcane words, Regency customs, and obscure passages add dimension to a novel that I have read over 22 times and thought I knew inside and out. But I was wrong. Take her annotation of this rather unassuming sentence in Chapter 4, for example: \\"With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Spacks explains that in this instance, dirty meant muddy. Thinking of how uneventful life in a semi-rural setting must be, she adds, \\"Aside from the arrival of the militia and of Wickham, virtually everything of significance that has happened in the novel so far has been psychological...\\" She then goes on to describe the states of mind in Jane, Elizabeth, Darcy and Mr. Collins as they interact with each other.<br /><br />In Chapter 2, Volume III, she introduces Michael Kramp's idea that Mr. Darcy's kindness to Mrs. Gardiner during Elizabeth's and the Gardiners visit to Pemberly is evidence of  the changing nature of England's social arrangements and that \\"the gap between new and old money is shrinking.\\" (p. 307)<br /><br />Dr. Spacks's new annotated edition provides an erudite commentary on Pride and Prejudice, refers to many scholarly sources, and includes a large assortment of images. As she explained in a recent interview with me: \\"we looked for images that were beautiful in themselves and that illuminated some aspect of Austen's period.\\"<br /><br />Her 24-page introduction explores the continuing appeal of Pride and Prejudice: that it is considered safe for teaching in school and appeals to both feminists and sentimental individuals who are attracted to a romantic English past. \\"It has also emerged clearly as a repository for and stimulus of fantasy, and thus possibly less safe than it seems. In the film versions...Darcy, romanticized, tends to turn into a Heathcliff figure, passionate, beautiful, and overwhelmingly physical.\\" Someone recently asked how this annotation of Pride and Prejudice differed from David M. Shapard's 2004 annotation. The Spacks volume comes in a lavishly color-illustrated, hardback edition, while Shapard's book was published as a trade paperback. Scattered thinly throughout its pages are a few black and white illustrations. Aside from the difference in physical appearance, Spacks's annotations are more scholarly<br /><br />Flipping through the first page of the novel, you can immediately spot the difference. Dr. Spacks, the Edgar F. Shannon Professor of English, Emerita at the University of Virginia, discusses the famous first sentence as material for a critical debate on the ambiguity of \\"want\\", whereas Dr. Shapard, an 18th century expert, emphasizes the introduction of two central themes of the novel, marriage and financial considerations. The two annotations are so different, that I believe there is room on the shelves for both of them.<br /><br />Jane Austen Pride and Prejudice: An Annotated Edition, edited by Patricia Meyer Spacks is a perfect gift for oneself and for a beloved friend or family member.

0312600844|5.0|The extremely polarized reviews illustrate how raw a nerve Franzen has touched. A more mediocre, less searing social commentary would tend to garner more tepid appraisals, or indifference.  But when people read Freedom, they seem to feel either uplifted or, alternatively, deeply offended, angered, contemptuous, or disgusted. And ironically that fact shows Franzen has captured our 21st century America quite well; we are a polarized nation, in something of a cultural civil war, with the two most recent presidents garnering either fierce criticism or adulation from their respective sides, but rarely anything in-between. It is no surprise that so astute a writer on American society as Franzen will garner a bimodal distribution of adulation and antipathy.    Personally, I'm in the camp that this is a great novel. It captures the cultural zeitgeist of our times and will be referred back to by future generations seeking insight to our times. Our own cultural narcissism makes some of us reject some of the warts on our proverbial face reflected by the mirror of this book; this flawed face is not mine, they say with their 1-star reviews, but the louder they yell, the more they belie that the face in the mirror is not some stranger's, but their own. Future generations will not feel so personally threatened, and thus will appreciate the book for what it is: a good read, which uses a healthy dose of a slightly absurd fictionalized America to reveal some mundane hard truths about current American society. Franzen once commented that there is no more autobiographical book than Metamorphosis, by Kafka. The implication being that by writing his main character as a cockroach, an absurd idea, Kafka could reveal much about man. Franzen doesn't go as far as Kafka, and certainly no cockroaches make an appearance, but some of the 'weaknesses' commented on by other posters, like the improbability of a midwestern nineteen-year-old being able to execute an arms sale in South America, for example, are in my mind similar, as a less severe example of the use of absurdity in fiction to reflect deep mundane realities.

B0044CBMXE|3.0|This was a very soft and fuzzy Bones episode.  The gang is all brought together again by attorney Caroline to save the medical coroner's job.  Everybody is very huggy, feely with one another and a body is resolved although it is definitely in second place in the episode.  The personal issues take precedence.  Bones and Booth still look in unrequited love to me although Booth met a new girlfriend while on duty abroad.  Absolutely no comedy in this episode, which is what I miss the most from the earlier seasons.
B000000OSE|5.0|Guns and Roses were on top of the world when they released USE YOUR ILLUSION I AND II on the same day (September 17th 1991) as separate CDs. While their debut, APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, remains their undisputed masterpiece, there are plenty of great songs on these albums although there's quite a few less than stellar tracks as well. In my view, I is better than II. It's got much more of an old-school rock n' roll vibe compared to APPETITE, sometimes accompanied by piano and harmonica. Singer Axl Rose is full of hate on most of these songs and revels in an extremely cynical attitude towards life in general. Izzy Stradlin takes lead vocal on three of the tunes, two of which are quite good.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Right Next Door To Hell\\" - Axl spews out the words on this amped-up rocker, not the greatest song but a good album opener. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Dust And Bones\\" - Izzy Stradlin on lead vocals with Axl wailing along as well. A laid-back rocker with a little boogie-woogie piano. It's a great song with strong guitar figures and a great chorus. *****<br /><br />\\"Live And Let Die\\" - Guns pulls off this great if somewhat disjointed Paul McCartney classic, giving it more heft and muscle. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Don't Cry\\" - a sweet melody and a great mix of balladry and rock with some killer guitar solos from Slash. *****<br /><br />\\"Perfect Crime\\" - It's not clear exactly what the \\"perfect crime\\" is in this super-charged rocker but it's intense and Axl delivers the vocals in overdrive, loading them with obscenities in the same super fast way he does it on \\"Right Next Door To Hell\\" as well as a few others here. Cool, but far from their best song. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"You Ain't The First\\" - This acoustic folk-rock waltz, a diss on a former lover, is a sing-songy countryish tune that isn't really bad although I imagine most fans, simply wanting to rock out, skip this one, including me. ***<br /><br />\\"Bad Obsession\\" - This old-school Southern rock n' roll chugger features (mouth) harp and piano. A good song about a familiar topic: drug addiction. ****<br /><br />\\"Back Off Bitch\\" - a good mid-tempo rocker. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Double Talkin' Jive\\" - The third track to feature Stradlin on lead vocal and it's good. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"November Rain\\" - the epic ballad, beautifully orchestrated, nearly nine minutes long. The video got heavy rotation on MTV back in the day, nearly 20 years ago. *****<br /><br />\\"The Garden\\" - a cool song with alternately dreamy and heavy passages. Axl shares some vocals with rock veteran Alice Cooper. Kind of mysterious sounding, this one's cool. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"The Garden Of Eden\\" - a fast-paced rocker with Axl blasting through his vocals and some spirited guitar playing. Throws in some spacey sound-effects (several of the songs on the album add interesting little sonic touches including vocals distorted to sound especially low-pitched). The lyrics are cool and I especially like how he trashes religion. The main problem is that the song itself isn't that great. ***<br /><br />\\"Don't Damn Me\\" - This one seems to be one of their least popular tracks but I think it's great. The lyrics are confessional and seem to come from the heart. I read somewhere they never played it live - Axl may have felt a little too vulnerable to sing it. At the end of the song he says, \\"that sucked\\" which may have been his way of discrediting it, but I think it's a great rocker with some killer guitar riffs as well. *****<br /><br />\\"Bad Apples\\" - a slightly funky, boogie-woogie-ish rocker ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Dead Horse\\" - this is my personal favorite song ever from \\"Buns & Hoses\\" (my joking, affectionate nick name for them). This one's a great song that really kicks ass. *****+<br /><br />\\"Coma\\" - Clocking in at over 10 minutes, this epic, heavy-rocking masterpiece is the highlight of the album. Apparently it's not available for download (legally at least) so that makes purchacing this hard copy essential. Starts out withwhat sounds like a heartbeat . . . \\"Hey you caught me in a coma/ And I don't think I wanna/ Ever come back to this . . . world again.\\" A hospital emergency room can be heard at various points with attempts to revive Axl. The song ends with him flat lining. Awesome! *****+. world again.\\" A hospital emergency room can be heard at various points with attempts to revive Axl. The song ends with him flat lining. Awesome! *****+
0143116738|4.0|There are lots of good stories in this book. E.g.:<br />Paul McCartney applies to join the choir of Liverpool<br />Cathedral - and is turned down. Not good enough as<br />a singer....<br />Really!<br />And it all points to the fact that society can't afford<br />to throw away people in the name of conformity. And people<br />can't afford to throw away their lives because they are scared.<br />Living your life as people did at the start of industrialism -<br />an era long gone - Really, it makes little sense.<br />Even though many people do exactly that.<br /><br />-Simon
B003VQM2LU|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers here - this is even better than the debut (excepting the hellacious \\"Get It On\\" and \\"No Pussy Blues\\" from that album). It's murky, atmospheric, heavy and grim with great lyrics from Nick Cave and music which perfectly compliments the words. Epic, cinematic. Fantastic guitar parts that shudder and erupt in surprizing places. And what a cool cover. Imagine walking into your living room and seeing that snarling wolf! A fitting image....great music, highly recommended!
B000TGCR38|3.0|Terrific acting and fast-moving plot: but, unfortunately, the prolonged and violently graphic torture scenes were too much for the average person to watch. Don't recommend this movie for the faint-of-heart.
B003S897UK|5.0|Got into the Mule about a year ago, no idea how i had not heard of these guys but so glad i have now....they are brilliant, great straight ahead rock, superb guitar , superb vocals and a rhythm section to die for....buy this album, buy all their albumns...you will not be disappointed...
B002ISID10|5.0|I bought this album when it was first released, and its still in my CD player and hasnt left it since I put it in there. Every single song on this album is distinct, and epic...Hey There Mr. Brooks being a perfect example. The mixing of genres is perfect. Not overdone, but just enough to be pleasing when they throw it in. The vocalist is one of the best I've ever heard. His range is amazing. Deep growls to screaming highs all within a single breath sometimes. Definitely one of the heaviest bands out today. Not a single song on this album dissapoints, and I can still listen from beginning to end every day singing along with every song and never get bored with it. This album will stay in my CD player until their sophomore effort comes out, and I gotta say...it just cant get it here fast enough. This band is here to stay.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I have been a fan of Glenn Hughes since i hear Burn back in  the 70's....(to me THE Purple line up is Hughes and Coverdale and anyone else)....i then got in to Trapeze and his sole releases and anything he has appared on like Phenomenon , Voodoo HIll, Brazen Abbott dn even the Sabs.....there is no better voice in rock....so why not put The Voice with a line up of same thinking guys with a pedigree as long as your arm..it was always going to work, great vocals, great guitar and a superb rhythm section ....this is 70's rock for the modern day....buy it and you will not be disappointed....lets hope they keep releasing albums like this...
B000BYA5GE|5.0|This is a very powerful an emotional moving movie about the international arms trade.It shows the raw reality that there will always be war and the political and morally bankrupt world we live in.Very well made movie!
1439181780|3.0|I loved The Secret, which I feel is a great book and message. The Power is just a remix of words of The Secret.

0307454541|1.0|How?  How has this book received such acclaim?  Actually won awards?!  Why do so many people who's opinions I typically respect rave about this?!! I just can't figure it out.  I found it not only a joyless bore, but aggravatingly absurd.  At this point I just need to vent...<br /><br />[Spoiler Alert] In case anyone still cares.<br /><br />Lisbeth - How on earth does she go from being a pathologically antisocial misanthrope with Asperger's the entire novel to a effortlessly social con-woman at the end of the book?  If she had the capability to pull this off why couldn't use a fraction of that ability to \\"con\\" the social welfare bureaucrats into believing that she wasn't a mute incompetent who couldn't handle her own finances without a public advocate?  Oh, and she's a super genius with a photographic memory (which she's ashamed of...how modest!) and \\"probably the best hacker in Sweden\\".  How convenient.  Her hacking abilities are so outrageously overblown that it would have been more believable if the author had just made her clairvoyant or telepathic or some such nonsense.<br /><br />Wennerstrom - The fact that this guy was the focus of probably 200 pages of the book but doesn't have a single line of dialogue is nonsensical.  He only exists as a vague, cardboard cutout of a character and a horribly developed and contradictory one at that.  He's a billionaire mastermind of a multi-national criminal syndicate who set up an ingeniously complex series of shell companies and off-shore accounts in which to hide his ill-gotten gains.  Oh, and he runs this all from a single laptop with 15 years of incriminating data on it which he also uses to download a lot of porn.  Yeah...  And, as another reviewer pointed out, this ruthless billionaire gangster is scared of financial reporter who works for a tiny magazine with a staff of 6 people whom he \\"battles\\" by trying to cut off their advertising dollars. Uh huh.<br /><br />Blomkvist -  Fairly obvious that he's the author's delusional conception of himself.  An aging, self righteous, leftist crusader who's still \\"fighting the good fight\\".  Inexplicably every female who crosses his path is unable to resist this smarmy, dullard's \\"humanity\\" and sleeps with him.  I guess this kind of makes sense considering just about every other male is either a Nazi, wife beater, power hungry capitalist pig,woman hating sadistic rapist or absurdly prolific serial killer.<br /><br />Technology references -  It seems like the author's reference material for technology subjects consisted of an electronics flyer and the movie Hackers.  There's pointless detail after pointless detail about what computer's they're using and manner with which they connect to the Internet.  I presume it's to add a modern \\"edge\\" to the story but it just comes off as a clueless attempt to sound in-the-know.<br /><br />Harriet - She's subjected to horrific ritualistic sexual abuse by her father and brother for an extended period of time, runs away, and grows up to be a wildly successful business woman and emotionally stable mother to an overachieving sun (Oxford AND Sydney Law!!).  Sure...whatever.<br /><br />I apologize as this more a rant than a review, but I just had to get it out.aging, self righteous, leftist crusader who's still \\"fighting the good fight\\".

B0036EH3WK|5.0|Quality of the box is really nice. Comes inside of shipping box wich comes with another black box which has the collection on the inside. Not as many secrets as I would have expected. Board game that comes with the game is a bit confusion when trying to play, comes with some rules but not nearly enough to understand the game. Overall a really nice collection box for Lost fans.
B00003CXCW|5.0|A true classic in every sense. Definitely one of the GOAT. It has two frequently quoted lines of dialogue, but SB is absolutely filled with great lines; sarcastic, caustic and painfully funny and true.  Movies have long been our culture's primary art form and this is clearly a masterpiece. I won't waste time re-hashing the plot - far better writers than me have already described it to great effect. I just want to list some of its reasons for it being so dead-on (sorry) perfect.    The opening is quite startling when we realize a corpse is narrating the story. Then it keeps getting stranger as it goes along. Joe's personal difficulties are firmly rooted in the reality all around us even though he works in the fantasy-producing world of Hollywood. But the instant he slides into Norma's driveway the entire perspective switches to surreal and eerie. Norma's house is a world unto itself and we already know it's a gigantic spider-web that poor Joe will never escape from. Right away, Joe is established as no more than a suitable replacement for a dead monkey. Only he doesn't realize it and thinks he's actually on top of the situation and is cleverly manipulating a crazy old woman with tons of $$$. But nutty though Norma may be, she's not stupid and her craftiness is on a level far above Joe's. She gives him a life of luxury but no cash, fully knowing he'd bolt if he had a couple grand in his pocket. Instead of the promised $500/wk he gets tailored clothes and expensive gifts. Even though he could pawn all this stuff and still make his escape he is in fact completely under Norma's spell and has no choice but to stay. Norma's not the only delusional one here - Joe is constantly kidding himself that he's a free man, albeit a sleazy one. In a real nice touch, she has him working on her atrociously-written screenplay for \\"Salome\\" (Joe's a ghostwriter in more ways than one) and we already know that poor Joe will eventually play the part of John the Baptist after all the veils are gone.  Once Joe mentions that she gives him half her winnings from the weekly bridge games with her old silent-film contemporaries, whom he cruelly describes as \\"The Waxworks\\". He has to hover at Norma's shoulder and fetch drinks and empty ashtrays and his biggest payday for this is 17 cents. The Waxworks are terribly disturbing to see. They don't appear fully alive or real, yet are obviously deeply sad and never speak on camera, just as if they're still frozen in their movies. It was a shock to recognize Buster Keaton (who I always enjoyed), and it turns out that the other two are equally famous silent-film stars that I was unfamiliar with. It's a small sample of Billy Wilder's genius to use these people and he employs similar tactics throughout SB. The story goes that Mr. Wilder never had very much to say about SB. If true, that could mean he expected it to be purely self-explanatory.     This movie is really a comedy with an appallingly grim sense of humor. The jokes are all strictly situational and are so bleak and so devoid of sympathy and so cynical and simultaneously so sad and pathetic that we're shocked and unsure if we should laugh. Maybe we should just cry instead. From the monkey's funeral, through the appearance of The Waxworks, to Norma's reaction at Joe's car being repossessed, to Norma batting a microphone away, to the revelation that only Norma's car is in demand and not her, to Max loyally preserving her illusion to the very last possible second on the staircase. It just goes on and on, non-stop like that the entire film - these are just a few examples off the top of my head, but there are many more. SB is so subtle and so well-made that it's an ideal DVD to own. Repeated viewings will always be rewarded with new insights and realizations and appreciation of the countless intricate details and deft touches. It's so sure-footed that there isn't a single misstep anywhere. All the pieces fit together seamlessly and form a startlingly high-quality finished product.    Norma is the sun that all the other characters orbit around and Gloria Swanson has come through with possibly the finest female role in film history. The reason is because it's human nature to relate to Norma on some level, I think. Man or woman, as we all age we will inevitably begin to feel outdated and left behind. Take even the most gorgeous 18-yr old and check back with her in about 40 years. But all the other actors are uniformly superb also. As fantastic as Miss Swanson is, William Holden holds his ground with her in every scene and is a perfect counterpoint for her. Joe is in fact a real scumbag but he still has a tiny trace of humanity left in him and it emerges at the end when he deliberately breaks Betty's heart in order to force her back to her fiance. Mr. Holden faultlessly conveys all Joe's cynicism and pathos and slimy opportunism and denial and abject self-loathing as well as his doomed attempt at redemption. Nancy Olsen is excellent as a naive, young, intelligent and ambitious girl who still believes in the power of love to redeem lost men. And her love does in fact reach Joe's deeply buried conscience. But we know it's too late. Believe it or not, the fiance is an uncharacteristically lively Jack Webb, who was strangely familiar yet unrecognizable to me. Last, but certainly not least is an absolutely incredible performance by Erich von Stroheim as Max, who can only express his limitless devotion to Norma by tirelessly enabling her and protecting her delusions. In him, we see exactly how terrifyingly powerful Norma's spell is (or maybe she only has a sharp eye for male weaknesses, of which there are plenty). Indeed, Max is her very first victim, whom she captured when she was only 16 and who has remained helpless in her grip ever since. After Max discloses his amazing secret, it gradually begins to dawn on Joe what grave danger he's in and that if he sticks around then he himself will one day replace Max, just as surely as he replaced the dead monkey. He attempts to break free and leave with only his original possessions, but we know it's way too late for Joe. His fate was sealed the moment he first arrived in Norma's bizarre realm.    Anyway, I can't recommend SB highly enough. Whether you rent or buy it (and you won't regret buying it), just make sure you see it and appreciate skilled and artistic filmmaking at its ultimate level.
B00006AW2G|5.0|How could anyone prefer The Beatles to The Rolling Stones after hearing this album? Classic Stones. That is all I need to say.
B00000G6PJ|2.0|I feel stupid. I bought this remastered version at the store the other day for almost twice the price of the un-remastered version, excepting better sound (and it also had nicer packaging). Boy, was I wrong. The remastering renders the album with almost no bass whatsoever. Really, I almost can't hear the bass guitar at all, except maybe on Submission, but it's still way too soft and flat even on that song. With no bass to hold the sound together, the guitars and drums end up sounding like noise coming from a cheap radio.    Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the music itself, but I'm thinking about returning this version for the earlier and cheaper Virgin CD, which I've heard is supposed to sound much more like the original LP. Some people may really like this remastered version (like the reviewers who gave it more stars) and that's great, but for me, it just doesn't work.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|The Zac Brown Band continue their upward ride to superstardom with this album. Features soon to be classics Let It Go, Whiskey's Gone, As She's Walking Away & Who Knows. Unfamiliar with the sound of the ZBB? Think of groups such as The Band, The Grateful Dead & The Dave Matthews Band. Zac Brown himself is a modern day Jerry Garcia. If you're a fan of late 1960s/early 1970s rock then this CD is for you. Do yourself a favor if you don't own [[ASIN:B001I10AAA The Foundation]]...order these albums together.

B0036EH3X4|5.0|I have been a follower of LOST from season 1.  There are so many speculations on what the plot was.  Where they in Hell?  Have they been dead this whole time?  NO!  they were an unlucky group of people that were choosen to take the spot of leader of the island.  And just so happens some crazy stuff goes down when you gotta take that role.  I thought the final season was great, it wasn't over done and for me it summed everything up perfectly.  If you are a fan of LOST I highly recommend watching this, but if you've never seen lost before you better watch the first 5 seasons or your the one that will be lost.

0060005696|1.0|The true Paradox of Choice is why did I continue to read this book through to the end?  This book is tedious and repetitive.  The author reiterates the same logic in chapter after chapter using the format of summarizing a study (that's not cited or referenced) and then offering his opinion.<br /><br />Summarizing the book: Choice is good;  Too much choice is bad.  Hmm... sounds like we could chart that on a bell curve.  I'm sorry the author had such a difficult time buying blue jeans - but don't waste your time on this one.
B00136Q2EI|4.0|Being a consumer of prog rock - as distinct from being a musician or a professional music critic - I naturally take a longer view of things. Pink Floyd is just one of the bands in my collection, though, like many people, I have their music indelibly entwined with much of my life experience. They have been a big part of my personal soundtrack ; the go-to band for existential blues, that also delivers a very serious message about chasing your dreams while you still have time.    For my purposes, the exit of Waters changed, but nowhere near \\"fatally wounded\\", Pink Floyd. When I turn down the lights and crank up 'Marooned', I have no doubt I am with Pink Floyd, doing for my soul what they always have. The message behind albums like 'The Wall' may have been Waters' doing, but, in the end,all that pain and distortion was someone else's problem, though massively and hauntingly presented as only PF can. If Waters took some kind of \\"depth\\" with him when he left, it was a depth that is a side road from the depth I need from this band, and which they continue to deliver in \\"The Division Bell\\".  And before too many of us start slinging the word 'dinosaur' around, consider Johnny Rivers, or The Righteous Brothers - words and music that transcend trendiness and break hearts just as soon as they become breakable, 60yrs and counting after the fact. To the extent that longevity and an enduring relevance makes you a 'dinosaur', I gladly apply that term to Pink Floyd. This is a concept album, about making the choice of either finding out who you are, or just sinking into the background with everyone else. That is a timeless contemplation that PF has been urging us to consider ever since The Dark Side Of The Moon.    \\"The Division Bell\\" is going to amaze - and deepen - us for a long time to come.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This is a great cd!  I also have the same songs on a cd by Abba and it isn't as good.  The young girl who played Meryl Streep's daughter has an amazing voice - probably the best of all of the cast.  Pierce Brosnan took a lot of criticism for his singing, but I thought he was just right for this part and the album.  Great CD!!

B002ZG99N6|5.0|I went into this movie knowing absolutely about it, there was little advance hoopla that I can recall, that usually accompanies a  major motion picture.<br /><br />The idea of mask wearing, semi automatic toting nuns at once seems invigorating and slightly surreal, but the viciousness, and sloppy impulse control of one of the robbers played brilliantly by Jeremy Renner (of Hurt Locker) immediately brings us crashing into  the reality of what's happening.<br /><br />These hardened  ruthless criminals hide behind a funny mask, and will eliminate anyone who gets in their way.  So they kidnap the attractive female bank manager played adorably by Rebecca Hall for leverage, and let her go.<br /><br />Upon checking her drivers license, and discovering she lives in their neighborhood, the psycho wants her eliminated to cover their tracks.

B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Once one of Hollywood's most famous and biggest talents, there's no denying that Mr. Shyamalan has hit a rough spot with his films recently.  To put it mildly, if your name appears in a film's trailer and people groan, you know things are bad.  However, there is hope for Mr. Shyamalan, as he proves with, \\"Devil\\" that he still has some great stories in him.    \\"Devil\\" is a supernatural horror/thriller/fable that follows five strangers who, on an ordinary day, enter a skyscraper, and get onto an elevator.  Shortly after, the elevator mysteriously stops, and they become trapped.  While the building's security crews (and a local detective) work to get them out, it soon becomes clear that things are not what they seem, and that one of the people in the elevator is none other then the devil, disguised in human form.    \\"Devil\\", despite not being directed by Mr. Shyamalan (he came up with the story and produced it), echoes his previous works by having a slow (but steady) pace, a heavy supernatural presence, and themes of ordinary people dealing with said supernatural presence.  And true to his previous films, there's a very low reliance upon visual effects, as most of the film is shot practically, instead relying on tension, story, and characters to catch our attention, rather then flat out gore and violence (though there is a good amount of that as well).      Ultimately, \\"Devil\\" succeeds in its reliance on storytelling and characters.  The people in the film are interesting, and act believably, considering the circumstances they find themselves.  Watching them starting to get at each others throats doesn't feel forced at all, and as you learn more about the people in the elevator, you get even more interested in them.  But in my mind, what truly sets \\"Devil\\" apart from other similar horror films is the final fifteen minutes.  While I can't go into any details without spoiling anything, I will say that as I watched the film, I really had no idea how it could end, and whenthe climax and ending come around, I thought it was refreshingly different and satisfying from similar horror films.       Overall, for a low budget horror film, \\"Devil\\" is really good B movie (even with the infamous, \\"TURN ON THE LIIIGGGGHHHHTSSSS!\\" quote).  I left the theater feeling very satisfied, and would definitely recommend it to fans of the supernatural/horror genre.  Don't let Mr. Shyamalan's name scare you away from this film, as it proves he still has some spooky ideas left in him.
0735619670|5.0|The focus of Code Complete is software construction, i.e. the coding part of software development. As Steve McConnell notes in the preface, \\"construction is the only activity that is guaranteed to be done\\". You can skip almost any step (requirements, testing etc), but if you don't write any code there is not going to be any software.<br /><br />I bought my copy of the first edition of Code Complete in 1997, and I was immediately fascinated. I had never read anything like it before - a book that concentrated on the actual writing of the code. For example, it had a whole chapter on if- and case-statements, and another chapter on the naming of variables. I had no idea there was so much to learn about these seemingly straight forward activities. It was immediately useful to me, and I started to apply as much as I could of what I learnt from it.<br /><br />Although it concentrated on coding, it covered a broad spectrum of activities around coding, from requirements and design to testing, debugging and optimization. It also had a great reference section with suggestions of further reading in the area of software engineering. This became my starting point for finding lots of other good books to read, like [[ASIN:0932633439 Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams  (Second Edition)]] and [[ASIN:0201657880 Programming Pearls (2nd Edition)]].<br /><br />So this summer I decided to re-read this seminal book, partly to see what's new in the second edition, and partly to see if still think it is such a great book.<br /><br />To answer my own question - yes, it is still the number one book on writing code. It is near encyclopaedic in its coverage of the nuts and bolts of programming. There are chapters on the naming of variables, on organizing straight-line code, on conditionals, on loops, on lay-out, on good commenting and on how to write good methods.<br /><br />In it, there are frequent references to scientific studies that support the advice given in the book. For example, how long should variable names be? Instead of just giving us his opinion, McConnell summarized the findings of several scientific studies on the subject.<br /><br />Each time there is reference to a study, there is a little \\"hard data\\" symbol in the margin. There are other symbols in the margin as well, \\"Coding Horror\\" for code examples of what not to do, and \\"Key Point\\" for, well, key points. The margin is also used for cross references to other chapters, and for quotes related to the subject discussed. For me, this works really well. It is both useful and makes the text easier to read. In general, the book is very well laid out.<br /><br />Some of my favourite advice from the book (all of which I remember from reading the first edition) are:<br /><br />Chapter 7.1 Valid Reasons to Create a Routine - for example: Reduce complexity, Introduce an intermediate understandable abstraction, and Avoid duplicate code (there are 6 more valid reasons in this chapter). The second part of the chapter is called Operations That Seem Too Simple to Put Into Routines and contains a great example of why it can be good to put even a one-line calculation in a routine - the code becomes more readable, and small operations tend to turn into larger operations.<br /><br />Page 172 (and 264 for variables) Use opposites precisely. When naming \\"opposite\\" methods and variables, be careful to use the correct pairs, like add/remove, begin/end, create/destroy etc. This makes the relationship between them clear and obvious.<br /><br />Page 433 Break complicated tests into partial tests with new boolean variables. This is such a simple thing, but it makes the code a lot more readable.<br /><br />Page 754 \\"Make the incompleteness of a statement obvi\\". For example, when breaking up a logical and over two lines, end the first line with && - that way, it is clear that the statement continues on the next line.<br /><br />Even though the book truly is great, there are a few things to complain about. In the first edition, the chapters on layout and comments came right after the chapters on the different control structures. But in the second edition, these two chapters have been moved further back. To me, that doesn't make sense, since they too are related to how you actually write your code. Now there are chapters on testing, debugging, optimization and refactoring in between.<br /><br />And talking about refactoring: while this is an important subject, I don't feel the chapter on refactoring is particularly good. This chapter is new in the second edition. The summary of refactoring is OK, but a good part of the chapter consists of just listing different kinds of refactorings.<br /><br />Overall though, the second edition is a nice face lift. The code examples are now mostly in Java, C++ or Visual Basic (in the first edition they were in Pascal, C or Ada). But since all the major themes of the book were already present in the first edition, it does not make a big difference if you happen to read the first edition instead of the second edition.<br /><br />Code Complete is thick - 862 pages (not counting the bibliography and index). If that feels like a lot to read, then I suggest you start by just reading one or two chapters, for example \\"Using Conditionals\\" or \\"Layout and Style\\". They (and pretty much any chapter in the book) can easily be read without first reading the preceding chapters, and these will give you a sense of what you can expect from the other chapters. Even if these are all you read, you will still get a lot of value from the book.<br /><br />However, if you are a programmer and care about how you write code, you owe it to yourself to read the whole book. It is considered by many (including me) to be the best book available on programming, and it will almost certainly make you a better programmer. Highly recommended.he first edition, the chapters on layout and comments came right after the chapters on the different control structures.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|Very comfortable watch. I love it..I dont like the fact that it needs to be reset after you leave it off for a day or two...It is self winding by motion....This is the only negative...I would rather a battery.
0345505387|2.0|Meh.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much since I have been seeing the samples and following the discussion for months about the book.  I enjoy graphic novels and wanted to know more about Murtagh, my favorite secondary character.  I thought that the $13 pre-publication price and free shipping offer was a good deal.<br /><br />Now that I have the book in my hands, I'm underwhelmed.  For starters I wasn't expecting a hard cover book of on the small side.  All the artwork I had seen and handled was 8-1/2 by 11, so I was expecting a full-size, soft-cover graphic novel similar to most of the other graphic novel I own.  The hard cover and full-color pages would explain the $25.00 cover price.  Most of my soft-cover graphic novels are priced lower, but they aren't full color.<br /><br />I finally came to accept Claire's breasts falling out all over the place as an attempt to convey a sense of how sluttish she must have appeared to the 18th-century characters.  Fair enough, I can live with that.<br /><br />What I couldn't accept was the inconsistency of the drawing of the characters.  If you compare the first pages of the book with those at the end, you wonder if you are looking at the same characters or whether they are drawn by the same artist.  By the middle of the book, all the characters blur together to the point it is almost impossible to tell one from another.  Except Claire, of course.  She's the one with the breasts spilling out of her dress.  The men look like some kind of elf kin.  Now and then a beard or distinctive article of clothing gives a clue, but usually not, and not enough.<br /><br />In spite of the fail, props to Diane for being willing to try something different.<br /><br />Didn't love it, didn't hate it, just meh.
0345505387|5.0|This is not the common place \\"novel\\". Merely a different format.  And I LOVED it! I am really hoping to see more of her books done like this. I would snap them up just like I did her others.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Sons of Anarchy season 1 is awsome.  Katey Sagal is a strong lead along with Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman.
B0012GVKW8|3.0|This is one of the coolest movies of all time in my opinion. Great suspense and great action. Arnold is great in this flick. The only problem I have with this movie is that they did a real poor job of remastering this movie for Blu-Ray. I'm hearing of that alot on these older films. Seems like there just not taking the time and effort into upgrading properly. It's a real shame, because wouldn't it do movies like this justice for full blown awesome picture and sound?
0345505387|5.0|This is the first third of Outlander, from Jamie & Murtagh's POV. It was really funny to see more of Jamie's thoughts; it made me giggle several times. And what's really cool is there's a new little side story involving his godfather Murtagh. Nothing that adds any new mystery or big plot, just a nice little behind-the-scenes type thing.<br /><br />As for the artwork? Loved it. The scenes are really beautiful, and the artist did a really good job with Claire (though of course it being a graphic novel, she's more busty than I picture). Jamie didn't really match what I picture in my head, but honestly, I don't even think a real human being anywhere could match what I picture in my head for Jamie. I can't think of a single famous person to point to and say \\"Yeah, close to that.\\" I'm guessing that's how plenty of Outlander fans feel though, and since I can't even think of a real-life model for Jamie, I don't mind that he doesn't look close to my ideas in the graphic novel. The male characters looked a little similar, but they're supposed to - they're mostly all related. After the first couple pages it I didn't notice it as much.<br /><br />If you love Outlander, you'll probably really enjoy this. Especially if you're craving anything Diana Gabaldon, which I always am.
B003FVI2KQ|4.0|I build my machines mainly for home theature and gaming.I upgraded mother board and cpu to do away with hp and all them other pc oem builds charging way to much for repairs and doing away with tatoed components that leave you no choice but to stick with there 3-4 times overpriced hardware.They wanted 400 dallars for a mb and another 300 for a seagate 720gb hard drive.Funny that I can pickup the same hard drive with 1tb capasity for about 100 bucks.But all in all F oem systems custom is by far better and less expensiv in every aspect I built a dreem machine for that price.But to get back to the point I changed out my AMD quad core and so far playing crysis which is one of the most demanding games it plays at full game settings plus extra downloadable enhanced graphics at full with no hick ups.I would have rated it 5 stars but the cooling fan is crap.It is loud.It say warranty is void if you change the heatsink and fan but it is not a veary good cpu fan.At idle it runs around 40-50c and fan is just screeming all the time half to leave the door of my case off.No biggie Got a cooler master v-8 on the way.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|I had been a hot and cold fan of the series, and only returned at the start of this last season.    If you are/were a fan, the story of Betty moved beyond the PRADA/TELENOVIA concept beautifully in my opinion. The actors are pitch perfect, and I believe the dialogue zings better than WILL AND GRACE,to drag in a comparative show.  The images of women, women of color, gays, Latinos, Latinas, teenagers, all wrapped in New Yawk and Manhatten Madness is very very satisfying.    I got all the seasons, and have strung out finishing off Season Last/Four, and the bonus material, because its hard to say goodbye to Betty and her dreams to become her own woman, on her own terms (this is supposed to be tv fodder)....I will miss her family, her loves, her co-workders.  Erica Kane move on out, 'cause Wilhemena rocks this almost-night time soap, and Mandy and Mark deserved their own show.    Great wrap up, from a devoted fan, waiting for a movie version, this series can catch you up and wrap you up in going for your dreams, dreaming big, acting big and accepting who you are in a fun, bitchy, campy, poncho-wearing, braces off way.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Hi, I bought the Will and Grace complete series pack. Every single DVD I have watched so far gets stuck and my player cannot read the disk. I have tried 3 different DVD players and have the same problem. I end up missing atleast 2 episodes on every DVD. I bought a new product, the collection is not used... DVDs do not have any scratches.     Please be careful when buying this product. You might miss atleast 6 episodes in each season !!!!

B002VECLVO|4.0|Colin Firth should have gotten the oscar for this role.  The story was a microscopic investigation into pain and loss, and his underplayed angst was spot on.  The details were impeccable in re-creating an era ( I was there first hand) The examination of great loss and pain played out privately was heart-wrenching, and of anything since A Beautiful Mind, a reminder of the courage of the human spirit.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Before I begin an actual review of this album, I need to give you a little bit of history so you know where I'm coming from in my review of this album. I'm 18-years-old and I don't listen to rap music. I've dappled in the occasional listening here and there, but (until recently) I'd never even heard a song by Lil Wayne or any other rap superstar...And I've never listened to any old-school rap enough to even give you an educated opinion about it. However, when the [[ASIN:B00004T9UF Marshall Mathers Lp]] dropped when I was in third grade...I bought it. [[ASIN:B00006690G The Eminem Show]] was my favorite album for a couple years and even Encore was a favorite of mine for sometime. After I burned myself out on that album, I lost interest in Eminem and all rap. When [[ASIN:B00192M9FC Relapse]] came out last year, I was not even slightly intrigued to check it out...Now, Eminem's new album Recovery is unavoidable. I heard \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" on the radio in a friend's car at a very low volume and picking up on some of what Eminem was saying, nostalgia lead me to check out this album...And now, here's my review;    You won't find any rap artists, Pink!, or Rihanna in my iPod and, honestly, the music found on this album is basically the opposite of what you would find. While this album is being well-received, some have made comments that Eminem has sold-out. Yes, the skits that littered previous albums are gone, this album is certainly more accessible than his previous albums, and yes it does feature guest appearances by pop superstars on it...But the Eminem that everyone knows and loves is still here and, quite frankly, the man is at the top of his game. It's usually fair to say that drugs inspire great music, but the clean and sober Eminem has produced an album that rivals his greatest work. It's poppy, yes and it's nowhere near as dark as The Marshall Mathers LP or as playfully morbid as The Slim Shady LP, but it still has the same rage, wit, emotion, and brilliance that made classic Eminem so appealing to the world.    I've listened to the album all the way through several times now and have listened to some of the individual songs over forty times and there is not a misstep on this album. Ditching the accents that plagued (what I've heard of) Relapse and utilizing several producers throughout the album, Eminem gives us 17 tracks that are all (in my mind) instant classics. I want to sort of go through my thoughts on each track, but I don't want to repeat the same repetitive drivel about each song (\\"brilliant lyrics!\\" \\"catchy!\\" etc.), so I'm going to try to break this down a bit.    Eminem's talent as a lyricist is undeniable, even if you're not a fan of the genre or are offended by the bulk of what he writes...But his skill at telling a story in rhyme and expressing inner angst/frustration is unmatched. Admittedly, the album's 17 tracks deal with a man who wants to put all his demons out on the table. There are a couple of fun, catchy songs here (On Fire, W.T.P., So Bad, and Untitled) that are basically built on punchlines (although Untitled has enough anger and morbidity to satisfy an Eminem fan looking for that); but most of the songs deal with love/relationships, his inner turmoil/drug addiction, and the death of his best friend and fellow rapper Proof. Most of the tracks deal with each issue at least once in passing and the track \\"Going Through Changes\\" (which samples a Black Sabbath song) discusses the former two issues at the same time.    The song \\"Cold Wind Blows,\\" which opens the album, teeters between radio-single, punchlines, and personal issues and is one of my favorite tracks on the album still. It shows, right off the bat that Eminem is back. \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\" is relatively humor-free, being one of the most personal tracks on the album. The chorus is sung by someone named Kobe. I have no idea who Kobe is, but his presence on the chorus adds to the poignancy of the song. It's a great track.    Sandwiched between \\"On Fire\\" and \\"W.T.P\\" is \\"Won't Back Down,\\" featuring Pink! Eminem added her repetitive chorus to the song as an afterthought and, the more I listen to this song, the more I feel it works. This song is a monster, an absolute classic that illustrates why Eminem is considered a rap icon and is no longer just a \\"white rapper.\\" His rapping on this track is superb. It's in-your-face, brilliantly written, and simultaneously dark and hilarious. The chorus by Pink! seems to come from a different song and the way that it quickly shifts from that to Eminem rapping is why I feel it works so well; it makes the impact that much more hard-hitting. If this isn't my favorite track on the album, it is the one I've listened to the most...It's infectious.    \\"Not Afraid\\" is the album's first single, I believe. You've no doubt heard it, but I have to mention how well-produced and performed this single is. The anthemic chorus and deeply personal verses (in which Eminem discusses his distaste for his last album and his devotion to his fans) makes this a truly powerful musical statement. It's not the same Eminem who once did the song \\"Kill You,\\" but it's a mature and still effective version of that rapper.    It's after this track, that the subject matter in Eminem's lyrics begins to grow overly familiar with seemingly every song being a sort of sister-song to one previously heard on the record. For many artists, this would make the second half of their album repetitive and unoriginal...It's an affirmation of Eminem's talent that this is not the case. Even when discussing essentially the same thing, his lyrics don't lose their biting wit and venomous rage and his skill at writing a catchy song doesn't disappear either.    \\"Seduction,\\" \\"Space Bound,\\" and \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" are a sort of trio of songs. \\"Seduction\\" has Eminem rapping about stealing someone's girlfriend, while the latter two tracks show the darker side of Eminem's romantic relationships. \\"Seduction\\" shows Em on top of his game as a rapper and is a really fast-paced, great song. \\"Space Bound\\" took a while to grow on me. There are some unique female vocals on the chorus that took awhile to get used to, but really fit the song quite well. It's in the vein of \\"Crazy in Love\\" from Encore, but probably better...It's basically a sister-song to \\"Love the Way You Lie,\\" the monster-hit from the album featuring Rihanna. I'm not a fan of Rihanna, but a song about an abusive relationship is certainly an interesting place to see her lending her voice. Furthermore, this is probably the most accessible song Eminem has ever recorded. Despite wanting to be a non-conformist, I can't deny how great this track is. The lyrics are blunt, but brilliant and Eminem's emotional, blunt delivery makes it pack a punch. While I wasn't big on Rihanna's input at first, I've grown to accept it, and I can't deny that this is a great song. Will it be a classic years down the road? Probably not, but let's be honest...Who still regularly listens to \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" and \\"My Name Is?\\"     The song \\"25 to Life\\" would be grouped in with the above songs until the final line of the song, which features a better twist than M. Night Shyamalan has written in years. To fully realize the brilliance of this track, one needs to look at the lyrics and then re-read them. Eminem outdoes himself here.    The track \\"No Love\\" features Lil Wayne, whom I mentioned earlier in this review. I'm not a fan of rap music and don't listen to Lil Wayne. This song does not make me want to go listen to Lil Wayne, but I still can't deny that this is one of my favorite tracks on the album. It also samples one of the cheesiest songs known to man (\\"What is Love\\") and, in doing so, improves upon it. Lil Wayne's rap begins slow, but once it picks up he spits fire...Eminem is not one to let himself be outdone on his own record though. Eminem has said he can't sing, but when he does \\"sing\\" he picks the correct moments to do so and his singing on the chorusof this track is perfect...But it's his rap that makes me come back to this song. The flow is brilliant and the lines referencing Kanye West's moment with Taylor Swift is brilliant. I love this track.    \\"Cinderella Man\\" has, by far, the most infectious beat on the record. The track didn't hit me instantly, but it's now a track I frequently find myself coming back to. \\"Almost Famous\\" has a strange female voice similar to the one on \\"Space Bound\\" (which come to think of it, may not even be a female voice) which, once again, takes some getting used to...But the track is terrific. The anger present is seething and infectious...And the line about David Carradine...Ooo.    The last \\"official\\" track on the album is \\"You're Never Over,\\" a song completely dedicated to Proof. It's obvious that Proof's death had quite the impact on Eminem and he does his best to express that here. The track is a touching tribute and one that would no doubt make the late rapper proud...It's a five-star track, but it's not one I'll personally be putting on repeat.     To summarize the rather substantial amount of writing I've done, Recovery is a true comeback album for Eminem. I always saw The Eminem Show as his magnum opus, but due to how constantly that album was played in my younger years (along with his other albums) it's really hard for me to compare this record to those last ones...So I won't. On it's own, Recovery is a triumph, showing an artist who has truly risen to the top of his genre to produce 17 tracks that'll rival any other album this year from any artist from any genre. Eminem may be older and (a little) more mature, but his talent as a rapper and lyricist is unchanged. I could rave about this album for several more paragraphs and comment on how the album's title is not only a statement about Eminem's sobriety but also parallels with him rising again to the top of the rap genre, but I'd rather just sum up my unadulterated thoughts on this album in five words: Honestly, this album is brilliant.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|This DVD version includes many action scences saved away from cinema audiences. For instance, Robin pinning a French commander against a barn door with arrows, demanding to be told an important plot point; Robin 'down with the kids in the hood' teaching them a thing or two about survival; Like Kingdom of Heaven before it the director's cut MAKES the film come together. Marshall (William Hurt) tells Robin some home truths about his past and it now makes perfect sense why he shouts 'Longfellow' before the final battle scenes. Also Robin gets to tell the Sheriff of Nottingham where to go too.   The French trying to land on English shores is pure novelisation and is just to have some artistic licence but it is true that a larger attempt was made by the French in 1215/16 so 'it could have happened' and who knows what the ships of the day looked like?  The setting of this tale in a period before the Magna Carta was finally signed by bad old King John in 1215 is a masterstroke. So King John does not sign anything in this version as the year is around 1200 so it does not conflict with history, as he was known to be very reluctant to give the people a charter of rights. Don't be surprised if Robin Hood 2 gets made next year just to finish off the tale and introduce the Robin Hood of Legend to a brand new audience. This wss simply a fun movie which sets up the political backdrop, provides plenty of action and lots of plot to set up an even better action sequel...with a final signing off from King John. Mark my words!

French cooking takes a while, but it is so worth it.  My husband cannot get enough of it........every day I hear, \\"Is Julia helping you with dinner tonight?\\".   Don't be surprised if your friends start dropping by to say hello around dinner time.  I highly recommend Mastering the Art of French Cooking Volume I and Volume II.

B001HN6940|1.0|Burton trashes all that Louis Carrol built and makes his own contrived action/adventure version. Alice was never about the action, the cliched dialogue, or the stereotypical plot. Burton simply plugged a hollywood formula into the characters and environment and what we end up with is the same old crap. Because it's colorful and flashy, however, it's still going to attract all the kids and their parents, but any thinking, discriminating individual will see right through the charade. Boy has Timothy Burton fallen far from his own tree. If only he had picked up this project right after making Edward Scissor Hands, we would be talking about a masterpiece of a movie; instead we get an uninspired, white bread excuse from him when we all know that whole wheat is better. This book was written for Tim Burton, and somehow he managed to screw it up royally. All the madness, illogical, backward, upside down attraction of the book is made completely logical; WONDERLAND ISN'T SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE! and yet in this case it does, and ultimately that's what kills it.

1439181780|5.0|This is a great book, fantastic reading; at least for anyone in search of some answers about how life works. In reality, this book is a simplified compendium of information gathered from many sources. Rhonda is not discovering hot water or the wheel, but I give her full credit for her capacity to convey the - at times - complex information found in the Bible into something much lighter. She even cites the Bible (Jesus, Paul, etc.) more often than The Secret, which means that she's not afraid (finally) to express her beliefs, or at least, her respect for the original source of all this information. Personally, that validates the information provided even more than just citing a whole bunch of people that, sometimes, cannot really serve as an example. To expand on this, Rhonda cites Prantice Mulford on The Power and Health section, and also Josiah Gilbert Holland. The first one lived for only 57 years and died during his sleep while the second one died at the age of 62, also of natural causes. This is not too encouraging, is it? However, the information provided remains quite valid, and for that, I can personally attest. My grandmother lived through 101 summers, and she did it because of her notion that health (or lack of) is in your mind. At 90 she was still cooking and cleaning the house, and God forbid anyone would even dare to ask her to seat and rest. Her broom would harshly bounce off your rear! She only stopped cooking and cleaning around 95 when her vision \\"failed\\" her at that age and started to suffer from cataract. Fondly and jokingly I would call her \\"vieja\\" (Old Lady) and with the wisdom of her experience, she would simply look at me, smile, and reply, \\"At least I've made it this far. Let's see the young ones coming behind\\". For some odd reason, that statement sent chills down my spine. She even gave the whole family a serious scare in three occasions when after ending up in the Emergency Room with the doctors advising us to \\"expect the worse\\" and the priest bathing her in Holly Water, my beautiful \\"vieja\\" would come back to life hours later, go back home, feeling hungry (as always) and joking and laughing on how she was able to cheat death, once more. When she finally died, she did it on her own terms. She died because she just got tired of living, not because an illness of any sort. She was the living example of everything Rhonda mentions on The Power. In a nutshell, this book is a must-read if you find yourself feeling pity for your own miserable life, or your lack of health, or because you can't get off the poor house, or because can't find the right person in your life, or many other things. The tricky part is to consistently apply the wonderful information that is being given; that's all. But if you do, trust me, you'll make it out of whatever negative situation you may be in right now. Now I'm making it big time, my life is changing for the best. I'm achieving a great status as an artist (painter) in Hawaii, and all of that after some tragic events that caused me great sorrow. I did it thanks to the Bible and the immense amount of information contained in it, but The Secret and The Power, helped me confirm, in a more comprehensible and direct language, that God made you to be as great as your own limitations impose, and those limitations only exist in your mind.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is a classic.  Very entertaining.  And it arrived in a most timely manner.  Charley
B0000258CK|5.0|How could anyone have any music without this LP.  The Vocals and the songwriting will never be match again. Almost ever song was a hit by Ms King or others.  This LP stayed on the Billboard top 100 for years. The 1st time I had Tapestry was on 8 track.  Having it on 4 different formats, this is the 2nd cd(wore out after years of abuse), I have had.  This was the 5th time for me to get this classic.  How could I write a fair review?
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I actually bought this game after being introduced to it by some friends awhile back.  The game is great if you're looking for a game Risk or Monopoly but don't want to spend 4+ hours playing.  There is a bit of a learning curve for the rules but playing a few games takes care of that.    My only issue with version 4 of Settlers is that the pieces for constructing the map don't fit well on carpet.
1577314808|1.0|There are good and new ideas in this book. Unfortunately, what is good is not new. And what is new is not good..
0312370849|3.0|The story in this book is quite good and it does grip you. My only dislike was that I felt I was reading a book for teenagers. The writing is so simplistic and predictable, made me wish the author was more genuine and elegant in her writing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a 20 minutes work out for women like me with small kids that don't have much time but want to be in shape. I love this CD and I highly recommend it.
0679805273|5.0|Typically this book makes a great graduation gift, be it high school, college or some other similar milestone. It easily speaks to those who are setting sail out into the world. I read this book for the first time many years after I last graduated from anything so it's a testament to this timeless story that I was surprised how much 'Oh, The Places You'll Go' was relevant to my life at present.<br /><br />As I write this review I am currently unemployed during the Great Recession. I'm optimistic for the future but, to borrow from the book, I've come down from the Lurch and now I'm in a Slump. This is not a fun place to be though I'm sure it will define me for the rest of my life, good or bad.<br /><br />If you're thinking about giving this book as a gift, and you should, don't forget to read it again yourself. You'll be surprised how much it's speaking to you now.

I even went into the bakery while visiting NYC and the three items I tried were phenomenal! <3 <3 <3    I highly suggest this cookbook!    *and to those of you complaining that they use spelt. . .the title says (MOSTLY) gluten free. sheesh! give them a break! their recipes are AWESOME!
B003S897U0|5.0|This is an incredible CD!    If you only own one Black Crowes CD this should be the one to own!!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show is amazing. It's sexy, luscious, addictive, raunchy, with lots of nudity. Sexist, and racism, and Vampire Rights are front and center. They don't shy away from any controversy. Actors are all gooooood looking and the story makes it hard to put down.  about the DVD set - excellently packaged, came on time ,no complaints.  About season 1 VS season 2. I definitely liked Season 1 a LOT. It was very personal, home town feel, compared to season 2. In season 1 HBO really took their time with every scene, making you REALLY feel the emotion in each scene. Most memorable was when Sookie was eating Gran's pie. You REALLY felt the pain there. Season 2 in comparison is a mish mash of a lot of events that happen in about a course of one week. In each episode Sookie is almost killed and Bill rescues her. It's totally less personal and most of it takes place in Texas or on a ranch somewhere. Most of the season Bill and Sookie barely talk. In each episode Bill exposes his fangs and hisses at someone, to protect Sookie. The 1st 2 or 3 times you saw that, you liked it. But when it's in EVERY DARN episode of season 2, it's just rediculous to the point of comedy.  So if you're going to buy ANY season of True Blood. Season 1 is IT baby! it's the ticket.
B003ELOQD4|2.0|I saw this show in Tampa, an unforgetable performance.  Unfortunately as others have noted, the quality of this video is simply sub-par and nowhere near HD/BD quality.  Save your money and catch them live before they get really old.
0316098337|5.0|What a captivating read. This was a book not to be missed. The other reviews give so much of the book away, I will only say that the book is filled with intrigue, excitement, drama and a story that was a super read.
B001HN6940|1.0|I rarely write reviews but I think that Hollywood has been so grossly absurd in this situation that I cannot stay quiet. A whole generation of kids are going to grow up thinking that this film is the story of Alice In Wonderland when it absolutely positively is not. This is a newly created SEQUEL. where Alice has grown up and finds out that she misheard all of these years ago, and it's actually \\"Underland.\\" Okay fine, that makes for somewhere to go with a story. But had they named this \\"Alice In Underland\\" it would be clear that this is not the original, classic story that kids should be familiar with. This is a movie that can accompany that movie/book as a supplemental piece of entertainment. But no, for some reason, Hollywood decided it would sell more tickets, and Blu-Rays, and DVDs if they misled everyone with the title \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" It is deceptive and unethical. Just as naming a movie about Kung Fu \\"The Karate Kid.\\" To purchase or support this movie in anyway is to encourage this sort of behavior. So I highly recommend letting this one go by. You're not missing much, you and your kids won't be any worse for it. Otherwise, we could soon be watching a version of the Velveteen Rabbit named \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" but it's about a rabid badger made of polyester with bloodlust who drives a hot air balloon.

B0000062S0|4.0|Not Zeppelin but didn't expect it to be. Page and Plant still worked well together on this album and it is overall a well done collaboration.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|This third album encapsulates everything that Maroon 5 is all about: catchy melodies that make you want to dance, lyrics that force you to sing even if you don't have an A class voice, and of course - the songs that make a girl's heart flutter!    Similar to previous Maroon 5 albums, Hands All Over has a variety of both mid-tempo songs and slow ballads, nevertheless ALL QUALITY SONGS!!! So far, my favourite song has to be \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\".    I've had the pleasure of seeing this band live back when they toured Australian in 2008... and I can't wait till they come back and perform songs from this album! This album is a must for veteran Maroon 5 fans... and if you're not yet one, then this album should persuade you to jump on board with us!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|LOTS is an amazing TV show!  I read all the books and even though the show is different I still loved it!  I can't believe they probably won't make a season 3 with all the horrible shows they run on TV!  However, even if there is no season 3 its still worth watching because its a great show!  The actors, effects, storylines, and locations are all amazing- it was like watching a great movie every week!
B002ZG98VE|1.0|This is an absolutely hilarious film, except for the fact that the violence is repetitive and tedious in the extreme. But aside from that, this is an unintentional parody to end all parodies. Pretty much everything in the detail is wrong - indeed, a list of historical errors would require a small book - and the acting is wonderfully bad in all respects.  The script seems to have been assembled more or less at random from pages torn from a Boys Big Book of Comic Heroes or perhaps there was no script at all.  At any rate, if anyone was actually paid to write this rubbish, they should hand the money back immediately.<br /><br />There's really not much more to say about this utter nonsense except that the sound quality is as poor as the direction, which in turn is as poor as the \\"mood lighting.\\" I can highly recommend this atrocious waste of money as an excellent anti-insomnia treatment, but I can't imagine why any sane human would waste more than two hours of precious life sitting through this abjectly dreadful piece of \\"entertainment.\\"  This is absolutely Hollywood at its most brain-dead, and we can only hope that everyone concerned suffered condign aneurisms during the initial screening.
B0044BZZJ2|5.0|the episiode was dramatic, enticing, sexy, and heart wrenching. I give it 5 stars and not just because i love ian somerhalder. ;)
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|That the authenticity of \\"Catfish\\" is in question is both the film's greatest strength and its biggest weakness. Directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost have repeatedly claimed that their documentary isn't a hoax, and while I'd like to believe them, I admit that I have my doubts; some of it comes off as a little too dramatic, almost as if the situation were intentionally manufactured for the sake of telling a cautionary tale of internet romance. That being said, the definition and purpose of a true documentary is open for debate. Some believe it should objectively present life as it is, the camera meant to provoke or surprise an unassuming subject, the audience meant to participate as a fly on the wall. Others believe it should express an opinion and support its position with facts and figures. \\"Catfish\\" seems to do a little bit of both, confusing matters even further.    Still, there's no denying that it's a gripping piece of work - mysterious, at times suspenseful, at times amusing, and in the end, a curiously touching examination of human behavior and the power of art. If the film is real, if the people on camera are not actors but actual documentary subjects, then it may someday be regarded as one of the best examples of early twenty-first century Cinéma vérité.    The film follows New York photographer Nev Schulman, Ariel's brother, who in 2008 received a painting of one of his photos from eight-year-old Michigan native Abby Pierce. Flattered by her interest in his work, he adds her as a friend on Facebook. This quickly expands to include most of her family, including her mother, Angela, and her older half-sister, Megan, the latter two he begins corresponding with over the phone. He has an especially good rapport with Megan, who's incredibly attractive and has dozens of pictures on her Facebook account. She's an artist herself - a singer and a songwriter. She has also just purchased a farm and is raising horses. Nev is smitten, and in due time, the two start a long-distance relationship. They text each other constantly, progressing naturally from chaste flirtation to bold innuendo. She eventually posts a few of her songs on Facebook for him to listen to, and he tells her they're all very good.    But then Nev discovers that all of the same songs appear on YouTube. One sounds exactly the same as Megan's version. She tells him that she was merely covering the songs, but it's obvious she isn't telling the truth. And what about Abby's paintings? Angela tells him that they're being sold all over the state for various amounts. She also tells him that Abby has just acquired access to a vacant building, which will be converted to a gallery to display her work. A few phone calls make it clear that this is simply not the case. Why are they lying to Nev? How could he have been so gullible? After documenting a dance festival in Colorado, Nev, Ariel, and Henry decide to travel to Michigan and confront Megan and Angela.    And this is where I will stop describing the sequence of events. I will say that it leads to an unexpectedly emotional conclusion. The goal isn't necessarily to shock, although certain audiences may respond to it in that manner; the real goal is to awaken within the audience a sense of empathy, to show us why certain people are the way they are, even if we may not understand. And here again I question the film's authenticity. Isn't it a little too convenient that such a message should be sent at a time when millions upon millions of people - myself included - are frequent Facebook users? I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel that something subversive is at work here. It's almost as if the filmmakers wanted everything to go the way it actually does go. No, I don't have any proof of this. It's just my gut reaction.    That doesn't change the fact that I was actively engaged with the material. Even the title got me hooked (no pun intended). The tagline warns, \\"Don't let anyone tell you what it is,\\" and whilethis may seem pretty stern, it also ignites a fascinating air of anticipation. What exactly does the title refer to? An interview near the end of the film puts it into perspective, and it affected me in two distinct ways: (1) It allowed me to see where certain people were coming from, even though I wholeheartedly disagreed with the methods employed; (2) it stirred within me such feelings of pity that I was tempted to overlook a certain someone's serious lack of judgment. I was tempted, but I ultimately didn't cave in. If that makes me a bad guy, keep in mind that the lies were perpetuated even after Nev and his team arrived in Michigan. If you can't come clean even after the person you lied to has you in a corner, I tend to doubt there will ever be a point at which enough is enough.
B0013D8LKO|5.0|Marriage gets the Kubrick treatment with a study of a couple who are committed but still curious about others.  Tom Cruise wanders through a dreamlike state after his wife tells him of a sexual fantasy she has had about another man.  During the Christmas season, he wanders from a Christmas party through to a bizarre sexual orgy where it seems his life is threatened and girl who protected him is murdered.  But is the incident real or a dream?  The movie really never clears up the confusion and we are left trying to understand what exactly happened which is not like the Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman characters themselves.  A wonderful dreamlike film.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This show really does have everything, action, adventure, love, magic, comedy, morals, strong characters, friendship, epic fight scenes, beautiful scenery, fantastic choreography, the perfect score to accompany the action....it is really an edge of the seat, nail biting performence from all involved. Legend of the Seeker just gets better and better with every episode! Bringing Cara in as a permanent part for season 2 was inspirational and gave it that little something extra, shall we say some added kick-a*s and sassiness. This will not be the final season if we get our way, and we won't stop fighting until we get this team, the cast,crew and fandom the 3rd season we deserve!!
143350393X|5.0|This is a wonderful translation and the study notes are helpful. The online resources were a great surprise as well.

0811876373|5.0|I was excited about buying the Cake Pop but but I was thoroughly delightly when I received it.  The photos were beautiful.  The instructions easy to follow.  And I loved the binding.  It was the perfect binding for a cookbook.  No need to hold it open.  It just lays flat.  I can't wait to try all the great ideas inside!
B003XX2PPO|1.0|What the hell happened? From recording a 5 star album, Complices to recording this worthless album! It is blatantly obvious that this album was totally geared for commercial success! What a shame! What's wrong with these people(reviewers) stating that this is such a great album, I don't think they even believe it! I have always been a die-hard fan of Luis Miguel but with good conscious cannot lie! 6 out of the 10 songs are upbeat-pop-chewing-gum songs...one or two of the 4 ballads are a little good and only because of Luis Miguel's voice! Luis Miguel has one of the best voices of our generation, it is a shame that he bought into the propaganda of selling  a cheap album!<br /><br />Que gran pena que despues de grabar un album como Complices(material y musica de primera calidad), grabe este album con musica tan mediocre y ordinaria! 6 de las 10 canciones son pop y solamente 2 canciones de las 4 baladas valen la pena. Luis Miguel ya no tiene 18anos ni esta en los 20s o 30s...ya es un hombre madura de 40 anos! Es obvio que grabo este disco con la intencion de vender mas en lo comercial. Que decepcion tan grande..ojala que aprendio de su inmenso error de grabar un disco como este. Luis Miguel es una de las mejores artistas de nuestro tiempo, que pena que se dejo llevar con la politica de vender discos con este album tan malo!
0553805371|1.0|I bought this book with an expectation to see some new ideas and new insights into the understanding of modern physics and creation of the universe. Every single idea in the book is old and have been covered before. The book simply restates those ideas without giving any new insights. If you already know \\"sum over histories\\" understanding of quantum, model dependent reality, anthropic principal, and multiple universes (multiverse) hypothesis you already know everything in the book. All these subjects have been covered in many other popular science books.<br />On the last two pages the authors state that individual matter can not exist by itself but the whole universe can exist. This is the claim they should be spending time on to explain; however they merely cover it in one and a half pages without giving adequate explanation why that is. They simply state that gravity has negative energy therefore \\"done\\". I expected a more detailed explanation about why the universe can exist without any external energy.<br />I am wondering if I can claim my money back from Amazon.
B00328G4V6|5.0|The feeling I get from reading some reviews is that some people should just stop moaning about whether this has been released with money in mind and start enjoying whatever Hendrix left behind. It's that simple. Why see this as unfinished when it's out there for all to dig just as Jimi left there and then? He always played for the moment and that's what we get here. I don't care whether there's a reason behind a release; anything that's out is supposed to sell or is it not?<br /><br />Sure as anything, I loved it and play it constantly, being reminded every time of how truly a genius we lost 40 years ago. If you like Hendrix, don't waste another minute: this is as powerful, inspired and fiery as anything he did - so move over and just let Jimi take over, will you?!
1439181780|5.0|Rhonda Byrne is right on. How often have we heard the words, Love is the answer but never quite understood it. Love IS the answer and it does have the power to transfrom your life in all ways!  (Its not always easy mind you but just knowing it helps you see more clearly)
067144901X|5.0|Great, short easy read for short attention spans! My 9 month old LOVES it. I can see that it will get old before too long, but not before my daughter is able to join in with the animal sounds. It's also the type of book that an older preschool sibling would like to 'read' to a younger sibling as it is easily memorized.
0312370849|5.0|The book was good .  It was in great condition and the service was very timely.  Thank you
B00006B1HH|5.0|What an easy purchase and the product arrived ahead of schedule and is in good condition.
0316098337|5.0|This is a book that you'll want to read all at once.  It is so compelling and the characters are so real that you will have a hard time putting it down.  This story is told by Jack, a five year old boy who has spent his entire life with Ma in a small room being held captive by Old Nick.  The story of their life together is powerful and haunting.  The pacing is perfect and I don't think I've ever read a book that so perfectly captures the voice of a five year old child.  Jack is totally believable.  There were moments that I so totally felt his terror that my heart was racing, and moments when his heartbreak seemed to leap off the page and become a tangible thing. There are times when Jack's observations are profound and others when he is such a typical five year old, you just have to smile.  Seeing Ma through his eyes made her struggles seem all the more heroic.<br /><br />If it were possible to give more than five stars, this one would certainly qualify.  The author has taken the opportunity to not only tell a good story, but to examine our society, our popular media, and our ideas on parenting.  I had to wince when Jack observes that most parents don't actually seem to like their children.  This book was an amazing read, one that will stay with me for a long time.  Don't pass up the opportunity to get to know Ma and Jack and how they lived in Room.  You won't regret it.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I loved the show when it was on TV and now love it more. While watching the episodes again I have an even better understanding of the charaters on the island and their struggles on and off the island. The enclosed items in the box are great (except I want to know how to play the game). I liked the way the collector's box looked like an old relic from the island. The construction of the box is very good and seems like it will hold up very well. I would suggest to anyone that is in the Darma Initiative or one of the Others, or on Oceanic Flight 518 to order this collection you will watch it again and again. I have not regretted buy this collector's edition. Thank you!!

B0041VXGRS|5.0|Like any baking book, you have to read it and follow the instructions step by step. Probably the first time you make cake pops, you will have some success and some failure. If you want them to turn out like Bakerella, you need to practice. I found that the recipe calls for way too much frosting. You need just enough to get the crumbs to stick together. If you add too much, the consistency is too sweet and not a great feeling in your mouth. I am so impressed on how this baker translated cake balls into a completely revolutionary food experience. Get the book! You won't regret it.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|I have a strange fascination with this movie. But I also have a fascination with Emma Thompson. She's an amazing actor and screenwriter. On my first viewing of this movie - which I had rented through Netflix - I was a little put off by Nanny McPhee's appearance but obviously that was the intention of the film makers. As the movie progresses Nanny McPhee slowly returns to Emma Thompson as we know her. When the movie ended, I thought, 'Hmm' (as Nanny McPhee so often does in the movie) but the movie nagged at me for another viewing. I purchased the movie from Amazon and now I watch it over and over seeing more in it each time. It's an wonderful piece of work. The sets are superbly done, the acting is excellent - Angela Landsbury is worth the price of the movie! - and the children are perfect in their roles. But that we could all have a Nanny McPhee in our lives! Buy it, watch it, enjoy it!
B003MZ0I84|5.0|This new album from Maroon 5 is awsome.  The album starts out with the song Misery, and doesn't stop.  I like all of the tracks on the album, there is not one bad one.  The highlights are \\"Misery,\\" \\"Give a Little More,\\" \\"Don't Know Nothing,\\" and \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed.\\"  The album is great, so if you like Maroon 5, or you just like good music and good lyrics, pick up \\"Hands All Over.\\"
0790737345|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and it came in the most excellent condition.  I am so pleased with it.  Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan - who could ask for anything more!  Thank you for the excellent product and the quickness of delivery.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This fourth season is a strong continuation of the storye lin with attention paid to development of some of the other characters, especially  Deb.  If anything it's even stronger than season 3 with maturity and compexity in the performances. Bated breath until Season 5...
B003PIUC02|4.0|I almost sent it back!!  In fact, I set up a replacement and then had to call them and stop the new shipment.  The box cover for the bluray does not look like the picture!  There is no blue box on the top.  Instead, there is a gold bar, like the non-bluray box cover, except this one litely has a bluray logo on it (also, not in blue!).

I love these tracks. I have had them in every format. Which is why I love this new technology. Can't wear them out now.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  Although not typical Hollywood fare, it is a wonderfully acted, sensitive portrayal of an extraordinary individual.
B00168OIOE|5.0|This is a must own for Pixar fans. The Blu-ray copy is wonderful and for those who have the capacity to download a digital copy, this one is special. A great movie for kids of all ages.
0385341008|5.0|I don't usually like stories told in letter format or ones set back in time, but still decided to take a chance with this book.  What a great, great story!  It is funny, sweet and sad and it held my attention to the very last page.  In fact I was sad when this book came to an end as I was not quite ready to say goodbye to these characters, this is a story I will read again from time to time.  The story takes place in the UK and centers around Juliet, a writer who is gets drawn into the lives of a small community through a series of letters.  I highly recommend this book!  In fact I first found this book at a discount store and bought this second copy from Amazon as a gift. I didn't want to let my copy out of my hands for fear of not getting it back!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I usually don't write reviews but this one had to be done.   I'm running a AMD Phenom ii x4 940 B.E. @ 3Ghz, it came with a crappy cooler considering how hot it idles.

Before I used this new cooler I used custom settings (min 70% max 90% [2.3ghz]) to get satisfying temps of 35C idle. With the new one on performance mode its running 36C idle! The best part is the fact that the hotter you cpu gets the better it's cooled, I havent benchmarked or anything but instead I have gamed pretty intensely on it (Dragon Age, Singularity at max settings) and standard pc stuff (internet tabs open, Torchlight playing in window, watching a movie in vlc in a window, and burning a cd) nothing made it even rise to 50C. Phenom ii 940 is said to handle up to 60C ..which isn't exacly right it's max is more like 70's.   Size wize, it is big but not to big. If you have a decent mid tower case then it should fit easily, only if there is a side fan then you may have to remove it. I have a Mini-ATX Gigabyte MoBo and it clears the RAM fine, the fan is adjustable and it easy work with.  Installation isn't bad, if you can't take both sides of the tower off then you will have to take out the whole MoBo to install. The hardest part for me was the brace included, don't be afraid of a little resistance but if it feels to tight then remember that the mount spring-screws are adjustable.     I didn't buy this for overclocking because I want the longest lifetime of my cpu, but if OC'ing is your thing then this is about as good as it gets for air cooling so go for it. It feels secure, runs extremely quiet, and it does what I bought it for.. can't ask for much more.

B003F3NDOE|3.0|A show that started strong but bad choices by ABC eventually got it axed this season.  UB was one of those shows that did a fine job of mixing and overlapping vanity and virtue, as well as being one of those rare and successful shows that focused on a functional Latino Family.  I will miss UB but I have to say that some of the episodes were below their usual par.  At one point there seemed to be a jump in a few stories all of a sudden, too, but rather than blame the writers I blame ABC for trying to push this along and force the story to come to a fast close.  It was nice to see some of the old characters return (especially Gio) and I liked how they ended with two certain main characters NOT getting together.  The show ended with dignity and hope and those were certainly some of the themes of Ugly Betty.  I shall miss this show.  WHEN WATCHED: July to September 2010 (I took a long time watching the last episode because I feared they would ruin it but they did not); MY GRADE: B minus to B for fans (C plus to B minus for non fans).
006117758X|5.0|In the age of political correctness manicured malehood and metrosexuals, this work even now continues to speak with an authentic maleness that is refreshing and honest. The book \\"Ham on Rye\\" is a simple narrative whos' directness of tone and economy of works gives an honesty lacking in a great deal of work around now. There are no complex subplots, there are no preachy beleaguering comments about our hero's choices, there is just the tale. Chinaski, the main character could easily journey with the men of \\"On the Road\\", but without their beatnik hipness that can so grate. It has that same joy of a narrative as \\"On the Road\\", that does not force the reader to some perfect conclusion and thus it stands that test of a classic. It is a book that you could forever reread. Its not an easy book to recommend to friends, it is a book of the outsider, it is similar to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" in that it charts the characters movement from innocence to streetsmart, whilst avoiding \\"Catchers's\\" habit of trying to capture teen slang.  This is a great book and even, better I feel dangerous walking down the road with it in my hand.      [[ASIN:006117758X Ham on Rye: A Novel]]

0765326353|5.0|To give a bit of perspective, since Elantris was published I have liked Mr. Sanderson. I enjoyed his Mistborn series tremendously and have the hardcover editions proudly displayed on my shelf above my desk. Only my most favorite authors get my humble yet prominent shelf space. Tolkien and David Gemmel hardcovers are the other authors I proudly display with ornate bookends in various locations in my home.  There are many other Fantasy Adventure books on my study shelves but I set aside these favorite authors of mine to easily access them to read again and again. I only point this out to show that I have a pretty good appreciation of Brandon's talents. On to the review....    You do get your money's worth from this book.  Narrative and dialogue are very well done.  The plot unfolds like Bob Ross painting one of his beautiful masterpieces. Only those that have seen Bob Ross paint can truly know what this means. It is amazing. From nothingness characters enter scenes bringing with them depths of individual looks, feelings, emotions, values, thought processes, and cultures. So you become very interested in them regardless of antagonism. The world building is superb. The plot devices are unique and creative, which is a very difficult thing to do these days when so much has already been done in the literary world that comparisons to previous works seem almost inevitable. Not in this case, Sanderson deserves credit for originality. His narrative and dialogue with each character and chapter was a work of beauty. I felt I was right there beside Dalinar, or Kaladin, Shallan or even Wit. I loved Wit and look forward to finding the mystery behind that character.    If there is a problem, and there are slight ones, it is pacing. I have to be honest. [Nobody's perfect Brandon. :) ] This story could have moved faster. There is maybe 100 or so pages that did not need to be there.  Some narrative of characters and their thoughts are repetitive(at times) and drag the flow of the story. When that passes, the reader is up and running again. When a good story is a foot, I despise to be slowed down by the literary equivalent of road bumps. That aside, the mind that created all of the threads of this story, held them, and intricately wove them at just the right time is very impressive. Last but not least, I very much appreciate that the book is family friendly.      This story is Epic so it is going to be long. Epic fantasy fans should love this book. I wanted to give 4.5 stars but I know the talent and effort in this tale deserves 5. I almost pared it back to four due to the slow spots.  If I could have given 4.5 stars, I would have.  It is a good read and I anxiously await the next volume. The wait is always a bummer....but that means the story was good.  So now I wait......  :)
B0017WCG48|5.0|Master of Puppets is quite possibly the best metal record ever made. Not a weak track to be found and they were doing stuff that sounded new, fresh, and powerful. The vinyl sounds wonderful and the packaging is beautiful as well.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|Ugly Betty is one of my favorite shows. Was very upset when it was taken off the air so I was glad when I was able to buy this dvd. I have all the seasons so I can watch it anytime I want. It is also on the tv guide channel Mon-Fri at 5:00. where I live. It is a good show. Betty is always trying to help her boss and is doing a good job at it.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|Yes - I called you fools.  Only a fool would compare a book to a movie.  They are 2 different forms of media you bone heads.  I wasn't interested in this movie but my 16 yr old son has been asking to rent this for a while now so I gave in.  Good story, some funny moments and great special efects.  My son has read the first 3 books and it did not bother him the movie didn't follow exaclty.  If you are a fan of Greek Mythology, like action and can suspend disbeleif you will enjoy this movie.  Looked awsome in blu ray.  I probably  would have given it 4 stars but here's a 5th for the fools.
B002ZG997C|2.0|I thought that this movie would show more on the Faith side of things, but it only showed it one time during the first half of the movie and I am now returning it.  Most of the first half of the movie is very brutal fighting with swords/guns and it's pretty graphic.  Not something to show a kid.  I was also dissappointed by Denzel Washington's performance.  If you liked \\"Man on Fire\\", this movie has those brutal fighting scenes but takes it to the next level.  The story of Man on Fire was also better than this movie.  Some of the movie showed about Faith, but I felt it was just a total action movie with graphic scenes that are way too harsh for me.  I thought \\"Man on Fire\\" was pretty bad when he cut the guys fingers off in the car, but this is like 10x worse.  2 Stars for praying at the table when they ate. :)
0143038583|5.0|I have been more and more interested in the food system and how to eat more naturally and healthy.  This book was just what I needed!  I could relate with the author, going through the process of going down the rabbit hole of our modern food system. He isn't out to save the world, just to share an experience.  It not only was very informative, it was also a good story.  Very human and very real.  I have already given the book away to a friend and plan to buy a few other friends the book!
B003J27WFW|3.0|I've been a big Rush fan ever since Farewell to Kings, and I still am.  Their music is nothing short of awesome.  I bought this DVD hoping it would have more rare concert footage that I'd watch over again.  Unfortunately it's mostly home-made video of them driving around their hometown visitng old haunts.  I did learn a lot about the band and their roots, I should have just rented it because it'll probably just collect dust now.
B000AMPZF8|3.0|I found myself thinking how can a band sound so emotional and so  Dull at the same time. I think they sound too theatrical and it doesn't come across as genuine to me. I was disappointed...sorry
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|but a major disappointment.  Unimaginative with so many questions left unanswered.  Violent only to make a statement and so many endings would have been better.  Like......What if she had been in the \\"arena\\" all along?
054531058X|1.0|I wish I could have read a review discouraging me to read this book.  The author is talented and does a great job telling the story, but it is a story that will not be forgotten for a long time.  And not because it's so good, but rather because I found it to be so distrubing.  I was trusting a friends review saying \\"while the main plot line is very upsetting (it is a bunch of teens killing each other)it is told in such a way that it's very worthwhile\\".      I got starting looking forward to a great book, esp. after seeing so many good reviews from many hundreds of others.  After getting started in the book it was indeed one I could not put down and stayed up all night to finish.  I kept waiting to get to the part that makes all the gore - spelled out and glossed over - worth reading.  There is a one sided love story that is sweet and in the end maybe the love is returned.  There is a little kindness even between competitors of the game.  But why use all that talent to write a book that leaves you so disturbed?      There are only a few things I got from this book; be grateful to not live in such a 'Big Brother' nation and do everything to keep ours from becoming like that, and of course the thankfulness of everyday things like clean water, food, life, freedom.  I feel like I did just after reading 'The Lottery' in 7th grade - disturbed.  One might argue that everyone aught to read something like that at least once, but why not have more goodness in the plot?      I am surprised that out of so many readers there were so few negative comments.  Again, the talent and skill of Suzanne Collins is worth mentioning.....I just with I could have cause to remember her writing in a positive light.      Please don't use this book in a school setting.

0399536108|3.0|useful book if you want to avoid falling into the trap of grad-school or a mediocre job.    but for those of us with a child, forget it, there are no tips in here to help the very people who are the most likely to be trapped.  was really excited to read this book, but realized, though i am only 26, that i am not the target audience.  some practical hints for parents would be appreciated!

B003XQM2YU|1.0|I watched this movie because a so-called medieval expert said the sets were authentic. I wonder if he was talking about the Norman assault craft modeled after WWII Higgins boats with drop-down bow ramps. Even the action and special effects were disappointing, where close-in combat is so murky, chaotic and confused it's impossible to follow who is getting whacked. But the greatest disappointment was the script, so bad I don't know where to begin. Couldn't the writers have made a stab at historical verisimilitude? Big epics like this cover a multitude of sins, the worst being the relentless resort to cliche. It's hard to believe this is the same Ridley Scott who produced \\"The Good Wife.\\"
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Okay.  Time for a new Bon Iver record.  The EP was great.  Let's just hope he doesn't have to sequester himself again to turn out more of his great songs.  Could take forever.  Or forever ago
B001TH16DI|4.0|This set has decent Blu-Ray HD clarity, but if you are hoping the recent Director Cuts are found here - they are not.  They are the original theatrical releases.  The bonus footage is new and not recycled - some of it is even interesting if you are fan.  If you are like my wife, you will yawn and fall asleep.
B003TML0VO|1.0|was not what i expected from santana--music was just that--music--radio level--nothing amazing like santana's guitar playing
1593078684|2.0|I thought this would be great, but I was not blown away by it.  I was hoping for a book that had all kinds of pictures/drawings from the vintage final fantasy series---but it didn't.  Really, I would have been better off skimming through my vintage FF strategy guides from the 1990's.  This is a book that will prolly just collect dust on my shelf now, unless I try and resell it back on amazon lol.  Maybe if your a die-hard fan you might get something out of this--like multiple views---but-----nah not me.  I was a die hard fan, but anymore the FF games have been going down hill since FF 7 and I was hoping to relive some of the classic monsters/heroes photos/drawings but this just doesn't have it.
0802473156|5.0|This book makes so much sense. I find it interesting when you discuss it with others that people immediately know what \\"love language\\" they are and what you are too! My husband doesn't exactly get my \\"love language\\" so reading this book together was very insightful to him and therefore beneficial to our marriage. Now we can look at our kids and see what matters to them too. Great read!
1439153663|5.0|My dealings with Amazon have been nothing but satisfactory. The efficiency of the order system plus the quick delivery of products is excellent!
B000002L68|5.0|If you like Prince you will love this one also if you have never seen the movie highly suggest it. The music is awesome.
1439181780|5.0|This is an excellent book that you want to take your time and think about what you read and how to put it to use in your life.

089381525X|5.0|Sebastião Salgado (born February 8, 1944) is a Brazilian social documentary photographer and photojournalist, first trained as an economist and worked successfully in that field until the reality of the world economic situation urged him to change vocations and become a poet of the working class.  His photographs are some of the most majestically poetic of any artist who desires to carry a message to the public. Labeling him as a photojournalist may be a proper classification, but that title is only the core of what Sebastião Salgado has accomplished.<br /><br />Salgado visits those places that are unknown to us were it not for his famous images.  The workers in the vast mines of South America, the sulfur mines in Indonesia, builders of dams in India, assembly line workers all over the globe - these are the heroic places Salgado takes us.  His images and accompanying gentle words are separated in this book into categories of agriculture, mining, oil, construction, food, and industry and the raw realities of mass labor jump from these pages.  Lest we think that these kinds of impossible working conditions occurs only in other places, then look carefully at the images of slaughter houses in our own South Dakota.<br /><br />In addition to being a brilliant photographer Salgado is a humanist and it is his obsession with quietly reminding us all of how we co-exist on a planet whose future is in danger in softly whispering overwhelming mages and words.  This is a book that should be part of every household: it should be demanded reading for school children and students of art and sociology and the environment. Grady Harp, September 10
B001EAWMGA|5.0|This was NOT what I expected! From beginning to end it was well paced and had me on the edge of my seat. Great sci-fi, action/adventure and a bit of horror mixed in with vikings 700AD. I liked the story. I liked the actors. Not overly predictable but enough where I was comfortable with it. Definitely an overlooked and under rated movie. No sex scenes. Real subtitled Norse language at the beginning. I would watch it more than the two times I have already ;o)

B003V4AK8E|3.0|There are some real oddities; occasional loss of connectivity is probably the worst offender, and has hit me at some truly inopportune moments, but not so often that I've considered switching back.    This controller, and it's wired counterpart, are for people who find their hands fit better on a 360 controller than a ps3 one.  In my case, it's the triggers that convinced me, but it is almost a perfect replica of a 360 feel in your hands.  It feels good, if a bit light.    My disappointment stems entirely from the USB dongle required for EACH controller, and that it doesn't just use Bluetooth, like standard controllers, so you can't power up the console with it.    Also, small movements and fine control is hampered by large dead zones around neutral position on the sticks.  You have to move a good distance before the stick registers movements, and that might make lining up headshots much harder, but probably won't matter in God of War.    My advice:  go wired unless you're desperately wedded to wireless.
0743298039|4.0|This was a rare find online; it cost me a dollar and after reading it, I have discovered it was well worth the money.<br /><br />The story has multiple main characters with Margaret and Vida being the top two.  Their lives come together when Vida writes Margaret a letter telling Margaret she has been chosen to write her life story.  Uncertain at first, Margaret decides to accept this offer and travels to Vida's estate.<br /><br />The tale then goes into the past for both Margaret and Vida.  It switches from one life to the next and from one time period to another yet the reader is never confused about the characters, the time line, or the story.  It is well written and it engages you.  It was a book I couldn't really put down for long and I am sure my other books laying on the nightstand were pretty sad each night as I reached for this one over and over again.<br /><br />The story had a few surprising twists and during some of the narratives I found myself guessing at what the outcome would be.  Truth be told that before the \\"surprise\\" ending was written, I had guessed it but that didn't take away from the story and there were other areas where I hadn't made the best guess and was pleasantly surprised when I read these twists to the tale.<br /><br />I would happily recommend this to any reader who likes stories weaved within stories.  I would recommend this to the reader who likes to try to solve the puzzle before the last page is read.  And I'd recommend this to those people who say they don't like to read because they can't seem to get into the story.  If you see yourself in any of those readers mentioned, then this is the book for you!  I know you will thoroughly enjoy it!<br /><br />I now happily place the book back on my shelf...but because I enjoyed it so much, I will take note of the author - Diane Setterfield - as she just added a new fan with this book!<br /><br />For more reviews by MaryEllen please visit Portraits of M.E. at [...]

1843118122|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moGW46EWJE9Z4Q]]`MARINE INSURANCE HAS, SINCE THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, BEEN THE ENGINE WHICH HAS DRIVEN THE REST OF THE ENGLISH LAW OF INSURANCE': Andrew Longmore LJ<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Well!  With a headline such as the above, which we quote directly from the Longmore LJ's brief foreword to this remarkable book, you scarcely need a headline from us. `The Modern Law of Marine Insurance' is, as he notes in his conclusion, `a book for those practising in all forms of insurance however far removed they are from marine insurance itself'.<br /><br />That's not withstanding Professor Malcolm A. Clarke's comment that 'a traditional line is drawn between marine insurance (MAT) and non-marine insurance, with reinsurance as a category closely associated in the common law mind with the former.'<br /><br /> An important and valuable perspective for practitioners in insurance law that `the traditional line between marine and non-marine insurance is, we would say, artificial and fluid as the two disciplines, far from being separate, are inextricably linked.<br /><br />In essence, the book provides an objective and thoroughly contemporary analysis of marine insurance law, together with a comparative analysis, which is certainly enlightening, of the law and practice in Europe, Australia and the USA.  It's a<br />compilation of the work of a team of world-leading academics from top universities, as well as specialist practitioners in this field.  Talk about a treasure trove between two covers, of marine law expertise!<br /><br />Particularly interesting is the chapter by the editor, Professor Rhidian Thomas on `The Concept and Measure of Indemnity in Marine Policies'.  As he notes in the Preface, `No principle is more fundamental and pervasive in marine insurance than the principle of indemnity'.<br /><br />Other topics that undergo intensive scrutiny include: valued policies...insurable interest...warranties, fraud...and the lamentably contemporary perils of piracy and terrorism, to cite only a few examples.  New developments of particular note are the new Institute Cargo Clauses 2009 and the associated new War and Strikes Clauses which came into force on 1 January 2009.<br /><br />This, the third volume in the Modern Law of Marine Insurance series, also contains a wealth of  useful research tools, (as you'd expect) namely extensive tables of cases and legislation, a detailed index and ninety pages of appendices, thirteen in all, including everything from the Marine Insurance Act 1906  to the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan of 1996, 2007 version.<br /><br />So, if you're in any way professionally involved in the world of insurance in general, the need to know about marine insurance must be the foundation of your knowledge base, so do rush out and add this invaluable and readable work of reference to your library- it's still the engine that drives the rest of the English law of insurance.rary perils of piracy and terrorism, to cite only a few examples.

B003HN7BYA|5.0|I just burned the 3 disc ablum to my itunes using AAC and am very happy with the remastered versions!!  I was surprised that I like the remaster so much because I read that the original master tapes were not remastered but that makes sense since 1990 technology was not so bad).      I first started listening to Pantera in 1992 when my friend asked me to see them in concert, during the 92-93 Vulgar Display of Power Tour, in Kansas City.  That concert totally blew my mind!!!  To this day it is one of the best concerts I've ever been to and I've seen nearly all of the great rock bands in concert.  I only wish I saw more Pantera concerts.      I will definitely be buying any and all future 20th anniversary studio album remasters with extra tracks, such as for \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" and definitely \\"Far Beyond Driven.\\"      I would only suggest to Pantera, for the future 20th anniversary albums, to do a possible \\"10-20% `re-mix' of each song,\\" similar to what Pearl Jam did for their remaster of \\"Ten\\" along with the regular remaster technology done with \\"Cowboys from Hell\\"; for the future remasters of the other pantera studio albums.    Well done boys!!!
0307594777|2.0|I bought hardcovered books and the pages were uneven and the material used was not very good. It hardly makes sense to send it back and pay shipping so i will keep it but will not do this again! I have seen it less expensive and in better shape in soft covered!I expect better quality material used for the expense of buying a hard-covered book!!!

B003L1ZWG2|3.0|FROZEN is a film that doesn't fall easily into any particular category. With director/writer Adam Green's previous films some will say it's a horror story. Others will note that it seems more like a thriller. But this movie falls into a category all its own, one that touches on elements of both yet doesn't completely take on either.<br /><br />Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore play Dan Walker and Joe Lynch, two best friends since childhood who are now college students. This particular weekend finds them on a skiing trip with Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neill (Emma Bell). The three are about to hit the slopes and hopefully along the way, become better friends. To date, Joe and Parker seem to be vying more for Dan's attention, now its time to develop friendship.<br /><br />The day starts with the group trying to con the lift operator to give them lift tickets on the sly for far less than they normally costs. Cash in hand, Parker talks him into it and the three head to the snow covered mountain. Taking the bunny slopes (since Parker is still in the learning phase) they have some fun but eventually Joe and Dan (more experienced skiers) want to take on the regular course. Parker volunteers to wait for them but Dan wants her along.<br /><br />With a bad storm on the way, the lift and mountain are in the midst of closing. But the three convince Jason, the lift operator, to let them go up for one last run. They are the last on the lift. A set of inconvenient circumstances results in a change of operators on their way up and the lift is shut down with them midway up the mountain, sitting in the lift high above ground. No one knows they are there. The cold is coming. And no one can hear their calls for help.<br /><br />The movie crawls along in stages as the three go from feeling it's a quick mistake or malfunction that will soon be solved to realizing the only people who can save them is themselves. Sitting on the bench, bombarded at first by the hail storm that arrives, they talk anything to keep themselves from worrying about their situation. They eventually discuss solutions from climbing the cable (which is razor sharp) to dropping down and hoping for the best.<br /><br />Eventually Dan makes the decision to drop and go for help. But it's much further down than they realize. Will he make it? Or will he do more damage than good? And is there more in the woods than they realize?<br /><br />The movie is less about special effects and whiz bang storytelling and more a character study between the three people we see on screen for almost the entire film. Each one has their own reasons for being here, though they might not really be apparent. Each one has hopes and dreams. Each one is young and thinking about the future. But with every moment stuck on the lift in the freezing storm they each, along with you the viewer, worry that their future may never come.<br /><br />This is a movie for actors. And while the Ashmore, Zegers and O'Neill might not be mega stars, this film can only add positive notes to their resumes. Director Green made the right choice in not using name recognized stars because their celebrity status would have taken over instead of their performances. With these three he brings out emotions and plays with them, giving you the chance to feel for them rather than recognize them.<br /><br />Given that the film takes place on a lift in the middle of a storm, there are some painful moments as well. Frostbite has rarely looked so real and harmful as it does in this movie. There are small moments where you not only feel the emotional pain but the physical as well.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is slow but that's on purpose. This is not about gunplay or car chases. This is about isolation, desperation, hope and possibly surrendering to the elements. It runs the gamut from the best to the worst in human experience. But it isn't boring. In fact the only reason you might press fast forward on the remote isn't to move the story along but to avoid sense of unease as it progresses.<br /><br />One thing is certain after watching FROZEN. You'll never want to convince a lift operator to let you make just one more run. And chances are you'll make sure you have plenty of warm items packed away in your car just in case something happens during the cold winter months.ain after watching FROZEN.

0767834739|5.0|I love this \\"Special Edition\\" set as the director's comments add depth to an already fabulous movie. Milla is once again on top of her game in this the second   edition of the Resident Evil series. Great special effects, fantastic stunt work,  non-stop action from beginning to end along with set work/CGI that is truly mesmerizing.    Five Stars on this one!
0439023491|4.0|I loved Hunger Games and went right to this book. I find I am more often disappointed by sequels then not, but this one was certainly the exception. It was set at a good pace and was not a rehash of the first book which is what I feared. I can't wait to get Mockingjay and find out how it all ends!
0786955570|4.0|I got this game as a present for my husband since we had been talking about trying to play D & D together but just didn't have the time or the crew to start a real, full-length adventure.  He was already familiar with the series, but we were both beginners at the rules and nitty-gritty logistics.<br /><br />We have really enjoyed the game thus far.  We have both been surprised by how engaging the play is.  Waiting to see where the next tile will lead us and what the next card will bring is a lot of fun, and I think that this introduction has whetted our appetites for dungeon crawling; we already have plans to expand our collection and have found additional adventures to use when we've successfully completed the enclosed adventure pack.<br /><br />My one major complaint about the game is that, in condensing the rules to fit into a one-hour game, the creators may have over-simplified the rule book itself, leading to a lot of confusion for us.  Since we are not learning D & D from an experienced player, we are completely reliant on the rule book to explain even simple things like which hero is attacked if a monster is equidistant from them or whether experience is shared by the group or only held by specific players.  Our first game in particular was very frustrating because we had to constantly check the rules to explain a certain action or situation, and we were usually left with an incomplete picture of the right way to play.  Most of the online help that we found said that, in the case of ambiguity, set your own house rules and always abide by them, but since we were new to the game, we didn't really want to have to do that often (since we don't know what makes a good house rule or a fair one).<br /><br />All in all, we are well pleased and are getting a lot of good use out of the game already (the replay value really is incredible - I can't imagine getting bored with this game quickly).  But I recommend having an on-line guide ready if you are a beginner to the series.

B00000DOYP|3.0|'Duke' was released in March 1980 and marked the beginning of a more commercial period for Genesis. I am a big fan of Genesis both with Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins, (their albums from 'Tresspass' right through to '...And Then There Were Three' I found outstanding, and I also disagree with some reviewers that Genesis were finished after Steve Hackett left the band.     'Duke' is kind of a concept album, 'Behind The Lines', 'Duchess', 'Guide Vocal', 'Turn It On Again' and 'Duke's Travels'/'Duke's End' - all classic Genesis without doubt - originally itended as one suite. The drums are very powerful on the album, although Collins' distinctive drum sound would appear the next year on his solo debut 'Face Value'.     'Duke' starts with a bang with 'Behind the Lines', which goes straight into 'Duchess', with the short 'Guide Vocal' (written by Banks) on the end, all excellent. 'Man of Our Times' sounds rather messy at first, but gets better with repeated listenings. Collins' 'Misunderstanding' was released as a hit single and it probably paves the way for many of the songs Phil Collins wrote as a solo artist in future years. 'Heathaze' is a bit too slow for my liking.    'Turn It On Again' starts the second half and this of course was the other single from the album. Unfortunately it is after this that the album really deteriorates, thanks to the rather whiney 'Alone Tonight' and 'Please Don't Ask'. The latter track has a listenable enough tune but the lyrics are cringeworthy to say the least! Sandwiched in between these is 'Cul de Sac', written by Banks, a good track but a bit bombastic and certainly not one of his best (he did much better with his compositions on both 'Trick of the Tail' and 'Wind and Wuthering' - check out 'Mad Man Moon' and 'One for the Vine', two of my most favourite Genesis tracks).     'Duke' picks up again at the end with the nearly 9 minute long 'Duke's Travels', probably the most prog piece on the album. This goes straight into 'Duke's End',which is a reprise of the opening 'Behind the Lines'.     Overall, Duke is made up mostly of strong material and is worth visiting... 3 and a half stars overall. The band also played some fantastic live shows around this time - tracks such as 'Behind the Lines' and 'Duchess' sound even better live (check out 'Three Sides Live' for these and more). Many reviewers will disagree with me as I prefer 'Abacab' to this and prefer the more stripped-down sound that came with that album... 'Duke' though still has its moments and its immensely superior to 1991's 'We Can't Dance' and the abysmal 1997 album 'Calling All Stations'.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|I've seen dozens of Lucias starting in the 40's with Lily Pons (still one of the most exciting) but the opera Lucia became tugid and dull; only a vehicle for a soprano that had (or thought she had) a coloratura voice. Good ones Moffo, Callas, Sills etc. and bad ones Ricciarelli, Scotto and many others who continued to sing long after their voice had gone. In most performances the other cast members were mere automatons that parked and bellowed with an arm extended. The present performance was superior to all others I've seen because it was a total theatrical experience. All the cast was involved in the drama and drama it was. This was due to the genius of Mary Zimmerman. Her concept initially turned me off when I first read about it. But when I saw it was revelation. The cast sang and acted! The tenor Piotr Beczala as Edgardo, M.Kwiecin as Enrico (what an evil!), and the Raimondo of I. Abdrazakov were all stellar in their roles. In most past performances who remembers anyone but the soprano. In this one we remember them all. No, Netrebko is not a full bel canto but she is a great actress and a fantastic singer. It was a great evening. And yes I loved the Victorian ghost story.

B000AWYOGE|4.0|This movie deserved a lot more credit than it got. A rare and effective ghost story, with great acting all around, even from the minor characters.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I plan on doing this workout beyond the 30 days. I am alternating between level one and two right now. I do not know when I will get to three but I will. 18 days strait and I can't say Ive lost weight but I have muscle tone and contours that I have not seen in years after 18 days!!! Muscle weighs more than fat and you can have two people weighing 140 and one can look athletic where the other looks dumpy. Knowing this has helped me not get discouraged. I think people get discouraged or impatient because they are misinformed. Once your fat turns into muscle that is when you lose some pounds. Anyway, money well spent. These 20 minute workouts are intense and I am drenched by the time I am done. I am not dieting, I am just eating more vegetables and fruit and laying off the bread. I do this in the morning and after I use a scoop of her protein powder with fruit and almond milk. I feel great, that alone will keep me on this for a long time I suspect.
1416594795|5.0|Yes, Charles Darwin would have been appalled at the percentage of scientific ignorance in the West, including the United States and Great Britain.  According to recent polls, discussed by Dr. Richard Dawkins,  about 40% of Americans believe that human beings existed at the same time as the dinosaurs.  And if they think \\"that\\", they will not comprehend geological time in the billions of years; without an understanding of geological time, persons won't grasp what Darwin's theory is all about.    Surely, when Darwin introduced his groundbreaking book - \\"On the Origin of Species\\" - he expected a lot of religious fury over his conclusions.  But when he died in 1882, he was so revered that he was buried in honor in England. My word, after so many scientific advances since his death...the Mendel revolution in genetics, the discovery of DNA, amazing fossil finds including primates 4 million years old that walked on two legs...how can so many be so ignorant?  What has gone wrong with our educational system to allow this?    This is the challenge that Dr. Dawkins faces...and his response is to write this conversational introduction to evolution. What makes \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" better than other similar introductions is that Dawkins starts with the basics...and patiently and eloquently explains every principle.     I liked the fact he begins with the idea of \\"Fact\\" and \\"Proof.\\"  He explains that only mathematical conclusions can be proved.  Or in his words - \\"to a mathematician, a proof is a logical demonstration that a conclusion necessarily follows from axioms that are assumed.\\"  Evolution, then, is not proved like a mathematical result. It is proved by being a collection of reliable observations or an inference that is not subject to reasonable scientific doubt.  The earth is round, not flat. That is a \\"fact.\\"  Evolution reveals that each living creature and plant is a cousin, perhaps a distant cousin, of the other. That is a \\"fact.\\"    From there, Professor Dawkinsexplains what Darwin actually discovered.  His contribution was not just that one species can change into another (that is evolution); his contribution was  the rationale why this occurs (that is natural selection). Alas, Darwin had not read Mendel's discoveries on genetics even though Mendel had read Darwin.  As the author tells us, \\"if [Darwin] had read Mendel's paper, the history of biology would have been very different.\\"    The book explains in simple language the concepts of evolution.  He discusses \\"pleiotropry\\"  (one gene governs several characteristics even though only one characteristic of the group may have been \\"naturally selected\\") or the concept of \\"homology\\" (such as the similarity of the bat skeleton to the human skeleton).  He talks about the emergence of animals from sea to land...or in some cases back to the sea again. (Think of whales or manatees which breathe air).    Finally, near the end, he discusses the difference between inorganic and living matter.  \\"The harder we look at the border between life and non-life, the more elusive does the distinction become....Right up to the middle of the twentieth century, life was thought to be qualitatively beyond physics and chemistry. No longer.  The difference between life and non-life is a matter not of substance but of information.\\"    In summary, this is \\"the book\\", the clearest introduction to evolution that is out there in print. Dawkins faced his challenge and he bested it. Every high school in America should require its students to read it.  After that, it is time to teach the new physics, cosmology, and the birth and destiny of the universe.

B002ZG9846|4.0|It's a goofy action movie with manga influences. Nicholas Cage seems miscast & a bit uncomfortable but the hero is appealing (a teenage kid trying to do good as a super hero but without the super powers) and there's enough well executed (in every sense of the word) action to keep you engaged. Certainly isn't going to keep you guessing with subtle plot twists and turns, but will amuse. Certainly any film that has a 13 year old girl in a plaid skirt killing 5 guys with 5 shots while pulling a Barbie suitcase on wheels full of explosives can be considered \\"not your run of the mill action movie), watching a group of thugs trying to deal with torture in a modern wood mill is well funny (that could just be me, but think \\"can't cook an egg\\" and scale up) and the dialogue is sharp & witty. Consider this; henchman comes into room where big bad is hiding from fight:    Henchman: Hey boss, just came in to get something from the gun room.  Boss: What's going on out there??  Henchman: It's cool, we got it, it's all under control.  Boss: It's all under control. So you came in here to get a bazooka.   Henchman: Well, yeah, mostly under control. I'll get back to you on the rest.
B001I82RVS|4.0|My friends had me watch this movie a few hours ago, and it was incredibly over-the-top with 200 gallons of blood pouring out of everybody from beginning to end. It was almost like a video game because of how insane the gore was. From literal 'hand' guns to eyes that pop out to mutated private parts, and much more. The film is set in the futuristic Japan. A suicidal girl named Ruka helps the police bring down the Engineers. I highly recommend TOKYO GORE POLICE!!!
B002ZG999U|3.0|Its great to see Stallone still kicking it at 63(now 64), and all the rest of the guys in there early mid 40's, and 50's except for Jason Statham who remains the young pup at 38. The movie has some solid moments, and the characters are very believable. Yet where is the main plot? Well i'm still asking myself this. Eric Roberts(usually known for his horrible performances)really does a great job as an American drug lord who goes in to liberate a small country somewhere close to Mexico. The only thing you really know is The Expendables get recruited by Bruce Willis who has a short but decent cameo with Stallone and the Legendary goveranator Arnold S. Basically they are sent there to take out this general but find out there is a little(very little) more to it when they rally the troops and find out they are extremely out numbered, but never fear they will find there way. The female informant on the island won't leave, mainly because its her home and she feels that its not necessary and that things will change. Well not leaving gets her totured, and also you find out she is the evil general's daughter, which isn't a spoiler OR much of a big suprise. Mickey Rourke plays a broken down veteran from the gang known as Tool, who tattoos up Stallone in the beginning and has a few other small appearances here and there, Rourke definitely being the best actor of the bunch does very well for the small part he's given. The rest of the guys just run through the motions and really play a very small part from an actors perspective but later on really get into the action. The fight sequences are planned out well enough, though, some of the editing will give you a seizure because the footage moves so fast from scene to scene you really can't tell who's beating up who, which is the way a lot of action films are directed these days.    Well in summing up The Expendables all i can say is if your a hardcore old school fan of blowing things up without much of a story(much like Rambo) then this movie is definitely for you. Even though i think they are trying to break a record for number of explosions to occur in a film, for the oscars(ha), it should appeal to those who like this type of movie. I was very pleased to see such older veteran actors together even if it was for a short time. I would however like to see Arnold and Stallone take on a roll together, which i hear is a possibility in the near future, though what movie? No one yet knows. Arnold works out religiously everyday which is a great thing considering he's just behind Stallone at 63 years old. Statham and Jet Li should also really really get together, since there fighting styles are much the same and they steal much of the psychical action in the film. So lets hope for that as well. The rest of the characters including Dolph the dope Lundgren(who i must say is horrible in this movie) should just be happy i suppose that they were given a chance to be in a film to show off there skills. So all in all its a decent film that will appease to old school 80's action film fans, but leave the younger crowd saying, who's dad is that? I myself enjoyed most of it, but i could stand a little more substance from a plot perspective next time. Expendables 2? Come on its Stallone what do you think? :)      Btw, i don't use names or tell a whole lot in detail as to not give away much of the movie. Although this pretty much sums it up lol.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I was looking forward to this film.  Been a fan of Russell's for over 10 years.    You can see Gladiator in this film.  A couple of similar scenes.  The 5th  teaming up of Russell & Ridley.    3 Oscar winners with Russell, Cate and.....where did they dig up William Hurt?   His career was over in the 1980's & he NEVER deserved his Oscar when it SHOULD have went to Harrison for \\"Witness\\".    It is a good film BUT we knew from the publicity press the film would NOT follow normal story lines for the Robin Hood character.  I found the storyline to get confusing.    Spoiler......Russell & Cate do NOT meet until an hour into the story.    Was a long film.  Scenes like when we meet the John character with another woman other than his wife were unnecessary.    Cheap DVD,.  No chapter search list.   NO extras on it.  There was an HBO special NOT HERE.  A special on the History Channel NOT HERE.    Poor, cheap DVD.   Good film but confusing & over long.
0143038583|4.0|Michael Pollan explores the eating habits of people in the United States in The Omnivore's Dilemma.  In the first section, Pollan discusses the proliferation of corn into the American diet and the American way of life.  He also discusses the history of corn and the effects of its overuse on the health of Americans.  In the second section, he turns his attention to grass, or more accurately pastoral eating or grazing.  He discusses organic farming and the benefits of raising livestock eating foods their bodies are designed to eat.  He also delves into the potential issues with the organic approach and organic labels.  In the third section, he focuses on foraging for food.  He includes hunting and gathering food form the forest and other places where food grows truly organically - or in the wild, so to speak.  In this section, he also explores the controversary surrounding eating meat or being vegetarian.  Each section traces his personal journey of experiencing the process of taking food from being raised to the table.  He ends each section eating a meal based on that section's focus.  The Omnivore's Dilemma is a well-written, if at times academic, informative, and interesting examination of food and the American culture surrounding food.  Every person who eats should read The Omnivore's Dilemma to better understand what they eat to nourish or at least sustain their bodies.

B0000797IO|3.0|It's strange, but I can identify with both the five star raters and the one star raters.  I think it's amazing this script was ever made into a film.  Don't most  of us watch movies to escape into worlds that are more dramatic than our own?  That just isn't the case with this one.      The sheer dreariness of the beginning of the film is actually well done. The movie REALLY portrays the pointlessness of Justine's life. It's a testement to the movie that we continue to watch it in spite of the lack of action at the beginning. So no, this isn't a comedy, although there are some funny parts.  Yes, it is very dark.  No, there isn't a lot of action. And yes, the acting is actually quite good.  I would love to ask the actors what they thought of the film.  By the way, if you loved, loved, loved this movie, try watching Shultze Gets the Blues.  It makes The Good Girl look like an action thriller!

B003NWS5AO|2.0|Robert Plant is rock and roll royalty, no doubt! His every solo recording will be of quality, excellent musicianship, and masterful promotion. But I ask, doesn't Robert Plant have the fury or lust of rock and roll  anymore? Do gentlemen of a certain age no longer put forth the fire, the passion, the rage, and the razor's artistic edge of rock and roll? Can gentlemen of a certain age no longer pour on the lava of sex appeal, or express the zeal of expression, or wail to the heavens the joy of life? I say gentlemen of any age can...    I hope Robert Plant is not a gentleman of a certain age. But the Band of Joy's journey into roots country blues makes me think twice. I have been told that the Band of Joy is just another chapter in a much greater book. I hope that is true. I want to see the next chapter, a climatic rock cresendo recording. I ask, what is beyond the band of joy? I ask, was Robert Plant's very best work only with Led Zeppelin?    This recording is well produced. It is crisp over the speakers. It is not Led Zeppelin at all. Is is Nashville, old school covers. It is technically sound, but I'm disappointed. Only masters like Robert Plant can bring rock and roll back to the front of the music scene. Only masters like Robert Plant can displace the current manufactured pseudo-pop-sound and show the world that rock and roll is on par with the great classics in music. Robert Plant's very best work has not yet been unleased.    Gentlemen of our age can form a symphony of rock. The Band of Joy is just a simple diversion, just like a nice weekend in Nashville Tennessee. Let's hope Robert's next stop isn't Memphis.

0312330537|5.0|This book is truly an epic! What can I say, but the words flow on the page and into your mind and make you think. His description of his experiences in India and the people that live there are truly beautiful. His story is sad, yet uplifting. This books shows you the good in people you otherwise would not believe could have any.  It shows the struggle of a man that wants to be true, wants to be good, wants to reconcile, wants to love and be loved, and wants to SURVIVE. His story is not to be taken lightly and I felt his struggles every turn of the page. Read this epic story but prepare to be reeled in!

0307454541|3.0|The story deep within this book was awesome, but it was an arduous, grueling process to get to the meat of the story. Basically, it dragged too much at times. I love to read descriptive books, but this story took that to a whole new level. However, I found it interesting enough that I do want to continue the series to find out what happens with the characters. The meat of the story was juicy, surprising, and shocking. Let's hope the next will be a little more satisfying though.
B0043CJ8AY|5.0|Can't beat Amazon's deals and prices!  Good new album... still not as good as Songs for Jane, but it grooves.  Mastering and overall mix is a little loud and hissy for my taste.  I guess that's just pop music nowadays.
B00065GX64|5.0|With his bugging eyes, lingering baby fat and perfectly round head, Peter Lorre's face has become something of an unexpected icon.  Lorre's visage is such a strange molding that it has even become enshrined in a number of cartoons: Warner Bros. used his impression in a classic Daffy Duck cartoon, the Genie in Disney's Aladdin concocted a Peter Lorre impression and a worm featured in the stop-motion film Corpse Bride bore a striking resemblance to the classic actor.  Most of these representations of Lorre played up the creepy nature of his image.  It should surprise no one, then, that Lorre's first role was as a pedophile and serial killer in the Fitz Lang directed M.      Many film critics credit Lorre's character in M as the first serial killer in cinematic history, a dubious, if somehow unsurprising honor.  The film itself is less interested in the motivations of the serial killer, although they are touched upon, than in how his reign affects the citizens of the unnamed German city.  There is no single main character in the film, leading one to suspect that Lang was interested in the living, breathing life of the city itself rather than a single stalwart investigator.  Just as the M is the first serial killer film, it is also likely one of the first police procedurals.      Lang beautifully illustrates how the threat of this serial killer has upended the lives of the citizens, police and criminals alike.  In the first scene we hear a chorus of children singing a makeshift nursery rhyme about the killings (a technique that has been copied many times since, most famously in Nightmare on Elm Street).  Even as one mother complains about the grisly song, another comments that when they can hear their children singing, at least they know they're still alive.  The police have been chasing after the killer for months, but, as the police chief explains to a politician over the phone, the murderer has left no clues and any tips have turned out to be worthless.  These murders have even hurt the criminal element of the city.  As the police have increased their efforts to find the killer, they have also increased pressure on criminal establishments.  In order to rid themselves of the law, the gangs have decided that they must first get rid of this killer.    These stories are woven together through several strategically employed film techniques.  When both the police and the gangs lay out their plan for capturing the murderer, Lang deftly cuts back and forth between them.  It becomes a race between the law and the criminals to find the killer first.  Cutting-edge camera work further helps draw a line between many different characters who have little in common beyond their fearful reaction to the killer.  Lang's camera deftly movies around buildings and through windows, connecting disparate city space.  M becomes much more than a story about a serial killer, but rather becomes how fear breeds in an urban environment.    There are few modern corollaries to M.  The closest example in film might be David Fincher's Zodiac, another film about a serial killer that is more concerned with those trying to capture the criminal than the criminal himself.  However, the movie's diffuse focus, its cast of dozens and its curiosity about the detailed workings of a city is also reminiscent of many HBO television shows of the last decade or so, especially The Wire.  It's become something of a cliché to say \\"they don't make them like they used to,\\" so instead I'll merely suggest that they're still trying to make them like they once did.

B000063COX|5.0|This is really the only Iron Maiden album worth having.  Iron Maiden successfully fuses traditional heavy metal, punk, & speed metal stylings in their NWOBHM debut.  \\"Killers\\" is OK too, but not quite as good as the debut.  The distinctive Iron Maiden musical sound isn't ruined by Bruce Dickenson's utterly terrible off-key wailings.  Man that guy is awful.  Probably the worst vocalist, metal or otherwise, that I've heard in my life.  Yeah I said it - Dickinson s*cks.  Too bad Paul Di'Anno, the vocalist here and on 'Killers', didn't last.    The first half of the album is the band's best, purest work:  \\"Prowler\\"; \\"Remember Tomorrow\\"; \\"Running Free\\"; \\"Phantom of the Opera\\".  The second half of the album has its moments too, notably the excellently titled \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\", and the slower-paced \\"Strange World\\".  \\"Sanctuary\\" has a great unpolished low-fi sound to it, almost like a band's free demo tape.    I usually feel that bands progress in the early phase of their career as they evolve into more practiced musicians.  Not the case with Iron Maiden.  Stick with the first couple of Iron Maiden releases.

B000AQJPQE|1.0|I was so excited to order this item for my 6yo, because we are studying the solar system in our homeschool this year. After making giant holes in my son's ceiling to hang it up, we discovered that it makes a loud noise as it spins around. It's not the regular motor noise, but an even louder \\"growling\\" sound. My guess is that either something is rubbing together inside the motor, or the moving circles are vibrating as they spin. I'm having to return it because the noise is keeping him awake at night.
0316067938|3.0|I felt like I waited so long for Bella and Edward to finally consummate their relationship, seal the deal, you know? I knew better than to expect explicit sex in the book but, COME ON!<br />Meyer takes to cowardly avoidance of any direct mention of sexual intercourse between Edward and Bella and yet she goes into very graphic detail about Bella drinking cups of human blood to stay alive and keep the baby alive, spewing rivers of blood when she's in labor,the fetus breaking her pelvis and spine etc.<br /><br /> The book started off so good, really. When I first read it I liked it a lot. However, the second time I read it (yes I read it twice) I started to think about a lot of things in it that I simply did not like or understand; for example Jacob imprinting on Renesmee.. good grief that was just plain perverse. Let's not even talk about whole thing with the Volturri- it just seemed like she abruptly started writing an entirely new in the middle of this one.<br /><br />There was so much potential in this book for a really good and exciting story but it seemed like every time things started to GET good or exciting, the author wimped out and went off in some weird direction that just left me disoriented. I think she should have quit at \\"Twilight.\\"

1416562591|5.0|Firstly, I highly recommend this book for the simple fact it is a good novel. Plain and simple.    Secondly, the people who give this a negative review are ignoring the fact it is a work of fiction, told from a character's perspective. The author doesn't necessarily believe what he is writing, which he states in his author interview in the back of the novel.    Give it a chance, there are some real deeper messages in this novel. Read the Bhagavad Gita first, then see what you think about The White Tiger.

B002ZG983M|5.0|Wow.<br />Back in 1987 I went to the theater to see the movie ROBOCOP. I left the theater so pleasantly surprised, I couldn't fathom why this classic film could be marketed so wrongly. Even the name ROBOCOP suggests something uber-cheesy. I was totally exhilarated by ROBOCOP and the complex, funny, and character driven script that led to the great film I had viewed. I feel exactly the same about KICK-ASS. I had zero desire to see this film in it's theatrical release. All based on advertising. I had expected something as cheesy and kid friendly as SPIDERMAN 1, 2, or 3. What was delivered to me was one of the most chaotic, unapologeticly adult oriented flicks I've ever been privy to view. Not unlike ROBOCOP, KICK-ASS is an intelligent, character driven motion picture geared for the sensibilities, and sense of humor, of the mature viewer that needs a movie like this to remind them that some movies are made to ENTERTAIN. And that's what this flick does. It's damn entertaining. It's much better going into this knowing little about the storyline, so I'm not divulging. Best flick in a while, check it out.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|Zac Brown and his band were superstars the minute \\"Chicken Fried\\" went top 40, their fate as country legends sealed. Zac has a great voice that carries everything he signs beautifully, and he and the rest of the band are some of the best players in Nashville.     That being said, sometimes they overdo it. \\"No Hurry\\" gets way too loud to properly deliver its message and \\"Who Knows\\" is too long for its own good. Then, sometimes they under-do it. \\"Cold Hearted\\" just isn't interesting and \\"Whiskey's Gone\\" ranks high on the innapropriate scale. Also, a warning to \\"The Foundation\\" fans, there is no sign of anything patriotic like \\"Chicken Fried\\", or anything as romantic as \\"Free\\" and \\"Whatever It Is\\".    Yet the reason that I love this album so much is that, despite the above facts, there are more than simply \\"good\\" songs on here. \\"Let it Go\\" is the best stress relieveing song since the original \\"Carry On\\" from Pat Green. If that doesn't relieve stress, there's always \\"Settle Me Down\\".     The true genius of this album comes with two great ballads: \\"Martin\\", and the song everyone's raving about: \\"Colder Weather\\". \\"Martin\\" is a work of beauty that will capture any guitarist after verse 1. \\"Colder Weather\\" (my new favorite song) is a heart wrenching story about a man who doesn't want to settle down, but can't bring himself to completely leave his love.     This album is not for everyone, but compared to the other sophmore albums released this year (\\"Doin' My Thing\\" from Luke Bryan and \\"Need You Now\\" from Lady Antebellum, for instance) it can't be beat.

B002ZG977Y|2.0|I was desperately hoping that this version of the film would improve upon the original by remaining faithful to the myths it used as its source materials and focusing more on the inner struggle of Perseus, a quintessentially conflicted Greek hero who initially refuses the call to adventure but ultimately triumphs over adversity to benefit his community. But rarely have I seen such monumental talent--Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Sam Worthington--so monumentally squandered. The CGI special effects are definitely impressive, but the story is muddled (what the heck is a djinn doing in the middle of this movie?), the action sequences are almost impossible to follow, and the dialogue is weak. In fact, the most entertaining aspect of this film is its one sly reference to one of the silliest parts of the original version--that ridiculous mechanical owl. Unfortunately, if anyone should be brave enough--or stupid enough--to remake this film yet again at some point in the future, this flawed version will also provide many opportunities for mockery.
0316098337|5.0|I am almost speechless.  Not since reading To Kill a Mockingbird at age 12 have I read a book that has so profoundly affected me.  At times the story was horrific, at other times heartbreaking.  Though I can understand those readers who read Room in one sitting, I was not one of them.  There were times I had to stop and simply breathe.  It was only near the end of the book that I realized that Jack was the only undamaged character in the story.  He was a child who was loved.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|Rarely has such a potentially exciting and adventurous figure as Robin Hood been rendered so bland and listless as he has in this film version of the noble bandit. Russell Crowe seems lost, Cate Blanchett is far too classy for this film, and Max von Sydow phones in his performance. Although I'm usually a fan of Ridley Scott's work, this one is just an unfortunate misfire--I wonder whether he has forgotten how to tell a story. The numerous villains in this story are poorly developed (as are just about all of the supporting characters), the plot--which wanders aimlessly--is unnecessarily complicated by irrelevant subplots and revisions to the standard Robin Hood tale, and the whole thing devolves into a boring, pathetic mess. Perhaps Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland were hoping to breathe new life into this classic tale, but they ultimately sucked the last vestige of vitality right out of it.
0380977788|4.0|I bought this book after I watched the movie.  The movie & book have their own pros & cons.  In the movie they definitely made it more interesting but they really didn't elaborate on why the Other Mother did the things she did.  It's like she was just some lady that made up another world because she wanted to love someone & eat up her life for what reason?  That's the question that was not answered in the movie, however the book definitely elaborates more, although there is no Wybie in the book & you need more of an imagination to paint a picture for the characters because the book mentions few details on how the characters look.  The movie was definitely way more interesting, but the book did elaborate more on why things were the way they were that the movie left out.
0316098337|3.0|Room is based on an original, arresting, thought-provoking premise. It's narrated by a five year old boy (Jack), who has spent his entire life living inside a small room where he and his mother are held prisoner.  If you want to read the book knowing no more of the plot than that, skip to the next paragraph. His mother was abducted at the age of 19 and has been repeatedly raped: Jack being born some 2 years later. Jack's mother is frequently depressed and desperate to escape. However she has protected Jack from the realities of their situation and one of the book's central ideas is that when you know no better, you always think the world that you live in is normal and it will still represent home to you.<br /><br />Having a child narrate the book is very clever in many ways. Jack is oblivious to the heroic efforts that his mother makes to protect and entertain him, but these are obvious to the reader. However he never really worked as a narrator for me. He starts the book speaking in quite broken english but quickly leaves that affectation behind. I realize that he was meant to be a highly developed child in some areas while very behind in others. But I couldn't reconcile a child who knew words like omnivore, nutritional and antenna and then at other times would describe something as \\"the hurtest\\". The first time he sees his mother vomiting he describes it as \\"stuff falling out of her mouth like spit but much thicker\\", but next moment he's calling it vomit and using the word freely from then on. All these inconsistencies kept interrupting the flow of the book for me. There were also times when I would like to have been given a better insight into the reasons for his mother's actions, which the choice of narrator made impossible.<br /><br />It's a story with two distinct acts, punctuated by a nerve-wracking section in the middle. I felt that the story loses momentum in the second half of the book, petering out towards the end.<br /><br />This is one of those books that sucks you into its world and makes you reconsider your own. It's a quick read that's highly absorbing. I can understand why so many people think that it's brilliant, but I only found it good, not great.rld and makes you reconsider your own.

0307454541|5.0|OK, so I'm a little late to the phenomenon that is Stieg Larsson and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  This book, and in fact the whole Girl trilogy, seemed to come out of nowhere and reach a fevered pitch in a very short period of time.  I find it even more amazing that it did so as a novel that had to be translated into English after the author's death.  Regardless, I finally got a copy and started reading... and was immediately hooked.  Larsson mixes a criminal mystery plot with a number of very dark characters to come up with a story that was very hard to put down.  All of the characters are flawed in some way or another, and the main character, Lisbeth Salander, is exceptionally dark but well-written.  Her past is mysterious, and she has some severe emotional and psychological issues that go with her incredible intelligence.  She hooks up with Mikael Blomkvist, a Swedish journalist who wrote a scathing expose of a financial giant, only to find himself on the wrong end of a libel suit for his story.  Blomkvist finds someone who will give him the information he needs to finish what his article started, but he has to solve a decades-old missing persons case first before his source will reveal his knowledge.  Salander takes an interest in the case (after hacking her way into certain files to find out more about Blomkvist), and it's with her unconventional methods that he's able to find certain clues that have gone undiscovered until now.  Add in some unexpected twists and tension at the end, and it had everything I look for in a memorable novel.<br /><br />If you like your mysteries to be gritty and uncomfortable, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo will definitely be to your liking.  I know a couple people who didn't like the story at all because of the subject matter and the morality of the characters, so you might want to keep that in mind if that sort of material bothers you.  But my guess is that once you get started, you might as well get used to the fact that you're going to be up later than normal for a few days.  I found that putting this book down was very hard.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedng to be up later than normal for a few days.

B000E5N62U|3.0|I think Nightfly is one of the greatest albums of all time. Musically rich, with lyrics that embody a unique combination of intelligence and heart, it is a wonderful experience -- a true desert island record. Kamikiriad is also excellent, though not at the same unique level as Nightfly.<br /><br />To my taste, Morph The Cat is a major step down.<br /><br />In general, I find that Fagan's (and Steely Dan's) albums take a number of plays to fully appreciate. So I gave MTC a number of plays. And there are a few tracks I like, especially What I Do, which I think is a very fine song. But most of the other songs are neither lyrically or musically interesting to me. For example, something like H Gang is nice enough, but has none of the originality and that made Nightfly so great.<br /><br /> I find Morph The Cat (the song) pretty much unlistenable. It is the only song in the entire Fagan/Becker canon that, to my ears, is downright unpleasant to have on the stereo. It is lugubrious, without the harmonic interest that could make it worthwhile. I can understand why, structurally, he might choose to reprise it at the end. But if I can't listen to it once, I certainly don't want to hear it twice.<br /><br />I'll probably give this two or three more plays over the years. Who knows, maybe I'll see the light and change my mind. But I really don't think so.<br /><br />If you're not already Fagan fan, I strongly recommend that you choose Nightfly as your first purchase. If you are, you'll probably want to have everything, and so I know you'll probably get this, and I don't blame you. I'm just saying -- don't expect it to be as good as Nightfly or Kamikiriad.
B000P6XU5G|5.0|Others have said it better than I could, but I will say that everything works together so well in this movie that you get that \\"Lightening in a Bottle\\" effect that is so rare in Movies and Art. How rare is exemplified by the fact that El Dorado and Rio Lobo, with the same star and director, doesn't come close to the magic of Rio Bravo.

0440241901|4.0|Emma Corrigan is in her mid-twenties, she is in a relationship and has a stable job. Like everyone else, she has secrets that is unbeknownst to anyone else - (that's why they are called secrets). They seem light and comical but if the people involved find the truth, then, there will be unfavorable consequences. Some of Emma's secrets are: she actually thinks her boyfriend looks like Ken (as in Ken and Barbie), her boyfriend thinks that she is two sizes smaller than what she actually is and Emma does not correct him, when Artemis her workmate annoys her (this happens daily anyway), Emma poisons her plant with orange juice, so again, she would rather keep these things to herself. That is, until a turbulent plane ride gives her the courage to confess most - if not all to an attractive stranger who is sitting next to her. As the plane safely lands, Emma found comfort in the fact that the American seated next to her will be gone since he was not from around. But of course, things are not that easy, the stranger is Jack Harper, an American CEO of the company she works for. He is visiting their UK Branch and of course Jack also has some secrets of his own.    As Jack unravels Emma's secrets the more he realizes that he does agree with her honest assestment on things. More importantly, their attaction for each other becomes evident.     Can You Keep A Secret is filled with humor, I literally laughed aloud several times, to think I started reading this book in the middle of the night. Sophie Kinsella is a wonderful author with a great sense of humor, this book is fun, light and an easy read. Emma is a wonderful character despite her quirks, she is easy to identify with.    [...]
0545310601|5.0|In the first two books from the Hunger Games Trilogy the reader starts to familiarize with the brutal world descibred by Collins. I'm not going into the plot details 'cause i expect the ones who read this review has already read Hunger Games and Catching Fire.<br /><br />In Mockingjay we are introduced to new rules and a new society of the supposedly extinct disctrit 13. And this is where the most part of the story happens and it starts a month later from the events of Catching Fire. District 12 is in ashes,Peeta has been captured by the Capitol and Katniss is the \\"face\\" of the rebellion.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a slow read and i had the sensation that the story just really unfolds from the middle of the book.<br /><br />From the start i just have one though on my mind. \\"Katniss,why don't you save Peeta already?\\". I Just love this character. Peeta is not the sexyest guy in books but he is so kind. So i  wanted a quick resolution for his issue. And when i finally got this resolution was like being punched in the middle of the chest. I don't know how Suzanne Collins do this things,but she do.Without mercy.<br /><br />About the action scenes,i would say that Mockingjay is almost a battle guide of \\"How to plan a war ?\\" or \\"What are the best battle strategies?\\". It is a book of war,blood and death. If you are not prepared for ir,prepare yourself or give up reading. Don'texpect a happy ending because you will not find it in Mockingjay. Collins wanted to be realistic and succeeded.<br /><br />In the final book in the trilogy we finally find out who Katniss choose.Gale or Peeta. Eventually she had to pick someone. But it wasn't enough. I didin't find the romantic scenes i wanted.<br /><br />The twist in last few pages of the book is breathtaking but it was not a surprise to me. And a final detail of the book just broke my heart. I had to put the book down,drink some water,warch a movie and laugh a little.Incredible as it seems,i could not cry in Mockingjay. Even in this particular scene,when something terrible happens,i could not cry like i cried at the death of Rue on Huger Games. The book is so hard and dry that i had no tears to shed.<br /><br />Mockingjay was a disappointment.

But then when I was looking at books recommended for me on kindle I saw it recommended the maze runner so I said why not and when I started reading it I was hooked I couldnt stop reading and I would till late at night and my mom would tell me go to bed but even so in the morning i read for hours on the weekend and before i went to school. Maze Runner was definantly the best book i have EVER read so far it was amazing and i actually cried at the end when chuck died. great book incredably well thought out!

9889979942|5.0|Tom Carter's visual journey through China allows us to vicariously drink in an immensely diverse culture. The unexpected can be found on almost any page; prostitution in macau, punk hair in Changsha, a beautiful baby in Gongtan, and the mentally ill in Luoyang. I learned a lot about China by looking at it's pages, the presence of Islam, street corner dentists pulling teeth, and other surprises. Normally I would call this a spoiler but there are just so many surprises in this book that I'm barely scratching the surface. There are also plenty of images you would expect: Tibetan monks, Chinese junks, and elderly weather beaten faces. This book is immense and though it is mostly photos, it takes a while to look at all 600 pages of people, villages, cities. I hardly have the vocabulary to describe the range and contrast of subject matter in this book; varied, diverse, encyclopedic, these words don't do it justice. With such a breadth of topics spanning the most populous country, there isn't much room for depth. Each region has a brief introduction and map, each photo has a short caption. But the book is a great leaping off place for anyone who wants to start learning about China through a visual smorgasbord.     The images of people are competently captured in a mostly street documentary style. Carter gets close to his subject, and sometimes their poses are obvious reactions to being photographed, other times they seem oblivious to being recorded. Sometimes the photographer gets up high to give us a birds-eye view of an area of village. Other times he gets in close to his subjects to tell their story.    Having made it through this enormous tome, I find myself picking it up repeatedly and thumbing through it. I keep finding images that I want to look at again, and there are so many that even memorable  photos seem like I'm looking at them for the first time.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I tried to like this series but just couldn't do it. I read reviews saying it was Dr. Who but rejigged to appeal to adults. Well, if you're a gay atheist that loves corny science fantasy then you win because that's obviously who the producers are appealing to. Plots are very thin, characters are all sluts (male & female, gay & straight) and utterly lacking a moral compass. Perhaps series 2 and onwards improve (viewership in the UK must have been abysmal for this dross) but I won't be buying.
0399536108|4.0|Many people know some version of Thoreau's sentiment:  If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.<br /><br />The Art of Non-Conformity by Guillebeau has essentially the same message, but provides a lot more specificity on how to hear your drummer and what to do about it.  This book is a quick read but inspirational.  If you aren't satisfied with your pursuit of the American Dream, read this book and pursue your own dream instead!
B001GCUO5M|5.0|If there was ever a movie where reviews shouldn't contain spoilers, it's this one, so I'll keep this short.<br /><br />As I watched this movie, it seemed really interesting, with tension created from the first moments and continuing throughout.  But as I started to reach the end, it seemed that the plot was reaching a conclusion which made the whole movie rather pointless, if not depressing.<br /><br />Then the ending of the movie turned me upside down and gave me a serious case of vertigo.  I was being told that most of what I had come to believe and become attached to during the movie was flat out wrong.  In fact, the shock to my beliefs regarding the characters and plot was so profound that I had to watch the bonus materials on the DVD to finally believe and accept what I was now being told.  Never before have I had an experience like this with a movie, and the movie is thus uniquely brilliant and certainly worth watching more than once.<br /><br />The general lesson which is illustrated with tremendous power is that, even among those of us who actively try to be objective and critical thinkers guided by evidence, we're still very prone to developing false beliefs and then bending over backwards to resist evidence which contradicts those beliefs.  Beware of your own mind!
B000RK3JOC|4.0|Final Grade: 93/A<br /><br />John Green knows how to write a quirky, nerdy, laughable character who's completely flawed yet really likable. Colin Singleton is just that character (okay, so his main characters are all a bit alike but Green can tell a story like nobody's business so I'll forgive him. Yeah, got me some Green love!). Poor Colin's just been dumped by his latest Katherine and is face-down on the carpet in his room when his best friend, Hassan, proposes a road trip. (I feel like I've been reading a lot of road trip books lately. Hummm. Maybe the Universe is telling me something.) While Colin really just wants to wallow, Hassan talks him into it because, who doesn't feel better on a road trip? Their trip leads them to Gutshot, Tennessee, Lindsey, and summer jobs recording the town's history.<br /><br />Despite the fact that not all loose ends are tied up and I was left hanging just a bit, I loved it. The strong teen voices come through loud and clear. You can practically hear them talking to one another, joking, chatting, and fighting. Sure, there's cursing but I don't feel like it's overused or thrown in just for the heck of it. And I love how wild, interesting facts are sprinkled liberally throughout the entire story. Like, do you know why the shower curtain always blows in towards the water (and you), despite the fact that the water is pushing against it? Yeah, I didn't until I read this book. Now, if it comes up on Trivia Night, my team will so own that point. (Wanna know? Read the book. Well, I suppose you could Google it but that wouldn't be nearly as much fun now, would it?)<br /><br />Colin is quite a self-centered character, which seems like a bad thing but isn't. Being incredibly analytical, he inspects every aspect of his life with a fine-toothed comb, especially his relationships with the nineteen Katherines. Hassan is the perfect foil for Colin--loud and funny, more than happy to call Colin out when he's spouting too many useless facts or being too self-centered. Plus, he's intelligent enough to play on Colin's level, even though he'd rather sit on the couch and watch Judge Judy (really, he doesn't want to do anything else with his life but that.). While it's pretty obvious what's going to happen to Colin and Hassan, the story is intriguing enough to keep the reader interested.<br /><br />Great characters and a fun plot made this book a fantastic end-of-the-summer, BBW author read., he's intelligent enough to play on Colin's level, even though he'd rather sit on the couch and watch Judge Judy (really, he doesn't want to do anything else with his life but that.).

1416594787|4.0|Richard Dawkins certainly won few friends among the zealous with his fiery attacks on religion of the past several years, and though he holds back from too much excoriation of those particular wounds, his masterfully argued case for the truth of evolution is little more likely to win any of them over.  Dawkins says he IS trying to reach the 'history-deniers' (shortly after a just but none-too-diplomatic comparison to holocaust denial): \\"But, perhaps more importantly, I aspire to arm those who are not history-deniers but know some...and find themselves inadequately prepared to argue the case.\\"  As a student of the physical sciences with a deep passion for truth and concern for the integrity of science education in our public schools, I find myself squarely in this category.  I have absorbed the science of evolution piecemeal over my life, but I had yet to make an effort to go over the evidence methodically.  This is just the book I had been waiting for a science writer as gifted as Dawkins to write.<br /><br />Dawkins' literary talent shines through with excellent analogies and eccentric wit.  He puts to rest misconceptions as to the nature of scientific truth, the meaning of 'transitional forms', patterns of genetic inheritance, and the relation of 'micro' to 'macro' evolution.  I have encountered most of the major pieces before, but it was edifying to see them all lined up in logical succession and joined into a coherent whole.  Of particular value to me were detailed descriptions of the Lenski E.coli experiments as an example contrary to the notion of 'irreducible complexity' and a clarification of the genomic evidence on the relations between species.<br /><br />I needed no convincing when I started reading, but I tried to be as skeptical as possible and try to think of alternate explanations as I went along.  By the end I had put to rest the nagging feeling that I hadn't really deliberated the evidence.  Admittedly, the exercise reminded me a bit of when I had to write a detailed proof that a + b = b + a.  I was also sobered by the sad reality that few, if any convinced creationists, would be persuaded.  For theirs is a theory that not only can explain the evidence as it actually exists, but also the evidence that doesn't exist, or anything at all, by rendering it unto the work of a God beyond all understanding.<br /><br />As a comprehensive introduction to the evidence of evolution, I suggest reading this book along with Jerry Coyne's \\"Why Evolution is True\\".  If you only have time for one, then Dawkins' book is better for the depth of explanation and clarification of common confusions, while Coyne's is more concise and is particularly illuminating on the crucial point of speciation.ed proof that a + b = b + a.

B001KL3GZO|4.0|I purchased the Legacy Edition in the hope of \\"improved\\" sound, partly on the strength of Amazon reviews.  To my ears the sound quality is, if anything, inferior to the 1997 remaster.  The difference is marginal, but contrary to some opinions, I found the high notes to be a fraction shrill, and although there might well be a small improvement in sonic detail across all frequency ranges this comes at a price - the sound is slightly drier, with less warmth and weight.  Please note that the differences are really quite subtle, and that I find the 1997 CD to have excellent sound (in particular, I can hear no true \\"clipping\\", as perceived by another reviewer), especially when compared to other jazz recordings of the period, for example Blue Note releases.  The engineer behind this latest Legacy remaster simply has different taste compared to his predecessor - he prioritizes detail over warmth, which will no doubt suit some listeners and disappoint others.    The SACD edition (in stereo format) is perhaps a trifle better than the 1997 CD - but again the difference is truly minimal.    The magic of this music is, of course, well served by any of the above editions.  However, I think the only reason to consider this Legacy Edition is for extra sessions captured on the second CD.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|I received an advance copy of \\"Frozen\\" from the distributor for the website I write reviews for.    I'll be brief here: The movie is good with some caveats.  Adam Green both writes and directs, and his direction is better than his writing.      He definitely keeps the suspense going through several key scenes, so I'd give it a B to B+ for directing.    However, the script needed to be better.  As I said in my full review at the website, there are too many coincidences that strain plausibility.  Once you get to the part where the kids are stranded for good on the ski lift, it's fine, but getting them there took too many worst case scenarios for it to be totally believable.    Another draft of the script might have kicked my rating up a star.  Definitely worthwhile as a rental, but only consider purchasing because the price is so low now.  If you're still on the fence after reading this and my full review, just rent it.
0316044938|3.0|Because of its gruesome title, I wasn't interested in this story until I found out it was about a murdered 14 year old girl making contact with her father from beyond the grave.  Traces of morbid elements don't excite me, but bate a bleak title with eerie connections, and I'm hooked.    In spite of some intense moments and the horror surrounding a missing child case, this book has less to do with suspense and victimization than it does with the healing aftermath of murder.  It subtly describes the need for both the living and the dead to move on, and it beautifully wraps up the passage of time with the process of letting go.      It also describes the connections between life and death, and while fictional, this story serves as a convincing confirmation that our late loved ones are watching us and remain in our daily lives.  The lovely bones title refers to the outline of the human body as well as the framework connecting families.  Human bones cannot be shattered without also fracturing the worlds of our external connections.  And when the living begin to heal, the \\"lovely bones\\" begin to mend like a broken skeleton once again becoming whole.     Less clear is the depiction of the secondary characters and plots.  The dead aren't the only mysterious creatures roaming the earth, as there are many lost souls among the living.  Our main character Susie Salmon helped reveal that fact in pictures of her mother that she left behind.  She was dimly aware of the realm of mystery surrounding her mother Abigail, but unlike a father obsessed with his daughter's murder, the inner torment of a detached mother needing to escape is far harder for readers to sympathize with or justify.  Therefore Mrs. Salmon's character came full circle while only being somewhat understood.    Equally complex is the murderer himself.  There is no mystery as to whether he actually killed Susie, but his past is only briefly revealed.  We know he builds dollhouses, which would support the fact that hewas neat and meticulous, but the development of his character wasn't fully explored.  The mention that he tried to stop his killing impulses pulls him into another dimension but fails to draw him any empathy, and his untimely and ironic death gives readers the feeling of conclusion but not necessarily the feeling of justice.    The greatest disappointment for me was that, except for an elbow, Susie's bones were never found, even though her haunted friend Ruth sensed where they were.  This seemed to say that we don't need to have all the missing pieces to solve a puzzle or to make a whole.       My only criticism is that after a ten year span, the ending summed up too conveniently.  While only in grade school, Susie's sister Lindsey acquired a boyfriend two weeks after her sister died.  They consummated their relationship a short time afterward, dated throughout high school, and married immediately after college.  Normally young boyfriends come and go, but sisters are for life.  It's almost as if the author gave Lindsey a life-long romance to make up for taking away her sister, and for an intermittent time period, her mother too.      And after over a five year absence, the mother is fully welcomed back by her husband who bears no resentment.  While it is difficult for Abigail, whom Lindsey confronts for her infidelity, to pick up where she left off, only her youngest child Buckley bears any open hostility.  How Abigail forgave herself and mended her relationship with her family is probably not as important as the fact that she chose to stay.  Broken bones, if set correctly, sometimes grow stronger.

B0041T4ML4|5.0|I had been waiting for quite a while for this book to come out on kindle.  For the longest time I would see the print version prominently displayed in book stores, covered in rave reviews, while kindle didn't have it at any price, not even for preorder.  When I was about to give up and buy the print version, suddenly it appeared on kindle at a very reasonable price.    This book really does live up to the hype.  It reminds me of Perdido Street Station more than anything I've read in years, although it could not be classified as New Weird.  It is set in a near future version of Thailand.  Modern trends such as global warming, genetically engineered crops, and exploitation of other countries by large American corporations have progressed for a few generations.  Most of the nations and many of the institutions in this future are still recognizable.  For example, as a University of Texas graduate I was amused to find my alma mater mentioned so frequently, though not in a flattering tone.    Bacigalupi does for his fascinating future Thailand what Dickens did Victorian London and Mieville did for New Crobuzon, giving us many individual characters from different walks of life.  As the story gathers momentum the plot threads are increasingly woven together.  I found myself thinking, &#34;This is great, but will he stick the landing?&#34;  Yes!  The ending was big, dramatic, and memorable.  Individual character endings were small, satisfying, and memorable.  Anyone who doesn't read The Windup Girl is really missing out.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|The Last House on the Left (2009), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), and Irreversible. These are three films that come to mind whenever somebody brings up uncomfortable rape scenes in cinema. I knew that I Spit on Your Grave would feel similar at least in atmosphere to these three films even though I had never seen the original film from 1978. The plot description gives you a pretty strong idea and the fact that the film is unrated pretty much lets you know what you're in for. The real question is if you're actually willing to sit through it.<br /><br />I Spit on Your Grave teases the impending nightmare that you know isn't far from taking place. Tense music and doors banging in the wind suddenly along with a girl walking around barely clothed in the woods just seem to string the audience along until the rape scenes (that's right, more than one) finally take place. It's incredibly hard to watch and practically unbearable. Rape is really the furthest thing from entertaining, but that's probably the point with this kind of film. It gives the audience a chance to be in Jennifer's shoes. Not that they'd want to be. You're forced into knowing the hell she went through so that her revenge seems that much sweeter in the long run.<br /><br />Jennifer's revenge in the film on the men that did this to her is really the main reason to see this. The film is still far from charming, but the second half is captivating in a sick kind of way while revenge is where the film's creativity lies. Jennifer's use of fish hooks, a bear trap, duct tape, lye, hedge clippers, pliers, and a shotgun are all done in pretty unique ways. The horror fan in me that craves blood and gore was strangely satisfied seeing these men get what they deserved while the other side of me that is looking for another fun and entertaining trip to the movie theater was disgusted.<br /><br />There were a few concepts in the film that made me raise an eyebrow other than the obvious. Some of the things that came out of the mouths of this group of cliche rednecks were beyond asinine, but that was probably the point. The whole \\"pretty little showhorse\\" routine was just bizarre. After the first rape scene where the men make their exit and leave Jennifer alone, she wanders off into the woods with nothing on below the waist. Besides being in a drugged-like state and being in shock, it just seemed like one of those situations in a horror movie that ends with you yelling at the screen wondering why the character didn't do anything else instead. You also never really find out what happened to the sheriff's daughter. Why she wasn't involved in a larger capacity in that final trap is kind of mindboggling. I was expecting her to be in Matthew's place or at least be forced to watch the tape of what her dad had been busy doing out there on the job. Lastly, since when does a writer from the city know how to set up these traps? It's like Jennifer dated MacGyver or something. The same people who complained about Jason in the Friday the 13th remake are going to have a field day with this concept alone.<br /><br />I Spit on Your Grave is incredibly reminiscent of The Last House on the Left. It's an exploitation film that pushes the boundaries of what the audience can sit through without becoming completely nauseated and leaving altogether. It's not really something that can be watched for entertainment value or the best decision for a film to see on your first date. This film is not an easy watch and makes you feel surprisingly unclean after taking this horrendous journey.

The philosophical conversations the movie might inspire, both political and ethical, would allow for insight into for our own world:  To what extent does political allegience color our definitions?  To what extent might war encroach the definition of murder?  How might an increased awareness of how power has been mis-used inform our attitudes?  Stuff like that.  Questions to ask and conversations to be had with friends after viewing the movie with a cup of chocolate.    Most of the bets made by Hollywood have relied on the inability of studios to lose money underestimating the taste and intellect of the American public.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|From beginning to end, this season of Dexter is by far my favorite. The play between John Lithgow (Trinity killer) and Michael C Hall (Dexter) is absolutely brilliant, which the previous 3 seasons were too, but this one really rises above the others. If you're a fan of Dexter, you already know you want to watch this. If you haven't seen any Dexter, and you don't have the time for a marathon to watch the first 3 seasons in their entirety, this is a good place to start. You don't need to see the other seasons to watch this one, on the other hand, if you have, it makes season 4 better. I don't know how the writers did it, but that's quite amazing.

0143118420|3.0|I would have really disliked this book, except that every couple of chapters the author would say something self-depreciating and endearing.  I don't identify with her well, mainly because 1) I don't fret over my relationships this much, and 2) she had that part in the book where she admits that the guy came up to her at a party and said something along the lines of (and I'm paraphrasing), \\"you must be like those people that look like their dogs; you're always like the men you're with.\\"  Throughout it you get the idea that she's well aware of her short-comings, and that the journey she sets for herself isn't just to get over her divorce and her relationship with David, but to try to overcome her tendency to get completely lost in the men that she's dating.    I enjoyed the section in Italy.  I even enjoyed the section on India, which focuses mainly on her thoughts on meditation, which admittedly is a slow moving part, mainly because it's mostly her own thoughts, but I actually found that interesting.  I can see how Richard from Texas may have been a real guy, and a person she clung to, because she admits that she always needs to cling to someone.    The author totally lost me for a while in Bali.  After her intense spiritual journey, and her lessons with the medicine man, she completely ditches her lessons and her medicine man's company to have daily sex with the next guy she decides to cling to (which seems to happen fast) and gets herself completely wrapped around the axle with stress and worry trying to buy a manipulative Bali woman a home.  It seems like she's fallen back into her old ways.  It actually didn't surprise me that she married him after, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just that it matches her old MO of completely throwing herself into her man whether she knows if it's the right thing to do or not.  Then she suddenly did that thing where she becomes endearing again (whether on purpose or not) and describes her visit to the island of Gili Meno where she fought all of the same demons two years ago.  Maybe this is really just her, and her extremely emotional and impulsive personality that doesn't match mine in the least, and she's always going to fight these demons that I am glad I don't have to deal with.    I think she's sincere.  I can glean from the hints she drops about Mother Theresa, Saint Anthony, Yogic masters, ancient Sanskrit, etc that she's done her homework, and I do believe that she studies it and is really interested in it.  This makes me think that she is actually always on a journey to help herself.  I wish she hadn't popped right back into her old ways when she came to Bali. But hopefully she's happy.  She's certainly successful and it's hard to begrudge her that.  She appears to work very hard and put a lot of pressure on herself to succeed, which may only add to her emotional stress.    The three stars is because, beyond the not identifying with the main character, the book is easy to put down after the Italy portion.  I read it in bits and parts after that, reading other books in between, so it took me about 3 months to finish.
B00337KM2S|1.0|I expected so much from this movie, having heard great critical reviews. It delivered nothing! First of all, it is billed as a \\"comedy\\" so I expected to laugh. There is nothing even remotely funny about any part of this film. Second, there is not a single likeable character in the whole film. I didn't care what happened to any of them. Third it is pretty predictable, no surprises anywhere. So if you want comedy, look elsewhere. If you want to watch a bunch of miserable people for two hours, this is the film for you.

B003REEPJS|5.0|I never liked Miley Cyrus to begin with, although now I guess I do. I won't listen to her kid stuff but I do like this album. Mostly I got this album because I love Dance, Pop and Electronic. My most favorite track by far is Can't Be Tamed. The rest of the album sounds good. The track that I strongly think she should release (if not, at least on her next tour if she tours again) is My Heart Beats For Love. That was really nice of her to do something for her friend, the hairdresser (I think that's what he is)    Personally, I will give this album an 8.5 out of 10.
B000Q67876|5.0|If your looking to buy this on blu ray do not buy this version. I just purchased this believing it would be remastered but it was NOT. The quality was horrible not as bad as Tommy Boy on blu ray which I am still furious about because I do not see how hard it is to remaster or what ever it is they do to please customers, but you know how it is all they care about is money, screw the customers. However there is a new version of Shawshank Redemption coming to blu ray in November on the 16th, which I will purchase but it won't be a happy purchase. Enjoy the movie none the less, I can't say this is the best movie ever made, it's all up to you and what you like. To me the best movie ever made is The Clockwork Orange, such a gruesomely true movie (not the treatment part of it...).
B003O26LLS|3.0|When I first heard Not Myself Tonight (before it was released but it was on her site) I was surprised. I didn't hear it quite well the first time but then I started to love it. As for her album, I was pretty disappointed. I bought the Standard Explicit version (I prefer to have music the way it was originally made instead of getting messed up. The clean version of Funhouse ((song)) I'm okay with, it still sounds cool.) and I was sad. The tracks sounded very good when I previewed them here, but when I bought the album itself, it sadly stunk. There were only a FEW tracks that I liked. Bionic, Not Myself Tonight, the beginning of Woohoo (before the weird singing), debating on Elastic Love, and You Lost Me. I'm not happy with how this was done but if she kicks butt on her next tour, I will give the album another chance.     I just hope she'll release Bionic as a single, that's an awesome song.    To wrap this up, I'm not a X-Tina fan but I do like some of her songs. I might give her greatest hits album a try. I do like Fighter and Beautiful.    If I could give this a 2.5 I would but I'll give a 3 for it.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I read all of Nicholas Sparks books. This movie is true to the book and is very well acted by Miley Cyrus as well as the rest of the cast. Be prepared and have a box of Kleenex by your side though. It is a beautiful story.
B0018CAAN6|5.0|I wasn't a very big Madonna fan before. This was one of her first albums I got because I was addicted to her 4 Minutes song. And I think I made a smart decision. I'm a fan now.     I love the album except for a few certain tracks (nothing against those that love them) Heartbeat I'm not that fond of, Miles Away (I do like it but I just haven't listened to it very much lately) and Incredible. The song is alright but it's not on my MP4 very often. I just really wished that either track 1, 3, 6, 9 or 11 or 12 was released as a single.
B000007WOP|3.0|I have been expanding my vinyl collection recently, and in the hopes of further stimulating its contemporary resurgence I decided to purchase the 2008 Back to Black vinyl reissue of Urban Hymns (in Sept 2010). Already had it on CD, but what the heck, vinyl is a much more enjoyable experience. Not so with this reissue.<br /><br />Pros: Jacket comes with two heavy duty inner sleeves with unique artwork on every side, though they lack antistatic plastic liner. Vinyl is thick and heavy.<br /><br />Cons: Jacket is not a gatefold (doesn't open up), and both disks share the same space inside. I felt that was pretty non-standard and a little cheap for a double LP. Sound quality left much to be desired, stereo separation wasn't very good, and it lacked the warm \\"punch\\" I am used to with most of my other vinyl records that makes the music feel alive.<br /><br />Deal-breaker: Disk 1 Side B, first band/song has a spot of raised, rough excess vinyl that causes the song to be unplayable. I returned the LP for an exchange, and the second copy had the exact same problem, same location! I sent it back for a refund. I believe that Amazon received a bad shipment of this \\"limited edition\\" album, and the quality control at at the pressing plant leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />Here is hoping that there are some good copies floating out there, but be aware that you may discover the same defect has afflicted your copy.
B00000DCHD|5.0|I first came across this album on vinyl when I was a kid; still many years after its first press date and well after Billy Joel had released greatest hits 1 & 2 as a double album. I came across it at a garage sale, and thought it would be a good addition to my slowly growing collection of memorabilia.    It was some time before I found what was (and still is) known as a 'record player.' I put this on thinking that because I had the 'greatest hits' and one or two other releases from Joel, I had no surprises coming.    ...I was wrong. As is the case with most of Joel's albums outside the greatest hits compilations, there is so much on this record (CD, Tape, whatever format you buy or have) that slips under the radar. Once a person gets past the first three songs that are well known (big shot, honesty, and my life), Joel uncovers something of a rawness and less polished genre that is almost a completely different Joel both musically and in word. Zanzibar speaks of a struggling musician that when considered perhaps lacks the ability to go too much further than he already has gone, but with it comes an acceptance and a certain comfort. This sets the tone for the rest of the album, with Joel singing about this egde on which he lives socially, financially, and vocationally.    How songs such as 'Stilleto' and 'Until the night' vanished from Joel's later catalogue is beyond me. I believe they are better songs than classics like 'uptown girl' and 'the longest time', which I find myself invariably skipping whenever they arrive on a playlist. 'Rosalinda's eyes' and 'half a mile away' sing about an escapism that has more power and sway over the listener than much of Joel's more charted hits.    When considered, this album receives very little kudos as a valid contribution to Joel's career. It is almost an alternative release, especially if the three openers are removed, which is not a stretch to suggest as they appear to come from a completely different place and perhaps from afiscal point of view needed to be on the album to satisfy those who wish to make money. For my money however, it is albums like this 52nd Street that make Joel such a treasure to listen to. I put this album on, as well as releases such as 'the nylon curtain', 'innocent man', 'songs in the attic', 'the bridge' and 'storm front' well before I would put on any hits compilation. It's the songs that don't appear on these compilations that are the heart of Joel in my opinion, and that's what I seek in an artist - not how they made their money, but how they struggled as an artist before making their money.     I said in my title, all that glitters isn't gold. That is reference to the more popular songs on this particular album. Hits? Sure. Great songs? Definitely. Do they shine brighter than the rest of the album? No way.
B001HN6940|3.0|I like Burton's films, and can go a long way to stretch with him on his abstract take on things.  While I liked the spin the cast put on their roles and the modern visuals of the characters, an overall cohesion was lacking in the direction that left me wanting more.  Wrapping the classic story in a modern metaphor of innocence lost and adult perspective on childhood was an original take.  The film's a good one to watch if you're a Burton or Depp fan, or if you enjoy dark fantasy, but likely not for fans of the storybook variety of Alice.

030726999X|4.0|The last in the series and what a rollercoaster ride it was for Kalle Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.  The reader was hooked from the beginning, wondering how on earth she'd extricate herself from the huge mess.<br />Although gripping and a real page-turner, on quiet reflection after finishing the book, I do have to say there are a few flaws, little niggles that I can't move past.  Things that are worrying me.  Maybe they would have been addressed in a fourth volume which sadly will never be written.  Camilla the twin sister never features, never appears and even at the end we are told Salander has no clue where she was.  I have to ask, why was she even included in the story if she played no part whatsoever?  Blomkvist texts Salander and tells her she made an error and that's how he found out she'd stolen all that money.  When she asks how she slipped up, he tells her that if she meets him for coffee, he'll tell her.  They never meet for coffee, he never tells her, so I'm left hanging, how did she slip up?  How did Blomkvist find out?<br />There was also a part where the billions of kronor she had, at the end suddenly turned into billions of US$.  Is that the same thing?  Are Swedish kronor equivalent to US$?<br />I also didn't like how she dismissed her inheritance from Zalachenko.  I understand she has her own fortune and the money from him is negligable, but it would have left a better feeling, a more warm fuzzy one, if she donated that money to open a centre for abused women and children or something.  It would have rounded off the story better.<br />Otherwise, another cracking good read that had me turning pages until 2am.  Now I've finished the series, I can get on with my life and my own writing again!
B003VOUGV0|5.0|I have to be honest.  I originally purchased this album as a joke.  I read all of the lyrics, and the entire album was meant for my boyfriend and I to laugh at.  But I started listening to the album out of curiosity and fell in love after the third listen.  I am at times reminded of Liz Phair.  Their voices are very similar, but the sound is incredibly different.  The themes are similar, some of it heartbreak, some of it fear, but I don't think Best Coast reaches the darkness Phair had in the early nineties.  Some songs like \\"Honey\\" have this very beautiful feeling of being covered in darkness, but what's surprising is that the message is positive.  She's in love, and she wants to be with someone all the time.<br /><br />There are other songs that have the feeling of being upbeat, but the lyrics prove otherwise.  \\"I lost my job, I miss my mom, I wish my cat could talk...\\"  But even in those moments of crumbling deterioration, Best Coast manages this very beautiful and upbeat tone.  Things are falling apart, but it only matters that she loves someone dearly and wants to be with them all the time.<br /><br />The album goes by fast.  You're enjoying one moment, and it's immediately replaced by another, and this is what makes me listen to the album on a constant basis.  I want to capture that same emotion before it goes to the next.<br /><br />This album isn't about complicated love.  It's upbeat and meant to be danced to, and I love it for those very reasons.  It takes the term \\"love song\\" to a completely new meaning.  It's celebrating what it means to fall in love with someone without making it trite or cliche.
0385342047|5.0|I've waited for this book a long time and it's worth the wait.  Huge thanks to the author for knowing what her readers want and giving it to us brilliantly once again.  I find myself laughing, shaking my head and saying \\"Oh no!\\" as though Becky were a real person.  If she were a real person, I'd send her a book on child discipline stat!
B000VUCIZE|1.0|Reading the other reviews with 1 star I see I am not alone in the panning this travesty.  The author has a few good ideas but these are weighed down by a mindset I can only call irrational.  Ironic since this presumes to be a book about rationalism.<br /><br />Mr. Harris's best three points are:<br /><br />Religious people are tolerant only in so far as they are ignorant of their own scripture or accepting of modern ethics and laws.<br /><br />People have an inherent need that \\"spirituality\\" fulfills.<br /><br />Our actions do not cause terrorism.<br /><br />--<br /><br />His worst ideas are:<br /><br />Islam is more dangerous then Christianity.<br /><br />Pacifism is a morally bankrupt idea.<br /><br />The mind is inscrutable so Dualism should be accepted as fact and this fact should be acted upon.<br /><br />Torture has value.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Mr. Harris does not elaborate, explain, or frankly justify his good points well enough and he dwells too long on the wrong points.  For instance he argues for a new spirituality instead of looking for the root cause of discontent.  Then he fails to describe a good alternative spirituality (as would be expected if there is an underlying problem to be understood first).<br /><br />He uses Gandhi as an argument against Pacifism.  Harris' arguments outline why Gandhi was not a good pacifist more then they outline why pacifism is morally repugnant.  Indeed he completely ignores the case of Martin Luther King Jr.  It is probably because there is no better example of ethical pacifism than his.  MLKJ was also a man of faith whose argument were not based on revealed truth but firmly in humanistic ethics.  So I expect Harris avoided him for multiple reasons.<br /><br />His arguments against Christianity and Islam are fairly xenophobic and one sided.  He spends a bit of time on Christianity but almost an entire chapter is spent listing inflammatory verses from the Quoran.  Apparently Mr. Harris does not see the danger Christianity poses to the constitution of the leading world power.  Nor does it seem to scare him too much that the leader of the same power is a born again Cristian who believes in the end of times.<br /><br />But his most egregious blunder is with Dualism.  I cannot see how a rational well informed philosopher and neuroscientist could believe that consciousness is inscrutable and that mind-body are separate.  But even if this was the case its beyond the pale to simply claim: \\"Dualism is fact.  Deal with it.\\"  This is an argument from faith!  Oh, the irony.
0618918248|2.0|This might have been good if he hadn't spent half the book trying to convince us that god does not exist. Who cares? Is this a question a serious \\"scientist\\" should bother with? The rest of the book is full of arrogant platitudes. He replaced one dogma for another and wants us to take his word for it that his is better. He has the soul of a christian I say... Really annoying read even though I agree with his basic assumption. Go figure...

B0040MW2BY|5.0|I can't believe this joint's only got one lousy review. C'mon lads &  dames, lucky lisp & the boys deserve more cred on their first full studio masterpiece. Fresh and original in it's day this record still holds up soundwise. A masterpiece because it says this is our sound, this is our message! We are THE SMITHS! What's recorded here is just a cameo of what is to come. From the open warm-up of \\" Reel Around The Fountain\\" to \\" Pretty Girls Make Graves\\" there are genuinly deep cuts to boost any mod's 80's alternabrit cred. Oh and don't dare miss \\" Suffer Little Children\\", a chilling and sweetly haunting tale of the woeful Moore Murders of Britain.  'Nuff Said!!!

0812973992|5.0|Colum McCann's exquisite prose is equaled by only one other contemporary writer - Mark Helprin.  If you've read any of the latter's novels (\\"Winter's Tale\\" in particular)and thrilled to his gorgeous use of our language and the New York City setting, then  you will take to McCann's story.  It fascinates and enchants - a mostly gloomy tale in which lives intersect and revolve around a central point.  Nevertheless, wondrously beautiful writing, which is so rarely encountered today.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|The prequel to the adventures of Robin Hood. Sure we have been mostly informed through the pages of history about stories of an unlikely hero who stood up for the poor and disadvantaged but did we ever get to know why and how. Truly a brilliant piece of story telling captured on the screens of modern times with a few lessons behind it. Excellent cinematography and directing does the trick for this movie along with smashing performance from Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett.
0345505387|5.0|\\"The Exile\\" was publicized as a Graphic Novel-a story mainly told through pictures. It was to be seen from another character's viewpoint and include new insights.  Did she deliver?  Yes, yes, and yes!  The GN is action-packed and illustrated with  colorful artwork.  Did we have Diana's detailed explanations of what characters were thinking or feeling?  Only enough to move the plot along.  We see events from Jamie's and Murtaugh's perspectives and learn a little more of their backstories.  An additional time traveler is revealed and we finally find out what happened to Clair's shoes.  All as promised.  As to art critics, let me just say that Diana hand-picked Hoang Nguyen and worked with him on the basic look and then let the man have some artistic license.  It is his profession, after all.  As for Jamie not being big enough, please recall that he has just spent months recovering from a serious head wound and was notoriously seasick every time he even approached a boat.  Of course he's a bit thin.  He was in an abbey with monks, not at home with a sister trying to fatten him up. He's a tall, attractive young man with plenty of courage and honor and muscles and...  excuse me, I'm off to reread.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|PKD, of course. On some levels the film is clever, other levels it's like the typical Hollywood Formula Ride from the Hollywood Theme Park, complete with stereotypes, politically correct casting, consensus reality themes, and so forth. But hey, if one avoided all Magickwood movies that contained these trite elements one would see very few.    If you've got some time to waste and you want a little escapism and a few tidbits of clever speculation about future, as well as bits of descent acting (here and there), watch Next.    Hey, but you'll probably watch the film and wonder what the hell I was talking about--no?

0765326353|5.0|I only wish all sci fi and fantasy authors would put as much time and effort into a single book as Brandon does with his.

0316098337|5.0|This novel is truly disquieting in places, due to the subject matter of a young woman abducted by an insane man who  locks her into a garden shed, impregnates her, and keeps her and her son there until it becomes their world. But strangely enough, this dark tale does not end up being about darkness. On the contrary, it ends up being about the resilience of the human spirit, our ability to survive and to overcome.  The 5 year old narrator is unforgettable. I fell in love with him, and with his indomitable, steely mother. This novel must be listed with the best of 2010- it is a feat of imagination, and paradoxically, a salute to the best features of the human race. Days after turning the last page, I am still stunned.

0553805371|2.0|While there is beginning to be a build up of negative reviews for this book, I want to preface my review by saying that Dr. Hawking is still one of the top players in his field and that his views hold considerable weight given his track record. That being said, I found this book to mirror what most of the reviews have already noted. Nothing new is presented here that wasn't already said in Hawking's earlier book A Brief History of Time. Hawking begins the book by saying that philosophy is dead and that scientists must answer the tough questions about life....then launches into philosophy for a good part of the book. While Hawking has done much work with quantum mechanics, there are reasons to be skeptical of his conclusions given what other prominent people in his field have to say and the current state of knowns and unknowns about quantum mechanics. The best I can say is that the book is interesting at times but highly speculative and the conclusions drawn are questionable. I would suggest reading Roger Penrose's review of the book to get an idea of what his colleagues (Penrose is certainly of the same stature as Hawking, just not as much of a name outside of the scientific field) had to say. Hawking so far as I know, has not really responded to some of the challenges from those within his community.    Conclusion: Don't buy the book unless you're a really big Hawking fan or are doing research on the subject and want Hawking's thoughts on quantum mechanics and scientific determinism. The book is rather short and can be read in just a few days. Perhaps there was a letdown because people expected more from a Stephen Hawking book ( I may be guilty of this )but it feels like Hawking is going over familiar territory and did not do enough to substantiate his position on the subject. Regardless of your feelings about Hawking's atheistic conclusions I would say that theists, agnostics, and atheists alike will not find the challenging, cutting edge book that many had hope for or expected.

1416594787|2.0|Richard Dawkins book, The Greatest Show on Earth (TGSOE) is similar to that of other books he has written in the recent past; it feels rushed and as usual he seems to put more energy and time into crafting acerbic and witty dialog directed towards those who do not hold his view than structuring his evidence. This wouldn't matter so much if he gave as much effort into editing his books. The problem with TGSOE is that it does not address many of the complaints or perceived problems with evolution and instead refutes the worst and easiest of the arguments, mainly from young earth creationists. In several instances, Dawkins seems to justify his position by presenting opposing arguments as silly rather than fully adjudicating his own position. I expect better from Dawkins because it is obvious from earlier works of his that he is capable of more.   Dawkins also fails to pick up on several recent developments in paleontology and biology. In the end, the reader is left with a straw man argument against one type of criticism against evolution (usually certain groups of young earth creationists) and a lack of answers for the reader on the most potent or cogent arguments against the evolutionary paradigm. Readers both for and against evolution will be disappointed; pro evolutionists will not be given the best arguments for the paradigm and will not be aware of what others are actually saying against evolution. In addition, those against evolution need to be aware that these are not necessarily the best arguments for it and should do additional reading.   Jerry Coyne's book Why Evolution is True would seem to be a better bet for those wishing to read about the subject.    My review probably seems anti-Dawkins but it appears that Dawkins is losing something as he gets older and his writings are not as fresh or revolutionary as they once were. This seems due to the fact that he gets distracted by his agenda against religion and doesn't think his arguments through (once again, more effort seems dedicated to witty phrases in the book as opposed to a full scale argument that makes a case with the best evidence and refutes the best counter-arguments). Dawkins is still extremely bright though and a reader could do worse than reading this book (the first several chapters are excellent in showing how dating methods work and non-scientist types should love his easy to understand style) but most would be better off buying Coyne's book or something else even if Dawkins has better name recognition. I should note in Dawkins' defense that he intentionally avoids certain subjects that he feels have already been covered by others in great detail such as Jerry Coyne and states this in the book.
1597801585|2.0|This book has won the Nebula, plus some other awards.  May win more.  The world depicted is certainly dystopian. Some of the ideas he explores and extrapolates from- say the 'Calorie Wars\\" - are great speculation, doing what good Sci-Fi has always done - hold up a mirror and ask, \\"Is THIS the future?\\"    BUT.  BUT.  The plot arc is dismal.  The writing is not that good, and the characters are all abandoned - all except his Windup Girl. The sexual acts described seemed needlessly brutal for his story, not to mention sexist, fifteen year old male nonsense. This book is probably a comic book that escaped and ended up in print. He may become wildly popular. I doubt I will buy, or read, this author again.
B0009VREDG|5.0|The Director's Cut of \\"Streetcar\\" adds back little snippets (such as Brando's \\"Tiger, tiger, drop that bottle top\\") that were removed because of a strict Production Code.<br /><br />A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE ran for two years on Broadway (855 performances). The only member of the opening night's main cast of 10 to not appear in the film was Jessica Tandy. She was replaced by Vivien Leigh to add \\"star power\\" to a company of relative unknowns.<br /><br />It's said that John Garfield refused the role of Stanley as he didn't want to be outshone by the female lead. Marlon Brando proved that fear very wrong. He's just brilliant as the animalistic Kowalski. It's an overpowering and unforgettable performance. For Miss Leigh, playing Blanche was typecasting. The actress had bipolar disorder and years later fantasized that she really was the tragic DuBois.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />When Stanley and Stella Kowalski's cramped tenement apartment is invaded by her much older and quite flaky sister Blanche, Stan does a not always slow burn that reaches flashpoint while Stella's giving birth in hospital. Although it isn't shown, we know what he does to Blanche. This violent act pushes her off the precipe of fantasy (where Blanche has been precariously hanging for perhaps many years) and right into full-blown insanity.<br /><br />Adapted from Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize-winning drama and directed by Elia Kazan, this is one of the greatest movies of the 1950s and just may be the finest play-on-film of all time.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.1) A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) - Marlon Brando/Vivien Leigh/Kim Hunter/Karl Malden
0312600844|3.0|I totally agree with \\"don't belive the hype\\"s review.  After seeing Oprah select this book I thought I was in for a treat.  The book gets very boring in places, the author goes on and on about what I feel is his political views.  He repeats the story over and over by having different character's views, but they all sound the same, no new insights.  I think the author could have shortened this book a lot and gotten to the point a long time ago.  I didn't think a lot of it was realistic or believeable. A 20 year old doing that kind of job?  It took me a while to get through it because I had to keep putting it down as I could only take it in small doses.  Disappointing book after all the hype it is getting.
0446560065|5.0|The book was perfect.  The art is so true to cats.  I could see my own cat's actions in the pages.  Previously, I had so much enjoyed Simon's cat videos that I had to buy this book if only because Tofield's generosity with his videos deserved my monitary support. I will now buy all additional Simon's Cat books.  WE WANT MORE, SIMON!
0385732554|4.0|The Giver is a great book for all ages. When I read it for the first time in middle school, I thought the book was interesting because it provided a new and exciting way of life to me that I hadn't thought of before. A way of life where you had a strict set of rules telling you what to do, where you were assigned a career at the age of 12, where you were assigned a spouse and assigned two children: one male and one female. I thought it was interesting idea back then and I thought that it must have involved a lot of in depth thinking and planning and work. However, I didn't necessarily like the idea because I thought to myself that I want to be able to choose what I want to do for the rest of my life and I want to be able to express myself in any way I feel like. I don't want to be forced into marrying someone or told who my kids are going to be and have to raise them even though they aren't my own kids.    When I read it just recently (I am now 18 years old) I realized that this is a simulated socialist society. It is a socialist society that is actually functional as well. People seem to be mildly content at all times. This functional society seems to raise the question: Why can't the world create the society? The answer lies within the stirring pills. Not only does this pill hold back a person's sexual urge, but it also suppresses a person's emotion, natural instinct, etc. These pills is what holds back the dentist or the doctor from demanding more compensation or money for his/her work than the construction worker. These pills suppress natural human emotions that cause problems but also good things to happen. When humans feel love they may do foolish things; but no human being would ever want to live in a world without love.
0312600844|5.0|Read it on Kindle and came back to order his previous book. I loved the characters and I loved the theme. There is no question at all where the one stars are coming from. If you are a lefty as I am you will love it.
B000069I1C|5.0|If you like Action Comedies, then you will love this one. Its such a good chemistry between DeNiro and Murphy. The plot is pretty good, not too thin that its laughable and not too thick that you don't feel like paying attention to it. Perfect mixture of everything.
B00278U1WA|5.0|With the first few albums being rather sophomoric, my confidence is growing that this artist will have no problem becoming a force to be reckoned with in the alternative piano genre. As a whole, this album feels more cohesive, and its more of an emotional experience than any of her previous efforts. Just gorgeous.

0385342047|5.0|Loved this book, as the prior ones in the series.  The character is very consistent and lovable, the situations funny and endearing.  The scene with Nanny Sue, Becky, and Minnie in the mall was so dang funny, it had me CRYING...worth the price of admission, if just for that! You go, Sophie!
0061251305|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. It's a must-read for anyone looking to understand the evolution around the development of networks in business. The authors have done the most extensive research I have ever seen to identify organizations that are now at what they call \\"The Fifth Stage.\\"     These organizations have in common: 1) hiring, promoting, growing and firing all based on values, 2) aligning around a noble cause and 3) the continual practice of Triading--connecting two people who have not met one another together . . . effectively (notice I say \\"effectively\\" which is an art).  The authors give numerous examples of companies that master these abilities.     What was  most heartening to read was that the work my co-author, Jocelyn Carter Miller, and I have been doing for the last decade is validated extensively. Starting with books like Pine and Gilmore's \\"The Experience Economy,\\" followed by Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point\\" and others like Dan's Pink's \\"A Whole New Mind\\" we are seeing the evolution of a new generation of businesses and, therefore, business leaders who get that values like integrity and making a difference can be coupled with values like innovation to yield amazing bottomline results.     It's a book that I know will sit alongside also books like \\"In Search of Excellence\\" and \\" Good to Great.\\" It's practical, tactical and very worthwhile!

B003I6473E|5.0|When I originally heard this CD, I was going to rate it 3 stars, but I decided to hold off on reviewing it for a few weeks.<br /><br />You see, this isn't one of those CD's that you like instantly (especially by Christina standards), but if you keep listening to it, you'll like it more.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />Christina starts us off with the title track \\"Bionic\\" saying that she's going to take over our minds and we'll shout her name \\"X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A\\".<br /><br />The next song is \\"Not Myself Tonight\\", where Christina pretty much admits this album isn't who she is normally. In this Edited version, the F word is censored.<br /><br />Then comes \\"Woohoo\\", a duet with new artist Nicki Minaj, where Christina and Nicki are flirting with guys, asking if they want to see their *woohoo*'s.<br /><br />In \\"Elastic Love\\", Christina sings about loving a person whose love for her is like a rubber band 'cause it comes and goes over and over again.<br /><br />\\"Desnudate\\" - if you speak Spanish, the title pretty much says it all. Christina wants a boy to take his clothes for her.<br /><br />\\"Love and Glamour\\" + \\"Glam\\" is where Christina talks about fashion being a lifestyle and getting glam.<br /><br />I haven't listened to \\"Breakfast\\" because of the title, but don't let that stop you from giving it a try.<br /><br />The next part of the album is all about the ballads.<br /><br />Starting with the song \\"Lift Me Up\\" where Christina wants her love to just lift her up and get her through this night.<br /><br />\\"My Heart\\" is the best Intro on the album in my opinion. Christina's little boy says \\"mama\\" in the cutest way. :)<br /><br />\\"All I Need\\" is then Christina's dedication to her son, Max, about him being all she needs. So sweet. :)<br /><br />The second single on the CD, \\"You Lost Me\\", is about Christina's date turning out to be a cheater. Very sad. :/<br /><br />\\"I Hate Boys\\" - well, not much more to say there. The title says it all. Christina doesn't like boys, at all. Which is kind of ironic considering she's married to one. ;P<br /><br />\\"My Girls\\" is a duet with Peaches, about Christina and her g irls doing their thing, making music.<br /><br />And the grand finale, \\"Vanity\\", is about Christina \\"not being cocky, but LOOOVVVINNGGG herself\\" - not really the best song in my opinion, but you can decide that for yourself.<br /><br />So, in the end, this album is very underated; don't let all the negative reviews stop you from buying it. Again, you probably won't like it after just one listen, but it just keeps gettin' better. ;)t all.

B000JQU1VS|4.0|Great classic stories. My only complaint is that periodically a word will be completely garbled and be unreradable, leaving the reader guessing as to what it is. I do not know why this occurs and would think the publisher would proof read the digitial text before releasing it. Poor quality control.
0312600844|4.0|Jonathan Franzen's Freedom is not mine, but it feels like the struggle of someone I know long enough for me to get to the end of it.  I'm enthralled by the promise of revelation that the intensely lyrical and psychological craft seem to offer; but, in the end that promise seems more like porn, and Freedom mostly reports on failures and seditions of soul that are not quite rescued by accident.    It's like some gorgeous, crazy, self-referential pop song that is a delight to dance to; and I know that even that level of success in the novel is a reference to its own portent.  Does this make it meaningful?      I was about to say, I certainly loved the beginning -- but this is not quite true, and the way that my experience was co-opted by the novel, to gain my assent, is relevant, so I will tell my own story to illustrate why I think this story is unsatisfying, if provocative and crafted like a wedding cake, almost shaming the consumer.    I am a housewife and writer, a mother who has given up most of her recent life and potential writing time to raise her children.  Getting me, a lover of art rather than sports, and a person who tends to see loyalty as a Blakean divine essence, present in everthing but especially in the houses, whether Victorian or Craftsman, that we tinker on and live in -- getting me to identify with a housewife whose family of origin issues had given her a blindly competetive streak which was painting over her reality with promises of an alluring win which would be an abuse of freedom, sexual organs, and other tools which are formative of loving foundations -- this was going to be a hard sell, except that a lost friend was onesuch, and so I almost thought Franzen and I might be trying to hear the same swan song.      My husband read me the first few pages aloud.  I squirmed with a sense of its heartlessness; but it was neighborly heartlessness, right?  A piece of prowess, appropriated and therefore appropriate.  Right?  And I was going to read it anyway, because of The Corrections.  And I enjoyed multiple sentences per page.  There is serious lyric here, and I love that; but even the lyricism could feel  much like one of Richard Katz's songs should sound: self-conscious rather than searching.  I began to see that the novel was, like War and Peace, so long so that it could construct its whole world, i.e., define all its own terms for its own success.  I was a pretty Hermaneutic circle, and a pretty, circle; but I couldn't help but feel that I knew so much more about the feelings Franzen was trying to imply his characters had than Franzen himself did.  In this way, it felt as if I were complicit in the affairs that the characters themselves had, because I had allowed real emotion, built between real people, to be harnessed to somebody else's lust.  It is a lustful book.  It is a book that comments on the lust of a nation; but the comments themselves, like Walter's at the microphone, are comments on the author's own failures to find something healthier to say and do.  Simulacra, stimulacra, simulacra.      The middle, and more specifically, Patty's pages, felt like they had their own internal engine; I no longer felt, at points, like the heart the book was running on was mine: mine was just running alongside.  Beautiful; oh, but hadn't Patty just run alongside Eliza, after having given her an initial uneasy access to her heart?  This book so knows what it's doing, it is fascinated with its own beautiful scraps; but it must be said that it shouldn't really have been there in the first place.  It's as though it's trying to be a model for prosaic rape, an exploration of what happens now that we, he, her, whoever, is so thoroughly in someone else's head that -- one -- can't keep one's own.     I have chickens.  One is named Freedom.  One is named Mayhem.  Mayhem has curled toes, and I tried putting foam and wire shoes on her feet to straighten them when she was a chick, thinking that she wouldn't be able to roost orproceed with chickenish behaviors without proper toes.  Shoes failed.  She grew.  She lived.  We love her.      This is a beautiful, curlytoed, tangled book that wants to be about marriage and friendship.  If you say yes to it, raise it up in the shoes of your own marriage and friendship, you will find feathers that are intricate and beautiful and true.  But the book itself, and the chicken itself?  Where did it go?  Just what is a migratory bird, how do you house it, can you, and aren't car accidents a dime a dozen?  Eggs, now, and the struggle to make the choice whether to eat or reproduce, the question of which came first, the question of whether you can really write about marriage and children unless you're in it, and the question of whether you have time to once you're in it: well, eggs we have.    I enjoy eggs.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|I love this show. There is something similar in flavor to Remington Steele. The writing is clever. The actors are clearly having a grand time making chemistry whether it's with the leads or the supporting characters (and a few guests like Alyssa Milano and Dana Delaney as well).<br /><br />Sadly this second season does not have any commentaries with it.  I could have sworn commentaries were recorded and available on the abc website. Why aren't they on this set? Because they wouldn't have been able to squish 5 episodes on each disc?<br /><br />I loved the package for the first season because it included lots of witty commentaries that gave the listener a sense of the camaraderie of the cast, show-runners and writers.<br /><br />One of the fun things about the show is all the meta-jokes that the casual viewer might miss, but hardcore fans will really enjoy.  I know there are people who watch this show and have no idea that Castle's poker buddies are real-life mystery writers.  Many Castle fans have no idea that the \\"Space Cowboy\\" Halloween costume Rick tries on was Nathan Fillion's costume from Firefly. (And the rest of the cast gets in on the act with their costumes of recently-played characters in the party scene at the end.)<br /><br />I am sure there are a million other little bits of fun in the genesis, writing and production of the show and I wish there were commentaries to point them out.  Even including the twitter comments by the cast members while they were filming would improve this package.<br /><br />Still, the show is great fun and if you don't care about commentaries, this package is just fine.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|i love that show, it so addicting, and u will just want to buy the other seasons, it rocks
0545310601|4.0|Mockingjay ends the Hunger Games trilogy in a more adult fashion than Harry Potter ended.   It ends the way war ends for victors and vanquished alike, with loss, and a longing for what might have been, and the realization that it could not have been.  If a kid comes out of reading Mockingjay with even a glimmer of comprehension, he'll have grown up a little.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Every SCI FI fan should own this movie.  This is one of my favorite movies.  If you can watch a movie more than a few times it  is a great movie. This is one of the greats.  Do not hesitate to purchase this work of ART.  Amazing special effects even by todays standards. Great writing and story line.  I cannot praise this movie highly enough.  I just wish more movies were available that were as good as this one.  Sadly thats just not the case.
0316098337|3.0|<Edit>  <Spoiler Alert>  While I honestly didn't think that my review revealed key surprise plot details, several people have advised me that they think it does.    I apologize if this review ruined things for anyone.  <End of Edit>    Obviously from the Customer Reviews, this is a very well liked book.  I also liked it but didn't love it as much as most people.    The  basic premise is that a young woman has been kidnapped and confined to an 11 by 11 room in a shed for 7 years.  Her captor is an older man who visits her on most nights and has sex with her.  As a result of this, she has a 5 year old boy named Jack.  Jack's only reality for the first five years of his life is the room.  This is his norm and only he, his mother and the captor exist for him.  He is permitted to watch TV but does not connect TV to the real world in the Room.    The narrator of the story is Jack which is effective in some ways as we get a first person perspective from someone who has never been outside a room.  It was a daring choice.  On the other hand, Jack's narration is laden with odd phrasing and perspective and becomes annoying to read after a while.  The first third of the book starts to get bogged down in effect.  I found it a bit gimmicky.    Once mother and child attempt to plan and execute escape, this turns into a very compelling thriller.  It is both exciting and emotional.  I was very affected by it even though I felt manipulated by its emotional turns.  I was very invested in their escape and read this section very muich on edge.    The last third of the book starts promisingly but again I lost a lot of interest by the end.    This is a quick read and has some elements of a good thriller.  The concept is gimmicky and reminded me a bit of a Criminal Minds TV episode.    I think the material was better suited for a novella and could have been much shorter.  The author seemed to struggle in making it longer.    Ultimately, I liked it despite feeling manipulated.  It's shortlisted for the 2010 Man Booker Prize.  While I liked it enough, I'd be disappointed if it won the award.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|Love this series on Show Time so this DVD is great especially since it's on Blue-Ray.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Okay...I have seen the reviews that others have written, but doesn't it really boil down to a simple question?<br />\\"If I watch this movie...will I enjoy it an have a good time?\\"<br /><br />Iron Man 2 is a summer action movie, pure and simple, it is what all summer action movies are.  Suspense of reality and entertainment.<br /><br />If that is what you are hoping for, then you are in luck.  If you have kids, then you are really in for a treat.<br /><br />My two sons, 6 & 12 and my wife and I all went to see this at a theater and EVERYONE enjoyed it.<br /><br />So I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a movie that they will watch again and again.<br /><br />Now, if you are the type that expects everything to be true to the original comic series...then read a review by someone who is more familiar that aspect and make your decision based on that.  BUT, if you are looking for a fun movie for the entire family....and if you are willing to suspend disbelief...then look no further!
0307454541|4.0|It seems that this is a book that tends to polarize people -- either they rave about it or they pan it. Well, I liked it -- despite all the naysayers and the critical reviews. The plot moved along at a steady pace and the revelations of the narrative were interesting and surprising. I confess to having seen the movie (with subtitles) before reading the book, and felt that the movie was a faithful adaptation. I liked the character of Lisbeth and wanted to know more about her, hence why I picked up the book. I did get a little bored with all the financial shenanigans and the endless detail about the money laundering, but the story about Harriet and the Vangers was definitely worth wading through all the other stuff!<br /><br />Glad I read it and think that most readers who like a good mystery will enjoy it too! I definitely plan to read the other two in the series.
078322737X|4.0|This is really a wonderful film, full of imaginative touches that strummed my heartstrings.  With the music and our knowledge of what came later, the emotional impact is quite powerful.<br /><br />You get a solid cast of characters, many of whom later became major stars.  Dreyfus is a dreamy, talented youth, unsure of what he is going to do the next day - step on the airplane to collge in the East or settle down in the hometown he loves and yet has the nagging feeling he's outgrown.  Ron Howard, the dependable guy who is egging Dreyfus on to accompany him, faces his own dilemma with a high school sweetheart who is strong willed, manipulative, and narrow-minded, if loving.  There is also a young Harrison Ford and an early effort by George Lucas.  The chemistry of the characters as they interact is realistic and fun.  There are also the themes of growing up and pulling away for greater possibilities, young romance, and looming adult choices.  Hanging over the whole thing, of course, is the impending catastrophe of Vietnam that will impact all of the characters in fundamental ways.<br /><br />My reservations about the film are also present.  It is too short to be much deeper than a nostalgic glimpse into a place that would soon cease to exist.  I did not like the shooting sequence at the liquor store, which was a badly contrived moment in an otherwise believable film.  I would have preferred more characters and a more complicated plot than hanging out in the downtown pickup scene.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I warmly recommend this film.  The music score plays some of the greatest pre-Beatle hits and the emotions, if too clean, ring true enough.
B0035J6TA8|1.0|I'm sorry.  I go back with Peter to the start of his solo career.  He's made all kinds of music during that time, not just the world beat, percussive-type for which he's best known, so I'm open to anything.  But this is dirge-like, and particularly uninteresting as the tone, color and orchestration of some many of the songs sound alike.  Excess, not insight.
0061743526|5.0|Wonderful book, everyone shoud read it and think about it.  Everything said about the \\"Negroes\\" can be applied to the Jews and other people not regarded as humans by many.  I do believe it is compulsory reading in high school English.  If it isn't, it should be!
B0015DROBO|4.0|So I finished the book this morning on my Kindle. Overall I liked the book, but the author was all into exposition. There were bits throughout the book that I felt had no purpose in the story and were drawn out. But on the same coin, descriptions of people, things and locations were good and you had a clear image in your head in how they might have looked. I would recommend the book to others but with a warning that its pretty wordy over little things.<br /><br />I plan to read the other 2 books, not until I read other novels on my list first.
0451529308|5.0|very timely delivery.  got for granddaughter and know she will  love it.  every young girl should read this book.
0307474712|3.0|I stuck it out but never got the payoff. I had a hard time liking these characters. Dexter is too self absorbed and Emma chooses to see the negative in every situation. I hate to think it's a British thing, but maybe. In the very rare case, I hope the movie is better than the book.
B0016PM722|5.0|Very nice, high quality light saber for a reasonable price, looks great hanging on my wall, good conversation piece. My only problem is with the way they shipped it, they just slapped the ups stickers on the box and ruined any collector value it might have had, they should have put it in another box and put the labels on that box, I would definately think twice about ordering collectibles from them, so I am happy with the lightsaber just not with the way they chose to ship it.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I have been using Amazon's HDMI cable to hook my TV as an external output for my laptop for when I watch videos.  I've only used it a few time, but so far it has been working out better than expected.  The video and sound quality is excellent for a cable that is much cheaper than at retail stores.  There is little reason to go buy a $30+ cable when you can get this for a fraction of the price.  The packaging was minimal but sufficient; a simple cardboard box with a couple of twist ties.  Definitely much better than the plastic shells found at retail stores.  When I need more HDMI cables, I'll most likely buying more of these.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Grapes of Wrath as a book is the most banned book in the USA because of its themes of big business corruption, the practical slavery of those suffering the Dust Bowl disaster in the 1930s and California's reaction to that mass immigration of 300,000 people into the areas of Fresno, Salinas, etc.  The title comes from the Civil War era song, \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\"<br /><br />John Ford along with filmmaker Darryl Zanuck wanted to make an epic and I believe they succeeded.<br /><br />Tommy Joad has been away from home for several years and just got let out of the pen, having been accused of murdering another.  But when he got home, he found a deserted homestead and a foul wind blowing out there!<br /><br />He meets Casey, a former preacher who seems to be waiting for something.  Tom meets others who have been cast out thanks to big farmer business and the major ecological disaster  known as the Dust Bowl, where a major drought throughout the mid-west wiped out half the agricultural input of the USA!<br /><br />Tom hooks up with his family and they head out towards California for the hope of getting a job.  They get a bill that says there are jobs out West.  Well guess what?  Becoming a displaced person means being taken advantage of.<br /><br />The film has several themes:  women adapt to these despairing times; the men take other roles.  The \\"Okies\\" are taken advantage of -- you want this job?  2.5 cents for each basket of peaches picked.  You don't like it?  See ya!<br /><br />The prejudice against them was horrific.  The big farmers using them practically as slave labor, the tough work bosses and prejudice.  The old folks who did not want to leave Oklahoma either became ghosts and bums or died out.<br /><br />Henry Fonda is amazing as the quiet, strong young man who sees the corruption and wants to do something about it.  Casey (John Carridine) acts as his \\"lantern\\" (as Tom puts it), searching for rights for these farm workers.<br /><br />What's really interesting on this DVD are the features.  This particular DVD you have to flip it to the special features.<br /><br />A prologue briefly explaining the background history of the Dust Bowl tragedy in the USA at that time.  The Fox MovieNotes newsreels that discuss the Midwest farmers drought.  And some of the actors getting their Oscars!<br /><br />The commentary by a film historian and a Steinbeck scholar were somewhat interesting, although their monotone chant and twenty-dollar words turned me off.  Still, I learned a lot about Steinbeck actually liking this film and how the American Farmer Association at the time wanted to boycott theaters that played this film.<br /><br />When the light of truth shines on these guys, even in a dramatized form, they can't stand it, obviously.<br /><br />The struggle of the migrant farmworker is not limited to the Mexican workers.  The white farmer of the Oklahoma/Arkansas area also met with resistance, suppression and violent, depressing conditions and starvation.<br /><br />John Ford's use of cinematic lighting (the candle) and special effects (the superimposed harvest machine blades, the black & white grainy looks) was amazing.  The film producers' creation of mood and depression was simply awesome and it seems Hollywood today has lost much of this cinematic art of the film!<br /><br />Now to read the book!

B000V4UFZK|3.0|This movie used to creep me out a lot when I was a kid. Bought it for my wife to see it. She was impressed.
B003ICWTR4|4.0|I saw this reviewed in several music mags and decided to buy it for my wife's next visit to the US, we are both Springsteen fans but missed the London concert.  Some of the older songs are just classic, Promised Land and Racing in the Street are awesome.  But how does one man get quite so sweaty, and with all that money why not change your shirt Bruce.  There were times when the running down to the crowd was a bit labored and in a few songs a bit less shouting and more singing would have been good, but all in all a very good set.  If you are a Sprignsteen fan you'll enjoy this and it's not expensive.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|What a great movie. The DVD had one pause fault but it is not a big deal, it did'nt freeze up.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|I know the movie is a great cult classic, but I haven't watched the director's cut. I heard from a friend that I shouldn't have gotten this version and just stuck to the original. Hopefully it's not too bad, though.
0439023513|3.0|I was completely enthralled with the first two books.  Unfortunately I felt disappointed with the third.  I felt like the only reason it was written was to finish up the trilogy and it didn't really enhance the first two.  After reading the first two, you know it's inevitable that there is a third, so the only reason I'd recommend this book is to finish off the series.
1582406723|1.0|This collection of the first six issues of the lengthy \\"The Walking Dead\\" series (soon to be a television series) suffers from the same defects as the whole current crop of comic books and graphic novels. They are all graphics-heavy and narrative-light. This is a perfect example: as narrative, it is boring and pointless. Even the graphics lean toward the pedestrian. Why the authors in the preface had the notion that these pasty panels would actually frighten anyone is beyond me. The only frightening thing about this volume is that it is followed by many others in the series.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Let me preface by saying that I love all kinds of music. From Country to Hip-hop, I love everything. My favorite band in the world is Dave Matthews Band, a band who much like ZBB is better live than in the studio. It took me a while to listen to \\"The Foundation\\" album because I wasn't immediately a fan of \\"Chicken Fried,\\" but \\"Whatever it is\\" brought me on board to the idea of listening to it, and when I heard \\"Highway 20 Ride\\" for the first time I knew it was an album that I needed to listen to. But let me get to this album. There are 18 tracks available. The deluxe edition has 16, and the iTunes version carries an additional two tracks.     Now to the music.... WOW. Zac Brown Band is the best band to come along in the last 5 years and \\"Colder Weather\\" is possibly the best song I have heard in the last 5. I remember hearing it for the first time. I was watching the ZBB webcast from Bonaroo on Youtube live, and they were playing a fantastic show. About half-way through Zac took a breather and told the crowd that he was about to sing a song that he considered the best he had ever written. I wasn't sure what to expect, but from that beautiful piano intro, I was hooked! I was so upset that I didn't have a copy of this song that I went looking everywhere for it. I finally discovered that the song was available on a Live CD that the band had released entitled \\"Pass The Jar\\" so I immediately scooped it up. And that's how this crazy ZBB fan was born.     This album is incredible! I don't know how else to say it. From the catchy and single worthy opener \\"Let It Go\\" to the upbeat jamboree of \\"Whiskeys Gone\\" to the INCREDIBLE \\"Martin\\", a song about a man of music and the importance of his guitar, this album shines. It is not a country album. It is an album with some country songs, but mostly this is an album of unadulterated music. This is music. There is no genre, there is no box to place this band in, they are simply musicians and they present themselves as such. Lyricallythis album is astounding, and much like Dave Matthews, Zac Brown WRITES all of his songs. You just don't find that often these days. So here's my take, song-by-song. Listen to this album! It is AMAZING!    1. Let It Go (10/10) - A catchy, singly worthy tune with a great hook. One of the best on the album    2. Knee Deep feat Jimmy Buffet (9/10)- this is more of a\\"toes\\" type song. It'll be great by the pool or on the beach next summer. Jimmy Buffet adds an increased island feel. Love it.    3. No Hurry (10/10) - Just a beautiful intro. I was hooked from second number one. Great lyrics, great musicality, very chill feel. Catchy chorus once again.     4. I Play the Road (9/10) - Another feel good song by the ZBB. Nothing sounds the same with this band, and the whole thing is filled with hooks that are memorable and delightful.     5. Cold Hearted (10/10) - Fantastic song about caring for someone who only hurts you with their cold heart. It reminds me of something from Motown almost. I'm not sure why, but it sounds familiar and different at the same time.     6. Whiskey's Gone (9/10) - The \\"Chicken Fried\\" of this album. This is one of the country songs on this album, but it's as great as most of the album.     7. Quiet Your Mind (10/10) - This song has a rock edge to it with this gospel inflection that's just amazing! QUIET YOUR MIND!    8. Colder Weather (20/10) - As I said above, it's the best song that I have heard in the last 5 years. It's perfectly written, produced, sung. Everything about this song is perfect. It's haunting, uplifting, full of imagery and essence. Absolute perfection. This song should be #1 for WEEKS.     9. Settle Me Down (9/10) -  Another great \\"toes\\" like summer/beach song. Fun, funky, reggae like. This band is not afraid to try different sounds.     10. As She's Walking Away - (9/10) This song features Alan Jackson and is the first single off the album. Great harmonizing, nice gospel feel to it. Great song, but not the best on the album.     11. Keep Me in Mind (10/10) - Just a jazzy/bluesy/reggae feel good love song. Can't stop listening to it. One of the album's best. It's unlike other ZBB songs.     12. Who Knows (10/10) - The ZBB loves to jam out in concert, much like DMB, and this is their foray into a jam sesh on a studio album. 10 minutes long. It's freaking amazing, and you can tell the band LOVES playing this song. I feel like I would hear this song somewhere on Beale Street in Memphis from a band that simply loves playing music and exciting a crowd. This song does that for sure!    13. Martin (11/10) - WOW! I play guitar (as best I can haha). I've have my depressing moments in life, and there's this feeling when times are their worst that your guitar is the only thing that has your back. I've written songs, poetry, and even tried to write my own song about my guitar that I thought was good, but this song blows it away. When he says \\"He is a good friend, And he has his own voice. And you get what you give; Sometimes it's just noise. But if you treat him well, He will last your life long. And if you're honest and open Well, he will write you a song.\\" Beauty and perfection    14. Make This Day (9/10)- This is my least favorite song on the album, but I understand why it might not be for others. Very upbeat. It's a catchy tune, but it just can't compare to the rest of this album.
B00006D295|4.0|Finally watched this after purchase. Spent years knowing I needed to see it because of friends who told me about it. Worth the buy.
030726999X|5.0|Awesome books...just finished the whole series and I could barely put them down. I bought the first one to take on my honeymoon and I read it in two days. I almost didn't buy it, because it didn't seem like the kind of book I am usually into being that it is kind of an action/suspense thriller. I recommend these books 100%.
0439023513|3.0|Following on the heels of the intensely popular \\"Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire,\\" many fans waited anxiously for the third installment of this intensely exciting series, only to be vastly disappointed.  \\"Mockingjay,\\" while providing the return of familiar characters, becomes more of a political commentary than a gripping story.  The level of writing does not compare to the rich detail of the first novel, and does not provide the same \\"edge of your seat\\" excitement.  This fan wishes Collins would have taken the extra time and made us wait for a novel that was better thought out, instead of rushed to print.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|My husband and I were on the edge of our seats during the whole season.  John Lithgow (as always) is AWESOME adversary for Dexter!  So many twist and turns you can't imagine...I would highly recommend purchasing, if you have not seen it.
0553807048|3.0|The author did a good job of capturing himself as he was: an arrogant, short sighted, drug induced, alcoholic financier of Wall St.  True, he was a genius when it came to making money by ripping people off with schemes.  As with everyone who spends a lot of hours working his trade, he became over confident and greedy then it all collapsed around him.  He is the epitome of what is wrong with Wall St. and our country in general at this time in our history.  It saddens me to know there are so many of them that exist and don't get caught.  And when they do get caught, they usually get a slap on the wrist for cooperating by turning their fellow cohorts into the feds then get let back out onto the streets to screw the little guy again.  Yes, he did prison time but not near enough time.  Up until the day he went to prison he really felt he wouldn't go there.  He felt the feds would look the other way while he was screwing his mistresses in his gold plated home.  Has he really changed as he says since getting out and losing everything that was near and dear to him?  Doubtful.  I gave this book to an acquaintenace to read because he too considers himself to be a genius.  He too is arrogant about who he is.  He felt the author was over the top with his actions and language and the author actually embarrassed him!  What's interesting is their excesses and language are exact mirrors of one another.  What does this have to say about people who consider themselves geniuses?  I guess I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks they are better than anyone else, uses drugs and alcohol to escape and even though they have a high IQ, speaks as though they live in the ghetto.  Or I would recommend you buy this book to give as a gift for that certain someone who thinks they're a genius and see if they can see themselves in the mirror.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|First let me say that I own both the Xbox 360 and PS3.  As far as the controllers are concerned, I much prefer the size and feel of the 360 controllers.  With the PS3 controller the base of my left thumb will hurt considerably after a few minutes.  As far as my review of this controller is concerned,  I highly recommend if you prefer the 360 controllers over the PS3.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I found the sticks responsiveness as good the PS3 controllers - no issues there<br />- The size and layout is exactly the same as the 360 controller (obviously having the same layout is great from a gaming consistency  perspective when switching back and forth between the PS3 and 360)<br />- The buttons are back lit with red light. Great for night time gaming given the light is subtle and therefore not distracting. Also, you can turn it off if you don't like it.<br />- Some reviewers have complained about the textured grips - I happen to like it given the controller is lighter than the 360's so it \\"sticks\\".<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The biggest issue is that you can NOT turn the PS3 console on via the remote (you CAN turn it off, however)<br />- This controller uses a USB dongle for the wireless connection, blue tooth would provide a more reliable connection.  As a result, you need a clear line of site to the console and is susceptible to \\"pillow/blanket\\" block.<br />- As mentioned, the controller is lighter than the 360 due to the 360's detachable battery. I prefer the extra weight of the 360.  It does have that \\"cheap\\" feel to it relative to the 360<br />- Lastly, it's made in China.<br /><br />I can't speak to the charge duration as I've had it for just a week, after a few weeks I'll update my review on that aspect.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good 360 controller for the PS3 and its allowed me to play PS3 games pain free.  As a result, I'm buying two more for back ups.
1440503257|5.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan who is married to an Englishman. Over the years I had learned from my mother-in-law how to make some of my husband's favorite dishes, but when we poured over this together he was so excited to see many things he hasn't eaten in ages. He was also ecstatic about the recipe for bangers, since he always says he misses English sausages. I also love how the author tells you exactly where each recipe came from and she included many fun tidbits of information! I am sure I will use this book more now than my Betty Crocker cookbook.

Even for a pessimistic \\"question asker\\" who was lacking in faith before reading The Secret and The Power, these books have already transformed my life and the way that I think. I feel happier, more positive, I have an abundance of faith and all other things that bring me joy and happiness.

B003YOMNCM|5.0|Hilary Hahn is, without too much question, one of America's most prominent classical musicians of recent times.  Her repertoire in both concerts and recordings ranges far and wide, from the various Bach concertos she recorded a few years ago with Jeffrey Kahane and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, to the big ones by Beethoven, Brahms, and Mendelssohn, and the early 20th century masterpieces by Schoenberg and Stravinsky.  On this particular recording, she cagily combines another warhorse of the concerto repertoire with a brand-new concerto by one of America's greatest composers of contemporary classical music.    The new work, in this case, is the 2008 Violin Concerto by Jennifer Higdon, a work that won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for music.  It is an exquisite and energetic piece, done in the traditional three-movement concerto form but without the traditional tempo markings; instead, the movements are marked with titles: \\"1726\\"; \\"Chacconi\\"; and \\"Fly Forward\\", and the vivid orchestration includes the glockenspiel, an instrument not heard everyday in orchestras much anymore.  The warhorse on this recording, meanwhile, is the D Major violin concerto of Tchaikovsky, indisputably up there with its Austro-German predecessors as a must-do for any violinist worth his or her salt.  Its popularity is amazing, given the fact that Leopold Auer, the violinist to whom the concerto was originally dedicated in 1878, declared the piece unplayable, thus delaying its world premiere for three years.  It is indeed a fiendishly difficult work to play, especially in the rapid-fire finale; and the fact that every great violinist has had to tackle it in concerts and on recordings means the stakes are raised ever higher for the next violinist.    Ms. Hahn, however, is more than up to the challenge on this recording, where, despite the 130-year difference between them, both the Tchaikovsky and Higdon violin concertos fit very well.  She is ably assisted by England's Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and their Russian-born music director Vasily Petrenko, The end result is not only one of the great classical recordings for 2010, but certainly among the best recordings from any genre this year.

0345479092|1.0|Tracy Hogg, the author, left her two young daughters to be raised by her mother in England when she moved to the United States.  That says it all.  This book is more about science than love.  She has some good ideas, but the presentation is too negative.  It's not accidental parenting, it's called LOVE!
B001BLSEPU|5.0|This is Elton John's autobiographical album, released in 1975. It basically tells the story of his life, from his humble beginnings to Rock Superstar of the seventies. There are thirteen tracks on this album, and all of them are great.   My personal favorite is \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\", because if its music, its  lyrics, and its stereo separation. Truly great music from a true rock artist! Put  this CD on your stereo and you will see for yourself. A true classic.
B000068TP0|5.0|another reviewer said that he was frustrated because all the songs in this dvd are in spanish.  hello, i think shakira is hispanic.  absolutely, the spanish songs  fit her very well.  the plus factor to this unplugged live concert dvd is that this presents shakira up close which is better than a ringside seat.  it is as if you are there up on the stage with her.  she is  an ultimate performer who gives more than 100% standard of excellence.  she can do this because of the great band that backs her up.  all the songs performed here are her greatest hits so it's worth the price you pay and the enjoyment seeing her emote all those numbers.  this lady unquestionably has an inborn talent for singing and entertaining plus she's oozing with sex appeal.  gloria estefan's husband surely made the right decision in giving this girl a break.  the moment she belts out her song you know that it is shakira because of the extraordinary quality of her voice and her style of singing which differentiates her from the other hispanic lady singers whose singing styles are common and boring.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a different style for Sparks and throughly enjoyed it.  Hated to see it end.  Recommend to all.  I don't know what all the bad reviews are for because of cost, alot of other proper authors new releases are the same price.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|After ten long years of warring abroad, Sir Robert Loxley has at last come home to Nottingham, except that Nottingham is not his real home or is his name truly Robert Loxley. A common archer, a veteran of the bloody Crusades, Robin Longstride has stepped into a nobleman's shoes to fulfill an oath sworn on blood. There's very much this whiff of THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE.<br /><br />Elsewhere in 12th century England, with the death of his brother King Richard the Lion Heart, the hedonistic Prince John ascends to the throne, only to inherit a near impoverished realm. And since John has never been the most stable of royals, his reign is launched on a tenuous note. King John rapidly imposes a crippling tax policy which then revolts the Norman barons.<br /><br />King Philip of France senses welcome strife within the English borders and seizes the opportunity to deploy his invasion fleet, and this spearheaded by the turncoat Sir Godfrey, former confidante to King John. From this backdrop of war and displeasure and deceit, Robin Hood emerges.<br /><br />I think I'll never tire of new reimaginings of these iconic literary figures, from Sherlock Holmes to Zorro to Robin Hood, and a few others. Manly man Russell Crowe and old guy Ridley Scott reunite in this try at redefining the Robin Hood mythos, or at least they offer a peek at the man behind the legend, perhaps place him in a more historically accurate context (Is that the Magna Carta I see that King John is sneering at?). This incarnation is certainly gritty and earthy and more brooding than other recent adaptations. It's certainly more serious, more ambitious than Kevin Costner's opus. It sets the stage for Robin Longstride's evolving into the legendary Robin of the Hood, depicts what Robin Hood was like before he was Robin Hood.<br /><br />The action is infrequent. You'll be disappointed if you come in seeking non-stop thrills and spills and constant feats of astounding archery. This movie takes its time telling its story, sets a leisurely pace. Action junkies might think it slow. Robin Longstride arrives at Nottingham only after an hour into the film, and the story then builds his presence as the English lord returned from the battles and getting to know his villagers, getting accepted by them. So that when Robin later rallies the contentious troops, you do get the sense that he's earned that place in the sun. Russell Crowe carries enough gravitas to pull this off with ease. Trivia: Ridley Scott had asked Russell to mimic the hair and beard of Maximus from GLADIATOR for this project. Because if you're gonna lift from something, why not lift from your own movie?<br /><br />Cate Blanchett as Lady Marion Loxley is most awesome, not at all that classic helpless maid in need of rescuing. Cate's fierceness and intelligence make her a pound for pound match for Russell Crowe's brawny presence. I would never have thought of Cate Blanchett in this role, but she is riveting, again.<br /><br />This being a fresh spin, certain stuff looks distorted; some of the Robin Hood tropes have been swept aside. In fact, if you were to replace these very familiar names, this story may well be unrecognizable. This is before Robin became Robin Hood, so it makes sense that there aren't much of those forest outlaw shenanigans or merry men scampering around. What we get, instead, are grimy orphan boys hiding out in Sherwood Forest, a subplot that doesn't get fleshed out enough (although, okay, it's already a long enough movie). No famous first encounter at the bridge between Robin and Little John; instead, we get a shell game. Tuck is not only a friar, he's also a beekeeper. Instead of Sir Guy of Gisbourne, we get Sir Godfrey who, as played by the always sinister Mark Strong, seems vile enough. Even more tellingly, the Sheriff of Nottingham barely registers a presence, although he is seen ogling the fair Lady Marion. So he's despicable, but not without good taste in women. Jeff Bridges as the royal purse holder, I think, strives for an English accent but doesn't really carry it off. But it doesn't hamper the film.<br /><br />I showed up for the myhos and the big battles. I stayed for the compelling period drama. Ridley Scott's ROBIN HOOD is, frankly, not as sweeping or epic as I had anticipated, and the battle scenes aren't so impressive or audacious. The story seldom allows Robin to spring into action. But the stuff going on between Robin and Marion keeps you engaged. I liked this movie quite a bit, but it's still not my favorite Robin Hood adaptation (that would be Errol Flynn's take on the thing, and then probably Sean Connery's). And if you've got a yen for more interpretations of Robin Hood but in book form, take a crack at Robin McKinley's THE OUTLAWS OF SHERWOOD or Parke Godwin's SHERWOOD. Ridley Scott's ROBIN HOOD gets 3.5 out of 5 stars out of me.older, I think, strives for an English accent but doesn't really carry it off.

B002JVWRAO|5.0|One of the best seasons so far... with the whole Apocalypse thing, each episode is possessed with great special and visual effects that will blow your mind. You'll see more demons, angels and a lot of Dean, Sam and even Castiel... so get possessed by demons or blessed by angels but this is a Supernatural season you can not missed.
0307463745|4.0|Well worth getting if:  1. You know you spend too much time on sorting rather than doing.  2.You need an antidote to presentee-ism.  3. You have  a life outside work and you want to work smarter.  4. You are setting up your own business and are being several departments at once.  5. You want to focus on impact rather than time spent.  6. You need a boost.  7. You only get  a chance to read at night and need short chapters before taken over by the snooze!    I am bought it because I am 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7.    It is a good companion piece to Timothy Ferriss.    Enjoy.
0312600844|2.0|Jonathan Frantzen is unquestionably an excellent writer. This book, however, suffers from a critical lack of a red pen as well as a surplus of polemic politcobabble. I downloaded it because it seemed to be the 'must-read' book of the season, and I hacked my way through it over the course of two weeks, reading a book or two in between when the density overtook me. Overall, I was left with the impression of a wall of words in which not much happened.    The book is centered on Walter and Patty, two stereotypical middle-class yups with a set of baggage to carry around. Walter is set up as a stereotypical Good Guy who we don't actually know much about until about mid-novel. Patty is The Bored Housewife who gave up her ambition to correct the mistakes her own parents made. Their two kids, Joey and Jessica, of course come with a set of luggage themselves, and are drawn to apparently personify the Youth of Today. Finally, we have Richard, Walter's best friend, a musician who again is a cardboard cutout of a burned-out rocker.     The problem with the book is that none of these characters are particularly interesting. In the attempt to give us a broad characterization of different generations, the actual characters are lost. There's an awful lot of whining and rending of shirts going on here, with the sound and fury signifying nothing. Most of these folks don't change, and the two who do make their transformations in either a simply unrealistic or overly dull manner. Meanwhile, the novel is overlaid with all the extreme political views of the day that represent only the fringes of both ends of the political spectrum.    I will say this though: Frantzen got the bit about modern-day rage completely right. And there is a pretty solid insight in here about what lies beneath the outer veneer of human beings, which can only be revealed by listening carefully to another perspective. Unfortunately the good stuff was buried in a nearly-impenetrable forest of verbiage.

0312600844|3.0|One of the more common complaints for poor characterization in novels is the lack of distinguishable and familiar flaws coupled with intriguing inner conflict.  Have no fear - \\"Freedom\\", the much anticipated follow-up to author Jonathan Frazen's 2001 novel \\"The Corrections\\", has a surplus of these commodities within the Berglund family, Patty's neuroticism and transparency, Walter's fierce political rhetoric but emotional timidity and Joey's arrogance and superficiality being mere appetizers at a banquet of imperfection.  Like fluorescent lighting, Franzen brings out only the worst in everyone when the book begins and it is this negative posture that sets the tone for the rest of the novel.  Each of his main characters is rich in supply of every off-putting stereotype of affluent WASPs and though these people are highly educated, the irony that propels the story is how incredibly stupid they can all be despite it.  Walter knows Patty is not entirely devoted to him but still he clings to her and marries her despite her obvious interest in his best friend and aspiring musician Richard Katz; Joey, believing himself to be the smartest person in the room, marries a girl he's not even sure he loves while involving himself in shady business dealings that nearly ruin him; Patty, a woman who has long craved the kind of intimate relationships she never had with her own family, consistently closes herself off to Walter, choosing instead to find a confidante within her son and have an affair with someone (Richard) who discards women like used napkins.<br /><br />I complained consistently throughout the reading of this novel that I couldn't find much to like about any of the characters within it.  Now, at the completion of it, I find myself rendered strangely speechless.  Although \\"Freedom\\" made quite an impression on me, I hesitate to call it a work of genius as so many critics have.  The guy is just writing what he knows about and let's face it - we've all known elements of these characters in the people we've met in our lives, however long or short those lives may be.  Of all his defective creatures, I dislike Patty the most.  I despise the emergent narcissist within her, the gossip, the depressive and self-pitying woman who is consistently starving for flattery and praise but seems to gain no psychological nourishment from it.  At the same time I forgive her for it all because Franzen has inadvertently made of her a mirror to which my own worst characteristics have been reflected, and I don't doubt that some or all of \\"Freedom\\" is his own self-reflection.  With all that time to think and write, how does one avoid it?<br /><br />The book is also heavily peppered with Franzen's personal politics (the flavor of it is overwhelming at times and bogs down parts of the book as a result). He makes his views known by revering avian wildlife and overstating the havoc that house cats wreak upon their numbers, by slyly spitting on conservative views and discouraging human procreation due to the devastating effects of overpopulation the world over.  I also think the man knows well about depression; I wonder if this book took nine years to compose because Franzen himself became mired in the invisible eddy of sadness and chronic dissatisfaction that befalls nearly every one of his characters.<br /><br />And now \\"Freedom\\", like his novel before it, is an Oprah pick, made even more prestigious and desirable simply by affixing that famous \\"O\\" logo on the cover.  Strong as his desire was and still is to be taken seriously as a writer, I guess he realized in the end that if he couldn't beat her (and he was very publicly criticized for trying), he may as well join her.  After all, what writer would be crazy enough to refuse a most assured spot on the NY Times Best Seller List in a day and age where celebrity endorsement equals instant success?  And hey - it's OPRAH; if the woman were any more deified, she'd be God.<br /><br />I can tell you right now thatthis book is going to be made into a movie (if it's not in production already - things move so quickly in the entertainment industry anymore) and that movie is going to be hard to watch, let alone hard to absorb within the confines of the written word.

0812550706|4.0|I remember reading this in Analog back in the `70's, loved it.  As a young teenager I was enamored with Ender's youth, intelligence, and ability to lead \\"troops\\" so well.  When Ender's Game came out in paperback long ago I picked it up and was once more in love with the story.  While Mr. Card had added to the story, the additions hadn't taken away what I enjoyed but made for a more rounded story.  Now, after many more years I wanted to see if Ender's Game still had the magic for me that it once had.  I'd forgotten some details but rapidly they flowed out of the story s Mr. Card brought Ender to life.  I was amazed once again at how ruthless he could be when provoked but desiring of peace and love at the same time.  Once more Ender observed his enemy for me, picking out little details, finding ways to maximize his own advantage in an environment where he's the new person.  Ender is Alexander the Great, that simple.<br /><br />Rating wise this one falls into the 4 to 4.5 star range.  While Mr. Card does a great job telling his story, parts left me wanting...  While we see Ender's soul he moves without heart.  Part of this is the detached nature of Ender.  We see and feel Ender, his thoughts about people, his way of thinking, all is flat.  While Ender is special, all of the \\"kids\\" at Battle School are special.  Given that all are special and that Ender is a little more so that most you begin to wonder why he's as detached as he is, why is he Alexander the Great (after all, Ender didn't have people educating him about space warfare prior to Battle School).  Because of this lack of heart I had to take a little away.  I'll also say quite frankly that I didn't remember the ending that well and after reading it again I now remember why, it's weak; Mr. Card should have either ended the story with the end of the war or taken another 50-100 pages to clean it up and possibly have made this a 5 star book.
0811870413|5.0|I am in love with this book. It is very sexy. I just want to be alone with it all day. It is what I have always wanted, a long, personal dissertation on bread making that is at times poetic, \\"I had fallen in love with the sweet, creamy flavor of bread fermented with wild yeast leaven...I wanted a deep auburn crust to shatter between my teeth, giving way to tender, pearlescent crumb. I wanted my baker's signature, the score made with a blade on top, to rise and fissure, and the crust to set with dangerous edges.\\"  Several things make this book on bread stand out from others. First of all, Chad Robertson. We have never met. I've never tasted his bread. But this book is full of his integrity. He shares his recipe with us - every true step. He wants us to succeed. He explains with effective thoroughness; and to be sure we understand the words, each direction has a photograph. Not just any photograph, these are all works of beauty from a man who surely has as much love for the project as the author. Eric Wolfinger was (is?) an actual baker at Tartine, and his exquisite photographs abound here. Another thing that makes this book enjoyable for me, is the inclusion of test baker's experiences. Photos and stories from some inexperienced (and experienced) bread bakers, taking on Chad's recipe for the first time - all successful by the way.  I've been baking bread at home for years, sometimes with my own sourdough levain. I have trouble keeping it alive in the fridge, or building up it's strength to bake a new loaf; but Chad explains things so well that I feel I can finally UNDERSTAND my levain and we might be able to develop a long and lasting relationship.  Lovely stories. Lovely photos. Lovely book.
1439165645|4.0|As an avid read and avid foodie I was thrilled when my book club selected this title (at NPR's suggestion).  I enjoyed the book as a foodie and the insight it gave into haute cuisine, but as literature, it left many things to be desired.  Some things were critical events and never discussed again, others were all tied up in a too-tidy bow at the end.      Main character Hasan starts out an angry confused teen in India who is very introspective for the reader.  As he travels the world and rises in the French Haute Cuisine scene, he loses his depth, interest and introspection (his himan side).      While this book did not strike me as serious literature, that does not take it out of contention for an enjoyable summer read.  Especially if you are a foodie.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Very educational and well put together documentary.  Really touches basics on how and why our food industry does what it does and how they become the winners; while us, wanting to eat 'real, organic, natural from nature' foods are the losers who have to continue to fight against a main-stream money making industry where profit is the highest gain, not our health.  Watched it on Net-Flix a few times.  I always buy organic and raw and support our smaller growers because of the added health benefits and hopes they will be able to compete more effectively with the top conglomerates who rule in food manufacturing.

055357342X|2.0|I loved the first two books of the series, but just can't get myself to finish this one (about 600 pages into it). Why? Because the characters are constantly doing stupid things. Anything to get into more trouble.     In the first two books, the characters always felt honest. Their choices made sense to me even when the paths they picked were the dangerous ones. But in this book, the characters simply seem reckless -- especially King Rob and his mother. They just seem to do whatever it takes to get into deeper trouble, even when that course is obviously pointless.  The series started to be a problem for me with Theon. Why does he do anything? As far as I can tell, he's there to make sure some characters make stupid choices later on. When that's finished, so is Theon. Just pointless.     At any rate, the first book is simply great. But I'm deeply disappointed with this one.
1416550534|5.0|For a debut novel, I hope that Kate Morton can continue to wow her audience as she did me in this novel.  Others have summarized the plot, so I will stick to my interpreation of her story telling skills.  Though the story is rather long, she kept the pace moving very well and shifted between past and present with tremendous skill.  Her character development was very well done - one could bump into Grace on the street and know her immediately.  The development of Hannah and Emmeline over the years was also carefully detailed.  You watched them grow as Grace did.  Overall I was very impressed with the amount of feeling I developed for these characters, and I was very sad when I reached the end of this well told story.
B001992NW4|5.0|Truly the scariest movie of all time and this movie was filmed in 1973 without all the computerized special effects of today's horror movies!!!!
1439181780|5.0|I was excited to know that a second book was released from Rhonda Byrne, simply because I needed to know understand the subtle \\"power' behind the \\"The Secret\\" in order for me to fully inculcate the teachings.      Now having read the book, I truly appreciate and understand that I have the 'Power' in my hands and therefore I can transform my life now.  This is the most important message from the book 'The Power'.    The book teaches one the very subtle lesson of the power of our thoughts and how every second should be spent in a worthwhile way.
0553805371|4.0|I agree with many of the arguments made in the book. Much of current theory was already developed when I was a student in the 1970's and recent theories explain much of what didn't seem to match theory then.<br /><br /> I remember in undergraduate and graduate chemistry quantum mechanics and modern physics classes being puzzled by facts like: when two hydrogen atoms approach each other, their electrons seem to telegraph a signal to each other before contact that they must have the opposite spins in order not to violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle so they can bond and form H2 - the normal way hydrogen gas exists in nature. Extensions of Feynman's work, explained in this book, can account for that.<br /><br />And I'm not one to claim that a deity is necessary for the existence of the universe as we know it.<br /><br />But while the theories presented in the book are fascinating and a great read, I still find the arguments in this book to fail in two ways:<br /><br />The basic conclusion of this book is that one theory explains our universe because it's the only candidate theory that fits. How egotistical! In the 1890's Thomson's \\"Plum Pudding Model\\" of the Atom was the only theory that fit but, as Rutherford's Experiment eventually showed, it didn't fit forever and all along other theories were possible but no one had yet thought of them.<br /><br />Secondly, the book discusses \\"elegance\\" in theories early on in the book, and then drifts far from it as the book rolls on!  Scientific elegance is based on the idea that nature is basically simple and symmetrical and a theory should be relatively simple and straightforward. The Ptolemaic system of the universe with the Earth in the center relied on complicated wheels upon wheels to explain planetary and star motion. It was too complicated to make sense.  Yet, the book wants us to believe that a combination of overlapping theories -each of which only explains a small part of the overall universe- is elegant???<br /><br />Personally, I've always felt the current theories of sub-atomic matter are NOT elegant and we have therefore probably missed some very important and simplifying point and I've wished a concept would occur to me that would generate a new theory. It hasn't, so I don't claim current theories are wrong, simply that they are theories -not scientific laws! Perhaps a similar conclusion should have been made by this book - which would not diminish its arguments in any way except to say the authors, like J.J. Thomson, don't know it all!>Personally, I've always felt the current theories of sub-atomic matter are NOT elegant and we have therefore probably missed some very important and simplifying point and I've wished a concept would occur to me that would generate a new theory.

B001992NUQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie, no doubt about it.  I loved it on DVD.  I love it even more now that it's on BD.  The video quality is superb with very little to no excess film grain.  The color is balanced, as is the black level in darker scenes (this is a very dark movie, after all).  What really blew me away was the sound!  I thought the DTS track sounded pretty nice on the DVD, but wait until you hear this movie in lossless format!  The dialogue is so clear, the impact of punches, kicks and explosions is so real, you really feel like you're listening to the action live.  The menus are also very clever.  If you owned the DVD version that had the red FBI warning screen when the disc started playing (the one that made fun of you if you wasted your time reading the pointless warning), you can expect more entertainment on BD.  I'm a huge David Fincher fan.  Get this movie and enjoy it again and again.        I am Jack's Inflated Sense of Accomplishment.
B00005JPUN|3.0|I think the reason people rate this movie down is that you never see a lead actress naked, like in other remakes. Guys, that's not a reason to hate a film. There are plenty of great movies without any nudity, believe me. Haha, okay so anyway, I just wrapped up the 1978 version, and really, I believe it comes down to personal taste. After my third watching of The Invasion, I can safely say that I prefer it to Kaufman's gritty dirge of a film. Yes, the ending is terribly lazy, but I wasn't especially thrilled at how Kaufman's film ended, either. The 1994 remake is still probably my favorite, but this is definitely not bad. Although, the blood/viral animations portrayed in the lab are a bit cheap, the zombie who becomes abruptly conscious and grabs at her when she tries to take it's picture is stupid, there's an odd jump cut at 44:22, when she leaves her car in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and starts to run from some zombies, she looks back, the camera cuts, and in the next shot she's continuing the same motion of looking back over her shoulder but she's now in the middle of downtown. Odd. Also, the concept of transmitting the \\"disease\\" by vomit is indeed disgusting and stupid. The scene on the subway where vomit is being shot through the air like spitting cobra venom is awful. Luckily, they portray it only once in the beginning, and twice in the middle, and then I think you don't have to see it again. Despite these legitimate criticisms, I find the film to be substantially immersive and enjoyably suspenseful, with Kidman as a worthy heroine.

0307454541|1.0|I was pretty excited to read this book and even enjoyed the setup and the mystery of the flowers on the wall but it was all down hill from there. Written for a teenager this story was neither well written nor interesting. I read this for a book club and there wasn't a single person who thought it was any good.  I have no idea why this has garnered so much interest.<br /><br />I also watched the movie, which was almost as bad as the book. I think people like this book simply because somebody on TV told them it was good.
B001UREJWM|4.0|The unexpected swansong of Ronnie James Dio was 2009's best heavy metal album, a relatively inspired reunion of the late model Black Sabbath. Even if they took the name Heaven and Hell because of legal entanglements over the Sabbath moniker, this is kind of molten lava sludge burning that the quartet excelled on for [[ASIN:B001EOOQEM Heaven & Hell]] and [[ASIN:B00382X4X2 Mob Rules]].<br /><br />Iommi in particular seems recharged here, his riffing is better than anything since the underrated \\"Headless Cross.\\" Dio is his usual leather-lunged self and, in a more unusual twist, is not dwelling on his usual dungeons and dragons lyrical philosophy. \\"Rock and Roll Angel\\" comes close to that realm, but the bulk of the songs are back to vintage Sabbath looks at the misery of the world, as oblique as the songs may be. This is at an absolute peak on \\"Bible Black,\\" where an old man finds the ultimate book of evil, but can't escape its demonic lure. Naturally, the band rips into this song like raw steak.<br /><br />In fact, only twice does \\"The Devil You Know\\" falter, and that's on the ridiculous \\"Eating The Cannibals\\" and the record company diatribe \\"The Turn of The Screw.\\" There's plenty of morbid to make up for it, like the creepy organ that opens \\"Follow The Tears\\" or the migraine marches on of \\"Breaking Into Heaven.\\" It's an honorable way to pulverize, and if Dio had to go out on any album, \\"The Devil You Know\\" is as good an exit as he could have been associated with.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This one always makes me wonder-who is the beauty and who is really the beast?   This is one of our all-time favorites.  We lost our original DVD copy in a recent move and have been eagerly anticipating its re-release.      The fact that it is coming out on Blu-Ray can only enhance the earlier improvements made when the movie was released on dvd.  We are looking forward to seeing the Blu-Ray version.
B000024FRW|2.0|Whether prodded by the record company or being a willing participant, the concept was solid in having Iggy Pop remix \\"Raw Power.\\" Unfortunately, his heavy metal \\"wall of sound\\" blasts any opportunity of setting the record straight on the endless debate/sniping by fans and critics on the original project, while also enhancing the larger-than-life legacy of the album and The Stooges.<br /><br />Those who have collected the variety of releases that feature demos/mixes of the eight tracks will hear the hard rock sound from those tapes, which follows the revolutionary trail being carved by Led Zeppelin and a departure from the path of the original line-up that was paved by The Doors. But the amped up digital distortion is like hearing Motorhead at a gig that has a malfunctioning sound system. It even blurs the iconic and timeless lyrics that often strike hard with a flaming stick at the ugliness of the beautiful people in pop culture. The \\"red zone\\" sound works best on \\"I Need Somebody,\\" with the price of admission better served through the lengthy interview of Iggy that dominates the booklet.<br /><br />Iggy had botched the mix in 1973, which forced David Bowie to enter the studio very late in the game to save the project from ending up in a dusty vault by stripping away \\"layered\\" guitars, keyboards, backing vocals and percussion. Bowie slightly opened a door that found punk rockers smashing down a few years later, while clutching what was then the mostly forgotten and dismissed album. That movable structure is slammed shut by Iggy and you can't come in.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|When I watched the third season on TV, I was not overly impressed, but still enjoyed it.  However, I ordered the third season and discovered that there are truly \\"layers\\" of comedy on this show.  You have to watch the episodes more than once to catch all of them.  It is so refreshing to have something on television not geared to the low-brows among us.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|This movie was enjoyable and full of unforgettable new characters. It nice to see Disney head back to Louisiana, the last time they were down there was in the original rescuers movie. This new Disney princess isn't a princess at all.  She's a hard-working middle class girl with a dream.  One she is willing to work for.  The fact that good triumphs over evil yet again may not be entirely realistic but, we don't always go to the movies for realism do we?  This movie left me feeling hopeful and cooking gumbo at my daughter's request.  Princess and the Frog is an enjoyable and uplifting way to spend a couple of hours.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I have to count myself among those who, in the final 15 minutes of the final episode, felt like I had been royally conned. Essentially, you can watch the first season and the last episode or two and get as much out of it as watching the entire series. Yes, there were some exciting, intriguing aspects to the show, but to find out that they were ultimately just filler with no real point throws a bucket of water over any of the \\"good\\" parts. It's not the lack of ultimate answers, it's the lack of any resolution to the stories. People who go on about the characters seem to forget that the characters are pretty stock and only developed through the mysteries and action on the show. Otherwise, they were pretty bland.

B003XWEQ1G|2.0|I finally saw this movie on television recently and I stand by my review.<br /><br />Though I'm a Russell Crowe fan, Crowe's age was an issue here for me.<br />Russell was too old for this part and appears overweight and winded. In the time of Robin Hood, a 46 yr old man was OLD.  I could not see Crowe as a passionate and spritely youth running through the forests committing deeds of daring-do.  I'd have prefered to see a young man of about 20-25 play the part, as that would have rung truer.<br />As for Cate Blanchett, as beautiful and talented as she is, she's also too old here.  Marion was a teenage maiden, not a 40 yr old widow.<br /><br />Now to the story... they threw in everything here but the kitchen sink.<br />Robin Hood is made out to be the literal savior of England and the creator of the phrase \\"A man's home is his castle\\" and his father to be the originator of the Magna Carta! ...Sheezz... The whole film feels ponderous and Crowe lacks charisma.<br /><br />Judging from other reviews herein and that this film was pulled from theaters in my area in less than a week, it seems to have been a box office bust.<br /><br />FYI: There's a female extra in one scene, standing in front of a royal reception lineup, appearing totally out of place. She looks like a Hollywood Housewife who's had too much plastic surgery and wearing far too much makeup, totally breaking the scene.  She must've actually been someone's wife who wanted to be in the film. (chuckle)<br />The only good thing good about this film is the authentic 'look' it has, except for that Hollywood Housewife.<br /><br />>>> Better 'Robin Hood' films are:<br />1930's Errol Flynn's version 'Robin of Sherwood'<br />1990's Patrick Bergin & Uma Thurman version<br /><br />>>> 'Robin Hood' films to skip:<br />This one, and the Kevin Costner version.

It's like the Emperor is wearing no clothes and everything is pretending he is.  This book is bad and the people who are calling it the all-american novel are not very well read.

I rewind some parts so I can get more details about the mystery and better understand what clues the author unfolded.<br /><br />I am a computer engineer that looking into computer security at the moment. Having such a book as a reference was great opportunity to describe how vulnerable we all to computer frauds and how simple is it to penetrate to our computer system and review our emails, photos, documents. Some of it is fiction and most of it is reality.<br /><br />Few words about child and women abuse which was the hard part of the book. Those parts are not recommended for young readers. The description in the book is hard to digest and interpret especially the sadism parts. I may be naive but are there still people doing sadism?

B001GCUO5W|2.0|SHUTTER ISLAND, the Martin Scorsese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is one picture I really wanted to like but didn't. I just couldn't.  SHUTTER ISLAND is slow, pretentious, stilted, and clich&eacute;. The ending is worthy of M. Night Shamylan on a very bad day (which is saying a lot considering his many failures.) But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays a US Marshall who is headed to SHUTTER ISLAND to find out what happened to an escaped mental patient. There he meets Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow who are the scientists in charge of the place. After several CGI flashbacks, we learn that DiCaprio's character was a witness to the infamous \\"Dachau Massacre.\\" You'll realize, after the movie is over, that this has no bearing whatsoever on the movie, despite a good amount of time being spent on it. (The film's account of the incident also seems to be at odds with the contemporary history.) We also learn, through flashback and clumsy exposition, that he is on SHUTTER ISLAND for a very personal reason - to find the man that killed his wife, whom he still sees in visions. So we have maximum security mental hospital on a secluded island with only one way off. Did I mention they are in the middle of a hurricane? And all their electricity goes out? And the crazies escape? And there's a horde of rats? And... And none of that even matters to the movie, but it's all in there. There are secret messages, warnings, crazies who seem sane, the obligatory shock therapy and frontal lobotomies, and an ending that for the life of me I believe was tacked on at the last minute just because. It's as though they took elements from several movies and soldered them together. It just doesn't work.<br /><br />All-in-all, I cannot recommend SHUTTER ISLAND.  There are many better movies for each of the genres that this film tries to represent. Here's a sample:<br /><br />-  Mental Health: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest<br />-  1950's Crime Drama: L.A. Confidential<br />-  Stuck on an Island: And Then There Were None<br />-  I See Dead People: Sixth Sense<br />-  Escaping from a Prison on an Island: Escape From Alcatraz<br /><br />For a much more entertaining evening, watch one of these instead.Confidential  -        Stuck on an Island: And Then There Were None  -        I See Dead People: Sixth Sense  -        Escaping from a Prison on an Island: Escape From Alcatraz    For a much more entertaining evening, watch one of these instead.
0316098337|5.0|Five year old Jack captured me within the first sentence. This book could not languish on the nightstand.  It demands to be read.<br /><br />Emma Donoghue's use of language, storyline and pacing are simply incredible.  Jack and Ma were so 3D that I could see them in every paragraph and feel their often contradictory emotions, their fear, their strength and most of all their love for one another. She writes a complex contemporary psychological drama from Jack's viewpoint.<br /><br />As the narrator Jack could have been easily too precious or too precocious. He was neither.  Jack is written with equal amounts restraint and exuberance.  Emma Donoghue climbs into a child's mind and heart, never letting you forget his world is founded in and 11 X 11 garden shed that he shares with Ma.  He cannot believe the world outside Room is real.  Ma knows only too well that it is and their continued survival depends on escaping Room.  The remainder of the book is written just as perfectly with Jack telling you his and Ma's entire story.<br /><br />Excellent read!

B003LL3NOK|4.0|I love ALL the Romero Zombie flicks new and old alike, including this one!!! I hope this is a continuing series without large gaps in years like others and without jumping all over the place and changing characters. If you liked the past Romero Zombie installments you will like this one too, plenty of action and Zombie head popping too!!!
B000002KXV|5.0|Well most of you bump into Donald Fagen because you like Steely Dan's work. But then Steely's music ends with Steely. Donald Fagen is very different. If you find the music to be one of the Halloween tunes to begin with, then listen to it from the start till the end patiently without pauses. And my personal 2cent worth of additional advice - read Donald's vivid imagination on the album's concept. Once you get that concept right, this album makes you feel that freak, that genius behind this amazing artwork in music which is simply extraordinary. There are not many albums that can realize an artist's impression of music so beautifully. You will develop the next level of taste for some of the finest works in music with this album and I can assure you the journey will keep getting better every time you go spinning this album.     I want to congratulate Donald on this masterpiece and Thank him for taking all of us on this eternal journey of Nightfly!
0545265355|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I am through the first two and am waiting for the third because I don't want it to end. What a great story. The author keeps you hanging from a cliff at the end of each chapter. You can't believe what is comning next. Hope to see more like it!!!
B000002UZU|4.0|Great double CD with Canned Heat (with Alan Wilson, his last recording before he died) and John Lee Hooker, Sr., the master of Detroit boogie. Canned Heat plays as a back-up band (Bob Hite, their lead singer, didn't even perform). It was obvious how impressed Hooker was with Alan Wilson, as he says on the CD. Certainly worth purchasing if you are a Hooker fan and Canned Heat played with their legendary knowledge of blues/boogie. Highly recommended.
B000YAA68C|2.0|I search for movies I can watch with my teen children and the reviews indicated this would be allright.  What they didn't say was that Harry Connick's character talked about using prostitutes, and having two ex-girlfriends who are now in a relationship with each other.  In an odd twist, Swank's character (while receiving letters from her deceased husband) has a one-night stand with a man she's just met.  Please!  After being married to Gerard Butler?  Kathy Bates (mom) could have added a badly-needed element of depth to show Swank's journey through grief.  Lisa Kudrow, as Hilary's pal, was a shallow one-dimensional character who was ruthlessly looking for a man to marry - another misfire which could have been developed to add depth and contrast to Swank's grieving process if her character had been better developed. There were touching moments between Butler and Swank, and it was a great cast and concept, but the tacky elements left a bad taste.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|RocknRolla  I think is easily Guy Richie's best film.  I don't think there's much character development going on. But it's such a good time that I didn't care. It's stylish and fun and pretty near as good as Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />  The film has a great cast and a kick ass score. The music almost steals the show it's so good. However, Toby Kebbell as a junkie is the actor that steals the show. Everyone is good, but it's Kebbell who's performance was Oscar worthy.<br /><br />  I should also mention that I think Gerald Butler also does his best work. The way he reacts when one of his friends in his gang confesses to wanting him, is hilarious. While his dance scene with Thandie Newton is about as strange and fun as John Travolta's with Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />  Speaking of Newton she's her sexiest here as Butler's boss who sends him on life threating errands that she sees as easy jobs.  While Tom Wilkinson gives one of his best performances as a scummy mob boss. No one plays that part better than Wilkinson I think. He was awesome in Batman Begins and is just as good here. The actor who played Archie was also brilliant, I think it's Mark Strong, not sure.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|Be willing to suspend belief and hang on for one special effect after another.  There's nothing offensive for kids . . . the bad guys are bad and the good guys are heroes.  While not a comedy, the movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously, delivering a balanced mix of drama and tongue-in-cheek humor.
B0009PEYGM|5.0|Only great artists - and Truls Mork is definitely one of them - can approach Bach's works with that magic combination of austerity and warmth - yet, their relative proportion is something of a mystery - that makes his music so uniquely alive and expressive. Written as six distinct opuses, each conceived in six movements, the Suites for cello solo belong to the purest Baroque style and are cornerstones on the road of artistry for any cellist aiming to secure for himself/herself a place in the Music Olympus. Besides the technical ability in mastering the instrument, a special kind of sensitivity is required on the part of the interpreter in order to supply the ease of conveying the deepest meanings and the proper moods of each movement. The sober, imposing or intimate atmosphere in a certain suite is set from the very beginning. Each Prélude contains the seeds of the ensuing numbers Allemande, Courante, Sarabande and a dance - Menuet, Bourrée or Gavotte - to conclude with a Gigue. One can state that there are six different trajectories throbbing passionately under a very austere glaze with sharp edges and polyphony-suggesting textures. Mork's vision of the six suites is seductive, as he knows how to differentiate each nuance, how to attack each phrase, how to stage each colour and timber to erect worlds of ethereal beauty. His involvement asserts for a keen personal conception. The exquisite result owes, of course, its noble shine mainly to Johann Sebastian, but maybe a quite equal amount of distinction is brought by Truls Mork's deep empathy with such a great music and his wonderful instrument (a precious Montagnaga 1723).
B003UYUQZW|4.0|Full of exciting escapades and narrow escapes.  Great stunts and an appealing hero.  The relationship between Dastan and Tamina lacked a certain chemistry, but they are engaging and fun nevertheless.  The bad guys were stereotypical, but hey! it's based on a video game...   A nice surprise was the anachronistic humorous quips from Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), and the beautiful backdrops.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo has been my favorite cartoon for years. I never get tired watching it with my 8 y.o. daughter. There is so much depth and warmth to it, so much humor and wisdom. It is the masterpiece. I highly recommend it to every parent who cares about the worldview of his/her child/ren.

0545265355|5.0|I received the first book for my birthday and then had to immediately go out and buy the other two books so I could finish reading them, too.  I had read all 3 in 3 days--they are practically impossible to put down.    One thing I really like is that the main character is easy to relate to.  She's not too perfect or too mean, and very much reacts to things the way we might if in her situation.  She is fallible and struggles with decisions, but she is a good person trying to do what she must to survive.    I loved these books both as an amazing story and as a thought-provoking commentary on morals, people, and government, and what happens when people's freedom is taken away.  This would make for a great book group selection or book for a teenager and parent to read because the great discussions that these books can invoke!    Though a young adult series, this is absolutely great for adults, too... like myself.
B000JPIB8Y|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book but there were some very sad parts.I didn't think I could get thru it but the author does make it interesting. The best part is what happens to the killer. What comes around goes around.

B0026FCNK2|5.0|I watched this on VHS first, and then bought it two more times. Two weeks ago I watched the new Blu-ray version and loved it even more. And the bonus features were excellent as well. I can't remember seeing them all before. On this film, I've always enjoyed the writing, casting, directing, acting, special effects, production values, (you name it) and now it's a good Blu-ray. It has replaced the old DVD version in my \\"All-Time Hits\\" collection!

0345505387|2.0|I was looking forward to another Diana Gabaldon book as I am a huge fan of the Outlander series. This book just doesn't come close to adding anything to the series. The illustrations are fine for scenery, but the people all look alike so one cannot tell them apart and they all have an Oriental look to them. Jamie's \\"cat eyes\\" are not always blue as stated in the novels. The story line is ragged and really has no flow to it. Sorry, I will just wait until another Lord John book or Outlander novel is published.
0765328321|5.0|In the far future, humanity has mastered interstellar travel and has moved to colonize other worlds and systems. Earth has become unified under the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), which serves as the peacekeeper of all of our far-flung settlements. But things aren't all hunky dory as there are some who want to rebel against its authority, and yep, you still have criminal pirates that raid ships. Some in the UNSC fear that eventually even bigger threats will emerge as humans move ever further from the centralized authority of Earth.     A secret program, called the Spartan-II project, is initiated to breed and train the ultimate super-soldier. If successful, the genetically and bionically enhanced Spartan-IIs will be much stronger, faster, and intelligent than a normal human and serve as the go-to black ops arm of the UNSC. Unfortunately, just as the Spartan-II soldiers complete some of their first missions, a new and unexpected threat arrives on the scene. We have our first alien contact with beings calling themselves \\"The Covenant\\". The Covenant has no interest in friendly relations. In fact, their priests have declared all humans an abomination to their god and instigate a holy war to wipe us out. The humans have plenty of ships and weapons to fight the Covenant, but they are mostly ineffective against the energy shields and laser and pulse weapons that the aliens possess. In effect, we are completely outgunned.    I remember playing the videogame Halo: Combat Evolved on my dad's Xbox for a few minutes almost a decade ago. The thing I remember most about the game is that it was a sci-fi shooter and also that I had no clue as to what was going on story-wise with the plot. I felt like the gamemakers just assumed I already knew what Halo was about. Over the ensuing 9 years I was aware of the games but never really knew about the universe in which they were taking place. But I figured with the release of the Halo: Reach videogame, it would be a good spot to jumpon with the the series. So i got out the original Halo and also started reading this book, which is the direct prequel to the first game.     I really liked this book. Everytime I see a Spartan in the games, they're more machine than man (or woman), and come off as these all-knowing duty fanatics. You almost never get to see their face. What I liked about The Fall of Reach is that we see a lot of the Spartans out of their suits with their helmets off. We even get to learn their names. They're not always super cool and they do doubt themselves. While they don't exactly show fear, they worry about their missions, etc. From the games, it seems like there is nothing they can't handle. Almost like they were demi-gods. I really wish the new Reach game had followed this book instead of coming up with a new Spartan team. If you are new to the Halo franchise I would definitely read this book before starting the new game. Actually, I would say read it before you play ANY Halo game. Nylund's writing stands on its own, mainly because it doesn't have to follow a boring videogame storyline. If you read this book, it will add infinitely to your enjoyment of the games, but it is also just a good sci-fi novel.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I absolutely love this watch!  Talk about motivation!  I love using the free training center software and entering in the training circuits from websites and books.  I'm getting back into running after about 12 years of not running.<br /><br />The heart rate monitor is comfortable too.  I don't see why you'd need to purchase the optional \\"premium\\" heart rate monitor.<br /><br />It is great to put in custom run/walk circuits and having the watch \\"coach\\" you!  I also like how I can post the workouts to my facebook and share my workouts to motivate myself even more.<br /><br />The only drawback I have is that I wish the watch was waterproof.  If it was waterproof, it would be perfect!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Here we have an extraordinary film dealing with profound themes of innocence and guilt, law and morality; set against the \\"grip and slog\\" (D.H. Lawrence) of everyday life.  Much of life is perfunctory, humdrum and carnal. To speak of the brief nudity (as have some reviewers) as a sensationalist distraction from the profound themes within which it is set, is to deny the human condition. More to the point, when does the \\"humdrum\\" itself become immoral.  We know that \\"ignorance of the law\\" is never a defense, but what about the banal acts of repetition that are moved from one context to another; becoming evil only in a later context?<br /><br />Only one certainty emerges from this movie; Kate Winslet is the greatest living film actor.  Those who thought her nudity a distraction have been seeing too many arty David Niven movies from the forties. This is a contemporary movie with contemporary esthetic.  Hanna Schmitz (Winslet's character) was a lonely, ignorant, amoral woman; illiterate, bereft of any history (nothing whatever is portrayed about her past), she is basically just a cipher.  David Kross as her teen-age lover deserves honorable mention.  His character as an adult was played by the redoubtable Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />Hanna lost her job because she was too reliable.  Her superiors were so impressed with her dependability she was promoted from transit ticket-taking to a job requiring reading and writing.  Unable to perform these simple tasks she was forced to find work of which she was capable, as a guard in the Jewish concentration camps. She was reliable as a guard but reliability proved her undoing when the concentration camps became death camps. Her \\"job\\" was to keep the prisoners locked in, and she steadfastly performed her duty even as the inmates were incinerated by an accidental fire.  Later, at the War Crimes trial she could not exculpate herself without admitting that she was illiterate.<br /><br />Lena Olin, in double cameo roles as mother at the trial and then daughter near the end of the movie is brilliant.  As the grim, stoic Jewish woman at the end of the movie she coldly states \\"nothing came out of the camps but death.\\"  She has no time for the sentimentality of Hanna's one time lover (Ralph Fiennes, portraying what he does best, self-pity).  The movie reminds us again what we have learned from the Jews; the death of the body is death.  No sentiment, no fantasy of salvation or forgiveness can change that fact; there is nothing more that we nor anyone else can do.  There is no redemption for Hanna or her sentimental lover.<br /><br />This movie is a profound tragedy. Yet, given the unforgiveable horrors of the Death Camps, there can be no sense of catharsis.rial and then daughter near the end of the movie is brilliant.

B003HGKJH8|5.0|With the first taste, Innerspeaker instantly reminds its listeners of an era driven by British psychedelics.  While listening you might think of John Lennon, 60s counterculture, tie-dye, bell-bottom jeans, or what it might be like to eat a few magic mushrooms.  Fortunately its layers extend deeper than these immediate impressions, so deep that after having listened to it for months you will still find yourself discovering little nuances.  That's the payoff with an album like this.<br /><br />The overall sound is peppered with familiar stylistics: fat snare pulses, echoed vocals, crunchy lo-fi guitar and smooth baselines, all with stunning precision.  At first the album may be overwhelming and listeners may feel they are rowing upstream, as if simply enjoying a light melody were too much to ask for (or too little in this case).  Don't let that initial feeling discourage you though, because once you've familiarized yourself with its' trippy harmonies and warm guitar riffs, Innerspeaker will begin to feel uniquely comfortable.<br /><br />Although it's difficult to identify at first, most songs oblige the typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus format.  But with Tame Impala these concepts have to be reconsidered: the song-structures, while conservative at their core, are embellished by a panoply of rich textures and rhythms.  \\"It's Not Meant To Be\\" starts with a two minute intro, proceeds into the verses and choruses, and then ends the same way it begins.  When you first hear it you'll be interested, though it might take a few listens until you're eagerly singing along.  Some songs are more accessible and will likely grab you faster, like \\"Alter Ego,\\" \\"I Don't Really Mind\\" and \\"Lucidity.\\"<br /><br />The lyrics are clever and catchy, and they conveniently parallel the \\"out-of-body\\" feeling that the music so naturally elicits.  I love every song, but my personal favorites are \\"It's Not Meant To Be\\" and \\"Alter Ego.\\"  Innerspeaker possesses a sound I'm normally not drawn to.  I always appreciated this style, but never gave it too much attention, until now.ed this style, but never gave it too much attention, until now.
B003TML0VO|1.0|Many actual guitar players have found Satanana to be vastly over rated (much like the Edge and Keith Richards - both fine song writers, but not great guitarists).  I'm glad Satanana put this out to prove the point.  The greatest guitar classics of all time????  Maybe, if you are a Justin Beiber fan...  I give it one star just for the guitar hero blasphemy that is Back in Black.  Sorry Santanus but this stinks on so many different levels it is hard to breathe.  My Mom taught me if you can't say something nice don't say anything ... but come on ... this is uninspired, unimaginative hackery.  I'd give zero stars if I could but I will yield the one star to great marketing and some production value.
0439023513|4.0|My daughter and I couldn't wait for Mockingjay to come out. We loved the first and second book in the Hunger Games series and of course wanted to see what the future held for Katniss. We enjoyed reading Mockinjay but as my daughter said, \\"I wanted more\\". It just didn't seem to have the depth of the other books and the way Collins wrote the ending was disappointing. Overall, it was good but a let down compared to the first two books in The Hunger Games.
0345505387|4.0|While agree with other reviewers that it was sometimes difficult to tell which male charachters were speaking, I enjoyed the graphic novel.  It was interesting to see a glimmer into Murtagh's point of view and find out a few nuggets from the novels that were unknown to me.  It will hold me over 'til the next book, which is exactly what I wanted.  No doubt, I will end up re-reading them all again, while I wait...<br />On the whole, the artwork and depictions of the beloved charachters were good.

B002RWKSII|5.0|It is a fantastic album.Never heard the Gershwin songs that way. Brian did very fine arrangments, and he gave the Gershwin songs the Brian touch. One of my favorites is the instrumental track \\"I got plenty of nothing\\" another is \\"´s wonderful or \\"They can´t take that away from  me\\" or ... at least all are my favorites.  Brian did on more highlight in his long career and  I and I think a lot of other fans hope there will come more beautiful music from Brian.
0307594777|5.0|There are at least 3 astonishing things about these books that probably make them so popular.  The characters and their locations are so very interesting -- one.  Second, the translation is near-perfect -- kudos to the publisher, et al!  And, finally, the storylines are quite thrilling.  What can throw the reader is the avalanche of detail.  That comes in the description of locations and personal histories as well as in the huge number of characters involved.    After reading the second book, I started to get a feel for how Mr. Larsson might have written these books.  It made me very envious of his striking ability to weave the plots.  It's sad that he has passed away and we can't be his continuing audience.  What a writer!
1932100660|5.0|A great book! All persons need to read it, in my opinion.  It will change your mind about what you eat, and what  the research says you should eat to be your healthest.  A lot of big money is telling us how to eat, and  it is not in our best interest!  Please read it!
B001JNNDBA|5.0|This film is hard to classify and I am still trying to digest and classify it 24 hours after seeing it. It is disturbing but not in any horror sense. Like the film \\"The Fountain\\" you must be patient and see it all the way through before you will really understand it - and maybe not even then at least at first. This is a sleeper in that you probably won't come to true clarity and understanding until after you have slept on it overnight. I guess the best way to sum it up, as much as it can be done, is to call it a psychological time traveller story, but that hardly does this film justice.<br /><br />Originally I put off buying this as it sounded like a horror film with all that that possibly entails. I am not a horror fan, nor like gore. I am glad however I took a chance and bought this film and watched it. Unique doesn't even begin to describe this film. Rest assured the R rating is mainly for extremely strong language. There is no graphic violence or gore involved, nor any nudity or sex, whatsoever. The disturbing part comes from anticipation and not understanding what you are seeing here.<br /><br />It is a profoundly unique well done story and no scene can be anticipated in advance as in many other Hollywood films.  It is not hard to understand now why this is such a cult classic!<br /><br />The Blu-Ray Directors cut is very high quality, extremely crisp, and the sound excellent. The soundtrack is really good and I really like the \\"Mad World\\" song and have since bought the soundtrack separately just to have it and some other unique tracks as well.<br /><br />If you are a fan of films like \\"The Fountain\\", \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\", \\"Dark City, \\"12 Monkeys\\". \\"V for Vendetta\\", \\"Man from Earth\\" and other similar type cult films this would be one to add to your film collection. Highly recommended!
054531058X|5.0|This book was amazing.  It had me hooked from the second I picked it up.  Maybe because I didn't expect to like it as much as I did (I read it because my bookclub was reading it) -- but I was truely wow'd.

0451228731|5.0|I loved this book and its sequel \\"Freedom.\\" It took 50 pages or so to get hooked, but then I couldn't put it down. It's also one of the more political and relevant books I've read in a long time. Sign me up for the revolution![[ASIN:B002VUFKDY Freedom (TM)]]
0345505387|3.0|This book is a nice treat for those that know and love Jamie and Claire and are eager to see them in picture form.  The meaty parts are left in - politics, action and controversy,  but the relationship between Jamie and Claire suffers.  It just does not capture the emotion and love between them that is so central to the books, as a reader I felt disconnected to them in that way.  If you haven't read Outlander before I don't think you're going to have a clue what's going on,  I've read and reread and sometimes I was even confused.  The artwork is beautiful but the male characters are so similar it often took me a few moments to try and figure out who it was that was speaking, or who that was there in the background of the scene.  All in all I'd say it's worth picking up as a memento if you already know and love the series but that's about as far as it goes.  It's ok, I'm just happy to have anything Jamie and Claire related as we wait for the next book.

044654759X|5.0|Wow! I just finished reading this book. Now I can get back to my other duties in life. This is the first book I have read in its entirety on Kindle. I tried one other ('Let's Take the Long Way Home'), but the author was a little too self-focused for my taste. With this book, on the other hand, I took advantage of every opportunity to read it. This meant staying up late at night, catching a few pages when I could, and carrying the Kindle with me everywhere I went. The book flowed well, such that even when the author was covering the mundane, it was not boring or tedious. The events leading to the end had me clicking through the pages as quickly as I could. There is some disturbing content in the book, but the author didn't get out of hand with it.<br /><br />So, I give the book 5 stars and am definitely glad I took the time to read it. I guess I'm now devoted to Kindle, though I love the feel of a book. Oh well.
0307454541|2.0|Two of my friends were wading through this tome at the same time I was. We kept asking each other, \\"Does it ever get interesting?\\"<br /><br />At page 150, characters who had previously sat around writing, drinking coffee, thinking deep thoughts, and telling their excruciatingly boring life stories started doing things. And it wasn't pretty.<br /><br />If you like the TV series, \\"Criminal Minds,\\" just imagine the most convoluted episode ever, stuff it all into the remaining 315 pages of this novel, and there you have it. Serial killings, sexual sadism, revenge times 10 -- all portrayed by emotionless automatons of characters. The characters seem so far removed from anyone you'd ever meet in real life that I'm scratching my head in consternation.<br /><br />Was it worth my time? Definitely not.
B00445WF28|5.0|The actor who plays the chubby gay guy and the actress who plays the Columbian wife just won best supporting actor Emmys and you can see why with this second season opener.  They are hilarious from the moment they first appear on screen again. She is a stymied Latin mother as her son discovers girlfriends and he fears for his life as his partner tries to build a child's castle with power tools despite no skills with same.  The rest of the gang is great too and I'm very happy this weekly hilarity is back.
0312600844|2.0|Very over rated.  The author could have condensed this 562 page book to about 100 pages and still get his point across.  Unless you have too much time on your hands, don't waste your money.  What was Oprah thinking when she put this one on her Book Club list.  I'm sure with her busy schedule, she did not take the time out to read it first.
B00168OIOE|5.0|It'll be a classic; actually, \\"it is a classic\\", ... a must see for all ages!  This package (4-Disc) is awesome - Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and bonus DVD
006145205X|5.0|Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was impressed with his development of exchange as a source for cultural development.  It was refreshing to read a well assembled thesis demonstrating that things are indeed improving for the world. And it is also important to be mindful of the ways which human progress has been messed up in the past.

B00275EGWY|4.0|I have read some reviews from vets of Operations Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Iraqi Freedom.  I am an Air Force retiree who spent 27 years on active duty.  I understand why some of the discrepancies can be frustrating to those who have lived life in the military and see Hollywood not getting the details quite right.  I often note a lot of differences between life and life on screen in most movies with a military theme.  Uniforms aren't correct, haircuts are out of regulation, people wear hats indoors etc.<br /><br />However, with \\"The Hurt Locker\\", theses discrepancies shouldn't take away from the excellence of the movie.  The main theme of the movie is not about the details of existence in day to day military life in a war zone.  The director is trying to show how the effects of the cat and mouse existence in this type of combat affect the key characters.  Also of importance is the relationships between them.  The acting by the the trio who make up the Explosive Ordnance Disposal--EOD--team (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) is excellent.  I can certainly relate to how Jeremy Renner's character, Sergeant James, feels when he goes home to his wife and child after tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.  You get the feeling that he can't adapt to the humble role of husband and father and actually misses the near addiction he has to the adrenaline rush of being the key EOD team member.  You also get the feeling he can't and won't be able to find anyone to relate to his experiences.  I grew up in Iowa and when I came home on leave, I really couldn't talk about my assignments with friends and family because they had no real concept of what I was talking about.  The pain within the story primarily comes from the two other members of the EOD team, who are really just trying to survive their tours and get away from a job they dislike in a country (Iraq) they hate--hopeful to get home in one piece.<br /><br />In addition to the superb acting by the three lead characters, the cameo appearances by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes added an air of actor familiarity and credibility; and the astute direction of Kathryn Bigelow brought the story and characters together brilliantly.<br /><br />I did knock off a star for the discrepancies some other reviewers pointed out, but I think this film is deserving of the many accolades it received, including the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and should be viewed by anyone interested in the effects of war on the psyche of some of those involved.ameo appearances by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes added an air of actor familiarity and credibility; and the astute direction of Kathryn Bigelow brought the story and characters together brilliantly.

B00003CWL6|5.0|Sometimes several different things come together to form a truly unique work of art.  Such is the case of Alan Ball's excellent script; Sam Mendes' direction; and the exemplary acting of an uparalleled group of actors.<br /><br />In \\"American Beauty\\", viewers will find themselves rooting cheerfully for Lester Burnham, the movies key character brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.  Burnham is a man going through a mid-life crisis slash awakening in a plot that turns out to be a mystery, drama, tragic comedy and satire all rolled into a finely crafted story.<br /><br />This film dares to show the sarcastic contradictions that occur in everyday life.  For those quick to judge others, this will hopefully be an eye opener as to what the effects of those judgments can have on life and death.<br /><br />I think most viewers will be able to relate to at least one of the unique characters created in this picture, which garnered 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, in 1999.  Personally, I fell in love and lust respectively with Thora Birch and Mena Suvari.  The other characters are brought to life in exemplary fashion by Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janey and Scott Bakula.  They all interact together and astutely show the everyday foibles, humor, tragedy and other unique circumstances that occur in suburban life.<br /><br />If you've already seen \\"American Beauty\\", you know how great it is; if you haven't viewed it yet, do so immediately--you won't regret it...
B000A2VMV4|5.0|This is my favorite movie.The Asian import plays well by why was this never released in the USA???
B0019X3ZZY|3.0|Marquis de Sade, the real life 18th Century oddity for whom \\"sadism\\" is named, would give Pier Paolo Pasolini a pat on the back for making this controversial film set in Facist Italy in 1944.  I, on the other hand, probably would not.<br /><br />I did give this departure from reality that takes the form of an allegory 3 stars, however, for its sheer ingenuity, uniqueness and interesting take on the depravities humans are capable of inflicting on one another, no matter what time in history they occur.<br /><br />If you are offended by viewing both heterosexual and homosexual rape and sexual degradation; torture and humiliation; nudity and vulgarity; and overall unrelenting disgusting behavior from adults toward children and adolescent teens, then this film certainly isn't for you.  However, if you are open minded enough to simply view this as one man's opinion of the effects of Facist corruption brought to life via his unique artistic big screen fantasy, then give it a look.  You might be shocked, but you certainly won't forget this story for a long time to come.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|*Note: Review contains spoilers.    omg. OMG. What a fantastic film! I saw AVATAR  in 3D IMAX the first day it came out, and I still bought this DVD. I completely ignored everyone who said wait for the version coming out in November, I just couldn't wait that long to see it at home, and own my own piece of blue magic. I can unequivocally say that AVATAR was the best movie I have ever seen. And I have seen a lot of movies. Hands down, five stars. Hell, I'd give it six stars.     I know there was a lot of hype behind this film given the astronomical amount of money that James Cameron poured into it, but seriously, for once the movie matched all the hype. AVATAR was phenomenal.    First, the cinematography was amazing. Viewing the film in 3D was like being a immersed into the landscape of Pandora - a part of its lush forests with multi-hued fantastic flora and fauna of all kinds. It was uniquely magnificent, and I was transported into that world from the very first glimpse of the planet. The Na'vi were fascinating as a species, both to look at in terms of their cat-like beauty and grace to their way of life and deeply-rooted metaphysical relationship with their planet. I loved Zoe Saldana's character, Neytiri. She was so fierce and beautiful and feminine, all in one package. What a fantastic character - such a strong female heroine! Neytiri was real and gritty and more \\"human\\" than some of her human counterparts in recent movies. She was so entrenched in her feelings. You could hear her raw emotion when she cried after her father died or when Jake revealed his betrayal. Zoe Saldana delivered a spectacular performance, worthy of recognition. Despite only seeing her in CGI'd Na'vi form, her ability to deliver that kind of gut performance goes beyond anything I've ever seen.    I had to admit I had some misgivings because I believed going in to see Avatar that there was going to be an unhappy ending - after all, how does a human possessing the body of a Na'vi via a machine get to live happily ever after? The human controller must survive for the Na'vi avatar to live. But I loved the way that James Cameron resolved this for me. Not to give away too much, but Pandora's magic, the spirit of Eywa, just made it come together so naturally when Jake Sully assumes the consciousness of his avatar for good, that I was spellbound.    I loved Sam Worthington's character, Jake Sully. I was rooting for him the whole time and I really wanted Neytiri to fall for him. Of course she had to be the daughter of the clan leader and seer! That was the only part that was a little predictable, but you always have to have an untouchable \\"princess\\" in these types of stories. Worked for me! When Jake Sully shows up with the Leonopteryx, as the sixth Toruk Makto, I felt my heart jump for him. That was just awesome!! In a lot of ways, the film itself became a medium for me to experience his character's first interaction with Pandora and the Na'vi - almost as if it were the avatar and I, it's human connection.  How's that for a mind-twister?     The conflict battle scenes were spectacular. I felt so emotionally connected to the Na'vi that I found myself gripping the arms of my seat when their Hometree was destroyed and when they were attacked by the sky-people. Sigourney Weaver was as awesome as she was in Alien, although not in the lead role this time, but she is just made for these types of movies. I've always been a huge fan of hers and all the Alien films.    I was connected to this movie the whole time, feeling goosebumps and a sense of breathlessness many times throughout its 162 minute run-time. At the end when Neytiri jumps into the shack and saves the human Jake, that scene was so emotionally touching - you just felt that it didn't matter what species they were - she loved him, and he, her. When they said \\"I see you\\" to each other, I felt their love in my toes. And that is an emotional connection, folks.    This film took me away from a very mundane reality to a fantastic world that I just didn't want to leave. I would watch Avatar again in a heartbeat! One of the things that makes a movie great is its ability to draw in its viewers and to make them connect emotionally, visually, and aurally with its message. Avatar accomplished that and more. It was a movie that I didn't want to end. I walked out of the movie theater with a fist pump and a huge grin, completely satisfied, which is more than I can say for many, many other films. You will experience the gambit of human emotions through the film, and for those critics who've said that it has no real plot or story, well they're the ones without imagination. Avatar is not just a fantasy or sci-fi film, it's a love story with a ton of action and some pretty neat concepts (like all life on Pandora being connected like the synapses of the human brain).    This film has no equal. I bought this DVD even without the special features. And I will probably buy the one with all the bells and whistles. 5 stars.    Check out my profile info for my website with pics, and more Avatar reviews.
0142000671|5.0|im really happy with my purchase. the book was in excellent condition. it was good quality as well. thanks !
0545123275|4.0|I started reading Shiver  and immediately loved the language. I loved the lyrical and descriptive sentences, as well as the fact that it was based on two points of view, both Grace and Sam. That held me rapt for about the first twenty pages. However as the story progressed, I found that I didn't love the multiple points of view as much as I thought I would have, primarily because it's in the first person. It was a little difficult to keep track of who was speaking...ie., who was the \\"I\\" in that particular chapter. It got confusing at times, and I found myself having to go back and check the chapter title.    My favorite thing about this book was unequivocally the imagery. Maggie Stiefvater is an excellent writer and creates a world that is so visual that you get drawn right into the middle of it, even if you don't want to. She's an incredible writer, and I loved that about Shiver. Her writing is so rich and evocative.     Overall I would rate Shiver 4 stars. As many other reviewers have said, fans of Twilight will enjoy this story, especially younger teen readers. Really great writing!!!

B002ZG983M|4.0|*Review may contain spoilers    I haven't enjoyed a comedy/action film recently as much as I enjoyed Kick-Ass. It definitely lived up to expectations. And as much as I love random, no-thinking-required comedies, this one actually had a few good messages, and when you add in a Sin-City-ish ton of blood and a badass eleven-year-old,  you've got  a little something something.    Don't get me wrong, it's probably going to rub you the wrong way from the start. I mean it's totally warped. You've got a father shooting his kid in the chest so that she can get used to the feeling of being shot (although later on we learn that he used \\"low-velocity\\" bullets...awww). Said kid swears like a sailor and kills bad-guys like a tiny ninja without blinking an eye. She reminded me of the school girl in Kill Bill. So it's probably going to scrape against what's been ingrained into you as socially acceptable because it really isn't on many levels - little girls shouldn't be foul-mouthed killing machines for one. That aside, it was a pretty good flick, but you have to put yourself in the mindset of Kill Bill. It's going to be gory and off-putting but it's going to be cool in its own sick twisted way.    So what's Kick-Ass about? Dave is an ordinary high-school boy, more of a nerd than anything, and he asks the question of why don't more people try to help others. Why aren't there more real-life superheroes? After being mugged and bullied, he buys a costume online and tries to defend people, calling himself Kick-Ass. The first time he gets completely  creamed (and stabbed) ending up in the hospital with all kinds of metal in his body and messed-up nerve endings. The second time he gets You-Tubed sticking up for a guy being beaten up by thugs, and suddenly Kick-Ass is an online superstar.    In his adventures, he meets two other \\"superheroes,\\" Big Daddy and Hit Girl who have their own agenda - to take down the big-boss kingpin drug dealer who framed Big Daddy and killed his wife. Hit Girlis eleven and is Big Daddy's own mini-me killing machine (she asks for switch blades on her birthday...awesome!) Meanwhile the drug boss thinks that Kick-Ass is responsible for killing his men even though it's really Big Daddy, so the drug boss' son decides to dress up as a superhero (Red Mist) to lure in Kick-Ass and the other two. In the end Big Daddy and Kick-Ass are captured but are rescued by Hit Girl. Big Daddy dies a fiery death. Together, Hit Girl and Kick-Ass finish what Big Daddy started, taking down the drug boss in an adrenaline-filled, bullet-blasting, bloody extravaganza.    The messages I got from Kick-Ass are as follows:-    1) Don't turn a blind eye to bullies    2) Stick up for people    3) Buy a wetsuit and some nunchucks    4) Learn kung-fu and keep your lunch money    5) Don't let your kids watch this movie or get switch blades for their birthday    I would rate Kick-Ass three and half stars out of five. In Tarantino-esque fashion, it's ingenious, irreverent, violent and vulgar, but like me, you'll watch it and probably enjoy it.
0307577589|4.0|the product is fine, the book itself is a lot of info in the beginning.  But is becoming very interesting.
1416972250|5.0|*Note: Contains spoilers.    One word. WOW!    Six words. HURRAH FOR MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEW!    Cassandra Clare is quickly becoming one of my favorite young adult authors, up there with the likes of Kristin Cashore (see my reviews of Graceling and Fire), Holly Black, and Melissa Marr. City of Glass, the third book in the Mortal Instruments series was absolutely fantastic. It was a well-written, character-driven, action-packed journey that I loved every minute of. I finished City of Glass in 4 hours. And yes, my signature \\"book-affair\\" after effect - ragged lips indeed. Yes, I know it's gross but when I don't even know that I am literally eating myself, you can bet your pants that it is a good book.    My absolute, unequivocal favorite thing about City of Glass was the multiple points of view. I LOVED the fact that we could see into the motivations and thoughts of each of the main characters - Clary, Jace, Simon, Luke and Isabelle. Clare does a fabulous job of keeping each of these POVs exciting and bringing them together at the right moment. I especially like the cliffhangers within chapters where the POV switches to someone else. To give further credit to the author, I really don't know which character was my favorite - I think I connected with each one of them, which of course made me connect more with the book as a whole. On the POV front, I think publishers underestimate the value of teens to appreciate and more importantly, grasp, a multi-layered POV story. In my humble opinion, it just makes the books richer. And of course, anything that addresses social interaction and real relationships (not just one-sided accounts) can only help teens/readers become more cognitive of what drives actual human connections.     So brief summary of City of Glass. This book takes place in Idris, the Shadowhunter world. Clary, the main protagonist,  goes to Idris to find a warlock who can make a potion to save her mother, who is still in a coma of her own doing. There she meetsup with the rest of the gang - Jace (her sort-of brother slash not her brother slash her crush), Simon (best friend turned vampire), Isabelle and Alec (Shadowhunter brother and sister), and Luke (father figure slash ex-Shadowhunter slash werewolf). The gang joins up in a race against time to stop Valentine (corrupt ex-Shadowhunter) who is intent on destroying the world as they know it. Clary continues to develop her runic powers - she can invent new runes and succeeds in getting the Clave to bind Shadowhunters and Downworlders (vamps, weres, fey, etc.) to win the war against Valentines and his demon army. Meanwhile, she's still in love with Jace, and vice versa. They discover toward the end that Jace is not really Valentine's son, and therefore not her brother (woohoo on the non-icky kissing!) Jace defeats his brother Sebastian (nee Jonathan). Clary defeats her father, Valentine. Everyone parties in Alicante like it's 1999. That's just the main story but there's so much going on in this book that it's diffcult to summarize the myriad of things in addition to the above like Alec's relationship with Magnus, or Simon's development as a vampire and his relationship with his \\"kind,\\" or Jocelyn's (Clary's mother) relationship with Valentine, that truly make this book a fantastic YA read. Now this is NYT Bestseller material.    The imagery was wonderful - I felt at times that I was in Alicante! The writing was fast-paced and kept building straight to the end with an oh-so-satisfying fight scene/conclusion. The plot was fascinating and Clare made sure to tie up all loose ends (something I find missing in a lot of books with this much detail and side-stories going on).    I closed this book with a sigh of complete satisfaction, and that's saying a lot. I give City of Glass a resounding 4.5 out of 5 stars. The 0.5 deduction was really for some of the incestuous undertones which disturbed me a bit, more so in the earlier two books. It made everything ok at the end of the 3rd book to discover that Clary and Jace aren't in fact related, but reading it while it was happening didn't really do me any favors. It was just a bit awkward - I really loved Clary and Jace, and totally wanted them to be together but of course, given that they were brother and sister, that made it just a tad difficult. But that's personal preference and social programming for you.    City of Glass was awesome! Read the trilogy, you won't be disappointed.

B003YCI1PM|4.0|I should start off by saying that I am a HUGE Selena Gomez fan. I think she is very talented and a great role model from the Disney Channel who presents a better self-image to the media than Miley Cyrus does. I looked up reviews for this album before purchasing it and was worried with the mixed reviews; many people stated that they liked her first album better. However, I was not a big fan of her first album because it was too pop-rock inspired, Ashlee Simpson/Avril Lavigne-like for my tastes... So I just bought the album.    I think the songs are collectively stronger for this album than the first. The songs are more danceable as opposed to being rock-inspired. The songs are well constructed and super catchy. I can't wait to play this album in my car. Overall, this album reminds me of Hilary Duff's \\"Dignity.\\"    The only downside to this album is that her voice is heavily synthesized and overproduced. However, that doesn't bother me too much since I know that acting is more important for her than singing.     So to sum up, if you liked her first album expect a change with this second one.
0545310601|5.0|*Note: Review may contain spoilers    So here it is, as promised, the final installment in the phenomenal Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, my review of Mockingjay. After my positive reviews of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I had some high expectations for the final book. I was not disappointed. Mockingjay  was everything I wanted and more, all in all, a great conclusion to an exciting and can't-put-down series. But be forewarned, it's nothing like the previous two...it's dark and violent and brutally honest.  You may love this book or you may hate it, but there's no denying that it will take you on a sublime roller-coaster of a journey.    As I mentioned in my review of Catching Fire which offered a preview of what the world would be like in Mockingjay, this unconditionally is a book of war. The world is bleak and filled with death. It is in fact a real-life version of the Hunger Games, only the world is the arena and there are no rules nor \\"tricks\\" to defeat the Gamemasters. The single ray of light and hope is Katniss Everdeen, the symbol of the revolution and its Mockingjay. But she is still under the thumb of the covert underground District 13, which of course has its own agenda...of power, control, and authority. The driving objective of the book, and our heroine, is to kill President Snow and overthrow the Capitol. In the end, Katniss does make it to the Capitol with the help of her combat team, and she does bring down President Snow, but not before losing almost everything that she holds dear. In Mockingjay, loss is simply a casualty of war where the luxury of mourning no longer exists. It is brutal, immediate, and final.    If you're looking for a romantic conclusion or a romanticized version of Katniss being an all-conquering heroine who takes up the mantle of power as the leader of the revolution, look elsewhere. If anything, Mockingjay shows that she is human, and in the end, just a teenage girl struggling to fulfill a role she never even wanted in the first place. So what if she runs and hides in closets? I don't see that as weak, I see that as human. She is flawed and frail, as are we all. I think that that was a very realistic portrayal of being under that kind of pressure and suffering from a very real post traumatic stress disorder. It made Katniss more of a hero to me than anything else because it was so believable. It was raw and it was real.    The whole new dynamic between the tortured Peeta and Katniss was also very real. Teens have enough problems dealing with the opposite sex even without trackerjack venom playing mind-tricks between them. In my opinion, I thought that dynamic gave a lot more substance to their relationship especially with respect to the epilogue, because they actually worked to make their relationship happen. He wasn't just Peeta from the other two books doing all he could to sacrifice everything for Katniss. By the force of the Capitol's torture, he hated her, which meant that they had to find each other through all of that hate and doubt and fear, for their relationship to make it. And somehow, they managed to do just that which to me is incredibly hopeful.    I think Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer, and what she did with Mockingjay was perfect. Although the story continues from the first two books, this book is completely different. It is gritty and raw in a way that the other two weren't. There's no fluff, no sugar-coating of personality nor of emotion. It is a world of pain, anger, and self-doubt...a very dark place. Some people may not like it or may feel that Collins deviated from the other two books. I disagree. I think what she did with Mockingjay was phenomenal. Gale became what he always had been even from book 1, The Hunger Games - he became a hunter, a soldier. Even though he and Katniss had a relationship, I always thought there was a hardness about Gale, perhaps born of the difficulty of his life. In a way, I think one can draw a parallel between Gale and Katniss, because although everyone (including the author) says that she is cold and all about her own survival, I actually think that that's false. If she was, she wouldn't have so much doubt and run away to hide in closets - this emotional fragility gives her a softness that is the antithesis of Gale. He is the consummate survivor. I wasn't surprised when the war became his driving objective, and he and Katniss grew apart. I don't think that Gale was vilified at all in this book, I think he just became what he was meant to become all along. A fighter and a leader. He, probably, was the least broken character in this book, which naturally made him one of the strongest.    On the flip side, I do have to say that there seemed to be a lot more in this book related to the war and the revolution as opposed to the characters or their emotional relationship with each other. Considering how central Prim has been to the book and to its heroine, I was surprised that her death felt so flat to me. It was almost too quick - there was not enough homage paid to her death. Same with Finnick, another central character and friend to Katniss, who just died. Their deaths felt hollow and empty. A part of me understands that Collins is on a new direction with this book-namely the emotionless callous nature of war-so maybe she was trying to convey more of a jarring casualty of war death as opposed to an unexpected (and more sacrificial emotional death like Rue or Mags in the previous books).    This takes me to the whole debate between Katniss' last objective-to kill President Snow-when instead, she kills Coin. I honestly believe that this was Katniss standing up for what she felt was the right thing to do. Instead of being driven by hate to kill Snow, she knew that Coin was only in line to be the next dictator of Panem. What she did made it possible for Paylor (who seemed to be a good leader earlier in the book) to be voted in as President. This final act is certainly not the act of apawn. Yes, Katniss is a broken fragile heroine (which apparently has upset many people who desperately wanted her to rise to the occasion and be a Hollywood hero) but she still manages to do the right thing for Panem. Doesn't that make her a true hero? There's a lot to be said for that, and I give her total credit.    At the end of the day, these characters have survived a war. They're not going to be all warm and fuzzy and blindingly happy. They are going to be broken and messed up, just trying to find a way forward day by day. Talk to any war veteran and you will see that what Collins has portrayed in this novel is not only a realistic expectation of the circumstances, but it is also a brutally honest and painful one. Other reviewers have said that if you want a fairy-tale, this book isn't for you. But the truth is, the fairy-tale is in there. It's just not where you would expect it. In my opinion, it is in the human capacity for strength, hope, and our innate ability to survive, putting one foot in front of the other and not giving up. Katniss and Peeta, as broken as they are, manage to do that despite all the ghosts that will more than likely forever haunt them. And that's a fairy-tale ending too, if only for the fact that there's beauty and hope in such strength.    I am in awe of this book, and of its author, Suzanne Collins. One of the biggest compliments is how torn readers are in their opinions, which in my view, just goes to credit the author because she is able to illicit such a passionate response from her readership. Brilliantly written and honestly executed, I would rate Mockingjay 5 out of 5 stars.     Check out my profile info for my website and other reviews.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|The Matrix Reloaded isn't a bad film. It's a very watchable, fun film. But the real disappointment is that there was the potential for it to be as fabulous as the first Matrix. It's a squandered opportunity. Sometimes when someone writes a novel that becomes a smash hit, the next isn't edited properly, because the publishing company are eager to keep their cash cow happy. That feels very much what happened here. It feels like nobody kept an eye on what the Wachowskis were doing, nobody tried to keep them focused, nobody steered them towards the story rather than the whizz-bang. And it's a crying shame, because the ideas they had for these films are completely brilliant.    The core of the second movie is the discovery that the entire premise of the first was a lie. The Prophecy is just another layer of control. The machines created Zion, selected the One, and set him up to start the cycle, just to keep people pacified; the naturally rebellious would have an outlet for their energies that could never threaten the status quo at all. Zion and the human resistance are no more nor less than a machine-created pressure valve for the Matrix itself. That idea is brilliantly clever; breathtakingly so. If the movie had been made with that at its heart, with everything else there just to serve the story, you'd have a movie that excelled the first, and could stand alone. But that wasn't what happened. And the failure of that story means that the last movie failed too, because its own story was equally muddled and equally squandered, and that compounded the problems. If the first movie had stuck to its story, and the second had lucidly set out that the machines are just as much sinned against as sinning, and can co-exist with humanity if only the hawks on both sides will allow them to do so, you'd have a brilliant series. But that isn't what happened, and saying \\"people didn't get the movies\\" just isn't good enough. It isn't a lack of intelligence that caused that problem. It's alack of coherent, skilled story-telling. The first film was beautifully made and tight, taut narrative drove the plot. The second and third were muddled and self-indulgent, despite fantastic ideas and stunning set-pieces.    The first Matrix movie had budgetary constraints that meant all the action had to be justified by the plot. Here, the action is as out there as they can possibly make it. There's no sense of it being purely to further the story; it's an end in itself. The famous \\"burly brawl\\" (Neo v hundreds of Smiths) looks fake a lot of the time and goes on too long, and the real shame of it is that half the length and a lot less CGI and it could have worked. The point of that scene is that there is someone new in the mix whose power threatens even Neo, but that gets very lost. Similarly, the freeway chase scene is amazing, but too long. It dislocates the movie and makes the real heart of it - the final mission - feel squashed and an oversight. The focus on set pieces such as these makes for a choppy, episodic feel, and it's a real shame, especially as when they work the fight scenes are extraordinary - the Chateau scene is balletic in gracefulness and looked breathtaking on the big screen, and Neo's brief initial fight with agents sent the adrenaline in the cinema rocketing. But the sloppy editing and pacing of the movie really doesn't do it any favours.     Similarly, there are too many scenes that simply don't need to be there. The conflict between Morpheus and the Zion military command is dull, dull, dull. I can't imagine anyone cares. Link is a brand new character, and while the actor is light-years better than the appallingly hammy one who played Tank in M1, I can't imagine anyone investing in his marital problems after a two scene acquaintance. Most of the Zion scenes are redundant, though I'm possibly in an Anglo-Saxon minority in not thinking the sex scene is one. I don't see what the issue is in showing characters supposedly madly in love having sex, especially given the weight the movies place on that relationship later. The scene was framed to make it about intimacy and profound connection rather than explicit nudity - as you'd expect from the directors of Bound -  though the Zion rave scenes it was cut with were a trifle annoying, looking as they did like an X rated Pepsi commercial.     Another problem is the wordiness and the heavily sign-posted symbolism. A good script shouldn't need to beat you over the head, yet here a lot of ink is spilt saying very little. The restaurant scene with the Merovingian is brilliant - well written and wonderfully performed - but as the character really hasn't been given enough to do, it's also redundant. This is especially unfortunate when the Merovingian says, with complete accuracy, that Neo is just doing what he's told and has no idea what his role really is. That salient observation is lost in all the waffle. This is a problem throughout; something may look good, it may sound good, but if it doesn't matter to the plot, it needs to go. The Architect scene is one that really does need to be there, and the for once the wordiness worked for me. It highlighted the difference between human and machine really well. But that was an exception. The constant talk of Purpose and Causality and Choice and Meaning is the paradigm of telling rather than showing, and if that's problematic in a book, it's a disaster in a film; particularly one so reliant on special effects. The effects and the wordiness and the heavy symbolism compete and counter one another, cancelling one another out and overloading the movie. Oddly enough in a film that prides itself on taxing audience intelligence, the philosophical and religious symbolism is laid on with a trowel at best, and beaten into your head with a baseball bat at worst. Those themes would be a lot more interesting if they were more subtly woven and didn't get in the way of the story. Exposition that detracts from the actual plot might be interesting in an art house film, but in this one it just doesn't do anything but diminish returns.    There's another big issue with a movie that throws so many words and so many explosions and fights into the mix: suspension of disbelief. When Neo stops sentinels with his mind, you need to be engaged enough with the plot to care. He can do this because he's been to the Source - the machine main frame - and presumably has enough of the machine code in his cranial hardware to do so, but it seems so out of left-field that you just think - huh?! The brilliance of the first film was the immediacy and plausibility of it. How *do* we know what is real? How can we be certain that life is as it seems? And the hyper-reality of the fighting freed and the Agents worked well juxtaposed to the broad mass of the rest of us. But in the sequels, there is no broad mass. We see programmes who are as stylised and skilled as the rebels, and you lose sight of the link to reality. Zion is a movie fantasy, too. I can't help suspecting that by losing the real world as we know it when portraying the Matrix, you lose some of the urgency. You also lose a connection to the audience. There's far less to identify with - to make this war and this battle feel relevant to audience lives. It's harder to care about the characters. This dislocation increases as the sequels progress and I found the eventual deaths - even of Neo and Trinity, characters I'd loved - muted and less than tragic. I think that is a pretty telling indictment.    The acting is mixed. I did feel Fishbourne phoned it in, to an extent. He obviously loved the character and that made him, for my money, a little self-indulgent. He sounds wonderful and looks fabulous, but there isn't the charisma and warmth he had in spades in the first film. Carrie Anne Moss is a fantastic actress, completely different in every movie I've seen her in and very convincing in all, but the oddity for me was that she was a different character in this movieto the Trinity in the first. You could argue that the character is now in love, but she still seems a completely different character, even in scenes where she isn't speaking. It doesn't matter hugely as both are likeable and engagingly intelligent portrayals, but if you watch the films together, it's noticeable, and I do wonder if the actress didn't just find a new portrayal after the break instead of rediscovering the old. In a sense it's a compliment to her that there is so little of her own personality in her acting - someone essentially playing themselves wouldn't have the problem. I also found her fight scenes rather less impressive in the sequels, to the point I wondered if the actress had been injured? She did far better in the car/bike chase elements. I thought Keanu Reeves was great as Neo; the change here is every bit as enormous but makes far more sense in terms of the plot. A lonely computer geek is now pretty much God with a wicked-hot girlfriend, so you'd expect him to be a tad more assured. People say Reeves is a terrible actor, but actually I disagree. I've seen him interviewed and was amazed to find he was very bright - and then realised that I'd thought he was Ted. Most of the world thought he was Ted. Now most people think he's Neo. Given the gulf between those characters, that's quite some achievement. He has a stillness and an innocence - a goodness, really - that worked really well here and he looks amazing in the fight scenes. I don't think he has huge range as an actor, but in his own parameters I think he's fantastic and the role suits him brilliantly. I also loved the actor who played the Merovingian; the Keymaker is also excellent; the Architect was genuinely chilling; and Hugo Weaving seems temperamentally incapable of ever turning in anything but a superb performance, no matter what he does. Jon Voight was also good in a cameo role (though it would have served the film better if his cameo had been single scene - only Star Trek fans couldhave enjoyed the Zion Council scenes).    The real failure of this film is that between the endless talking and the endless fighting you end up feeling like hardly anything important happened - that it's light on plot. And nothing, actually, could be further from the truth. A film with a brilliantly clever plot, some wonderful characters, and some fabulous action scenes ended up being a bit of a confusingly episodic mess. A hugely enjoyable, fun, action-packed mess, but a mess just the same. The action and speech disguised rather than revealed the plot, and it's such a shame. This movie is a real lost opportunity. I'd buy it anyway, expecially in Blu Ray and especially if I had a very large screen! But I can't help feeling sad that they didn't have someone from Warner keeping their eye on the ball. They killed their own franchise and didn't really realise their vision, I don't think.
0439023491|5.0|*Note: There are spoilers in this review<br /><br />Catching Fire is the second in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games series. I reviewed the first book, The Hunger Games, a few weeks ago. Needless to say, I was not disappointed by this book. The writing is as fast-paced and exciting as the first novel, and my heroine is the same in all her imperfect, defiant, and gutsy glory. I couldn't put Catching Fire down (and stayed up until 2:30am to finish it in a 3 hour stretch).<br /><br />In summary, once more we meet up with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, only this time they are victors of the Hunger Games and back in District 12. They live in new houses, have plenty of money, and don't want for much of anything. But with the Hunger Games over and her very public relationship with Peeta in limbo, Katniss finds herself falling for Gale, her best friend, in secret. A best friend who is also in love with her. Unfortunately, it is a secret that is known by her enemies, particularly President Snow. To make matters worse, President Snow hasn't forgotten their stunt with the berries (forcing the Capitol to proclaim two victors in the last Hunger Games), and now he has warned Katniss that she must quell any inkling that the berries were any kind of symbolic act of rebellion against the Capitol, and instead only a simple wish of someone desperately in love. But the spark has been made, and Katniss can no longer contain the fire that results. She is unable to convince anyone otherwise, including the president. To regain control and squash any rebellion, President Snow forces Katniss and Peeta back into the Games, where they learn that they are part of something greater - a far-reaching plan to unseat the Capitol, and one that has its fingers not only in the defunct District 13, but also in the Capitol itself. Fighting for survival, Katniss manages to escape the Games with the help of other District allies but in the end, is separated from Peeta who is captured by the enemy. Book 2 ends with Katniss unwillingly becoming the symbol of the rebellion (headquartered in District 13), and its figurehead...she is the mockingjay.<br /><br />Catching Fire was thrilling from beginning to end. It was great to reconnect with the familiar characters from The Hunger Games and get to meet some new ones that were just as interesting as the old or even more so. While everything feels familiar, like the same style of narration, the novel is never boring or predictable. It does take a little adjustment and effort to work in the personalities and the ages of the new Hunger Games competitors but that in no means detracts from the pacing or the story itself. I did find that I wasn't as interested in the mechanics of the arena this time but wasn't sure that was due to the complicated nature of its clock structure or whether I was more interested in what was happening with the characters themselves (which is a big compliment to the author).<br /><br />This book also seemed to be a lot more violent than the first. Death is an accepted casualty, as is walking on skulls or seeing piles of dead decomposing bodies. It didn't offend me at all, it was just something I noticed. That said, I enjoyed the authenticity that it gave to the book - it felt real, like it was a darker and uglier world. Or maybe it was reflective that Katniss was growing up, and she herself was harder and viewing the world differently. I still retained the connection with Katniss in this book - she stayed true to herself (as well as to her personality the previous novel) and while she does seem older and wiser, at the core, she doesn't change. She is still headstrong and compassionate and just as awesome.<br /><br />Catching Fire was a great second installment of the series! Well worth the read, I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars. I already have Mockingjay in hand so stay tuned for my final review. Hopefully it will measure up to its predecessors.<br /><br />Check out my profile info for my website andmore reviews.more reviews.
B00138CV5K|5.0|Maybe it was just the time of life that is music hit me, but this is one of my top albums of all time.  The lyrics are poignant, the orchestration stirring and his raspy vocals just seem to cut through it all into your soul.  It's worth a listen.  It's the kind of album you want to take on a car ride alone across the state or on a long walk.  Like a classic book, you need the time to appreciate the depths.
054531058X|5.0|NOTE: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.    Normally when I get accosted in book stores by women older than me raving about a young adult book they've recently read (and I mean raving, she couldn't stop), I usually nod and carefully inch my way backwards scanning for nearby exits. That was the case with The Hunger Games. Needless to say, I didn't immediately buy the book at Barnes and Noble, and got the heck out of dodge. A few days later, scrounging around for something different to read, I came upon The Hunger Games, so I purchased it. Boy, am I glad I did. I finished that book in 3 hours flat. It was different for sure. It was exciting. It was heart-pounding. It was sweet. And it was good.    Suzanne Collins is a solid writer. The language flowed well, especially after the first tenth of the book which didn't really grab me initially, and at times I really got pulled in by the descriptions of the territory so much so that I had to go back and re-read little things I missed on the previous page. I'm also a chronic speed-reader, so I'm sure that didn't help when I got engrossed.    The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic future where there are no longer U.S. states but twelve districts surrounding a Capitol in a country called Panem. The Capitol is full of excess and gluttony and wealth, while each of the twelve districts has to fight for basic necessities like grain and water and oil. District 12 is the last district, and is the poorest. Each year, as a punishment for a prior rebellion of the districts against the Capitol, two young people (one boy and one girl aged 12-18) are chosen from each district to fight to the death while it is all broadcast on live TV. If you're like me and are thinking of The Condemned, a 2007 film, where a bunch of death-row convicts are placed on an island and have to fight to the death streaming live over the internet, with the winner getting a free pass out of jail, I will tell you that it was quite similar in concept. Even down to the sponsors of the event sending floating parachutes with weapons or food to the combatants to give them an edge.    The big difference of course is that these are teenagers fighting to survive. But conceptually, it is pretty much identical. The main protagonist is a girl called Katniss who is headstrong, clever, protective of her family, hostile yet compassionate, and multi-dimensional. She is fierce, and she had me at hello. When her little sister's name is drawn in the selection for District 12, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She along with another boy who has loved her since they were children, Peeta, head to the games at the Capitol. As part of their strategy, they are coached to go into the games as a pair (and not traditionally as solitary fighters because there can only be one winner). Not unexpectedly, this connection is what saves them both in the end.    The first thing I noticed once they got to the Capitol was the huge dichotomy between life in the Capitol and life in District 12. One favors a life of indulgence and excess, the other one of hardship and suffering. I thought Suzanne Collins did a great job of communicating this and it was one of the many things that gave added depth to the book. This was a world that I could really sink my mind into.    Once the actual games commence, following an Olympic-style introduction ceremony, it's all about survival and not getting killed. I found myself becoming so tied into Katniss and what she was feeling each second of the day during the ordeal that I could not put this book down. When she was hurt, I felt hurt. When she was sad, I felt sad. Kudos to the author for being able to weave this kind of reader response with such finesse. In the end, after finding and losing allies, almost dying, avoiding some pretty tight situations, and yep, falling for her District 12 partner, Katniss and Peeta make it to the end, and in an unprecedented turn, are declared twin winners. The plot is pretty intricate so I know that I am leaving out a lot of other little plot things here, but that wouldn't be fun, would it? Giving away all the good stuff that makes this novel a keeper? You need to go read it yourself and get lost in this world. It is worth it.    One thing that I loved about this book was that it had a beginning (started a little slow, I have to admit), a middle, and an end. I really cannot stand books that end on cliffhangers expecting you to go buy a sequel to find out what happens. That's not fair to readers at all. That's like watching a movie that ends telling you to \\"tune in for the sequel.\\" Um, no thanks.    I would rate The Hunger Games 5 out of 5 stars. Great read with lots of cool twists, and solid characters that you can really connect with and feel something for. No one-dimensional Sallies here. The action is literally non-stop, and you will react emotionally to this story even though it's sci-fi fiction. It's gritty and raw and dramatic. I enjoyed it immensely, so yes, an indirect shout out does need to go out to the raving lunatic fan in Barnes and Noble. Thank you, crazy lady, you made my day by bringing my attention to this book.    Check out my profile info for my website and more reviews.
0316069884|3.0|The beginning chapters, and the ending chapter are totally worth reading!  Safran-Foer's description of his family and their relationship to eating is wonderful!    The middle of the book will quite likely put you off eating meat, after you read about all the processes used to bring meat/poultry to market.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I love Zakk Wylde and all the music he produced with Ozzy and by himself but after hearing Black Rain; I knew Ozzy needed to freshen things up a bit. Scream does just that and has a totally different feel than Black Rain. I knew nothing of Gus G but he definitely has a different style and tone than Zakk. Interestingly, as a guitar player I can hear some of George Lynch's darkness in Gus's solos which I love. Gus uses more exotic modes and scales than Zakk. That's the neat thing about musicians; they are basically an amalgamation of their influences but in different priorities. This creates almost infinite possibilities of music and song writing. Think about how many rock and roll songs have been written since the beginning and yet very few (besides the obvious copycat bands) are completely unique.     As far as Ozzy, well I honestly don't know how he sounds this good. It may be some studio magic but I've also seen him live and he pulls it off live as well. The guy is something else really. For some reason he sounds extra growly and heavy on this album compared to say: Black Rain or Down to Earth. I'm guessing that was some studio jape going on but it works for sure. I'm in disagreement with those that write in about these `old' heavy metal bands and say \\"they should hang it up...\\"...why???? I mean what is $13 dollars for a CD this day and age. If you don't like it, sell it back on Amazon. The thing that always kind of bothered me about rock and roll and heavy metal in particular is that it's assumed that these musicians get `worse' with age. Generally and in any other style of music, that's simply not true. Like anything else, the more experience and knowledge you get about a particular thing the better you are. Unfortunately, heavy metal stars are judged not only on their musicianship but also on their athleticism and the ability to jump off a stack of Marshalls. However, seeing an old grey rock star reminds us we don't look any better and thatdoesn't make us feel great about ourselves either. The truth hurts......    Buy Scream...it's very good heavy metal rock and roll...period.
B000VALY54|4.0|I watched this on a whim since I'm a fan of RDJ and Kilmer, respectively. I love detective stories and the overall theme is a loving tribute to the more Pulpish, hard-boiled variety. The dialogue is extremely well written, being punchy and nothing short of hilarious (in a good way).<br /><br />Protagonist and pop culture savvy, 4th wall destroying narrator of KKBB is Harry Lockhart (Downey Jr.); a rather inept thief suffering from a serious case of verbal diarrhea, whose half-baked plans never really amount to anything even remotely productive. Despite being kind of a loser, his almost childish enthusiasm manages to endear the audience to him completely. He teams up with his unrequited childhood crush, Harmony (Monaghan), both fueled on Johnny Gossamer pulp-gumshoe stories as they clumsily investigate a murder. Dragged into the mix (kicking and screaming) is a detective/personal consultant by the name of \\"Gay Perry\\" (Kilmer), who functions as the sole voice of scathingly sarcastic reason and unwilling bodyguard/baby-sitter to the danger prone Harry.<br /><br />Kilmer and RDJ are perfect as a comedic duo and Michelle Monaghan is nothing short of adorable and equally as funny in her role. The film takes a few interesting twists as more back story is uncovered during the murder investigation, but kind of suffers from mood whiplash. One minute we're viewing a laugh inducing scene, then have serious moral issues dumped unceremoniously and far too suddenly in our laps. It's definitely not for everyone and some complain about the `slow pace' of the film, but I didn't find it to be noticeable or tedious. If anything, I found the pace to meander between solid and choppy.<br /><br />I really have to praise Downey's and Kilmer's portrayals, as their exchanges basically comprise the majority of the humor and add this `buddy cop' feel to the story, despite Lockhart being a rather pathetic ex-con. Near the tail-end of the movie, Kilmer delivers a shockingly emotional scene when confronting Harmony's lousy excuse for a father, which comes rather unexpectedly, but is definitely one of the highlights of the film in terms of acting. RDJ again displays an uncanny ability to seamlessly become his character to the fullest extent as the emotionally immature, yet strangely adorable fallguy.usy excuse for a father, which comes rather unexpectedly, but is definitely one of the highlights of the film in terms of acting.

0374158460|3.0|jonathan franzen writes well, and the book is extremely entertaining, a real page turner.  with  a lot of ironic humor  (how very modern) and insider pop culture references. but this is definitely not the or a great american novel, hype notwithstanding, in this reader's opinion.   more a slight of hand virtuoso performance. parodying contemporary times, without any overarching moral theme. for something more meaty, also with humor, try david mitchell's Cloud Atlas.
1439153663|4.0|I just finished reading \\"The Kitchen House\\" and must say, I found it to be absorbing, believable and quite soberng at times! I enjoyed the steady back & forth of Belle & Lavinia's accounts of the passing years. It was if they were each 'talking' to me, telling their stories.    The only 'draw back' was the last few paragraphs. I wish there had been a few more pages dedicated to the ending. It left me a little 'flat' and empty. It is the only reason I rated this wonderful book a four, instead of five stars. I highly recommend reading it!
B002VECMAE|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, in spite of several problems with the script (very thin and scattered) and the storyline (especially the contrived and undeveloped ending).  Clooney is great in his role, and the rest of the cast provide some very unique performances that are fun to watch.  What I most enjoy about the movie, though, is the fact that it never takes itself too seriously, even when aiming at important social issues, and that it never presents anything in black and white--every issue is presented in shades of grey that allow the viewer to think about things without being preached to.  Every supposed criticism from one side is couched with a flaw in perception from that side that may or may not invalidate that criticism.  The filmmakers don't try to explain anything in terms of right or wrong, but in terms of what may be right and what may be wrong; what may be true versus what may not be true.  In that way, the film is highly enjoyable and entertaining.
1439181780|5.0|This book is a real eye opener, I have read the book The Secret which is the first book from Rhonda and was delighted. The Power is the follow on from the Secret but you don't need to have read the Secret to enjoy this book completely. It is a book you will read over and over as there is a lot of information to take in.     If your life is a bit stagnant at the moment, read this book. It will reinforce your positivity and create the life that you want for yourself.     As you will learn, nothing is impossible if you are positive about yourself.    Enjoy this book! Enjoy life!
B0036EH3XE|1.0|It is easy to make a gripping and exciting TV show full of intense and incredible scenes, if you as the writer never have to concern yourself with the small detail of how to make it work in the end, how to unfold the story, how to explain all the mysterious things in any meaningful way.<br />Remember it is these mysterious things that made the show such a hit in the first place.<br />How often did we sit there and ask ourselves: my God, what could this be? Wow, how is this possible?<br />And our excitement was due to the fact that we couldn't wait to find out what the explanation was, was it not?<br />Now imagine you watched the show and knew from the very beginning that all these great mysterious storylines would never be explained at all or the explanation would be totally dumb and very, very thin. Would you have been excited?<br />I could think of a lot of very cool highly mysterious things to put on a TV show if I never have to bother with how to reasonably explain any of it.<br />I think we've all been played for fools.<br />And I am concerned that - in the greater picture - Lost may have opened the box and other franchises have picked up (or will pick up) this idea of how to make easy money on TV.<br />We - the viewers - will only find out after having watched at least a couple of seasons.
B000L3CHC0|4.0|I love the way this watch looks on my wrist.  The face is beautiful, and the touch of yellow on the chronograph hand is great.  I'm having trouble sizing the watch perfectly though.  I'm either going to have to wear it very loose or somewhat snug.  There is a small adjustment you can make with the wrist clamp, and loosening that a bit did help.  One thing of note: the watch band is very shiny;  I don't think the pictures convey that very well.
0345505387|4.0|I am a Gabaldon fan, and this is the first graphic novel I've ever read.  I found the artwork beautiful, and the extra insight into the Outlander story very entertaining.  I liked seeing bits of the story that Claire knew nothing about.  I can see how it could be a bit confusing for someone who hasn't read Outlander, but for those of us who have, it was a treat.  It provides a quick Outlander fix if you're in need of a little bit of Jamie and Claire.  I would recommend reading Outlander, then reading The Exile.  It is definitely worth it.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|I'm a big sci-fi fan, but I like my books to zip along and take me for a ride and this one does not disappoint on any level. The atmosphere created in the future Thailand is rich, the characters intriguing, and the ideas suggested for our future planted their seeds in my brain and stretched their twisted roots into all kinds of areas.    I can not wait to read the next novel this amazing writer brings us next.

1142816893|4.0|I've just finished a re-read of Eleanor Porter's \\"Pollyanna,\\" which apparently I had read a number of times when I was younger, because I remembered every single little aspect of the plot.  I suppose many people already have at least a passing familiarity with this tale, which was first published in 1912 and has been reprinted many times since then, as well as having been adapted for the screen on numerous occasions.<br /><br />I confess, I was surprised at how well this story held up when read through adult eyes. Oh, it's rather sentimental, true enough, but perhaps I'm not as jaded as I would like to think I am because some of the sentimental/emotional passages totally did a number on me!<br /><br />Obviously this book has staying power, though the dozen-plus sequels that followed (written by a number of various authors) have long since faded from the public's memory. To the best of my recollection, the first Pollyanna book is far superior to those that followed, but I still wouldn't call it perfect. The \\"plucky orphan\\" character has long been a staple of children's literature and has appeared in many guises throughout the years, but immediately after I started reading the book I got a very strong \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" vibe, \\"Anne\\" having been published four years previously to the first printing of this story. This feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu continued on and off throughout the novel, and I couldn't help but wonder if Porter was influenced by Maud Montgomery's work.<br /><br />Despite a number of interesting little sub-plots, the narrative of Pollyanna is rather loose and episodic, and I think I would have liked to see all the story elements woven together more completely. I also noted that a handful of key scenes were played off-stage, and only referred to by the characters in passing, which seemed a bit odd to me.<br /><br />But, I suppose the primary problem I have with Pollyanna is the heroine herself. She's just TOO good, TOO sweet, TOO everlastingly charming and upbeat to be the least bit believable. Now, I wouldn't say that she is OFFENSIVELY good---unlike the horribly sanctimonious Elsie Dinsmore (a favourite Victorian child heroine), Pollyanna doesn't preach to the other characters or give the impression that she's morally superior to everyone else. But Pollyanna didn't come across as a natural little girl for me; she pales not only into insignificance, but into invisibility, in comparison to the marvellous Anne Shirley of the \\"Green Gables\\" books. In addition, I would say that Pollyanna's general naïvet&eacute; might have a certain charm in a child half her age, but in a ten- or eleven-year-old character, it just seems a bit odd. I don't want to sound too mean-spirited, but you'd almost think that she has some sort of developmental disability. So, the portrayal of the main character is kind of a major drawback to the novel.<br /><br />Still, despite a somewhat mixed review, I'm going to recommend this story; I think at least some young people of today would enjoy it, though obviously it will probably have more appeal to young girls than to young boys. And if you have even a passing interest in vintage children's literature, this book should be read at least once, as it's been so iconic in the field of American juvenile lit.  I'll give it four stars, with the high rating due in part to the nostalgia factor, since I did enjoy this very much when I was young.<br /><br />(You know, from my youthful reading I remember Aunt Polly as being very old in this book---so imagine my surprise to learn that the character is actually five years younger than I am at present. Man, I am so totally depressed now...)<br /><br />This book has been published in many varying editions over the years (including an abridged paperback version for the school market, sold by Scholastic). The copy I've just read is the same one that I had as a child, published by The Page Company in 1914. (I'll upload some photos of this book to Amazon'sdatabase.)  It really is a lovely edition, and I would recommend this particular version if you can find it. The boards are covered in a green patterned cloth that catches the light in different ways, depending on the angle you look at it. Tilt it one way and you'll see a diamond pattern of light fleur-de-lis on a dark background, tilt again and it's dark fleur-de-lis over stripes, tilt again and you'll mostly see just the stripes, tilt again and the light stripes turn dark and the dark stripes turn light----okay, okay---you get the idea I'm sure! Now, I know there must be a name for this sort of material---but I know almost nothing about fabric and so can't describe it using the correct terminology.<br /><br />This edition also has eight illustrations tipped in; full-page black-and-white paintings printed on glossy paper.  This once again reminds me that it's a real shame so few juvenile titles contain pictures in the present day---these are quite nice.ticular version if you can find it.

B001NT0TF8|5.0|Yngwie was ALWAYS at the top of my 'all time fav guitarist' list. Many don't like him, probably because of envy, or jealousy of his overwhelming mastery of his instrument. Many musicians back in the 80's, when they 1st heard him, came close to throwing down their instruments and giving up! Seriously, they did..Because THEY wanted to be THAT guy playing those passages. Yngwie started a new revolution in guitar playing, may as well accept that, like him or not. But i will say this....If there was never an Yngwie, there would never have been any Steve Vai's, Joe Satriani's, Tony Macalpines, Paul Gilberts, Vinnie Moore's--nor any of the new age guitarists out there playing and incorporating 'those same chops and licks' in music today. I will admit, these days Yngwie isn't doing ANYTHING to impress. But he's already laid down the foundation, and EVERY guitarist out there KNOWS who he is, and will say he was one of the inspirations for them to pick up the guitar, including myself. Like him, or not,,, he was easily one of the greatest musicians (not songwriter), of all time.. hands down. I just wish he would go back to what he did best, back to his roots, and bring all of his long, lost fans back.

This is a picture book of us and it can be damn uncomfortable. Read it to the end. You might end up LOL at yourself and your BFFs.
030726839X|5.0|This book is, indeed, a study of the finest years of Winston Churchill, as war leader of Great Britain.  It grew out of a comment made by Roy Jenkins in the course of writing his 2001 biography, which is arguably the best single-volume work of its kind.  As other reviewers have noted, the book also works as an unauthorised sequel to William Manchester's incomplete The Last Lion trilogy, which is the best biography of Churchill's life and times there is.  This is a focus on Churchill as war leader, not a study of the man per se.<br /><br />To sum up the theme of this book, Churchill got a lot of the little things wrong, but got the big thing - winning WWII - right.  As it turned out, he was also right about the post-war world and the threat of exchanging the Nazi empire for a Soviet one, but was powerless to arrest this on his own, and was powerless to convince Roosevelt and the US to assist.  In part, ths was due to his getting the little things wrong.<br /><br />From the fall of France, the Battle of Britain, North Africa, Italy, and D-Day, the big picture of WWII is laid out.  Greece was perhaps Churchill's last success of WWII, at least by some values of success.<br /><br />There is sorrow here also - the loss of Poland, the looming horrors of the Soviet Iron Curtain, all flowing from the fact that having allied with Stalin to defeat Hitler, the western allies were stuck with Stalin to the bitter, bitter end.  Without Stalin, there could be no battlefield victory for the west; with him, the victory was gall and wormwood.<br /><br />This is a superb volume, dealing with the role of Churchill in WWII, and the role he played in shaping the post-war world.  Although never stated in the book, it is clear that to the extent that the US and Britain today share a \\"special relationship\\" - and they do, and arguably stronger now than in 1945 - this should be seen as Churchill's true legacy, one myth he spent his life's work to turn to truth.  Hastings here shows the decline of Britain and her Empire over the course of the war years, the ebb and flow of popular support for Churchill and the war, the troublemakers in Cabinet - to rise above all this, as Churchill did, is probably the truest mark of a great man, save for his utter public lack of any resentment at the loss of office in 1945: his simple exit, without recrimination, shows his complete commitment to British democracy.<br /><br />The book does end in 1945: there is no coda dealing with Churchill's return to the Prime Ministership in later life, or his death nearly 20 years later, so do not expect that at the end.  This is simply a history of wartime Britain as Churchill made it: when his war ended, so did the story.  It is an excellent retelling of those dreadful years when the fate of the world hung in the balance, and Churchill's attempts to bring down Nazi Germany.the course of the war years, the ebb and flow of popular support for Churchill and the war, the troublemakers in Cabinet - to rise above all this, as Churchill did, is probably the truest mark of a great man, save for his utter public lack of any resentment at the loss of office in 1945: his simple exit, without recrimination, shows his complete commitment to British democracy.

B00127RAJY|3.0|Jillian Michaels is NO JOKE!!! This was my 1st JM workout and I must admit she is Tough... I found her toughness to be a good motivation for me when certain parts became difficult. I am no stranger to working out. I would place my fitness level at intermediate. I was able to move through level 1 with ease, but level 2 prove to be a problem. It took me about 2 weeks to easily move on to level 3. Level 3 is just plan TOUGH!!! all in all good workout. My only complaint about JM' circuits is I hated the 1(cadio),2(tone), & 3(ab)combination. it became annoying to constantly have my heart rate going up & down. If the ab portion could have been included at the end of the workout I would've gave 5 stars on the 30 day shred.  Other than that I look forward to rest of JM's workouts..
B0034G4OVS|2.0|As it's been mentioned already, this is movie is exactly like Open Water, but on land and with wolves instead of sharks.  The movie could have worked as a land adaption of Open Water, but it starts off in the most off-putting way possible -- it has the typical, cliche obnoxious 20-something character types that NO ONE ever cares about and therefore makes you almost want to root for their demise.  This is yet another movie I had to edit via the FF on the remote because there's just so much boring, uninteresting dialog from characters that are stereotypes.      The film does strike a chord for me though, because I grew up snow skiing and occasionally the lift will stop to accommodate someone having a hard time getting on or off, and almost every time that happens, I can't help but think of the \\"What if there's no way off but to jump\\" scenario.  Although I can't ever recall worrying about wolves waiting for me on the ground.    And come on, out of the 3 of them, none of them had their cell phone with them?
B000002HD5|4.0|My friend is a big Afghan Whigs fan, and has been trying to get me to get this album for a long time. He finally gave up and just got it for me for my birthday. It's not that I wasn't interested, it's just that it was never in stores when I looked for it and never came to mind when I was online. I've heard at least most of the songs at some point before already, so there weren't many surprises, but hearing the entire thing flow as an album was nice. I don't love it as much as he does, but it's still a solidly enjoyable collection of songs, and generally more interesting thematically than what I usually listen to, which is often a lot of nonsense lyrics.    It's pretty hard alternative rock, mostly. Greg Dulli plays his guitar and sings angrily. The rest of the band backs him up. Towards the end they mix it up a bit, with female vocals on the powerful \\"My Curse\\" and an instrumental final track. There's a lot of repetition if ideas in the lyrics, including a cool reprisal of the opening song's chorus with a new twist on it in \\"Debonair\\". It seems like the kind of album you keep getting more out of the more you listen to it. It's pretty much what I've come to expect from well regarded rock bands of the 90s, a lot of good hard songs but not a lot that I find particularly gripping while listening casually. I definitely think Dulli is an interesting guy, so I'll probably check out some more of his work.

B002ZG983M|5.0|\\"Kick-Ass\\" engaged me from first frame to last.  Reading some of the more negative reviews the resevations about this film seem to center on the use of a preteen (Chloe Grace Moretz) in violent and profane situations.  This debate has been going on since \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Taxi Driver\\" in the Seventies and this argument will go on forever.  Regardless, I love this movie because it gives a jump start to a moribund genre, the comic book movie.  Director Matthew Vaughan has concocted something fresh, funny, original, and action packed.  Aaron Johnson is fine as Dave/Kick-Ass but everyone knows this is Moretz's vehicle.  Whenever she's on screen the energy level of the film rises appreciably.  Moretz's work here suggests a young Jodie Foster in the aforementioned \\"Taxi Driver\\".  Christopher Mintz-Plasse's star continues to rise after his memorable turn as McLovin in \\"Superbad\\".  If memory serves the film did OK but not great box office.  A sequel is alluded to at the end of the film so I hope \\"KIck-Ass\\" developes enough of a cult following so that comes to fruition.
0061365343|5.0|My four year old loves it. Little House in the Big Woods is so wonderful because Cherry Jones does such an amazing job at narrating the story. Complete with a southern accent and the ability to change her voice for different characters, she brings the stories to life in a way many others could not.<br /><br />Cherry Jones is currently president Alison Taylor on the hit series \\"24\\". But, she also is an accomplished Broadway actor, and after hearing these CD's, I'm convinced that professional dranatic or musical theater actors make the best narrators. Its fantastic.<br /><br />I'd also purchased one of the Magic Treehouse CD sets, which are narrated by the author, who by the way has such poor narrating skills that I couldn't listen to them and actually threw them out, which is why I appreciate Cherry Jones' talented performance so much.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I originally awarded this album 4 stars. I'm modifying it after having given it 7 full-length listens. I'm good with my original review (below), but I've upped my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Don't like it? Tell me why. Fair warning: you have an uphill battle.<br /><br />I wanted to hate this album as much as everyone else apparently does, but I just can't. Is it mellow? Compared to their freshman and sophomore release? Yes. Does it suck? Compared to their third release? No. Compared to their freshman and sophomore release? Sorry, but no. This may be their quietest release, but it's also their most creative. This is a concept album, despite its flaws, and the execution while amateur compared to the bands that invented the idea of a concept album (The Who, Pink Floyd, Kind Crimson) is admirable in an age where the more accessible the music, the happier we are as listeners. This is a more complicated album than most will give it credit for, but before you go back to jamming to the pop-tart top-40, try listening to this album all the way through with no distractions and no preconceptions. You may just like what you find.

B000002KXV|5.0|During his period as half of Steely Dan for all intents and purposes Donald Fagan's lyrical focus had always been on sly,cryptically phrased musings on the various twisted urban misfits surrounding him and Walter Becker in New York City and LA. It became a trademark. But Fagan had another side to him and a lot of it had to do with a comepletely middle American existence in 1950's suburbia. From the stark black and white back cover photography of tract housing to his somewhat ambiguous manifesto written on the back this is certainly a very clever way to differenciate Fagan as a solo artist outside Steely Dan. Musically this album is not in fact too different than [[ASIN:B00004YX39 Gaucho]] but the sound of the album is quite a bit more full and keyboard oriented. It could easily have been a Steely Dan album since all of the same musicians that you'd find on a latter period Dan recording and the same polished sound,enhanced further by the fact that this is one of the earliest full digital recordings ever made. Songs such as \\"I.G.Y\\",\\"Greenflower Street\\" and the wistful shuffle of \\"Walk Between The Raindrops\\" explores the pseudo futurism and often ironic romanticism of post WWII America with Fagan wittily crooning about \\"getting your ticket to the wheel in space\\". The funkified \\"New Frontier\\",named for JFK's famous slogan gives a similar treatment to an atomic age fallout shelter romance Fagan may or may not have genuinely indulged in during his young. That romantic end of the theme is again explored in the ballad \\"Maxine\\" with some wonderfully multi tracked vocals as well as the well received cover of \\"Ruby Baby\\",adding to the period flavor. The title track stars Fagan as \\"Lester The Nigthtfly\\",a graveyard shift DJ broadcasting \\"jazz and conversation\\" while taking some eccentric call in's along the way. There's also a noir-ish political intrigue Cuban revolution-era sendup on the breezily percussive \\"The Goodbye Look\\". Even though the album has a unified lyrical and musical theme it also contains enough variety and charm to make it work in many context,from the audiophile to the irony of hearing this entire album played beginning to end for years in the local supermarket. Either way it's one of the most welcoming and clearly defined of the all the Steely Dan related releases and was the best possible way for Fagan to begin his career on his own.ified lyrical and musical theme it also contains enough variety and charm to make it work in many context,from the audiophile to the irony of hearing this entire album played beginning to end for years in the local supermarket.

B000002J0N|5.0|When Crosby, Stills & Nash released CSN in 1977, the world had changed quite a bit from that dream of '69 - still a long time before the dawn indeed - but somehow they managed to record an album which bore an incredible unity with all three of them bringing inspired songs to the brew. How can one not be moved by the sad beauty of Cold Rain or the irony in Anything At All??? What about the magnificence of Cathedral? All songs are magically crafted, bearing wonderful harmonies - even for their high standards. Great rock grooves provided by Stills also guarantee CSN's versatility. And taking into account the context of the times around its release, CSN is particularly strong and easily surpasses their works as solo artists or duos.<br />This is by all means a great record from start to finish, something to ride along their original 1969 release with ease. Also, mention should be given to the exceptional audio quality of this remastered edition, something which gives it the required clarity it deserves. A true classic.
B001QOGYFO|4.0|I enjoyed this more than I expected to.  Glad it was on TV, and I didn't buy it.
B002ZG97V0|3.0|First off--Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole is not meant for little kids.  It is directed by Zack Snyder, who also did Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead, and 300.  This is also a pretty violent film.  I am suprised it didn't get a PG-13 rating.  It doesn't contain any blood, just ruffled feathers.  Still it might give youngsters some nightmares.<br /><br />This owl flick is definitely a visual delight.  The CGI images are indeed crisp and amazing.  I watched it in 3D at the Imax theater, although I don't think the gimmicky glasses and resonant speaker system added anything to the movie.  They sure as heck didn't help cover the monotonous, derived storyline.<br /><br />It doesn't take long before you get the feeling of being kicked out of your nest before you are ready to fly.  Not that any aspect of the plot will go over your head, it is painstakingly simple and cliched.  The story flutters through a basic good owls vs. bad owls conflict.  There is no intelligent dialogue.  Not much humor.  No clever birds and the bees innuendo either.<br /><br />Final assessment--Booooring, bird-brained disaster--2.5 stars.  This film would have been better if it was geared toward little kids with less violence and a cute little message woven in.
0345505387|5.0|I am not a typical Gabaldon fan -- I read the first three books, but stopped after VOYAGER, and I don't have EVERY single character, love scene, setting, and plot point memorized. Nevertheless, I thought this little graphic novel was a lot of fun. Jamie and Claire are drawn much sexier and more fresh-faced than I pictured them in the book. In a way that's not so good for Claire. She's a tough, smart, worldly woman, and in this graphic version she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen!<br /><br />But I adored the humor and the light-hearted romantic moments so much more, like when Jamie is holding her on his lap and he says out loud \\"I will protect you always\\" but inside his head he's thinking, \\"she has the most wonderful round bottom!\\" Diana Gabaldon is a genius, and in 500 years people will still be reading OUTLANDER and comparing it to ANNA KARENINA and ULYSSES. But the lady has a sense of humor too, and this little book was a real treat for her fans.
B004047XXO|4.0|To compare the strengths and weaknesses of two different types of 3D I watched this movie with both the red/green anaglyph 3D glasses that comes with the 3D DVD, and with a pair of TV Eyes 3D Glasses, a new kind of non-electronic 3D glasses designed for use with regular 2D movies and TVs.    Ice Age is always a fun franchise, and Dawn of the Dinosaurs holds up that tradition admirably. This DVD comes with both a 3D format DVD, and a regular 2D DVD, as well as 4 pair of red/green cardboard (anaglyph) 3D glasses.     I watched both versions of the movie on a 32 inch RCA HDTV, and turned off the room lights as the DVD instructed for 3D viewing.      I tried the 3D version of the movie with the red/green glasses first, and I was surprised at how well the colors came through. Often anaglyph movies can have a strange silvering effect, basically washing out all but a few colors, but this DVD actually did very well. The mammoths', sloth's, and tiger's fur all looked the right color brown, and the white of the snow and blue of the sky came through nicely. It did tend to make dark blues and greens stand out oddly, and eyes and mouths tended to have an oddly psychedelic flashing quality as they went from pink to white and back again, especially in fast motion scenes.     For the most part the tracking and converging of the frames was very good, ghosting was mostly limited to far away objects, which could gain a pink side shadow, and the occasional odd effect, such as one scene where the possum's noses were very luridly pink all during one scene.    The depth of the image was nice, adding a true three dimensional feel to the backgrounds, and while there weren't any \\"jump out\\" scenes that I noticed, there were some wonderfully deep and solid looking scenes, such as when Sid and the eggs are thrown into the air and briefly \\"float\\" in space until they start falling.     This is definitely the old fashioned \\"50's\\" style of 3D, with the colored glasses, but overall it was done verywell and made for a very entertaining movie.     Next, I watched the 2D version of the movie in 3D with the TV Eyes 3D glasses. TV Eyes 3D glasses are a bit odd compared to most other 3D glasses, because they have a row of small holes across each lens. You have to look through the holes to watch the movie. I didn't think they'd actually work when I first tried them, if nothing else I figured it would just be impossible to see out of the holes, regardless of whether they did anything 3D or not.     They did make the room dimmer when I tried them on, but once I aligned the holes the way the instructions said, and turned off the lights, I could see the TV just fine.      This type of 3D was not as deep as the red/green 3D glasses. Things didn't stand out quite so much in some scenes, but the characters did look very solid and three dimensional. The main difference (aside from the colors) that I saw was that the red/green glasses had a tendency to give a \\"layered\\" look to some scenes. Almost a pop-up book effect sometimes as if things had been laid on top of each other. The TV Eyes 3D wasn't as deep, but the transitions seemed to be smoother. Giving a more natural look to the depth it had.     The other thing that I really liked about the TV Eyes 3D was that it made the picture very clear and sharp. The 3D was actually higher definition than my regular HDTV. I couldn't see the scan lines or pixels, so it made it look that much more real without losing detail. And the colors were very natural. There wasn't any problem with psychedelic colors or the pink flashing eyes like with the red/green glasses. It was just like the normal movie picture had been upgraded for clarity, while also adding a bit of depth, like the background had been pushed back so you could see the shape of everything.     So, for me, it was a toss up. For a really deep 3D experience I'd go for the 3D version of the movie with the red/green glasses. But for a more natural, less distracting 3D view I'd probably go with the 2D version of the movie and the TV Eyes 3D Glasses.     I also saw this movie in it's original 3D theater release in Real-D 3D. That effect was about halfway between the two discussed here, Real-D at the theater had all the depth of the red/green 3D version, while having the natural colors of the TV Eyes 3D version.     But, however you decide to watch it, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a totally fun movie. From its mad-weasel dinosaur hunter, to its \\"lonely hearts\\" musical scene of the acorn being \\"Alone Again\\" when Scrat gives it up for the love of a flying squirrel.     Brilliant!

I'm not a science writing buff but in the hands of a great storyteller, a writer with investigative journalism skills and a deep passion and commitment to the subject matter, this is a total home run.

006112429X|5.0|Where to begin?  Let's start with the fact that motherhood is viewed from what is likely a very unpopular cultural perspective.  That's the first thing that got my attention when I saw this on the table at Barnes and Noble and then bought a few more copies on Amazon to give to folks so I would have someone to talk to about it.  I thought, this is interesting...someone is actually going to acknowledge in writing, that not every woman in America wants to bear children.<br /><br />That right there takes chutzpah.<br /><br />Not only is the protagonist unabashed in her desire not to give birth, but she is just as pointed in her decision to have the child because she wants the man (e.g., her husband) that comes with the baby she doesn't really want, but oh well.  Whoa!  I'm lovin' it.  Gutsty, gutsy.  \\"Punchline\\": The child turns out to be a psychopath.  Hmmm, bad mama or bad seed...?<br /><br />None of the main characters are particularly likeable.  Yet for me, one of the many gifts of this jewel of a novel is that despite not personally liking the father, son, or mom, I found their characterizations by Shriver to be luminously compelling.  And while I didn't \\"like\\" them, her gift as a writer allowed me some sense of sympathy.  I mean, all around bad choices.  Who among us is perfect?  I can relate to that human condition in general, if not to the heinous specifics of this particular family.<br /><br />I thought, where on earth can this woman (Shriver) possibly go with this story?  And all I will say is that she blew my mind FIVE TIMES:  1) with her writing, it is so beautiful; 2) the juxtapostion of this rose blossom of craft and the thorns of a truly dark tale, 3) the first suprise toward the end; 4) the second surprise even closer to the end, and 5) the last surprise, which is also the very last line of the book, which made me gasp it was so creatively courageous.

1416589473|5.0|The book is a must read for any fan of GW, and for other's it might help to use a wiki on some of the thing's it references because it seem's to take the view that you know a little about the game to begin with    the book has a steady pace throughout with some awesome fight's and gives a good look into the world of GW2
B000O599WG|5.0|This film is my choice for the best western ever. To me it's what \\"high noon\\" tried to be. John Wayne was at his best, Dean Martin should have received an oscar nomanation and it had many others in a great supporting cast(even Rick Nelson did pretty good)basically it has a simple story about a sheriff(Wayne)who is holding a killer in his jail until more authorities show up.The killer's brother a big shot who will do anything to bust him out. Out numbered with only an drunk deputy(Martin),a crippled elderly sidekick and an inexperinced young gun, he manages to do his job. It also has a very good DVD extra included.

B003L77TZI|4.0|Katy Perry's album Teenage dreams-  I bought this listening to the two signature tunes- Teenage Dreams and California Gurls, which are really the best numbers from this entire album. However, unfortunately, this opinion doesnt change even after listening to the entire album.   Pros-  The two tunes (aforementioned) are really catchy, peppy and uplifting (even the videos are good, although bit provocative). You feel like listening to them over and over again. Apart from these, the other nice tunes from this album would be \\"last friday night\\", \\"Firework\\", \\"peacock\\", \\"circle the drain\\", and \\"E.T.\\". However, there are  flaws with the album which make this entire album not \\"very great\\" altogether.  Cons-  Katys voice that has gone off-pitch in many of the songs (especially \\"whom am living for\\", where it is horrible. An excellent tune here has been ruined just because of her voice). So, although the tunes are good, it makes you turn off your music because you can't take the screeching sound. Plus, some tunes that have real \\"explicit\\" contents like \\"peacock\\" and \\"circle of drain\\". These songs surely cannot be played at home and only meant for the night clubs (which is OK).  Bottomline-  Katy really delivers excellent dance tunes which are surely going to be hits in future, but her \\"album\\" altogether isnt that exciting (presentation and theme of the album is done well though). She has all the poteintial though. Its OK that this album has been made by keeping the college crowd in mind (and it will serve its purpose), but it is also true that albums that contains great tunes, which are not composed for a particular group of audience will be accepted by a larger crowd and make a long lasting impression. We can expect this from talented Katy in future!  Out of 12 songs, 7 are good. This is good enough to make you spend 10 bucks on this album I guess..
B002U33GUQ|5.0|Definitely one that I enjoyed listening to. Has a new sense of cross genre implementation. He uses a canvas that is somewhat foreign to the jazz scene today. Very much in the likes of Billy Childs. Could you imagine the music he and Billy Childs could make? I'm waiting for that album : )
B002Q85A1I|4.0|There are so many wonderful editions of Tchaikovsky's The Swan Lake, how does one choose? The music is absolutely supreme, so only one conductor's and orchestra's view is hardly enough for this work. Many conductors call their Swan Lake complete in 4 acts, but there are some short, lively supplements to act 3 that really should be included with any set that calls itself complete. Previn includes the extra numbers, so it's already a plus. The LSO and the recording sound great. Not a Swan Lake to knock your socks off, but a lovely rendition. I prefer Sawallisch, Dutoit, and Lanchbery. We need complete CD editions of the ballet from Ormandy, Fiedler and Fistoulari. Those LP's and CD highlights are the real deal in excitement, elegance and joy, as dated as they may be. Ozawa/BSO is high in excitement and fine playing from the BSO, but unfortunately lacks the added numbers.

0312600844|5.0|I am a bit surprised at the polarized opinions of Freedom.  That it may not speak directly to everyone, I understand.  But 'a waste of time'?  I think not.    Franzen delves deeply into the psyche of America in the last quarter of the 20th century: the opportunities and expectations of a prosperous generation; a coming of age of late baby boomers in the 70s and the struggle between the abundance of freedoms and the responsibilities that come with maturity, family, and friendship.  He plays it out by weaving the theme through individual struggle, relationships, political and social issues.    If you can't find yourself somewhere in the mix of Patty, Walter, Richard - the extended families, your not trying.

B0034G4OU4|5.0|I came out of this movie and completely broke down. I realized for once that I was not the only one experiancing this. Afterall they made a movie about it. So I must not be alone. Secondly I had advice on how someone else overcame this. I want to purchase it and watch it over again, until I get it. The message is crucial to so many women and I would advise young women to learn from this. I cannot say enough good about this movie. It is life changing, at least it was for me and obviously for others. Saw this with my Mother, when we came out of it she said \\" that was about you\\". She was right and it helped my healing begin.
0545310601|5.0|Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! I finished reading this book a few weeks ago, and it is one of the most phenominal things I've ever read. It had me almost wincing to turn the pages to see if everyone made it out alive, and with those who didn't SPOILER ALERT: Prim, Prim..PRIM...I cried right along with Katniss. The way Collins wrote, she bled life into her characters, she make us CARE, so when the war in Panem was over, and Katniss pieced together her \\"Memory Book\\" you could feel the echo of all those lives gone, and those who told their stories, so they wouldn't be gone in vain. This isn't a very good review, but it's how I feel. This was a fantastic, heart renching end to a story.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|This is one of those classics that I first watched with my kids when they were young. The classic special effects brought back memories of other classics of that era, particularly Tron. The Blu Ray format brings a clarity that makes those special effects even more believable.
B00009R86L|3.0|Since this is advertised as a Post Office shoulder pad I wanted to try it. It is better than what came with my bag but not nearly as giood as the Op-Tech that I bought after sending this back.

B003WKFAIW|4.0|JUST LOOKING AT THE ARTWORK BEFORE THE CD WAS RELEASED I THOUGHT WHAT A COVER LIKE 1980'S BANDS (example ratt  \\"out of the cellar\\" this is pop, commercial because of the production. i still think it very good music.  the band sounds great, very good harmony, i gave it 4 stars because some of the songs sound so shania twain.  but we know that is because of the producer. then i hear a little def leppard in the song \\"hands all over\\",     i like the music and the  energy
B000BSLU2S|5.0|First off I bought this with my Coolermaster Hyper 212 Plus CPU Cooler expected to get just another thermal compound. There was more compound in the tube than most that I've used before, I had to enough to cover my CPU and GPU easily. Since it was an upgrade by getting the cooler I wasn't so sure of the effiency of the compound. The solution applied to the GPU was the noticable one, I was worried that I would have to buy a new Video Card due to overheating. After I applied it, I turned it on and instantly I noticed a 9-11C drop. I thought this was weird because it usually runs hot until the compound molds, this is just good stuff. Don't go wrong, stick with these guys and buy the lastest and greatest in thermal compounds!<br /><br />(just remember to clean your chips good before applying.)

1439102813|5.0|This was a thought-provoking, heartbreaking but beautiful story of Alice, a highly intelligent Harvard psychology professor who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at the age of 50. I was totally drawn into the book, which shows Alice's worsening condition month-by-month and the effects it has on her and her family. It was a touching story and one I won't soon forget. Ms. Genova is a talented author who has given readers a look inside the brain of an Alzheimer's patient and shows the havoc and confusion that the patient is experiencing. I have not read a book like this before and I feel I have a new understanding and sympathy for anyone going through what Alice experienced. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a profound and lasting reading experience.

B002RV01QI|2.0|I have every Enya album, and have listened to her since I was 11.  I object to almost every song on this \\"Best\\" of album.  Granted, I didn't buy it, a co-worker did.  Amarantine was not her best album by far, so why ANY songs from that were on here is highly questionable.  Watermark, Orinoco Flow, Caribbean Blue, Only Time (only since it was SO popular), Boadicea, and Athair Ar Neamh are deserving.  But she picked the least original from her Day Without Rain album.    I don't know... maybe I am too biased... but from my perspecitive, this is a very disappointing album and I would like to know who picked the songs, and what were they based on.  Calling ALL of these songs as \\"The Very Best Of Enya\\" is borderline absurd.
B002ONC9NM|4.0|The movie is set in 1961, a year before Beatlemania sweeps the world. It features Jenny, an above average girl in a school trying to get admission to Oxford. She finds her surroundings stifling, her peers' average and yearns for a life when she can travel at will and enjoy artistic and literary pursuits. She meets an older guy and is attracted to him. The movie details this union and its eventual conclusion. I liked the movie a lot even though found some of the situations a bit puzzling and they were the scenes that involved her parents, how on earth did they get taken by this stranger that they allowed their daughter to go out on dates with a much older man. I also found surprising the fact that her school never got involved more deeply and kept the parents uniformed about the affair. I guess this is a movie and such artistic liberties are normal but it could have happened because the script by Nick Hornby is based on a memoir.<br />The leads acted well and I particularly liked her father played by Alfred Molina, who wants his daughter to move up the social ladder so badly that he is willing to do anything for that. Peter Sarsgaard is amazing as the much older man who falls in love with a younger girl; none of his actions suggest that he has any guilt. I thought the movie was directed well with above average performance including the lead Carey Mulligan, who was simply superb as Jenny. I gave it three and half stars. 9/24/10

1601252463|5.0|One of the complaints my players have now that we've switched to Pathfinder is that the core classes are so potent that it's almost a step down to take a prestige class, but with this new book you get a whole handful of new base classes to fill any spaces left by the originals. There is also a very good section on magic items, and the feats list is ludicrously extensive as well as extraordinarily useful for all classes. Finally, the alternative racial favored class options allow for a very diverse set of options for players that choose to stick with one class for the long term.
1594484775|4.0|I've been a fan of Nick Hornby for years, loving his work but still yearning for something to match the witty About A Boy.  I brought Juliet, Naked with me to my car dealership while getting some work done on a Saturday afternoon.  I ended up  reading this book non-stop until 4 a.m., and eventually finished Sunday afternoon.  Though I still won't put it on par with About A Boy, this was the first Hornby book that I virtually read non-stop.  It was that good.    The book focuses on obsession and mid-life crises.  There is Duncan, a 40's something man who is one of a few people obsessed with the obscure, reclusive musician, Tucker Crowe.  Duncan is a professed \\"Crowologist,\\" and has spent many years analyzing and over-analyzing everything there is about Crowe.  He has even created a website dedicated to Crowe, and a few scattered people from across the globe share their obsession with Duncan on this site.  I couldn't help but think about the fans that have obsessed with Syd Barrett since he became a recluse(though I read that Hornby got the idea from Sly Stone's reclusiveness).  Annie is Duncan's girlfriend, who realizes she has wasted 15 years of her life with this man--precious years that she will never get back.  Tucker has been living in obscurity since suddenly leaving the music industry 20 years ago, and has nothing to account for all those years.  He has 4 children, several ex-wives, and no money.  A simple review that Annie gives of a newly found, stripped down version of one of Crowe's albums, referred to by Crowe fans as \\"Juliet, Naked\\" is the catalyst for all the characters to try and change their lives.    The big point the novel seems to put forth is, \\"don't waste your life away if you're not happy--do something about it.\\"  You don't have to be on top of the world, but don't \\"settle\\" either.

B002ZG98UA|3.0|I thought the 1st one was okay to pretty good.    The 2nd one uped the action & weirdness very well.    The 3rd one had me very interested from beginning to end.    This one didn't have much except regular zombies for the most part which was disappointing.  The beginning sequence was a neat way to capitolize on the end of the 3rd movie.  I really wish it had ended about 3 minutes before it did.  The cliff-hanger was not needed in my opinion nor do I hope they make another one to resolve it.  I think the series should pretty much end here but somehow I doubt it will.    Worth a rental not a purchase in my book.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|If you like Gladiator then you will like this. I wouldn't say it is as good as Gladiator, but it is very good. It beats Alexander big time, and is a better movie I think than Troy. Although the action scenes aren't quite as good as Troy when it comes to swordplay.  Very good BD. One of the best looking ones I've seen.
0446563048|5.0|While the first quarter of the book precedes the Zappos days and explains the life paths that took Tony to Zappos, the remaining part is pure, unadulterated knowledge.  From looking at Customer Services as an extension of Marketing rather than as an expense/cost center to the method of paying new employees to quit, the methods used to build this business are diametrically opposed to what mose business sees as normal.  When you finish the book you'll likely do as I did - bring up these items for serious consideration in your next board or executive meeting.  One cannot argue with the success of Zappos, so read the book and take to heart what Tony shares.  It's good for all.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a great heatsink. Currently one of the top performers out there, with the great new direct contact heatpipe technology, this heatsink is easily competitive with other heatsinks over twice its price. Installation is a breeze, and although it requires a backing plate on the motherboard, and some people complain about that, backing plates are pretty standard on such large heatsinks.    One problem with this heatsink in my system is that it's too tall, but that's something I knew going in to the build. This heatsink is monstrously tall, and you should probably check the measurements and compare it to the width of your computer case. In my Antec Nine Hundred Two, the heatsink is placed too close to the side fan mount, making it impossible to mount a fan on the side. If you're planning on doing so, you may want to figure out if it'll fit with your specific case/motherboard combo.    All in all, a great heatsink, it keeps my Intel i5-760 at 30C idle. Under Prime95 load, it'll ramp up to about 50C, with very little ramp up in fan RPM, and it drops back down to normal idle temps within 10 seconds after closing Prime95.

B000G0O5N2|5.0|Excellent movie. They did a good job with this one. Only movie about this scenario Ive ever heard of. Worth watching.
0895774356|5.0|I read this in 2010, 50 years since the original publication. This is a story that takes place on the brink of tumultuous social change and a great racial rift during the 1960's. Told from the viewpoint of a woman recalling her years from the age of 6 through 9, the dialog of the children in this story can be quite comical. Scout, the main character telling her story, has a father, an attorney who ends up defending a wrongly accused black man. Scout and her brother Jem learn quite a bit during that time. What stuck in my mind was the sadness as I relived those kinds of memories. I would have been around Scout's age during that time. The injustices made me cry back then; it did the same for the children in this story. As taken from the book, after the verdict's decision came back as guilty and Jem asks his father how they could do that, his father replies with, \\"I don't know, but they did it. They've done it before and they did it tonight and they'll do it again and when they do - seems that only children weep.\\" What an excellent book. I loved it! Please take the time to read this wonderful classic.

B0037AGASG|3.0|I'll be the first to say that I rarely revolve to \\"tween\\" artists as my `go-to source' for musical entertainment.  In fact, most teen artists annoy me greatly and the buzz that surrounds them just seems utterly ridiculous.  I don't think the buzz that surrounds Justin Bieber is any different, though despite how annoying the sixteen year-old can be to me at times, I am less annoyed by him than say The Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus, both whom have seen their respective popularity peak on recent albums.  Sure Justin Bieber may have a taste of \\"countertenor\\" going on vocally, which doesn't appeal to everyone and causes an eruption of hate to pummel the teen heart throb, but one can't deny that `catchiness' often accompanies `corniness.'  That is the case with [[ASIN:B0037AGASG My World 2.0]], which is a better effort than `The Biebz's' debut [[ASIN:B002T921AC My World]]. Sure, teenage males will all grumble saying that Bieber's voice isn't any deeper, but slowly and slowly, and perhaps most recently in appearances, Bieber's voice changes slightly, reminiscent of Chris Brown's vocals from his first effort to his successive efforts.  But enough rambling, I find 'My World 2.0' to be a solid album, considering its market for \\"tweens\\" and even for adults who don't mind some catchy, corny cuts every now and again.<br /><br />\\"Baby\\" featuring Ludacris was way overplayed, but isn't every great hit overplayed anymore?  The production/songwriting team of Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart and The-Dream pen yet another pop gem, in all its catchiness and ridiculousness.  No one would call Bieber \\"prodigious\\" here as a vocalist, but the track does suit his adolescent voice well.  And Ludacris's verse is clever as always, even if Justin Bieber is actually 16.  \\"Somebody to Love\\" is clever as well, smartly contrasting \\"Baby\\" with an up-tempo dance number that is inline with the electro-centric pop/R&B music of today.  Again, \\"Somebody to Love\\" benefits from its catchiness.<br /><br />\\"Stuck in the Moment\\" again suits Bieber's vocal range, and does so with a catchy refrain (\\"I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place...\\"). \\"Stuck in the Moment\\" fails to be as captivating as \\"Baby\\" or \\"Somebody to Love,\\" but is still enjoyable.  \\"U Smile\\" is a nice sound for Bieber, exploiting the most beautiful facets of his voice.  \\"Runaway Love\\" one-ups it featuring the best production work of the whole album and giving the listeners another catchy, sugary refrain.<br /><br />\\"Never Let You Go\\" is pleasant, though not profound, but still sticks in the listeners heads (those refrains Bieber).  The refrain this time is as follows: \\"its like an angel came by and took me to heaven/cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go)/take my hand, let's just dance/watch my feet, follow me/ don't be scared...\\"  Corny, annoying pop genius - especially for teenage girls.  \\"Overboard\\" is ok, though it feels like a rewrite of Jordin Sparks' \\"Battlefield\\"; furthermore as far as duets, there was slightly more chemistry on say the Jordin Sparks - Chris Brown duet on \\"No Air\\" than this duet between Bieber and relatively unknown Jessica Jarrell.  Bieber out-sings his duet partner (did I really just say that?), showing us the potential this will come from Bieber in the future as his voice deepens, etc.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Eenie Meenie,\\" featuring Sean Kingston, is dumb.  It may be dumb and annoying, but it is catchy nonetheless, thanks to production by Benny Blanco (a Dr. Luke associate).  As far as separating Bieber as an artist from being a `teen-pop/R&B star' to being solely a `pop-star,' it does not benefit Bieber necessarily.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" features nice slick production, though it is not a revolutionary cut.  Final cut \\"That Should Be Me\\" is vocally Bieber's best cut showcasing the strength of his vocal nuances and ad libs.<br /><br />Honestly, it is not a bad album.  There are better albums and albums I would revolve to before this one, but My World 2.0 is a push forward for Bieber and I'd be interested to see what comes next in his career.  3 1/2 stars.ieber and I'd be interested to see what comes next in his career.  3 1/2 stars.

B000063DIR|1.0|The listing says bonus tracks, but their is only one track that was previous released as a B side on vinyl.I got rid of this one quickly. It just didn't hold up to the originals. I realize that none of the band was happy with the final product originally. They had to go back on tour and couldn't be there for the mix down. I felt like I was scammed after buying this album. I'm sure it brought the extra income to the Osbourne camp as they intended. They could of re-voiced Randy's playing as he did multiple tracks when he recorded this album? His original recordings are analog so it doesn't really sound quite right with the rest of the re-recorded tracks using different technology. Quiet Riot did a better job when they re-released  the old Quit Riot material, where it actually improved the recordings. Maybe this turned into some sort of Axle Rose syndrome. The reward for Robert and Mike to be in Ozzys touring band was to be on this recording (It was great to see Mike on the first Black Sabbath reunion tour) and to be a part of history. The re-recording just doesn't fit. Ozzys voice sounds less raw and more processed, which does  help him stay in tune more and it  does helps  him sound less wasted (and less on the edge of a nervous breakdown). All those years of cringing I guess they couldn't resist. [[ASIN:B000002B7O Diary of a Madman]][[ASIN:B000002B7O Diary of a Madman]]
B000P6XU5G|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time in beautiful HD. BD though wasnt too great. No surround sound, but what can you expect from a movie made in late 50's.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|You know a movie is bad when you keep checking your watching every 5 or 10 minutes.  That's exactly what I did as I was watching this dud.  The ending was predictable.  I lost interest whether the girl would find her father or not.  (Frankly, I didn't care after a certain point.)  I found little to no character development.  This movie is very overrated.  I know a lot of people will probably say that they liked the themes of how sometimes we have to do what we don't like to do in life and the importance of hope.  I say: big deal.  Don't waste your time or money seeing this dud.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|A little silly at times....but excellent movie. Its just too bad I wasted my time with meet the spartans because now its hard to take this movie seriousy becase of that horrible spoof. Still worth watching though.    For those complaining of the grainy quality....that is there on purpose. They made this movie to look that way, its based off a comic after all. Its supposed to be dramatic, dark and they pulled it off.    Kudos
B00000K3D4|5.0|I don't know what it is about fantasy movies from the 80's, but so many of them are THE best of the genre. Return To Oz, The Neverending Story, Legend, The Dark Crystal, etc. Each of them have a charming and captivating quality that fantasy adventure flicks of the last 2 decades don't possess. Same goes for the 1986 Jim Henson classic Labyrinth.<br /><br />Loosely based on Maurice Sendak's children's book Outside Over There, Labyrinth follows spoiled 15 year old Sarah (played by a young Jennifer Connelly) who's too obsessed with fairy tales and her stuffed bear Lancelot to think about others. The immature brat whines and complains about having to babysit her baby brother Toby while her father and stepmother go out on a date. Wishing to be rid of the screaming infant, Sarah calls for the Goblin King to take the child away forever. Turns out he's not just a character in a fairy tale, because King Jareth himself (the glammed out David Bowie) grants her wish and baby Toby vanishes. Immediately regretting what she's done, Sarah is told that she must travel through the Labyrinth to rescue him within 13 hours. If she fails, little Toby will become a goblin forever. No pressure, right?<br /><br />The Labyrinth is a ginormous, mind-boggling maze with so many twists and turns that will make your head spin. Invisible pathways within walls, dead ends that switch from one area to the next, and several traps. Along the way, Sarah befriends the curmudgeonly, jewelry loving gnome Hoggle, large yet lovable creature Ludo, and tiny fox-life knight with loads of courage Sir Didymus. Fearing the girl might succeed, Jareth places several pitfalls to defeat or distract Sarah from her goal.<br /><br />I have to say the whole look of the film from the Escher-styled sets to the Muppets themselves are fantastic. Quirky, offbeat, and reminiscent of the darkness surrounding the timeless fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. The soundtrack is amazing as well.

B001O7JHSE|5.0|I have always loved this movie. It is just amazing. If you are skeptical, check out the IMDB page on it. Its not in the top 250 for nothing. My fave movie, followed by Shawshank redemption and Rio Bravo.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|That's an accurate description.  It is for adults but it features kids, one of whom is a vampire.  You should listen to it in Swedish and read the English subtitles, since the English dubbing is horrible.    The film is very slow paced as well, so you will have to endure that or else hit the FF button on your remote.      The swimming pool scene towards the end is probably the most chilling scene.      Where is Oskar headed at the end?
B001BJ690Y|5.0|One of tarantinos best. Excellent fighting, excellent choreography, even better music. Well worth every penny. He successfully takes culture from numerous types of movies and brings it all together here. CLASSIC
074356619X|5.0|\\"Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne is a book that is best read many times over. Each time I read or listen to the keys and helps in this book, I learn something new. By getting the CD, I use my ears to input the information rather than my eyes.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|Not as good as the original, typical horror flick. Nice twist in the story as with all the Saw films. Not for me though, once youve seen it, its not that re-watchable.

First set I purchased, the right ear can didn't output sound and I had to return it. Had to pay to send it back, what with shipping costs these days, it was quite expensive and the second set works.

Larsson keeps you guessing and intrigued as he describes the plans to uncover the mistery and builds on the relationships of the characters to make them even more interesting. Definitely a great end to the series!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Guy Ritchie manages to stay true to Doyle's characterization of Sherlock Holmes, but more so than past films, this action packed movie highlights the martial arts skill in 'baritsu' that Doyle mentioned. When I saw this for the first time, my immediate impression was that there was much more overt violence here than in any other Holmes film I can recall, but the scenes are extremely well done and the actors are superb. Also, the cinematography was impressive, as were the costumes and sets.<br /><br />The chenistry between Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) is perfect, and it is fun to watch them play off each other with their intelligence, skill and humor. I'm grateful that Watson was accurately portrayed as an intelligent friend and partner to Holmes, true to Doyle's description of his character. I think that Conan Doyle would have been quite pleased with this film in all respects, including his love of the occult and supernatural.<br /><br />I also note that there is a deeper, more purposeful aspect to this story referring to religion and politics and showing how those in power or aspiring to power often attempt to control the population through fear and terror. This happened in ancient times because people could not understand or control the forces of nature, and alas, it is happening now in many parts of the world.<br /><br />Web news services recently announced that Guy Ritchie is doing a second Sherlock Holmes film, due December, 2011. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law will again play Holmes and Watson, and Stephen Fry will play Mycroft Holmes. It would be great to see the major players reunited for more superb films, and hopefully this will be the first in a series with many more Sherlock Holmes movies to follow! Bravo!

B0015DROBO|3.0|I'm not going to recap the plot or the story.<br /><br />I almost didn't get into the book enough to really finish it. It's just soooo slooooow.  On the advice of family and friends I pushed through the first 25% of the book that's rather boring and dry. Nothing amazing really happens until about 55% and it's fairly exciting until about the 80% point. After the climax it was pretty boring and the end just fizzled out.

0140277447|5.0|\\"Civilization itself is paper thin.\\"  Roughly 350,000 Chinese were slaughtered in the city of Nanking by the Japanese during a seven week period.  Women were raped and mutilated while the men were used for bayonet practice.  People were buried alive, set on fire and tortured.  In the midst of a real-to-life Dante's inferno a small number of foreigners fought to protect Chinese lives.<br /><br />The book was written in a very factual, unemotional manner and did not gloss over the atrocities of Nanking.  It is thought provoking and makes one think about civilization and the capacity of humankind .  Overall, this is a very well written book and highly recommended.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie.  At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important.  Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'.  As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels.  The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact.<br /><br />We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to  San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad.  Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill).  One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan.  Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected.  When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.'<br /><br />Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found.  Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe.  There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet.  Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll.<br /><br />Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol.  Though there are flaws present, the overriding effect of the story diminishes them to the point of being inconsequential. This is a very beautiful film, one that do well being viewed by every one on the earth!

B003XL6EKS|5.0|First off I would like to know what is it about the songs Brandon Flowers writes that makes them so addictive?  I was orginally going to give the deluxe album four stars.  I thought the only thing lacking was the magic that you get with the Killers other albums but then again this is just one fourth of the Killers.  However I caught myself singing four of the songs without realizing it and that was after only three listens.  I didn't even know all the words yet!  However the tunes were stuck in my head.  Strangely enough I DON'T really like country music at all and was greatly surprised the most country sounding song on the album The Clock was Tickin'is one of my favorites.  It brings tears to my eyes everytime I listen to it.  The album is wonderfully written, very clever and at times humorous.  Very well done Brandon!  Not a bad song on the album.  I can't wait to hear what the Killers do next!
0345505387|1.0|When it comes to Diana Gabaldon, this is what I've concluded:  1) She's sold enough books that she can write whatever she wants to write. Good for her.   2) She and her publisher don't appear to  care much for what her readers want to read. Not so good for us.    Earlier reviewers have nailed many  of  my own issues with this book, but here's what irks me the most:   Why do all the men look alike?  Why isn't Murtagh old, tough and ugly?  Why doesn't Jamie look like his description? Where's his wide mouth? What's with the cliche superhero chin?  WTF is up with the Sasquatch-looking guy who's in league with Geillis? Of course, once he mingled at Leoch he looked exactly like all the other plaid-clad men we can't tell apart. If he's the  the gargantuan, primal, muscle-bound creature on the last page of Chapter One, oh puh-leeze.   What would someone make of this book who'd never read the Outlander books?  (OT but I have to say it) How many of us are going to go to our graves without know how Master Raymond, the Loch Ness Monster and Stephen Bonnell are or are not connected, among other burning issues? What really happened to Claire's parents, and Roger's? Can travelers steer their way through time, space and distance?  Not that I expected this book to answer any of that, but it didn't answer much else, either.    Anyone who's fallen hopelessly in love with the Outlander series and all the characters therein will buy the next book, and the one after that...presuming we and the author all live that long. But I, for one, will devote no money, time  or anticipation to future projects like this. (The publisher yawns. \\"Hey, we got your money -- what do we care whether you liked the damn thing or not?\\") I feel had, and sad... it's such a potentially  golden chance squandered. There's nothing here for me and I won't be  opening  these lovely, baffling and ultimately, soulless pages again.     I wasn't disappointed that this was a graphic novel. I expected that, and enjoy several other graphic novel series.  Gabaldon clearly enjoyed writing this and working with the artist. Again, good for her...and for the fans who'd love everything she ever wrote, down to her grocery list.  As for me....Half Price Books, here I come.  I predict a lively resale rate for this title.

B003TML0VO|2.0|The first thing I noticed about this CD was the title, and I must admit this is a bad title. These songs are definitely NOT, in my opinion, the greatest guitar songs of all time. That being said, I'm a HUGE Santana fan and was really looking forward to listening to this album. I couldn't wait to hear Santana's interpretation of these songs and was hoping he would have some monster guitar playing on here. Boy, was I disappointed. At best, some of the songs are OK (I like the spanish guitar-influences on While My Guitar Gently Weeps. I also think the guitar playing on Sunshine of Your Love is top notch). But a lot of the songs left me with a \\"What were you thinking\\" frame of mind. The version of Back in Black is ridiculous, and Dance the Night Away was equally as disappointing. They sound generic, the guitar doesn't seem to be the focus of the recordings, and the overall quality is not up to par with Santanta's past efforts. Simply put, the album has no flow to it. I know Santana has released other CDs with various singers, but those flowed well and sounded great. This doesn't. Had I listened to this before I bought it, I would not have purchased it.
B0044KI7B6|2.0|My son and I were both really disappointed in the new seasons 1st episode. It lack so much including a decent plot line. We expected a more exciting story - since Sam and Grandpa are fresh from heaven and hell plus not a whole lot about the cousins. Why the gin creatures? There could have been other creatures that would have made a better story like demons, the trickster, ghosts...these are all creatures they have done multiple episodes on - but the gin - 1 episode and it wasn't focused on the creatures. This just seemed to be the type of episode you would see mid season - not one to start to season off with. It was just flat. What happened - new writers???? We hope the other episodes have some umpf to them...btw, it was neat seeing Corin Nemic, glad to know he has a paying gig and isnt doing those silly internet shows with David Faustino anymore :)

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game of monopolizing the island of Catan is a very enjoyable and somewhat addicting game.

It is different every time you play and you become engulfed in its potrail of pioneer development and ultimate domination.  Game play lasted about 45 min. to an hour.  I would enjoy a more detailed 3D version but I didn't wish to invest hundreds of dollars to obtain one.  I highly recommend this product.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|Atom Egoyan's \\"Chloe\\" will not appeal to all tastes, despite a healthy dose of eroticism (and tasteful nudity), as it is really an examination of love, aging and insecurity, and how our imagination fills in the blanks when passion wanes. The thriller aspect is actually quite predictable, and a bit disappointing, but it doesn't take away from what truly makes the film work; the terrific triangle of Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, and, in a breakout performance, Amanda Seyfried, in the title role.<br /><br />Moore is a gynecologist slipping into middle age, with a still-hunky college professor husband (Neeson), and a teen-aged son who hates her (Max Thieriot, in a role which, unfortunately, largely ended up on the cutting room floor). When hubby skips out on his surprise birthday party, and she finds a photo of him with a sexy student on his cell phone, she assumes the worst; rather than simply confront him, she hires a cute young prostitute (Seyfried), to seduce him, and prove his infidelity. Seyfried confirms Moore's darkest fears, saying that he, albeit reluctantly, responded to her advances. Rather than cut things off, however, Moore, aroused by the thought of her husband's actions, pays to continue the seduction. A bizarre romantic triangle plays out; the hooker provides erotically-charged, graphic details, while becoming increasingly attracted to the wife, who, in her anguished, yet obvious physical arousal by the accounts, responds to the sexual advances of the hooker. Seyfried conveys all this with a combination of sexual savvy and wide-eyed wonder, and watching her bend the sophisticated Moore to her own sexual will, leading to a very intimate, well-played seduction scene, is ultimately, the real climax of the film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot then slides into melodrama, involving the husband and son, loads of guilt, unrequited love, and predictable tragedy. It is a let-down, as I said, but certainly doesn't ruin the overall pleasure of this film.<br /><br />Atom Egoyan's films are always well-crafted and provocative; this is a rare case of the director working from someone else's screenplay (by \\"Secretary\\" screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson), and the end result, while flawed, is still superior to most of what I've seen on screens over the past couple of years.

1401302378|4.0|After reading this book, I noticed Long Tail effects in the world of language learning, where \\"suppliers\\" (those with the ability to teach a certain foreign language) and \\"buyers\\" (those with the desire to learn that niche language) are finding one another online.  As Anderson relates, Long Tail economics work when production, distribution, and transaction costs are decreased.  Indeed, free audio recording software, language learning forums, Skype, and specialized meet-up sites like Mixxer have allowed language learners to fulfill their unique language interests, and have thereby created a mini-boom for learning in \\"niche languages\\", complete with their user-created link repositories, Facebook language exchanges, and so on and so forth.  I imagine this is true for practically every single hobby community out there!

B000AOEMXM|1.0|The final star Trek, and the absolute worst, boldly going where no television show in its right mind would want to go.    The prequel premise was promising, but the series has so many flaws, it becomes all but unwatchable. Perhaps the biggest flaw was trying to form a show around \\"Captain Archer\\", one of the most unlikeable Star Fleet characters ever created. He's pushy, self-righteous, sanctimonious, smug, arrogant, and, in episode after episode, so completely reckless with the lives of his crew and the well being of the ship that in the real world he would have been sent packing after one or two episodes. He consistently ignores every bit of advice and warning given to him by his senior officers, often scolding them as though they were school children for daring to question his judgment. What's the point of senior officers -- experts in their field -- if you ignore every last bit of advice they give you? But Capt Archie alone knows the way and has to do everything according to his own whims, no matter how reckless or ill-advised. His butt gets pulled out of the fire time and time, not by his own ingenuity or smarts, but by chance or the very senior officers he so constantly dresses down. Trying to create a show around such a reckless, irresponsible person was doomed to failure from the start. It's strains credibility that anyone would feel an ounce of loyalty to a caption who seems determined to get them all killed, not just once or twice, but in episode after episode after episode. It's also strains belief to think that Capt Archie was the best they could come up with to handle Earth's first forays into outer space.      But that's just the beginning. If you subject yourself to watching this series, prepare yourself for a never-ending stream of \\"phase pistol\\" fights and watching the Enterprise get pulverized by one hostile species after the next. And virtually every single species they meet is hostile and trying to kill them for one reason or another.     Add tothat the fact that Capt Archie is just plain stupid. There isn't one trap he won't walk into, one ambush he won't avoid, one trick he won't fall for. Time and time and time again. Episode after episode. One of the great things about humans is our capacity to learn from mistakes, a capacity which Capt Archie apparently does not share. Every distress signal turns out to be an ambush, but he keeps right on responding to every single distress call. The security measures on the ship are so lax that it is easily boarded by hostile aliens over and over. \\"Amoury Officer\\" Lt Reed is so incompetent he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if he was standing five feet away from it. The phase pistol shoot-outs go on and on because no one seems able to hit anything.     More disturbing is the level of hostility and angst, which starts off right from the beginning with the demonization of the Vulcans, who are treated so badly in this series it's painful to watch. The Vulcans keep telling the humans they're not ready for inter stellar exploration -- and they're right. And in episode after episode, Capt Archie and crew constantly prove it. But the vilification of the Vulcans goes on and on. But there's more to the hostility than that. The crew walks around with grim faces, the captain is frequently rude and dismissive of his staff, the ship takes pounding after pounding and the crew's lives are constantly at risk but Archer is so busy imposing human morality on every species they meet that he doesn't notice. As the series continue, the levels of tension and hostility continue to rise unabated to the point where it becomes unbearable.     Unlike other Star Trek series, there is little exploration going on here, little science, little science fiction. It's all phase pistol shoot-outs and attacks by hostile aliens and the messianic Capt Archie being called upon to literally save the world (he takes the entire third series to do that, and just when he's saved it, he's called upon to save it again!). With all the special effects and shoot-outs and running and scrambling and crawling through Jeffries tubes, we never really get a chance to know who these people are. Unlike the other series, this one is no fun. No fun at all. No sense of wonder. Very little character development. Just one battle with hostile aliens after the next. It begs the question of why anyone would want to explore \\"strange new worlds\\" when it means running the risk of getting yourself killed time and time again.     Much is made of \\"human morality\\" and attempts to ram it down everyone's throat. As if humans were the only species that had any morality. And the moment that morality isn't convenient for Capt Archie, he tosses it aside and does as he pleases.     It's not hard to see this series is a product of 9/11 xenophobia, where the stranger is always the bad guy and humans are the only ones who act morally.     I could go on and on about how awful this Voyage of the Damned is. Best advice: toss it out the nearest airlock.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|..Awesome product, either you're a fan or not.  The packaging is very well done: the box, the extra objects,...I didn't expect this to be so good and complete.  The extra DVD is just something a long-time fan should have, and the price is very good too!
006145205X|5.0|A very good book on all levels.  Well written, draws on a diverse range of research across different time periods and fields, and has an original and coherent theme throughout  --that humans as a species are distinguished by their ability to trade and exchange not just objects but the ideas those objects encapsulate, and that once we realise this our ability to solve future problems seems all the greater.

B003U9V6A6|5.0|This band offers a fresh sound that speaks to the times, with increasing musicality that in a way is reminicent of the big rock bands of the 1970s, atuned with a \\"modern rock sound\\".  With each album, a richer more vibrant sound echoes - tur the other cheek philosophy in these strange times.

The interaction - and lack of it - of the major characters is really hilarious.  The writing is refreshingly sharp and to the point.  When it becomes vague, it is because it's making you wait to laugh.  All things have been said about the characters are dead on, but no one I've seen has mentioned the little gem at the end of each episode...    Chuck Lorre (creator/writer) uses the credits to vent a bit.  Some of these things are quite hilarious, and more worth mentioning to my friends than entire episodes of other shows!  In fact, if other shows had as much comedy as these little \\"vents\\", they would be more successful!    You definitely want to own the discs to make the episodes flow better.  And, of course, so you can \\"pause\\" the credits to catch Lorre's missives at the end!    Favorite show so far: Leonard's mother visits.    \\"Excuse me; I have to urinate...\\"  Christine Baranski has to come back more often!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I had serious doubts about buying this watch based on all of the poor reviews and I'm so glad I didn't listen.  I honestly can't figure out what all the complaining is about regarding the touch bezel.  I sweat a good amount and live in a warm climate - most of my runs with this watch have been in 75+ degree weather with 80%+ humidity.  I usually soak through my clothes within minutes and I've never had a problem getting the bezel to work.  Today was my ultimate test and I ran in a heavy drizzle/light rain.  It took a little longer than normal (about 5-10 minutes) to get satellites due to the very heavy cloud cover, but once I had them I never lost the signal.  The touch bezel still worked fine with rain on the face of the watch.  It also didn't interpret the rain as a \\"touch\\" as some of the previous reviews stated.  I'm a quite small person (5'2\\", around 110lbs with a small frame) and this fits me great with the included velcro strap.      I use the Garmin connect system with no problems from a Mac and usually only have to charge the watch every 5 days or so (I run about an hour per day with longer runs on the weekend).  I consider this very satisfactory for my needs.  To the reviewer that said a 9+ hour charge wasn't satisfactory for his long runs, I assume this is only a concern for ultra-marathoners.    Update 10/17/2010: I just wanted to add a note for Mac users.  I did encounter a problem with the upload software that seems to be annoying.  I purchased a new MacBook Pro this week that is running Mac OS X v. 10.6.4.  Apparently to upload using this OS you have to reboot your machine in 32 bit mode.  Annoying because you would essentially need to reboot twice (once to get into 32, then once to get back into 64).  This isn't an issue for me since I still have my old computer that I use, but a bit frustrating otherwise.  They are apparently looking for a solution, but it seems that this has been going on quite a while.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|FINALLY!!! Accept is back...and back with a vengeance.    This is the album I have been waiting for since 1986's Russian Roulette was released. To me...the last REAL Accept album. U.D.O.'s Animal House came close (as it was written by Accept to begin with), but this is what Accept should be and this is the sound that is near and dear to all our \\"metal hearts\\".     I'll start with the obvious comments about new singer Mark Tornillo. He is the man for the job, without a doubt. One would think Udo is too iconic to replace...maybe so in 1986...but not in 2010. Mark not only replaces Udo...but SURPASSES him and compliments the band perfectly here. His voice is gruff enough to handle the traditional Udo songs...but has a wider range to enhance these new songs. He has a banshee like scream that is a blend between Brian Johnson of AC/DC and Rob Halford of..well...ROB HALFORD fame.    For me, as it has always been, it's about the maestro WOLF HOFFMANN. He and Peter Baltes have done the impossible. They have taken music that so easily could be considered \\"dated\\" and have made it so contemporary you would not think that this is a band that has been around over 30 years. Andy Sneap (producer extraordinaire of bands like Arch Enemy, Nevermore, etc...)really brought this classic metal act into the new millenium.     I could go on and review track by track...but that is pointless. There isn't a \\"filler\\" track to be heard. This is, quite simply, the best metal album of 2010 and probably worthy of being in the top 10 metal albums of the last decade. It is a classic.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is a classic that I had on VHS and wanted it on DVD for annual Christmas viewing.
B000000OYN|5.0|Whitesnake was on a run of accomplished albums in the early `80's which included `Saints & Sinners' from late 1982.  The overall quality of the record is even more impressive when one considers that the band was going through some severe turmoil from which they would really never recover in their original form. Bernie Marsden and Mickey Moody both left during various stages of the recording process and would soon leave for good when the LP was completed along with Neil Murray and Ian Paice.  Despite that fact Coverdale would soldier on enjoy his greatest commercial success towards the end of the decade.  As far as `Saints & Sinners' goes, the record is chock full of songs that epitomize the best of Whitesnake's first era - \\"Bloody Luxury\\", \\"Victim of Love\\" and \\"Rough n' Ready\\". \\"Here I Go Again\\" and \\"Crying in the Rain\\" also make their original appearances here and while many people prefer these versions, I still like the ones from `Whitesnake' (when I usual prefer the former - see \\"Fool for Your Loving\\"...eesh!). Again `Saints' was only a success in Europe and not the USA which is where Coverdale knew the big money would come from. And he was right....
0439023491|4.0|I enjoyed this as much as the Hunger Games, but couldn't quite give it 5 stars this time. Collins penchant for narrative is, at times, more than I needed and slows down some otherwise great dialog, some of her best scenes. While the details of food and costumes was intriguing in the first book, I was skimming through it this time. I also settled on 4 stars instead of 5 because I got tired of the love triangle. Katniss seems to be in love with whatever person is in the room with her, Gale or Peeta. It just went back and forth too many times. Distracting. I still enjoy Katniss's character, the flawed, self-reluctant hero.<br /><br />Revisiting the Hunger Games a second time was just as exciting as the first book, unfortunately it comes 2/3s through the book. Perhaps this is what spoiled it a bit for me because I knew she was going back after inadvertently reading spoilers, so my experience might have been different had I not. Collins still paces action really well in addition to creating the world of the Hunger Games. In retrospect, I feel the book would've been better served getting to the Games sooner and drawing more conclusions in the end.<br /><br />I'll be there for the third book.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is one of our all-time favorite movies (it's based on the true story of amateur golfer \\"Francis Ouimet\\", played by Shia LaBeouf).  We had loaned out our previous copy, and it was never returned; so we were delighted to find a replacement through Amazon.com, when we could not find it in local stores, nor other on-line sources. This was a new DVD, at an excellent price.
B003EYVXYG|4.0|Minor Spoilers Alert!!  First, I am a HUGE Romero fan, but I am a bigger zombie flick fan. I love them all, the good, the bad and the down-right awful. My sons and I have regular Zombie movie nights where we watch 2-3 zombie flicks and either laugh, cry or get the crap scared out of us.   We watched Diary of the Dead again right before watching this one, and they are definitely different types of zombie flicks in my mind.  Is this the worst zombie movie out there? Heck no. But it's certainly not the best Romero one either. But so what! He meant this to be off beat and funny. And it can be a serious study of the social complexities of the human/ zombie experience with its hidden correlation to modern day societal moral principles, as noted in other reviews. Depends on what your looking for:) But I recommend that the haters watch it with a B-Flick mind set and enjoy it for what it is...a George Romero zombie flick!!! The parts you're complaining about are the best ones! How about the scene where the old guy jumps onto the boat? Did you see his landing?!?! OMG, we watched that sucker a hundred times and laughed out azzes off! His facial expression alone was hilarious! Or the times when they lost their Irish accent (think about the Irish blessing that was said with a stick of dynamite) though-out the movie? We thought it was a lot of fun and I am DEFINATELY adding it to my collection :)
B0013FSL0C|5.0|A great combination between reality and fiction. Interesting for a professional view of several moments of the therapy, such as transference and counter transference, defense  mechanisms, and other therapy realities. Great work, and exiting performances!!
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book! As far as young adult sci-fi goes, Suzanne Collins got it right!   This book was not only intriguing, romantic, suspenseful, witty, full of action...it is completely appropriate   for it's young adult audience, yet interesting enough for adults.  I read the three books one after another because I could not wait to find out what would happen next. Neither will you, check it out!

B002KS1IJC|3.0|Wasn't a bad film, but certainly nothing I would spend more than the $3 dropped on here to rent it.  This is one of those films that's original enough, paced  just right, and has a good blend of various elements to make it worth a watch between better movies and TV shows.    Essentially a light sci-fi take on the Beowulf myth, \\"Outlander\\" ultimately turns out to be another \\"hero versus monster\\" movie.  That's not necessarily a bad thing; many movies have become classics, and build entire franchises around this core concept.  But in and of itself, this makes the movie not terribly original.  The most original aspect is that the hero is a space-traveler who crash lands with a vengeful alien creature in Bronze Age Norway, and that the monster isn't just another mindless killing machine, but it as a bit of an agenda.  The hero, Caviezel's character, must then set about finding a way to work with the local villagers to stop the monster, the Moorwin, before it completes its vengeance.      For a seemingly outlandish (no pun intended) concept mixed up in a cliche'd genre, the movie actually plays better than expected.  The subtle character development of the hero is done fairly well, enough so that you at least come to see him as more than a standard tough guy, monster killer.  And the surprising twist concerning the monster's origins make you nearly sympathize with the creature's motivations (but not quite; it's still violently butchering everyone and has no spoken lines, so for all intents and purposes, it's still just a monster).  In addition, cinematography, musical scores, and special effects are surprisingly well done for a movie of this caliber.  And yes, as another reviewer points out, the monster is surprisingly original in design and concept.    However, this movie suffers from several glaring logic problems (most notably, HOW DOES A SPACE FARING HUMAN LAND IN BRONZE AGE NORWAY???; is there some time travel stuff they forgot to mention?  Oh, and steel doesn't cutthe monster, so they take the advance metal from the hero's space ship and are able to reforge it using a simple fire??).  And the ending to the movie is more than a little contrived, enough so that you might roll your eyes and scratch your head at the same time.  Further, while they try and give the Moorwin monster a back story and reason to not completely hate it, this effort ultimately fails, and you still end up seeing it as a mindless killing machine that needs to be put down like some feral dog.  And the course of the movie is still fairly predictable and not terribly unforeseen.  Finally, this movie starts out looking like a sci-fi, but if you're expecting anything resembling the standard lasers and aliens and space-ships and cool planets fare, don't bother; after about the first 30 minutes, this is mostly an ancient-style monster tale.  Nothing really sci-fi about this movie.    So, in summary:    Pros:  --- Good special effects  --- Fairly original story concept  --- Original monster design and concept  --- Decent character development (especially for a movie of this type)  --- Decent pacing, scoring, and action    Cons:  --- Multiple glaring logic problems, starting out at the very beginning  --- Not a terribly original or unsurprising ending or event development  --- Some story and character development is mostly weak and wasted  --- Movie appears to be a sci-fi, but ends up just being another ancient monster movie    I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, by any means, but I definitely wouldn't buy it, and I probably won't ever be watching it again.  It was a decent movie to watch while eating supper one night, when nothing better was available, and Sophie Myers (Freyya) is a hell of a looker, even in this grimy movie, but don't go in expecting anything terribly memorable.
B003XWEQ1G|3.0|I was very appreciative of the grand way in which Ridley Scott told this story, but it was rather bothersome to hear them speak about Richard the Lionhearted by calling the crusades \\"his crusades\\". Scott throws in a scene where the Robin is talking about killing women and children at some battle, and how the muslims only looked on the english with pity, as though they are above savage actions.  This added a political tinge that i felt was un necessary, and coupled with the free to be you and \\"lesson\\" that robin gives everyone, and the very hippie-ish ending, i found that this went from an entertaining film to some kind of lesson.   For historical accuracy i will up my rating of 3 stars to 4, but for that preachiness i spoke about prior i lower it back to 3. Worth watching all in all
B00004TH7Z|3.0|I really like the songs and melodies, but in my opinion, Steve Harris ruined this album with his bass playing.  It doesn't sound like a bass guitar at all...sounds almost like a metal \\"clunking\\" sound (and now that you've read this review, you will always hear it...just like the cow bell in \\"Don't fear the Reaper\\").<br /><br />Seriously, listen to the bass in any song off this album...it's not a bass like you're used to hearing...it's a constant \\"clunking\\" that totally ruins this album!
B003TML0VO|1.0|Shocking how sonically TERRIBLE to listen through. Santana is a master, songs are chestnuts. Some may benefit from ultra-compressed sound, as \\"Dance the Night Away\\". But the mix of most of the record is so off the wall bad that It's almost as if this was made in someone's living room with $700 ProTools. But I Love Carlos, how can you not? This is like a K-Tel Record of the 70s on T.V.! IT should've been 'Not available in Stores'.
B0000A98ZP|2.0|This is just one of the most overrated films of all time.  Probably because of the emotional investment so many of its fans have in it, as they saw it when they were teenagers, or, just as likely, pre-teenagers.  But even older critics seemed to have suspended their judgment.<br /><br />Despite having been made in, and so heavily identified with, the 80's, Breakfast Club is firmly rooted in the pop psychology movement of the late 60's/early 70's.  Much of the \\"action\\" In the film consists of the eponymous \\"club\\"  sitting in a circle and trying to \\"break down\\" each other's \\"walls\\" (in the parlance of the times), a trope directly lifted from the 70's pop psychology Encounter Group therapy session of the type seen in films like \\"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\\".  A lot of these scenes are right out of the rule book of the infamous Synanon House of the period, where the \\"encounter\\" style was far more aggressive, and could turn into an attack on a single person.  This happens a lot in Breakfast Club, to each of the characters.  Most of this psychological terror is carried out by the school bully, Bender, played by then-25-year-old Judd Nelson, who incessantly harasses most of the other kids in room, who are there involuntarily, (for detention).  The only \\"kid\\" (actually a 25-year old Emilio Estevez playing a kid) to hold his own against him is Andy, \\"the jock\\".  There's also \\"the nerd\\", played to the hilt by Anthony Michael Hall, and \\"the prom queen\\", played by Molly Ringwald, ( about two years away from throwing her career right down the dustbin of history ).  Ally Sheedy plays \\"the loner\\".<br /><br />In the weird logic of Hollywood, all of this abuse just makes the kids love Bender more.  Similarly, at other points in Breakfast Club we are repeatedly expected to feel sympathy not for the victims of abuse, but for their tormentors, not only in Bender's bullying actions, but in the Estevez character's whining, self-pitying (and, I might add, seemingly endless) monologue about committing some freakishly creepy sexual abuse on some poor kid.  Apparently, it really hurts to bully people.  The film industry, largely made up of people with Leftist tendencies, often asks us to sympathize with bullies and criminal perps, a couple of the most egregious examples being the bleeding-heart hand wringer Dead Man Walking and the South African film Tsotsi.<br /><br />The \\"encounter sessions\\" in Breakfast Club are interspersed with small, generally non-sequitir vignettes of 50's-style teen rebellion, e.g., the crazy, spontaneous dance scene, backed by a soundtrack that was already dated back in 1985.  This little sequence gives the movie its biggest WTF moment, when Estevez lets out a leonine roar, and suddenly a plate glass window shatters ( It plays like some weird fusion of Heroes, Dune,  and Footloose ).  So disjointed is this film that it seems as if several different writers were working on different parts of the movie, and when they were done writing, they just sort of patched it all together in random order.<br /><br />Worst of all is the way the film resolves itself, as, for no apparent reason, four out of the five kids pair up (guess who gets left out?  Bingo!  \\"The Nerd\\"!  How's that for a depressing message for at least a portion of the audience in a film that fancies itself \\"uplifting\\"?)  In addition, the eccentric \\"loner\\" chick is turned into a clone of the prom queen (and there's another nice message, this time for the female portion of the audience: conform, girlie)!some freakishly creepy sexual abuse on some poor kid.

B003J27WFW|5.0|The band Rush is the Rodney Dangerfield of music - no respect.  Despite dozens of gold albums and decades of consistently sold out concerts - Rush's extraordinary musicianship and half dozen bona-fide rock anthems are consistently ignored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (and critics in general) in favor of critic's darlings The Stooges (among others).  To some Rush fans, this is an outrage and part of the Hall's conspiratorial bias against progressive rock that has kept Yes, and until last year, Genesis, out of the Hall.<br /><br />But this isn't the whole story.<br /><br />Rush is an odd band. Their vocalist, Geddy Lee,  sounds like \\"a hamster being chased by a flamethrower.\\" Their lyrics, written by drummer Neil Peart, while drawing on numerous literary sources (most famously Ayn Rand) - can be some of the most tedious in rock. When it all comes together however, like it does on \\"Tom Sawyer\\" \\"Free Will\\" or \\"Spirit of Radio\\" and a dozen or more other songs, Rush's music is something  unique that ROCKS! I dare say a song like \\"Limelight\\" is downright irresistible to any fan of rock and roll. The opening riff, the drum fills, the lyrics, the spacey middle section - all epic and iconic at the same time. Is it any wonder it can be found on the game Rockband!<br /><br />Thanks in part to the bands longevity, some are taking a second look at Rush and their place in rock and roll history. Recent appearances by the band in the movie \\"I Love You Man\\" and the TV show The Colbert Report have brought them back into a bit of, ahem, limelight.<br /><br />A terrific new documentary, \\"Rush - Behind the Lighted Stage,\\" furthers the case for revisiting this often dismissed band as one of the great bands of rock. Filmmakers Scot McFadyn and Sam Dunn, previously of Heavy Metal: A Headbanger's Journey and Iron Maiden: Flight 666, clearly know their material and have created a most respectful, mostly chronological, documentary of the band.<br /><br />Having full access to the band and their inner circle, McFadyn and Dunn provide a portrait of Rush's history from their high school struggles and early gigs, the addition of \\"new guy\\" Neil Peart, and their evolution as music makers from concept albums to more radio friendly tracks.  What emerges from this telling are three pretty regular Canadian guys who seem down right well adjusted and relatively nonplussed by their fame and success - this despite the constant criticism and a few personal traumas (Peart lost his daughter and wife).  They really seem to enjoy each other, the music they make, and the fans that like them. No bitterness comes through. There is little Behind the Music to unearth, and this documentary avoids that more tabloid tone.<br /><br />What also emerges is their incredible precision as musicians. \\"If you can play Rush, you can play anything!\\"<br /><br />Talking heads like, Gene Simmons, Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan, and Jack Black (among others) provide witty and insightful commentary about Rush's career while showing the influence Rush has had on many of today's musicians. Clearly the respect for Rush runs deeper with musicians than the critics.<br /><br />I hope some members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame view this as they may find they actually respect Rush more than they realize, and vote them in. For everyone else, it's just a great documentary to be enjoyed recalling how fresh it was to hear \\"Fly by Night\\" all those years ago.ovide a portrait of Rush's history from their high school struggles and early gigs, the addition of \\"new guy\\" Neil Peart, and their evolution as music makers from concept albums to more radio friendly tracks.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Oh hell yes! I always liked Accept, but this album is by far their hardest and best ever. One hell of a comeback. Finally Metal(true metal) is back, and Accept is leading the way. Yes hard Metal with melodies and harmonies like we had back in the eighties. The new band members are great with the original members. A perfect fit. I always thought metal died back in the eighties but if other bands do a similar thing then Metal itself can make a comeback in the tens or whatever we call this decade. All the songs on this album are good even the ones I did not like as much as the others I liked. Do yourselves a favor and treat yourself to this kick ass album now.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Robin Hood the tale that has not been told to often before. This movie was a lot better than I expected. Many people say it is no Gladiator, but its not fair to compare it to that movie when it is a different story all together. The story is the beginning of the Robin Hood story and tell of Robin Longstride and how he became Robin Hood. This movie in forums has been said to be made in planning for a sequel. I really hope they make a sequel to this great movie because it deserves one.    The movie itself has quite a few great actors and actresses and they all hold their parts very well and keep the story very interesting. When I saw it in theaters with some family of a younger age 18 and 15 they said it had too much dialogue but on the contrary I thought the dialogue added to the legend and back story quite well and engrossed me in the film. I have always been a big fan of Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett and in this movie I thought they fit their roles perfectly. The story was great and the quality of the soundtrack was epic and the usual for a Ridley Scott movie. I will not delve into story because you have to see it to really enjoy the greatness of this movie. All I can say is treat yourself to a great film that some have said is not one of Ridley Scott's best but in my opinion it is up there with the best of them and comes very near to Gladiator one of my favorite movies! Watch it and enjoy!!

0374158460|5.0|I read the article about Franzen in \\"Time\\" magazine recently -- and thought that FREEDOM would be a bit \\"heavy\\" for me.  Then I saw it on sale at Costco, skimmed a few pages, and realized it wasn't at all what I'd expected.  I spent the better part of this weekend reading this book, and HIGHLY recommend it.  I found the growth, changes, and healing which occurred within all of the characters in the book to be   believable, touching, and inspiring.   (A reviewer below is concerned that the book is unrealistic in certain areas.  To me, that was irrelevant -- it is realistic in all the ways that matter:  i.e., the dissection of the human heart and soul.)   Bravo!!
B0013USZHG|5.0|Incredible CD, not only because these are teenagers playing and lots of them.....13 bassoons and a long list of double bass players.  The recording's sound is amazing. You hear every piccolo, glockenspiel note or clave beat as much as every tuba and percussion. I am partial to the bass sound so I'm happy to say it is loud and clear but no section overpowers another. Whether the results are from the mixing in the studio or the actual playing, it's very cool to listen to.  The syncopation, the triplets, mixed meters are played with such ease. The transitions from variation to variation in # 4 are so exciting.  How I would love to see them live, to watch the horn section dance and see the timpanists play.  Smooth as silk legato to allegro and fff, like a stadium of sports fans rising as one...The energy is contagious.  I play it in the car, loudly.  I am Swedish/English and have a love of Celtic music but this music is something else. I am also envious of the program, the system, in Venezuela. Creative geniuses made this happen. Bolivar, Dudamel, and the players.  Bravo, More!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Masterpiece Classic's \\"Little Dorrit\\" is the most special, endearing and heart-warming piece written by Charles Dickens that you will ever want to experience.  It is by far my favorite movie of all times, in which I would have easily paid 10 times the price of this 4 set DVD collection to watch numerous times over.      \\"Little Dorrit\\" played by Claire Foy and \\"Arthur Clennam\\" played by Matthew Macfadyen are incredible in their performances, in which both present themselves in the most giving spirits that you'd wish every human being possess.    Wikipedia has a well written write-up on the series at [...].  But it seems to lack the emotional side that this series will make you feel.    On a scale of 1-100, I would give it 1,000 along with 2 thumbs up and 2 big toes up!!!  I hope you love it as much as I do!!!

B000FC12C8|1.0|Hi,<br /><br />The good: everything you have read about Benjamin Graham's classic is true AND the text is well written.  Jason Zwieg's comments at the end of each chapter and footnotes are excellent.  Both Graham and Zwieg make excellent use of data to back up their ideas.<br /><br />The bad:  every page or two brings more examples of the horrors of the Kindle edition.  The data tables are illegible even when one zooms in to them.  The footnotes make forward and backward references to page numbers in the print edition but do not link to those locations.  Thus, Amazon has managed to use digital technology to make an excellent book look quite poor.  Perhaps they were afraid that diligent readers would look too deeply into the investment quality of Amazon stock.<br /><br />While this book is a must read, and Kindle addicts will want the electronic version, Amazon really needs better quality control.

0553582038|1.0|After reading the first 3000 pages in the series non-stop, and loving every word, it was like suddenly hitting a brick wall. Brienne, Cersei, ok ... but where is Jon, Arya, Cat? At page 400 or so I peeked at the end of the book and saw a little note from the author that explained things - my favorite characters would be in the NEXT book! Ok, well, I'm ok with that and back on track and have ordered book five from Amazon UK, because I don't want to wait another 6 to 8 months.
0345505387|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I highly recommend it to fans of the Outlander series.
1402760663|5.0|A rather relentless exposure of the deliberate slaughter of the American Indians of the American West from 1850 to 1890. It does become depressing as we move from one chapter to the next and one tribe after another is lied to, plundered, forced to re-locate and its' members killed off through-out all these phases. It is indeed a very sad reflection on America.<br /><br />In these pages there are very few Americans who made a genuine attempt to deal humanly with the Indian nations. The only thing that can be said is that the European Americans (settlers, miners, industrialists, railroaders and soldiers) saw land and took it. The reservation system was simply land that no Americans wanted and forced the Indians to occupy it at dire cost.<br /><br />In the long history of modernity coming in contact with tribal peoples, little good ever occurs to the indigenous population. This is certainly borne out in the pages of this book.<br /><br />What is also interesting is the complete disconnect between Washington government policy and events happening to the Indians out West instigated by the settlers and the army.<br /><br />It must also be remembered that at this time African Americans were enslaved or had just been released from slavery. They too were a disenfranchised people on the American continent. It is hardly surprising in this context, that Native Americans had much to fear from the movement of European Americans to the West. America was not a society that had a history of dealing benevolently or equitably with non-Europeans.<br /><br />This new Sterling edition has wonderful photographs and illustrations of a long ago vanished people.

B00006J3WH|5.0|This is a must-own item for any Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan. \\"Once More With Feelings\\" is one of Whedon's greatest creations. With the same catchy music, earworm lyrics, and hilarious personality that is to be expected from the man who brought us Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog, the OMWF soundtrack captures the essence of what Buffy is really all about.    It's clear from their quality that James Marsters and Tony Head are the only professional singers in the group, but Emma Caulfield could definitely pass as one as she really shines here. Amber Benson is also fabulous, and guest star Hinton Battle does a very classy job. Alyson Hannigan and Michelle Trachteberg were a little squeamish about singing and thus have less parts, but nonetheless both sound very sweet. Nicholas Brendon seems to be trying his absolute best, and can have a pass because he's funny, but Sarah Michelle Gellar is the only one who really stands out as *definitely* not being meant to sing. Her voice is so tweaked that it's kind of depressing. And yet she still manages to be epic. That's one thing we love about BuffyTheCharacter--- no matter how flawed she is, she will always be adored. <3.

B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Look, it is not really a FIVE Star film. Compared to the AVP ones it is, but it is really a solid 3.75 Star Film, but the fact that some people feel compelled to give it only a single star is Absurd and forced my equally absurd higher rating of FIVE.  If you liked the original, you can't help but like this one, as it is more of the same.  I loved the homages to the Original, and it was entertaining.  If you didn't like the original movie don't bother watching this one.  With that said, it was a good movie.

030745455X|3.0|The second installment in the Millenium trilogy delves more deeply into the history of the title character, Lisbeth Salander. Larsson weaves an entertaining and complex tale of political intrigue, sexual perversion, and family dysfunction, but--as was the case with the first novel--the narrative is uneven and sometimes meanders as it attempts to find its identity. Part psychological character profile, part political thriller, part police procedural, part social critique, The Girl Who Played With Fire is a frustratingly inconsistent novel. For example, after one of the most dramatic and shocking moments in the book, Lisbeth Salander simply disappears from the story--I know this dramatic convention is intended to parallel the secrecy she must maintain as a result of the events in the story, but just when the action is at its most intense, Larsson chooses to dwell on the nuts-and-bolts details of the police investigation. Perhaps this novel simply suffers from middle-child syndrome, common among many middle books in literary trilogies--as the ending of this novel clearly indicates, its most important function is as a bridge to the concluding novel, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

1439153663|4.0|This story was somewhat disturbing, but I still stayed up late last night until I finished the book.  The end was a little abrupt - I wanted to know what happened with Suckey, was she ever reunited with Lavinia? and what happened to Belle's son? And how did they all lived after the fire and Marshall's death?  Did Will's wife die? and did he eventually marry Lavinia?  I would love a sequel to this story.

0316098337|5.0|This is my first exposure to Emma Donoghue and it is a fine one indeed.  For three days I have been trapped inside the pages of this book and have not wanted to escape.  It may take readers 25-75 pages to get into the rythm of what Jack is saying, however, once you get to know him, you find yourself not only understanding him but ready to respond.  Since more than eighty have already reviewed this book, there is nothing left to be said.  This book however, is the best I've read in 2 years.
B003L77TZI|2.0|I do not like this new album. In my opinion it falls under the shadow of \\"One of the Boys.\\" Where her first album was sarcastic, heartwrenching and hilarious, this album lacks. It's a pop album through and through (which is what she was going for), but all of her signature sarcasm is gone. The best I could find was some cheap humor about being drunk on a Friday night and having a peacock. It was a disappointment for me, but I'm sure she'll get some new fans.

006145205X|4.0|The following should not deter anybody to read this wonderful book full of information, but the reader should wait for the second part Ridley still hesitates to write. Ridley p. 350: \\"In this book I have tried to build on both Adam Smith an Charles Darwin\\". Well, he read only ½ of Smith and writes only about that half. According to Smith two measures ensure the \\"Wealth of Nation\\". (1) Deepening the division of labour to enhance the productivity of the productive labourers, i.e. adding physical or human capital including inventions, and (2) diminishing the proportion of labour employed for unproductive consumption to enhance the stock of physical und human capital making productive labour even more productive and to employ more labour productively. Productive and unproductive means simply that everything which will be input to the next economic reproduction cycle is productive and what is used up as final consumption is not. As Smith starts his book with these observations, I suppose that is his central message and not the \\"invisible hand\\" on page 182.    Ridley writes about (1) and only once mentions (p. 9): \\"rent-seeking ... need[s] careful regulation, something I always supported.\\" A really competitive economy leaves little profit and it's the consumer who benefits. Competition enforces productive labour. \\"Rents\\" always mean monopoly income - un-earned income to classical economists - and allow consuming unproductive labour. For Ridley monopolies means first of all a monopolistic state. They doomed 1500 BC several empires (p. 166) and a little later. Ridley even mentions Keyley dictum (p. 172): \\"Humanity's great battle over the last 10.000 years has been the battle against monopoly\\". But to him the \\"the corporate monsters\\" (pp. 170 ff) of today behave better but are really of no serious concern. In the same spirit patents (\\"intellectual property\\", pp. 262 ff) may have negative sides, but also positives.    Ridley' s battle against monopoly means the state and only the state. He should have read a bit more of Adam Smith. But this may be politically incorrect.
0345505387|5.0|What a wonderful book! This is a graphic novel that depicts scenes from the novel Outlander from Murtagh's point of view, showing Jamie Fraser's side of the story. Diana Gabaldon along with illustrator Hoang Nguyen make the story come to life as we travel back to where the story began. Diana's story telling abilities are unsurpassed and she does not disappoint in this book. There are scenes in this book that were not in Outlander. After reading this novel, I wanted to go back and   re-read the entire series. Mr. Nguyen did a wonderful job bringing these characters to life through his artwork. In my opinion, he was right on the money with my own perception of how the characters looked at this point in the story. Reading this graphic novel reminds me of how much I love this entire series. Everyone- from a long time Gabaldon fan to new readers- will enjoy Outlander through Jamie's eyes.     Five stars and two big thumbs up!!!!!!
0399536108|5.0|Chris has the rare ability to inspire while remaining very humble and accessible. If you've spent several years telling yourself that dealing with a job you hate is part of being an adult, get ready to have that kind of backward thinking shaken out of you. If you're unhappy or discontent with the way your life is, this book will teach you to find the source of that frustration and change (or altogether eliminate) it. I've read plenty of books like this one, but none have been written by \\"regular guys\\" like Chris who, rather than simply regurgitating a chronicle of their successes, share their emotional journey in a way that makes you want to quit your crappy job as soon as possible because his success like his is within your grasp.     I've already bought this book for several friends of mine who needed a reason to find a new path in their life and career, and I'm sure I'll buy ten more before it's all over. Read this book.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Just when you thought there was nothing new and refreshing along comes the perfect voice matched with the perfect arrangements and lyrics that makes for the perfect CD.  I can't say enough about this CD...it's just incredibly awesome.  Thanks Melody.
0064407667|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old son just two months ago and he's already on book five (or \\"Book the Fifth\\" according to Mr. Snicket). You'd think he likes reading but no, he just likes Lemony Snicket! Getting my son to read was like pulling eyebrows with a pair of tongs but now I'm forcing him to put the book down and go to bed. Last year he had very little AR points. This year he already has the most in his grade.    These series of books are humorous yet intriguing. I love the way the narrator speaks to the reader, defining words and explaining the reasons that things are happening without making the reader seem ignorant. His language is both witty and wacky - go figure. And the suspense rises with every page keeping a mind, like my 9-y-old's, captivated and, unfortunately, awake.     So, if you're a parent like me with a child like mine, this series is a winner. I just have to figure out what to do when my son finishes the series. And, at this rate, that could be anytime soon.

0307594777|5.0|I purchased hardcover editions of these books for my personal home library, and they are great stories!  The bad news is that Mr. Larsson died in 2004, so there won't be any more great novels from his pen.  I would only caution that the hardcover editions are slightly oversized and heavy, so if you're looking for something to read on your commute or to stick in your bag or purse, better to purchase a paperback or softcover edition!  The books are definitely worth the purchase price!

B000683VI4|5.0|Word gets around about a good movie and The Notebook was mentioned to me with high marks and that is why I purchased this movie.   Unlike many movies today that has foul language this cinema has none of that and has honest-to-goodness good performances by two seasoned actors reliving their life story by two young people who also hold nothing back in their feelings for one another.  I would give this movie five stars because of the script,the venue, and the performances. One of the best love stories I have seen.

B0018M6J90|3.0|\\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" is an old-fashioned, moderately entertaining comedy-of-manners that is never quite as captivating or as scintillating as we keep hoping it will be.<br /><br />This roundelay of love, drawing-room comedy and farcical misunderstandings takes place among the snooty theatrical set in pre-WWII London.  Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams) is an ambitious if slightly ditzy American actress who's juggling an assortment of romantic and sexual partners on her way to fame and fortune.  Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances MacDormand) is a frumpy, somewhat eccentric, but wise and ethical professional governess who, in her capacity as Delysia's personal \\"social secretary,\\" helps to steer the morally unfocused ing&eacute;nue through the shoals of emotional game-playing and artful deception that are practically de rigueur in the social world to which she aspires - only to discover that the two women have more in common with one another than their widely disparate positions on the social scale would lead one to suspect.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Winfred Watson, with screenplay by David Magee and Simon Beaufoy and direction by Bharat Nalluri, \\"Pettigrew\\" suffers from creaky plotting, strained comedy routines, and a gruelingly predictable outcome, but the performances are classy (especially by McDormand), the settings rich in atmosphere and ambience, and the whole thing so entirely inoffensive and good-natured that we can't really complain too much if it isn't all we would like it to be.

B003NWS5AO|4.0|Ever notice you always know when it's Robert Plant singing? You never mistake HIM for someone else. Band of Joy sounds a lot like Raising Sand. To me, same feel. I could play both albums together on shuffle and let it go. Good background music. Not something I'd want to crank up in the car. I'd cut off my arm to hear him sing with Norah Jones.    *Updating to add that this album gets better every time I listen to it.
312529861X|5.0|I was introduced to this series of book when I was in France some years ago. I now require it as a text in one of my French major / minor university courses. I highly suggest it to anyone who is in thinking of becoming a French minor or major to help you as you take courses or as a refresher during the summer months. It is filled with grammar explanations in easy-to-read. It is an authentic French publication, all in French, designed for adult learners of French.

0812550757|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" was certainly a fun book, but it read more like a child's daydream: you get to go into space and be in an army and fly around and shoot lasers. There were moral quandaries and a deeper look at humanity's darker side, but not too deep because it kept coming back to the kids shooting lasers at each other.    The sequel, Speaker for the Dead, is very different. While I first read Ender's Game in middle school, I can't imagine my fourteen-year-old self managing to get through Speaker. There are no lasers, or kids in cool space suits. It still stars Ender Wiggin, but this is an older Ender, plagued with guilt over his unwitting genocide of an entire species.     Ender now finds himself on the planet Lusitania, three thousand years after the events of the original book (isn't the theory of relativity a wonderful plot device?), no mere chance considering the planet is home to another alien species, the Pequinos. Ender has with him a souvenir from the previous book: the cocoon of a Bugger queen, one which can hopefully reverse his childhood mistake.    So you have some standard sci-fi stuff: a backwater colony planet, aliens, spaceships. But Speaker for the Dead is also very much about people, and relationships, which is a major divergence from the first book. The other main character is Novinha, trapped in an unhappy marriage and mother of six. Ender arrives and they immediately don't get along. The story is just as much about the people as it is about the aliens.    Whether or not you enjoy Speaker for the Dead is based on what you liked about Ender's Game. If you enjoyed the first book in the series because it was \\"cool\\" and featured armies of small children flying around in zero-gravity fighting in mock battles, don't bother with Speaker because it has none of that. But if you found yourself more interested in the narrative of Ender's Game, fascinated by the computer program that toyed with Ender's psyche, or the dual nature of Ender who was both ruthlesstactician and ten-year-old boy, then go for Speaker of the Dead. This is the Ender's Game for grown-ups.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|Lost in Translation - a film about, by, and for the snobs. Two lifeless egotists, while suspended in sterile environment, happen to drift past each other and briefly develop an appearance of human relationship, then part ways and continue drifting aimlessly in that lukewarm formaldehyde of a movie. It was nearly as memorable and engaging as watching the movement of two floaters in a broken toilet. The fact that the toilet is very expensive and is located in a foreign country doesn't change the nature of what it is you're looking at.     Bring this plot to a studio and unless your last name is Coppola you'll be lucky if you can pitch it to the security guard without being slapped silly. The photography was great, though. It had an expensive look and feel, perhaps like everything else in the author's uneventful life inside that ivory tower of hers.

0312600844|1.0|Why does anyone want to waste their time on reading a book about ordinary people being horrible?  I mean I can understand watching reality TV but this is like reality fiction and its not interesting.  I just don't get why people fawn over this guy.  he is surely a good writer but he needs to understand that a reader wants to attach themselves to at least one character.  Unless you are a depressed housewife, I don't see why you would bother.
0345505387|2.0|I'd never read a graphic novel before \\"The Exile\\" so I don't pretend to be an expert in the medium. However, when I want to read something escapist, author Diana Gabaldon's genre-bending \\"Outlander,\\" an outrageously entertaining combination of historical romance, science fiction and adventure, is one of my go-to novels. I check out her web site from time to time. I bought \\"The Exile\\" because I was impressed with the cover illustration and a couple of other art samples I saw there, and because it was marketed as presenting \\"Jamie's side of the story.\\" I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. So I read it again last night, and I passed it on to a friend who loves graphic novels and in fact writes them himself, just to make sure I was not being crabby. I'm still disappointed.     On the off chance you're reading this review and are not familiar with Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" novel, it's the first-person story of Claire Randall, a 27-year-old British army nurse. World War II has just ended and she's with her husband on a second honeymoon in the Scottish Highlands. While exploring a circle of standing stones, Claire is suddenly transported back in time to 1743 where she encounters British dragoons, Highlanders gathering forces in support of Bonnie Prince Charlie's rising to restore Scottish independence from the British crown, and other Highlanders who want to stay out of the rising. Among her adventures, she marries 23-year-old Jamie Fraser. I almost never read romance so I can't say for certain, but I'd bet a goodly sum that he's one of the most perfect every-woman's-dream heroes in fiction.     So, here's why I was disappointed in \\"The Exile.\\"     First, right on the cover, it says \\"Experience Jamie's Side of the Story.\\" I thought it would be told from HIS point of view. Well, turns out it's told, ostensibly, from the point of view of Jamie's godfather, a character named Murtagh. I would call the narrative point of view more \\"third person omniscient confusing.\\" I had reallyhoped for more insights into Jamie. I felt like I did not learn anything about Jamie from \\"The Exile\\" that I hadn't already read in the \\"Outlander\\" novel.    Second, as you may have guessed, I found \\"The Exile\\" extremely confusing, and I know the novel on which it's based well. In fact I re-read it just before reading \\"The Exile.\\" It was hard to figure out what was going on. Other than Jamie, the male characters tended to all look so much alike it was difficult to tell them apart. I realize it's hard for an artist to create characters that are both distinctive AND supposed to share a family resemblance, but it was really a struggle to tell Murtagh from Colum from Dougal from Kenneth. The dialog bubbles almost never helped me figure out who was speaking and being spoken to on any given page. Just to test myself, I asked my graphic novelist friend what he thought, and he said, \\"I like the pictures but I can't figure out the story at all!\\" It may be that Gabaldon was over-concerned with not disappointing her fans and tried to squeeze too many of the characters and incidents from the 600-page \\"Outlander\\" novel (of which \\"The Exile\\" covers about a third) into the graphic novel format. Anyway, I can't help but conclude that \\"The Exile\\" REALLY does not work as a stand-alone and works poorly as a re-imagining of part of \\"Outlander\\" for people who know the story.    Third, and this is probably the most subjective, but I could not accept the artist's rendering of Jamie most of the time. There were a couple of panels where I went \\"Yes, that's it.\\" Mostly not. Yes, I understand Jamie is only 23 and sexually innocent, and yes, I understand his eyes are supposed to be slightly slanted, but in the regular novel, he's extremely masculine and rugged, having lived most of his life outdoors in a time much harsher than our own, and having gone to hell and back more than once in his young life. The way the artist renders him in most of the pictures in \\"The Exile,\\" he looks like a rent boy with a trust fund. His skin is too smooth, his face is too feline, and he looks too girly, as if his face had been waxed rather than shaven. The Jamie I know and love from \\"Outlander\\" is honorable to a fault; the artist-rendered Jamie looks shifty-eyed and smarmy.     Fourth, \\"Outlander\\" and Gabaldon's other novels are frequently laugh-out-loud funny. Aside from the supplemental material, \\"The Exile\\" was pretty lacking in the humor department.    Aside from my problems with Jamie and the other male characters too-close resemblance to each other, I enjoyed the other artwork. I thought Nguyen did a nice job with the female characters, the settings, the action, and the horses. The book is very attractively printed, with vivid colors. I'm sure I'll flip through it again, looking at the pictures without trying to follow the story. Hence the two-star rating.    If you're curious, and you might be--the visuals are worthy of attention--I'd suggest you borrow a copy of \\"The Exile\\" from a friend or check this out of the library, rather than paying retail ordering from Amazon. Better to check out Gabaldon's Outlander series of prose novels. She's really a remarkably entertaining storyteller, and a way-above-average stylist in the realm of popular fiction.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I've liked Maroon 5 ever since their first album. \\"This Love\\" and \\"She Will Be Loved\\" left me breathless in more ways than one. After hearing their first single \\"Misery\\" from Hands All Over, I decided to purchase their latest album. It has quickly become my favorite Maroon 5 album to date.    The CD begins with the sassy \\"Misery,\\" and the hits don't stop until the final song. The acoustic version is pretty good, too. Most of the album is full of funk, rock and pop. But in the end, genre hardly matters in my view because good music is just what it is: good music. My favorite track is \\"I Can't Lie.\\" It's beautiful beyond words, carried out by Adam Levine's unique crooning. The bonus track \\"Last Chance\\" is pretty memorable as well. It's full of attitude; in fact, the entire album is full of that.    I recommend Hands All Over to Maroon 5 fans and newcomers alike. I can keep going on about how great it is, but I think one actually listening to it will truly do the group justice. Check it out!
6305268843|5.0|I had the opprtunity to see this movie online, and it is absolutely brilliant in every way. The soundtrack, which isn't commercially available, is beautiful and haunting, from the dramatic opening to the very last note of the last track. Having recently seen Sophie Marceau in \\"Anna Karenina,\\" I knew how good she is in a period piece and though this film isn't exactly one where costumes take center stage, it's a beautiful movie nonetheless. Sophie Marceau is perfect as the mother, evoking passion, pain and love all in one. The rest of the cast is also spot-on. Every scene is meticulously shot and beautifully filmed, especially the scenes of passion amidst the firelight. I highly recommend this movie. Should have been rated PG-13 instead of R, because in the case of this movie, the nudity is essential to the story and moves the plot along.

0393061310|5.0|Diamond has undertaken a task of monumental scope. He has methodically argued for a specific paradigm of pre-literate cultural development based upon extensive interdisciplinary scientific evidence.     His argument, explaining the technological imperialism of the West during the Age of Discovery, boils down to having been   in the right place (Mesopotamia), at the right time,   with the right tools, i.e. domestication of animals & cereal-based agriculture   which allowed these societies to move on to more complex structures & technologies, i.e., metal forging -- Guns & Steel  and the superioritiy of European colonial military technology as it colonized the Americas, India, & East Indies-- Germs      The scope and sophistication of his argument make his analyses among the most influential and well-researched works of history of the last 25 years. Germs, Guns, & Steel should be required reading for most undergraduate students and for scientific intellectuals who are serious about science's Big Questions.
B00004RF97|4.0|Katharine Hepburn's film career began extremely well, with a string of popular movies and an Academy Award; by the late 1930s, however, she had been in one critical and popular fiasco after another, the public was no longer interested, and exhibitors had labeled her \\"box office poison.\\"  The combination was a career-ender--but Hepburn's friend Philip Barry came to the rescue with a stage comedy he had written expressly for her.  It was THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, it was a smash hit, and Hepburn owned the film rights.  She then struck a deal with MGM, which was eager to make the film: $250,000 to purchase the property and final control of director, casting, and script.  The result was spectacular, a film that pleased both public and critics, and which was nominated for numerous Academy Awards.  It is well directed, photographed, designed, and flawlessly performed.  And it is also somewhat over-rated.<br /><br />The story is very well known.  Some years earlier, Philadelphia socialite Tracy Lord (Hepburn) married and then divorced C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant.)  She is now engaged to George Kittredge (John Howard); at the same time she has precipitated a separation between her parents, for her father's aparent infidelities have created a scandal.  As the wedding approaches, a notorious scandal sheet uses information about Mr. Lord (John Halliday) to blackmail the Lord family into allowing the magazine to cover the wedding.  Reporter Macaulay \\"Mike\\" Connor (James Stewart) and photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) are dispatched.  Social difficulties begin to pile up when Tracy decides to confuse Mike and Liz, when Haven arrives as an unexpected guest, and when Mike unexpectedly falls in love with her.  Having so soundly condemned her father for provoking scandal, Tracy finds herself in precisely the same situation, and she learns a thing or two about being a decent human being as a result.<br /><br />The original Philip Barry play was surprisingly acid and included an additional character: Sandy, Tracy's brother.  As was often the case in the 1940s, the fangs of the original were pulled to make the material more appealing to \\"ordinary America,\\" and as a result the film isn't nearly so funny as the play.  The role of Sandy was deleted in order to make more time for Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart; this too was a mistake, for it had the effect of unbalancing the relationships that swirled around the leading lady.  Neither of these are huge problems.  The film overcomes them easily.  But there's no getting around the fact that the play is a flyweight story about high society, and as one of my friends put it so well, \\"I can't get all that worked up about how unhappy rich people are.\\"  The film has tremendous star power, no doubt about it, and it is indeed fun, but it isn't a patch on the likes of such comedies of the same era as ALL ABOUT EVE, THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, or BALL OF FIRE.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is extremely good, with sparkling white and crisp black and an amazing range of gradations between the two.  Hepburn has never looked more beautiful, Grant is stunningly handsome, and James Stewart is memorable (he won an Oscar for the role.)  And yes, it is enjoyable.  But it just isn't as enjoyable as you thought it was going to be.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />In Memory of friend Jerry Williamsr: Sandy, Tracy's brother.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Prior to getting the Turtle Beach X41 headset I had been using the prior Turtle Beach 5.1 surround headset. While that was an outstanding product, and still is, the X41's go another level in clarity with the complete elimination of any background hiss that the older set had.  If you've never tried one of these, you'll be very surprised at the directional ambiance and clarity.  Most games have full directional sound and these 7.1 surround sound units allow you to be able to tell when someone is sneaking up on you.  Plus, you can play without any annoyance to those around you.  Non-players tend to get annoyed with a war going on in the living room.  The sound quality is outstanding for the price of this unit, especially when you can now purchase these on sale in the $150 range.  They can also be used to watch movies or any optical sound output.
0312600844|4.0|The psychologizing and politicizing of this large story about a small family, as though literature might now summon a great explainer, seems tendentious.  Franzen went long with this saga without purporting to write the GAN. Who believes he thinks he's Proust or Tolstoy? Freedom doesn't claim to be a close analysis of America post 9/11. Others have done family break-ups, internationality, cyber-space, and green, not to mention mid-life lust and crisis, or the state of the national psyche, and a critique of the Iraq war, more luminously and persuasively. Enjoyable, though indulgent for its length, no literary milestone, this is possibly all he's got. Corrections showed that less is more.
B003TXSF5C|4.0|The book is great fun. So why only four stars? Because after lucid explanations of the threads give us insights into the quantum world, Hawking and Mlodinow leave us hanging off of a bridge that is both unfinished and far short of the book's stated goal--showing us the grand design.<br /><br />I am a layperson with significant interest in the mechanisms that govern our world. Thus, I have read not only Hawking's first work, A Brief History of Time, but also Brian Greene's profound and largely persuasive books about string theory (The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory) (The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality), Lee Smolin's provoking insights in his The Life of the Cosmos and Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, as well as his devastating condemnation of the string-theory cult that he sees pervading academe, The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next. I've also read the intriguing Faster Than the Speed of Light: The Story of a Scientific Speculation, by Joao Magueijo. And, finally, I've read extensively about Richard Feynman and also his non-technical works. So, I have some, albeit non-mathematical, background.<br /><br />In the final analysis, The Grand Design rests on ipse dixits. Thus, Hawking and Mlodinow write in their last and disappointing chapter, without explanation beyond their conclusion, that \\"there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes\\" out of nothing. But that conclusion begs the question as much as the theological first-cause explanation of a deity.<br /><br />It may very well be, as Hawking and Mlodinow theorize, that our universe and the uncountable other universes they postulate arose from nothing, just as it is possible that the deity that most if not all religions believe created our universe in one form or another arose from nothing, but we need something more than the mere glancing conclusions The Grand Design gives us.<br /><br />Hawking and Mlodinow also write at the end of their short book that \\"M-theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe.\\" But they do not tell us why, and, indeed, admit that its theoretical underpinnings have yet \\"to be proved.\\"  Sadly, they do not even mention the legitimate objections to the myriad string theories that Lee Smolin and others have explored. This is a major flaw of the book because M-theory as Hawking and Mlodinow, and others, describe it, is but a pastiche of string-theories stitched together.<br /><br />Although M-theory's stitched-together fabrics have, apparently, overlapping edges, the theory lacks the elegant simplicity a true scientific theory demands. After all, the cumbersome Ptolemaic epicycles, which sought to explain why the planets seemed to meander through the sky, had two of the three requisites of any valid theory: it accurately described what folks saw, and it accurately predicted what folks would see. Indeed, when Copernicus gave us the correct heliocentric theory of how the earth and the other planets interacted with the sun, the epicyclic tables were more accurate predictors of where the planets would be. The problem with epicycles, of course, was that the mechanism is wrong.<br /><br />M-theory _may_ accurately describe what its proponents seek to measure, but it does not give us an elegant explanation of a mechanism that answers the question Hawking and Mlodinow pretend to answer, the \\"why?\\"<br /><br />That said, I give the book four stars because it neatly gives us an overview of quantum physics, especially that of the pioneering Richard Feynman. Yet, even after reading The Grand Design, Feynman's quip that \\"no one understands\\" quantum physics remains true today as it did when he was alive.king and Mlodinow also write at the end of their short book that \\"M-theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe.\\" But they do not tell us why, and, indeed, admit that its theoretical underpinnings have yet \\"to be proved.\\"  Sadly, they do not even mention the legitimate objections to the myriad string theories that Lee Smolin and others have explored.

B0009VRHLK|3.0|I'll admit that I came to this film with a pretty heavy prejudice, having read a ton about it beforehand.  My overwhelming pre-viewing impression was that this was a screamingly indulgent film--hyped for its one crucial, highly aruably groundbreaking scene--so I struggled mightily to give it a fair shake.  In the end, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  Indulgent?  You betcha.  But that's just about a given for a true art film, and that's what you've got here.  Gallo is putting out some extremely personally meaningful art here, but the main problem is that I'm having trouble deciphering it.<br /><br />Good art makes you think, though, and I've been cogitating on this film's story and its characters for the past two days, and I've got to admit now that the story is entirely plausible, and very intriguing.  The payoff comes only in the final minutes, which retroactively recasts the entire film.  Watching it again knowing its secret seriously alters the intake of the preceding 90 minutes, but it still drags, quite a bit.<br /><br />I'll also admit to very frequent glancing at the DVD minute counter, wathcing it creep slowy to 92 minutes, so I could be done with it.  I don't remember the last movie I did this with...no wait, it was that wretched [[ASIN:B001CQRJNC The Love Guru]].<br /><br />Synopsis: Motorcycle racer Bud Clay drives his van from New Hampshire to Los Angeles as he struggles very, very deeply with loss, guilt, denial, his views and expectations of women, his past, his future, etc.  This poor guy really, really needs some professional help.<br /><br />I found little enjoyable about this movie, not even Sevigny's famous oral sex scene, as that notable part is really quite ugly and non-erotic.  It's some mighty powerful filmmaking, you betcha, but what exactly is the point?  I keep wondering how that scene developed from writing to script, to Gallo discussing it with and then convincing Sevigny that the scene truly was integral to the story and his artistic vision.  He managed to do that, obviously, although it escapes me how this very arguably brave (on both Gallo's and Sevigny's part) act of filmmaking is crucial to the story.<br /><br />This film is all about our central figure, Bud, played by writer/director/editor/producer Vincent Gallo.  He struck me as a cross between Woody Harrelson, with that jutting cro-magnon profile and the sunken eyes and searching, melancholy allure of Viggo Mortensen, but with the eyes a bit more sunken, just on the wrong side of normal-looking.  Bud looks downright greasy in every single shot.  We do get to see him shower, thankfully, but he comes out with his hair all gnarly once again, and he puts on stained clothing.<br /><br />Kissing is a big deal in this film, and he does a lot of it, with a few different ladies.  But, the endless, groping face-pawing during the kissing was massively distractive, with Gallo's big ol' hands and just about creepy-long fingers.  Both Bud and the girls just pawed each other's faces constantly, like they were petting--blech.<br /><br />And what of this brown bunny, then?  Early on Bud drops in to visit Daisy's parents, and Bud is either at the wrong house, they don't know what's happened, or they're in just as much denial about the ugly truth as he is.  Later Daisy talks about eating a giant chocolate bunny...well, that's a brown bunny, too, so what is the crucial meaning that has it titling the film?  Beats the hell out of me.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a movie that I really didn't enjoy watching, but now having thought about it for a few days and taking another look, am slowing warming to.  It was slow, visually dull and repetitive, and ultimately very, very unhappy.  The main reason I can think of to recommend watching this film is so that if and when it ever comes up in conversation, you can say that you have, in fact, seen it.ed to do that, obviously, although it escapes me how this very arguably brave (on both Gallo's and Sevigny's part) act of filmmaking is crucial to the story.

B000000TDH|4.0|I never got to hear Tragic Kingdom growing up, only the singles, so listening to it is like listening to a time capsule of the 90s. It's fun, bouncy, and leaves a good impression, but I will leave the music reviews to those who know it better. I want to give folks some juicy details of the vinyl release. The pictures \\"Slowcloud\\" posted are misleading. That is a special edition that comes with a T-shirt and is NOT what Amazon is selling right now.<br /><br />What you get is a single-pocket jacket, with plain white paper inner sleeve, and a lyric and liner notes insert. The vinyl record itself is PURPLE with an orange label and sounds decent. It is possible that the vinyl comes in different colors. I don't hear very many pops and crackles. My best guess is 140 gram thickness. Well worth the cash to diversify your collection.

0345505387|1.0|Although I am not a fan of graphic novels I am a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon's books so I was very excited for this book to come out only to be very very dissapointed in the end result.  The sample pages shown are not representative of the entire book, so don't be fooled.  The art work was amazing for the first maybe 7 to 8 pages (which include the sample pages on Amazon) after that the illustrations become inconsistant and very cartoonish.  You could hardly tell the difference between characters as the story progressed because they all looked the same and reminded me of bad charcters pulled from a Pokemon episode.  You can not even tell from the first illustrations of Jamie to the last illustrations that it is even remotely similar to the same character.  I knew that the book was not going to be as in depth as her novels, and would cut out lots of detail, but figured it would follow a similar time line.  There were many inconsistencies with the original story that just didn't make sense and didn't allow you to really get a sense of any of the characters.  I basically read through two thirds of the book in less than 30min and couldn't even finish reading it because the art was so bad and the story so choppy and disconnected it was too awful to read.  I am still a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon but would not want to see more of her amazing stories reduced to such a poor product.
B002RKRUEA|5.0|When it comes to Stoic philosophy, Marcus Aurelius is second to Epictetus in the discussion of avoiding the indulgence of emotion. However, Aurelius' \\"Meditations\\" is different simply because it's the first leadership memoir based on Stoic philosophy.<br /><br />The book is raw - it seems that these were never going to be published, so it had a bluntness to it and an honesty rare for a military leader, let alone one of the best Roman Emperors in history. He was a spiritual man, and tried to rationalize his duties. It lacks rhetorical flourish but it's honest.<br /><br />I don't know if the book stands alone as a philosophical work, but it is an interesting work about self improvement, duty and service. Despite his reputation as a \\"philosopher king,\\" the book remains a valuable book in leadership and history.<br /><br />The Kindle version itself is pretty well laid out with ample enough notes and historical background on Aurelius himself to help you better understand the man himself. His notes range in length from a few sentences to multiple pages, so there's no real orderly format to the book (to me, this makes it more appealing.)<br /><br />Since the Kindle version is free, give it a try. You'll find yourself better for it.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Installed the cooler on a Phenom II X4 965 BE (140W)(3.4GHz stock)(MOBO Gigabyte GA-MA790FXT-UD5P)(Case CM HAF-X with stock fans), overclocking was done from BIOS menu to CPU multiplier only. temperature measurements was done by a room temperature  and AMD Overdrive status report. For all the below tests this cooler did not show ANY signs of noise that can be compared to the stock AMD cooler which sounded like a Boeing 747 during the reverse thrust on an oily run way :). I did not add an extra fan to the cooler just the included fan.    Test 1:  using \\"white grease\\"  OC to 4.0GHz (1.525V VCore anything less=Random BSOD)room temperature was 30C (86F) processor crashed immediately after running Prime95 Windows 7 x64.    Test 2:  using \\"white grease\\"  OC to 3.8Ghz (1.475V VCore)room temperature was 30C (86F) processor crashed at first iteration running Prime95 Windows 7 x64. temperature was racing to reach the 60C (140F) and it eventually crashed.    It was now clear that the OC settings was not quite right with the current setup as the processors jumped to 60C (140F) in a couple of seconds  I thought it might be a good idea to give the included \\"CoolerMaster\\" compound a go.     Used the method described at the below URL to apply the included compound.  [...]    Tried the same first test as there was a great difference in conducting performance for the CM compound over the white grease I tested first.    Test 1: OC to 4.0Ghz (1.525V VCore) the temperature was 58C (136F) and of the cores crashed (gave a wrong iteration but Windows continued operation normally) towards the end of second iteration iteration.    Test 2: OC to 3.8Ghz (1.475V VCore) well, the system is (till today) stable I finished 12 iteration on Prime95 running on Windows 7 x64. The normal reported temperature (AMD Overdrive) is around 38C (100F) at no load conditions (AMD Cool'n'Quiet is disabled automatically after when cores' speed reaches 3.8GHz) and during full load (Running WoW or Starcraft II) temperature fluctuates between 43C (109F) to 45C (113F) with no crashes at a room temperature of 28C-30C (82F-86F).    Conclusion:     1-Excellent cooling performance for the money. Use of the included thermal compound is highly recommended.  2-Do not use the normal thermal white grease, it is not efficient with Computer CPUs.  3-Temperature difference is only 13C (55F) on an OC Phenom II X4 965 BE (140W) which generates lots of heat when OC'ed.  4-Installation took only 18 mins and watched [...]/watch?v=hSq_xbxsm7Q\\" before the installation (I have been working with computers since the power switch was a latch on the back of the desktop) and thanks to the HAF X internal design which has access to the back of MOBO without having to pull out everything.  5-This cooler might be very big for medium cases, consider upgrading the case or compare measurements before buying.    Future plans:  Installing another fan to try to reach 4.0GHz using only air cooling. This will probably push me to get the (125W) version of the CPU.
0765326353|5.0|Robert Jordan sort of had the last laugh on a lot of us when he passed away before finishing the Wheel of Time. Brandon Sanderson, who is finishing up Jordan's seminal fantasy series, seems to have gotten a bad case of 'Encyclopedic Fantasy Novelitis'. With the first edition of this multi-tombed series topping off at 1,008 pages, and the well known phenomenon of fantasy series novels getting longer as they go, we may be looking at 15,000 plus total pages by the time that this series finishes.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot think of a single time during the reading of this book that I ever felt bored, annoyed or anything other than totally absorbed in the richly detailed world described by Sanderson. The world is described down to the level of how grass would evolve in a world without top soil (think underwater tube worms)and how some races of people have physical traits such as metallic hair accents, inherently two-toned skin and kevlar-like armor plating in place of skin. Don't worry though, you won't have to suffer through descriptions of 'smoothing of skirts', the internal musings of unimportant characters, or extraneous plot lines. In this regards at least, Sanderson has learned the lesson that I wished Jordan had learned around book 3 of the Wheel of Time series. All of Sanderson's observations of his creations add flavor rather than simply adding verbiage.<br /><br />This book features plenty of combat, and the tactics and weapons are new and interesting. Most of the book though allows several characters to be very well developed, and I assume that this development will be critical to the plot line as the series moves forward. In fact, some reviewers have criticized the book for really beginning in the last 100 or so pages of the book. I understand their point, but I disagree. One of the greatest assets that Sanderson brings to novel writing is a vivid sense of character development. All of his novels benefit from characters that we can actually care about, flawed though they may be.<br /><br />Perhaps the most compelling character in this novel is Kaladin. Much has been said by other top reviewers, but I find his development compelling. I also find Sanderson's observations on leadership, as illustrated by Kaladin's story, to be richly nuanced and insightful. These are lessons in this portion of the story that should be learned by all leaders.<br /><br />A couple of other notes. This novel, as all Sanderson novels do, has a fair share of strong female characters. Violence is real, but it is not glorified. Rather, war is treated as a painful reality with real consequences for real people. Finally, there is a strong moral sense to the book, without and sense of preaching.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and hope that Sanderson is taking good care of himself so that he can live long enough to complete the series, probably around 2022 or so.h they may be.    Perhaps the most compelling character in this novel is Kaladin. Much has been said by other top reviewers, but I find his development compelling.

These are lessons in this portion of the story that should be learned by all leaders.    A couple of other notes. This novel, as all Sanderson novels do, has a fair share of strong female characters. Violence is real, but it is not glorified. Rather, war is treated as a painful reality with real consequences for real people. Finally, there is a strong moral sense to the book, without and sense of preaching.    I highly recommend this book, and hope that Sanderson is taking good care of himself so that he can live long enough to complete the series, probably around 2022 or so.
B003XX2PPO|1.0|Luis miguel has a perfect voice. but, his music is the same with the past of the time.   This album is a copy of an album back in 1990 call 'Luis Miguel 20 años\\".why is he afraid to sing a different kind of music? why not a rock album or cha cha cha!!!something new!!!!!!!!!!!    I spent 13 bucks, It was a bad buy.
B0030BCCAM|5.0|I've reviewed all three of these albums before, so I'll be brief.  See the cost of tracking each one down on their own?  Exactly.  I was lucky enough to discover Colin and the Zombies just before certain items went out of stock and the prices soared for what remains.  These are quintessential must-owns by an artist with exquisite, sophisticated taste, and this particular box set is worth owning brand new.  Despite the lack of liner notes you get with the individual products, you get two bonus tracks on the Journey disc:  the outstandingly gorgeous \\"Beware\\", and the rather creepy \\"Lover Brother.\\"<br /><br />You need to own this box set if you don't have it yet.  I gush and rant about Colin all the time.  The man has taste, sex appeal, and a romantic style all his own that his distinctive vocals express all too well.  New to him and anything Zombies related?  Then trust me when I say you won't be sorry.  This is nothing short of superior 70s British pop.
0893860220|5.0|Nisargadatta's instructions are simple. Start with \\"I am\\" and let go of everything else. \\"Be clear and quiet - alert and detached, all else will happen by itself.\\" (pg.397). Titling the book \\"I Am That\\" is ironic since you aren't whatever is implied by \\"That\\".  You just are.     It's this zen-like dilemma that the book focuses on. The writing is so simple to read and the content so complex that you have to step back from it every so often to let yourself absorb the message.  The irony continues, because the message is that you don't need the words, the books, the gurus.  Awareness of oneself suffices.    If Krishnamurti invokes curiosity, Nisargadatta invokes awareness.  The two are directly linked and Nisargadatta refers to Krishnamurti as a fellow realized being several times.  Both are staunchly against gurus and ask not to be worshiped or followed.     I keep reading and reading, but know in my heart that once the instructions are heard, they simply must be followed.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in my life.  What an absolutely beautiful look into the human experience in life and death! And, the soundtrack is like the bow that wraps a perfect present.  If you get nothing from this movie, you're not looking deeply enough.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Maiden with yet another amazing release.  This band just keeps getting better.  The songs are epic, the vocals are great, the guitars are amazing and this is another Iron Maiden ultimate metal album! \m/
B0014I4KH6|5.0|I really like her first album. Very country and her lyrics are so deep when you really listen. I'd buy it ten times over!
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This proves even though UDO is awesome, Accept does not need UDO to make it's ultimate return.  This album is loaded with awesome riffs, killer vox, great tunes and for this band I could not have dreamed of a better return album! \m/
