B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I totally didn't expect this movie to have so many layers.  If you can suspend logic for a couple of hours, this movie has something for everyone: action, suspense, passion, love.  I only noticed a couple of things that didn't make sense.  It's the perfect date movie: something for the guy as well as the girl.  I know that sounds sexist, but you know exactly what I mean.  Don't  you?
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I read a lot of the reviews, good and bad, before trying out this app. (Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\")<br /><br />Unlike some reported, for me the app saved images and I had no trouble finding them afterward, and it does have some nice features.<br /><br />The deal-breaker was too severe for me to consider using this app at all. Even with saving the image at its high resolution, it left the image corrupted by compression artifacts that did not exist in the original image.<br /><br />So if you can imagine starting out with a perfectly sharp, clear picture, then winding up with a picture that has blurs and smears at every edge and color interface - that's what you get with this app. I had done my first test with a simple crop and save.<br /><br />So to double check this, I loaded an image, did absolutely nothing to it, and then saved it with the \\"ultra high\\" resolution option.<br /><br />I wound up with an image that was ruined by compression artifacts.<br /><br />In today's world of high resolution images and big, big device memory, there is no excuse for that result from any image handling software, even one for a tablet or phone device.<br /><br />I'll be dumping this software as soon as I submit this review.

1781162646|3.0|\\"Joyland\\" is a short, fairly enjoyable read from Stephen King in the same emotional vein as \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" \\"The Body\\" (\\"Stand By Me\\"), and \\"The Green Mile.\\"<br /><br />It is the story of New Hampshire college student Devin Jones who spends the summer of 1973 working at Joyland, a small locally-owned amusement park on the North Carolina coast near Wilmington. He makes friends, learns the carny lingo, struggles to get over his former girlfriend, comes of age, and earns the respect of the crusty carny veterans. Devin also becomes involved with a disabled boy and his mother who are spending the summer at a Victorian house up the beach. When Devin and his friends encounter a ghost and begin to poke around into a killing that happened at the park a few years before, things begin to go sour.<br /><br />\\"Joyland\\" reads quickly and really isn't objectionable, but after finishing it I wonder if it was merely a long short story or short novella that got repackaged into its own volume in the Hard Case Crime series. It's nice to see Stephen King working in the nostalgic and emotional areas where I think generally he is underrated, but the ghost story here feels tacked on. The whole book feels insubstantial, like it should be part of a larger book or even a short story collection to tell the truth.<br /><br />\\"Joyland\\" might be good for light beach reading, but don't expect too much.

B003G4W49C|3.0|Rather unusually in a book, Card has a Foreword that comments on how the book was written and what the initial responses were. It appeared that people either loved it or hated it, and this creates a problem for me as a reviewer, because I have a foot in both camps. Card has a master's degree in literature, and in his early years he spent much time involved with plays. Accordingly, his interest lies in human interactions, and since this book was first drafted when Card was barely out of adolescence, he wrote about children. The book is written mainly in the \\"show, not tell\\" mode, although that switches towards the end, where it becomes more important to cover territory. For me, this is partly the wrong way around. It starts with Ender, a 6-year-old boy, and who happens to be \\"a third\\". It took me about 10% into the book to be sure what that meant. Ender is chosen to go to \\"battle school\\"; the problem is that Earth has been previously attacked by \\"buggers\\" (sentient beings that have a society similar to that of ants) and Earth has to respond to defend itself. What it is doing is taking very young children that have been selected following a period during which they had monitors embedded in them, and they are to be trained as commanders of a space fleet. The training for Ender comprises a mixture of bullying, neglect, games, and \\"battles\\" in which \\"armies\\" (more like mini companies of miniplatoons) battle in zero gravity. The story largely follows Ender as he is tested to the limits of his endurance, while there is a subplot in which Ender's older brother and sister begin manipulating Earth's society through blog posts.<br /><br />The really good included the depiction of Ender, except that the boy should be older. No six-year-old could think like that, but that does not really matter. Ender is tested to the extreme, and the description of his coming to almost a total breakdown is extremely good. The story is highly original, and while the story in retrospect seems reasonably straightforward, Card tells it in such a way that there are genuine surprises from time to time. The craftsmanship in telling a story and playing with the reader's emotions is excellent. The story also properly appreciates the time dilation effect of relativity, so the science is fine. He does have an invention giving instantaneous communication at a distance, which violates relativity, but this is fine because the story depends critically on it. No such ability, no story. That is the ideal use of \\"the magic wand\\" - not to get the author out of trouble, or to shift a standard story into space, but to create a new original story. Good stuff.<br /><br />There are less appealing aspects. First, battle school is mainly devoted to tactics, and worse, nobody learns anything from what happens. The teachers teach nothing. The idea seems to be to let a great commander evolve. They treat the children as dirt. No great commander in history had such a horrible start. Worse, the battles effectively have the opposition merely turning up. Sorry, but the enemy have to have some good moves. The ending contains real surprises that tear at the emotions, but when you start to think about them, the logic and self-consistency has all the holes of a Swiss cheese. Read it, do not ask why some events happened, or more importantly, did not happen, and do not go back and ask if that could happen, why did something else not happen. Do not ask questions, and you will love this book.<br /><br />Ian J Miller, author of A Face on Cydoniasonably straightforward, Card tells it in such a way that there are genuine surprises from time to time.

1936891026|5.0|If you are in or have ever found yourself in a creative/task rut, Steven Pressfield's \\"The War of Art\\" is a high octane punch in the guts that will leave you breathless in the truth and sincerity of his message.  The first 2/3's of the book dazzles as your inner critic come to life guiding you on the fight that needs to be fought to overcome your creative hurdles.  Pressfield's lean prose cuts straight to the bone with nary an unneeded sentence or word to deliver his battle plan.  While the final third of the book loses some momentum as it takes on a more spirit-metaphorical angle this book in its entirety remains a must read and will certainly be on my mind for many days to come.

Certainly glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater nor did I have to pay to see it at home.  The attempts to put in catch phrases from some of the actors was strained at best.  Kind of tired of hearing Arnold say &#34;I'll be back&#34;.  When they asked Chuck Norris &#34;I thought you were a lone wolf&#34; (or something along that line) I thought I was going to lose my lunch.  The one bright spot was I was able to doze a little through the movie and woke up ready to accomplish something meaningful to make up for the 2 hours I would never get back.

0783240287|4.0|I admit, I'm a complete sucker for musicals.  I know it's totally unrealistic for people to burst into song, and that it can easily jar someone out of the story if they're not used to it, but a well-written musical is just fun in my opinion even if (or especially if) it's cheesy and goofy.  \\"Mama Mia,\\" \\"Bye Bye Birdie,\\" \\"Hairspray,\\" \\"Oliver!,\\" Rogers and Hammerstein's \\"Cinderella,\\" \\"Wicked,\\" \\"Into the Woods,\\" most of Disney's animated-musical output... they're a blast.  Yes, you do get a few stinkers in the mix (such as the infamous \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Love Never Dies\\"), but that's true with any genre.<br /><br />Although \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\" is a rather... creative adaptation of the original biblical story of Joseph's coat of many colors, I find I can't nitpick the differences because it's just too much fun to watch.  The fact that a good cast of actors and singers brings it to life certainly helps.<br /><br />The story is familiar to anyone who's read the Bible or attended Sunday School -- Joseph is the favorite son of his father, who dotes on him to the dismay and anger of his eleven other sons.  Finally upset enough to act, the brothers gang up on Joseph and sell him into slavery in Egypt.  But Joseph, a dreamer gifted with visions of the future, manages to work his way upward in a classic rags-to-riches story, and ends up going from slave to prisoner to a noble second only to the Pharaoh himself.  The story is told in a unique format, however -- as a stage play being put on for a parochial school, with a quirky teacher serving as narrator and the children in the audience joining in as the chorus at appropriate times.  And though the original story was fairly serious, here it's not played seriously at all, and is acted out with great bombast, drama, and color.<br /><br />I've left a review before regarding the music of this musical (under the [[ASIN:B000001E0A Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1992 Canadian Cast)]]), but it's worth mentioning here as well.  Virtually the entire story is told in song format, and though the lyric choices are occasionally odd or sound forced, there are some clever turns of phrase and it stays surprisingly true to the Biblical story despite the wackiness and camp factor.  Most of the songs are quite catchy and lively, and they cover a wide range of styles from country to disco to calypso to rock.  And there are some truly beautiful and thoughtful numbers as well, such as \\"Any Dream Will Do\\" and \\"Close Every Door To Me.\\"<br /><br />The acting in this film... well, let's just say that nobody involved in this film takes it seriously.  Everyone, from Donny Osmond as Joseph to the backup dancers serving as wives and servants, gleefully chews the Technicolor scenery in this film, hamming it up for the camera and belting out their lines with gusto.  Richard Attenborough as Joseph's father and Joan Collins as Potiphar's wife were a bit of a surprise to see, but they seem to be having quite a bit of fun in this as well, and Collins in particular is delightfully slinky and sinister as the ice-cold seductress.  The brothers range from okay to hilariously great -- some, like Asher and Judah, are quite memorable, while others are quickly forgotten after the film is over.  The narrator has to be my favorite character -- she steals every scene she's in, somehow managing to insert herself into the action of the story on a regular basis and serving as a sort of bridge between the audience and what's happening on stage.<br /><br />And since I mentioned the scenery in the last paragraph... lets just say this movie looks nothing like ancient Egypt or Canaan.  At times the sets look like theme-park versions of Biblical times, while at other times they're psychedelic in design and color.  But given the overall tone of this musical, this wasn't particularly jarring.  If anything, it just added to the over-the-top camp of the whole experience.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest strength of this musical, especially this production of it, is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  It's not perfect -- some of the lyrics are cringe-inducingly forced, the costumes are weird and in some cases shockingly skimpy, and it's rather obvious a few of the actors can't sing (the butler and baker are the biggest offenders here).  But it's still incredibly fun and catchy, and it looks like everyone involved had a blast making it.<br /><br />Definitely worth your time if you're a fan of musicals in general (and Andrew Lloyd Webber in particular), though if you're looking for a serious biblical epic you're better off looking elsewhere.  Probably best for ages 10 and up, due to the aforementioned costumes and some implied sensuality.f this musical, especially this production of it, is that it doesn't take itself seriously.

B003PBB4ME|5.0|So I ordered this with the knowledge that it was going to be very cheaply made and probably flex a lot, but I really needed a cheap alternative to running around with my camera and a mic and it being stable.<br /><br />Well this was my answer I got it and right away out of the box I tried bending it and breaking it (I used it with a canon 5d) and it barely flexed at all. So I put my camera and mic on it and gave it a whirl.<br /><br />It flexes a SMALL bit nothing to bad whatsoever or even alarming. The grip is really strong and holds a lot more weight then previously stated. I had my 5d and a pretty large zoom lens on this and it was perfectly fine.<br /><br />As for people also saying the bottom bolt does not get tight enough... Well tighten it more, the rubber foam on the top (which is to not damage the camera frame when tightening down and also hold it in place) has a lot of room to smush down, if you make it tight (as you should) the camera will not move at all.<br /><br />Hands down I give the product 5 stars, its not flimsy it works great and its a cheap alternative to 90% of these other companies selling these for $100 or more.

B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this film, because the trailer was so picturesque. Unfortunately, the movie itself was as vague as the trailer. There is a sparsity of dialogue, which is fine, but there was a disconnect in the language. It confused me even more to what was going on. I still don't know what the film is really about.

B009LQKHIO|2.0|There's no way this made it through an editor. I *did* manage to crawl my way through this novel. Eventually. Which is why it's getting two stars instead of one. I had to take a few breaks before during reading, which isn't normal for me. The errors just got too much. The main characters of this particular story, Todd and Megan, weren't very likable. The supporting characters seemed to be more developed. This version read like many a first draft I've edited my way through. The promise of the story was there, but all the errors just made it a painful read for a \\"finished\\" novel. The only words I can say to the author are: get an editor with a red pen that will bleed all over this. Develop it. Fix your grammatical issues and stop repeating yourself. There's nothing wrong with that in your first draft, but this should've gone through a few more edits before it was published and advertised. You've got potential.

B000002HPT|2.0|This album is a mess. It gets two stars because I enjoy Trail of Tears, Peruvian Skies, and Hollow Years, but otherwise the album is a mess. A shout-out must be made to the abomination that is You Not Me. Its terrible.<br />I bought this album knowing full well that it would be a rough experience, and after multiple listens, trying to find something good, I can only bear to listen to the three songs I listed. I know the group was under pressure from their label, but even then that does not salvage the fact that the album is not at all representative of what Dream Theater is. Their worst album by far.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've heard some people have issues with these, but I've had them for about a month now and have been loving them. They charge relatively quickly and stay charged for a good length of time. It's a pretty simple matter to just plug them in when they run low without the cable getting in your way. The surround sound is great, and the bass is amazing. I'm not a huge audiophile, but it performs well above and beyond what I could hope for. I use the mic a fair amount and haven't noticed any issues. It records crisp, clear audio consistently. I haven't worked with the macro buttons to set up anything fancy, but it's nice that they're there for if I discover a pressing need for them. Plus the ability to put on music and wonder around the house listening to it without disturbing anyone else is great!
B000002H2H|4.0|Metallica hit their stride with Ride the Lightning. There is much debate between fans over what is the &#34;best&#34; Metallica album (I fall firmly in the Master of Puppets camp), and Ride the Lightning is worthy of the title.<br />Its a solid album from start to finish, with Fade to Black, Ride the Lightning, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Call of Ktulu being the standouts. I find Escape, Creeping Death, Trapped Under Ice, to be great trash songs (just not up to the caliber of what I previously listed)<br />The reason this album gets 4 stars is due to Fight Fire with Fire. I just don't dig it. I always skip it and start with Ride the Lightning.<br />Otherwise, a great album for metal fans, Metalllica fans, and a great starting point for new listeners.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|This short novel is a unique gem.  Burgess plunks us into a dysfunctional world resembling a kind of U.S. or England around 1970--perhaps what we might imagine if WWII and the Cold War had played out differently.  The Slavic-based slang of the teen hoodlums is disorienting at first, but you learn it as you go and it sets just the right mood.<br /><br />Reminiscent of The Trial by Kafka in its absurdity, this story has a lighter, wittier style.
B000001ES9|3.0|This is a solid album, but there is still something missing from it. The direction of the band seems kind of undefined, searching musically for a hook, which makes for a listening experience that is choppy. Working Man is a great song, as is Finding my Way, but otherwise the songs bounce around on quality.<br />To be fair, Rush is not a bad album by any means, just unfocused.  A great buy for hardcore fans, but could dissuade some new listeners by its unfocused, almost metal sound.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I have enjoyed every season of this show. I love the storylines and all of the characters and hope that season 4 will be available for Amazon Prime members soon!
B000001ESN|5.0|This album is phenomenal. Its one of those great albums that you can listen to on repeat and still discover things and little riffs or base lines, or some of Peart's great fills. It starts strong with Spirit of the Radio, continues with Freewill, and ramps up with Jacob's Ladder.<br />All in all, essential to any Rush fans's collection, and a great way to get a feel for Rush's &#34;second sector&#34; of music.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|As far as holding camera equipment, I have no complaints. It will hold a DSLR (or two) and up to six lenses. I used it recently with a Canon 60D, three lenses, an external flash, a small video camera and still had room for the lens hoods from the lenses. Front flap holds extra batteries, cords, etc. The front flap is actually big enough to hold an 81/2 x 11 brochure that you often get when going to a sponsored event.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this bag is that I am a rather large man with a rather large chest and shoulders and the straps fit well, but tightly. There is also a cross-strap that connects the main straps but even when it is loosened as much as possible, it is still tight on my chest. So if you are an average sized male or a female, it should fit just fine.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is a great album. Great from start to finish. The album opens with Tom Sawyer which has a great  rhythm to it, and Geddy Lee delivering some solid vocal work. Followed by the Red Barchetta, the album continues along delivering another great song. Once again, my proclivity for instrumentals makes YYZ (pronounced why-why-zed) a song that is often on repeat on my iPhone. Limelight has the distinction of being in my top 5 Rush songs (and the honorable place as my ringtone). Honestly, the first half of the album kicks ass. Its worth it just for that.<br />Gratefully, the album's second side continues meeting the strong benchmark established by the first half. The Camera Eye is the &#34;monster&#34; of the album, clocking in at 11 minutes of Rush goodness. Witch Hunt is a solid tune, and part of the phenomenal Fear series of songs, and ending the album is Vital Signs which features a great intro to the finale song (the rest of the song is great as well, it has a solid funky groove to it)<br />All in all, probably one of Rush's most cohesive albums, great from start to finish. This is a must buy for Rush fans, new Rush inductees, and music collectors in general.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|A must read for Harry Hole fans. If, like me, you have read all of the other novels currently available this helps to see where the stories all began. When you read later books there is always references to earlier told stories and this book fills in some of the gaps. You can see through this book how the author's writing develops over the course of the series.
B000006YCU|3.0|While they are called Dream Theater, this album represents a sort of &#34;Pre Dream Theater&#34;<br />The technicality is there, and the longer than average compositions, but its still kind of a mess. The Ytse Jam is the best song on the album. The vocalist does not do the group justice, and his vocals sound kind of strained the entire album.<br />Its a solid buy for hardcore Dream Theater fans (Which I count myself among) and its really interesting to hear the beginnings of the prog metal group, but not for casual listeners, or someone trying to get into the group.
B006S01GH2|4.0|This is a cute movie about someone who wants to help all those around him and finds a way to succeed.
1781162646|4.0|I am a big time Stephen King fan and I like this book, but if you are expecting the thriller the cover foreshadows, you aren't going to get it.  There are few &#34;goose-bump&#34; moments, but maybe their rarity is what makes them work.  What you mostly get is a sweet story of a sweet guy escaping the trauma of being dumped by his first love at a carny-style amusement park.  The thing I liked about it the most was its depiction of the era.  The differences in the way young people looked at things reflect an innocence now lost forever.
0385349947|5.0|Inspiring book for all women... and men!  I loved the stories as well as the reminders for women to take control of their careers, life and family.  We can do a lot, but can't do it all and this book also gives forgiveness for those shortcomings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Similar to a lot other games but it has it's oen attributes. Very addicting and fun! I'm glad I got it.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This app, while having many games on it, was not as much fun as I thought. First of all you only are allowed to play so many games at first. You then must unlock or buy the rest of the games. Also the name puzzles me. Why not just call it 132 games? That's just my opinion though.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Saw them live with FUN and they stole the show. Drummer remind me of Travis Barker. The music is highly creative and fresh with a positive and contemplative message.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is fun reminds me of clue. I just sucks that u don't get that many diamonds if u needed them. And im not buying any with money so ill just wait. Lol
B008L5G4I8|5.0|Once again a page-turner from Agatha.  From the rich, stuffy, privileged kind she tosses us into the fray and confuses us and titillates us with twists and turns until we think we've figured it out and then pulls the final twist and lays it all out.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It's not what I wanted i thought it was the actual game. But it was just instructions. I wanted the game but instead downloaded the instructions ugh so I deleted it.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|We never watched it on the first night we rented it and it was not accessible the next night so.....we wasted our money.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Loved it! Such a sweet feel good movie about the pace of life, and how one man slows things down. Reminiscing flashbacks to the past. Reminds us how life should be... fun, easy, relaxed, with a purpose.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|A little tough to fallow in the first half but the second half is tough to put down. Worth reading!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Game is the best I spy game ever!!!!! I could play this game all day! I recommend it to anyone who loves I spy games.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|I must say I was surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this movie! Though I like Katy Perry's music, I didn't think her movie would be too good. However I found myself very entertained! Not only do you get a glimpse into the life of a superstar, you also get a look into her personal life. This movie introduces you to Katy Perry's personality on and off stage, her dedication to her fans as well as her rise to stardom. You feel like you get to know Katy Perry as a person, not just as the glittering pop star you see on her CD covers. This is a great movie whether or not you are a big Katy Perry fan.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I had this on my iphone and missed it so much;so glad I have it on my kindle but now I have to buy everything again
1451695195|5.0|I have read several books relative to authors' journey to heaven and back. Dr. Alexander's account, however, has been an awakening for me where now, nothing is more important to me than love and returning to heaven. It is a book that stays within reach as I want to stay as close to heaven as possible. Each time that I read a passage, I am more aware of my purpose in this realm. Read it and you will never be the same. Isn't it time for a spiritual revolution?
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very fun. The plots are funny and so are the characters. You will enjoy watching this season. A little unrealistic though
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app has sounds for everyone. I'm a heavy sleeper so roasted wakes me up the best because it's the loudest.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's weird, this feeling. It's like I've personally gone through the horrors of the quell. I've been responsible for an uprising personally. Right at this moment I'm filled with dread and just as woozy from the drugs they keep injecting her with. I am overflowing with anticipation to read the third book and I can't share this experience with anyone simultaneously because its a book. Not a movie yet. I think I'm gonna go to the movies as soon a  this is out.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great way to keep playing magic while on the go. Bring more dlc decks though, too many mono colored as is
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We love Suits!  The main characters are so witty and smart. We love the way they resolve cases as well as the comedic banter between them.They each have a unique style and my teenage boys and I enjoy discussions about the &#34;lines&#34; they nearly cross in every episode! Great conversations about ethics and morality!  Fun show!  I recommend it to those who also enjoy West Wing and LA Law!
B009CG29RK|5.0|It's pure entertainment.  My 3 year old daughter loves it and I can actually watch it without wanting to rip my eyeballs out.  :)
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Pics don't save to phone or upload to Facebook. App has potential though once that issue is fixed<br /><br />HTC EVO 4G user.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|Love it!! I have watched the movie so many times. I even bought the second one which by the way isn't that good like the first one...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is the first book I've read in a long while that I couldn't put down. Defending Jacob had a surprise ending.
B00BX8U0EE|5.0|Great box and packaging. Anything with both Lemmy and Robert Calvert together is worth the money. This is my favorite Hawkwind album.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book in about 3 1/2 hours. I literally sobbed through this entire book worrying about each character but too intrigued by their story to stop reading. If you can, read this slowly and take it all in. It is well worth the time.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|My mom read this and said it didn't help her at all. She's just shy and uncomfortable around people and was looking for help with smalltalk.
B0048WQDIE|1.0|Absurdity.  Nearly 100% absurd.  I enjoyed the fanciful bits of absurdity in the \\"Hitchikers\\" series.  Catch-22 was non stop.  Eventually got to the point where I could no longer read.  Most of the characters qualified as detestable.  I got where Heller was going, he just chose to go there repeatedly, in every chapter.  They need a zero stars option.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm not much of a TV person. I don't like sitting still, but oh my GOSH my friends wouldn't shut up about Downton Abbey. These weren't the same set of friends who watch things like the Bachelor or Honey whoever the hell that is, so I was curious. I rented one show, then another and the next thing you know, I've watched a whole season! The series is more literary than most things on television today. I won't go so far as to say it's intellectually stimulating because after all, we're talking about the lives of the English nobility and their servants. It's more of a historical fiction though and I find the costumes and the characters to be delightful and sometimes downright nasty. No doubt some might say that it's just a snobby soap opera, but we prefer to call it drama, dear.
B003HARV98|5.0|Honestly I love both her CD's but this one has not left my car CD player. It is just something I can't get enough of.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I wasn't so sure at first, but my wife and I really enjoyed it. Engaging story line and well thought out storyline.
B00BHO70L0|5.0|First of all, and just in case more people need to know about it: THERE IS NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE OR AUDIO TRACK IN THIS EDITION. Meaning, Japanese language and Japanese subtitles, that's it. So if you're not fluent in Japanese and/or not a huge fan of the series, you might want to wait for the FUNimation release.<br /><br />That being said, the movie in itself is eye candy to the maximum exponent. The story moves even more away from the original series (1.11 kept it together pretty well, and 2.22 already deviated a lot from the original), but it is a welcome change, especially considering that...<br /><br />HUGE SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />These movies seem to take place AFTER the events of The End of Evangelion, meaning that this is not a retelling of the original series but rather a proper sequel.<br /><br />END OF SERIOUSLY HUGE SPOILERS!!!! KEEP READING!!!<br /><br />Included in this edition is the Blu-Ray in the usual high quality box (wider than the two previous movies), the Blu-Ray with the movie, a CD with the soundtrack and a very nice 32-page artbook.<br /><br />Still, before purchase please consider that this is for fans only, or for people with VERY fluent Japanese. If you're neither, wait for the US release.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|A game like this me and my husband have so much fun playing together to beat the riddle we are one as a team
B0015T6G2G|3.0|Learned a lot that I did not know about South Africa and can't even imagine fighting the racial discrimination and hardships that he went through.  However, it was very, very long and not always the most interesting reading.  had to make myself finish it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy every episode of this show.  Only wish there were more episodes each season!  Can't wait for the next season to show up.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I want to play this game but when it loads, it goes right back to the home screen. Very irritating!
B00004UEDQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  Sandra Bullock is a great actress, I would definitely recommend it.  it was as described..no regrets.
1451695195|5.0|This book was a most convincing account of the promised hope of life beyond death.  Eben Alexanders descriptive of heaven is so captivating and informative, especially helpful for those who have questions about eternity.  Excellently written.  I have purchased multiple copies to share with others.
B00797MB0O|3.0|If I had followed the reviews, I never would have watched this.<br />Not every story has a sappy happy end. Calm down and enjoy the fact that she's just a (miserable) character. In this film, Mavis acts as any non-Disney character would in her nutty position. Compose, carry on.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Started watching Downton Abbey at Season 1 on Amazon Prime because several friends recommended it.  Now in the middle of Season 3.  I see that Season 4 begins in January 2014.  It is surely worth all the awards and accolades!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|The game was to fast hard to follow. Maybe it was just us. But I didn't keep it on my phone.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I just got back from watching this movie again and I have to admit it is better than the first one. I really enjoyed the comedy of this movie and how cute Agnus is.  I won't give away any of the movie you will just have to watch this because it will have you rolling off your couch or chair, especially the way the minions are.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This a great story with rich characters, fantastic clothing, great sets. The story presents an in-depth contrast of the social classes showing a vast difference between the aristocracy and the working class.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is a very good game. I think it is great time waster. it kind of gets boring and it takes a really long time to get coins unless you are a pro at it takes sometime to like it. I say its fun tho!<br />  ()  ()<br /> &asymp;( '  . ')&asymp;  bunny face! hope you enjoy it if you get it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the characters, the clothing, the sets, the script, everything really! It is rich in the literary elements, like a really great novel.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very frustrating but fun it definetly is a copy of Mario I mean its just like Mario but its a jolly green guy. well its very fun no kidding.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I really liked this movie. I am not much of a movie critique. Cast and the whole crew .. Direction, Cinematographer absolutely impeccable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm eight years old and I Love THIS APP I've already beat Vector and Meena and El macho it's awesome and if if you like this App then you would probably like temple run and subway surfers please download this App is is magical
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I liked the documentary and it as a good tool for parents to watch with their kids.  The learnings include being diserning about what you read, caution re: digital flight ...how any image can go viral and also about kindness. Nev and his brothers treat each other as well as the catfish's family with respect.  People hurt others when they are hurting, it doesn't make it ok but it makes it human
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I've listened to hundreds of electronic albums, and this one take its place as the top one, with incredible melodies that always go places you never expect and leave you guessing in joy.  Cannot recommend enough.
B00B9366VO|4.0|This movie is a fun way to re-live some amazing rock records, from Fleetwood Mac through Nirvana.  Dave Ghrol does a good job narrating.  The best part is seeing how happenstance was the reasoning behind some of the best music of the latter part of the 20th century.  The documentary can be a little slow at times, but in general, I enjoyed the movie a great deal.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a riveting season. I won't give away the plot, but could any TV series have more going on than Downton Abbey? The character development is so intriguing and so well written. If you love period pieces, this is for you. I can't say enough about  Season 3. I had to watch it all within a couple days, it was that good. I will be watching it again. In fact I thought I would invite the  family for a &#34;Downton Abbey Immersion Weekend&#34;.  The costumes, the set decorations are superb. I don't know which is better, the story of the Crawley family or their servants.  Watch it, you will fall in love with it.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Have been using it with my iPad for garage band....perfect
B000RF7XYO|5.0|I chose this movie because the era of time and this wonderful queen and the<br />daughter of another great women and king. Cate Blanchett did such a wonderful<br />job of pulling me into her joy and sadness. The supporting actors did so much<br />to lift the movie also.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Bought it for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it.  Could not find it at any store, so glad Amazon had it for sale.  Also, a good price.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie was mostly a journey of emotion and learning. The actors<br />of course were just wonderful and the photography by this director was<br />unreal.
B001NE80P4|4.0|Bought this movie for my daughter to complete her collection (she has original and HSM #2).  She was happy as can be to have the 3rd one, which I think is the best.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Cate Blanchett did a wonderful job in this showing a great and much<br />loved queen.  The story of the Spanish ramada was so well done. The<br />photography was wonderful. I could have done without the torture.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Cancel your daily newspaper.  This will keep you up on international, technical, and financial news without any strain.  You can select the areas you wish to see every day.  The stories are long enough that you will get a good background and learn a lot.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game sucks .it is really slow and when you brush the person's hair it just stops after a while .and whenever you try to do anything  it starts to do it on it`s own .so if I were you I would not buy this game!
0783225547|5.0|I saw this film twice in theatres-once with my mom, and once with my aunt, enjoyed it equally both times. This was one of my first disaster films, other than Earthquake. I've owned it on VHS, and DVD...twice! Obviously it is one of my favorites. Even with the so-called cliches, which rarely ruin a movie for me, anyway) this film never gets old. Director Roger Donaldson, who also made Species-didn't care much for that) clearly did his homework, and overall, knows the material. Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Harry Dalton does a very nice job as the volcanologist, who just won't back down from his prediction, no matter what any one tells him, including his boss, played by Charles Hallahan-essentially a character actor. The rest of the team does a decent job as well, even throwing in some humor periodically. Linda Hamilton as the town's mayor, best known as Sarah Conner from the first two Terminator films, was very good and likable in this, along with her two children. Theme composer James Newton Howard-just like the current Dark Knight series and Devil's Advocate, does a very creepy and ominously effective score. The characters are well cast, but for some, the real star is the volcano-when it finally does erupt, and boy! Does it ever!) The devastation looks fairly realistic. Check it out!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Original concept.  Excellent cast.  Highly enjoyable.  All in all, it's a winner.  Malcovich and Mirren are absolutely fantastic.  Everybody else pales in comparison, although they're still excellent.  Can't wait to see the sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great way to teach how to care for animals and the horses  that all shall take part in if they are wanting one
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I like this game. It was fun and creepy. Would play the next one. What a great game this was.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the premise of an &#34;attorney&#34; lying about being an attorney and having an attorney cover up for it... witty!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book. From the beginning until the end it had me hooked. Absolutely amazing book through and through.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|It was working fine and now all of a sudden it's an error when I'm trying to sign in and my password and username is correct. Please fix
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you loved the despicable me movies you will love this game. 100 percent satisfaction from me. I love it.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game exceeded every expectation I had. The characters were realistic, the atmosphere was increadible tense, and the multiple endings had me puzzling a long time after I'd finished. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the tough descisions of The Walking Dead.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Perfect fit. Protects my kindle nicely, meanwhile is not bulky at all and It adds very little weight. Very resistant material.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's A Great App I Love To Play It, I Play Everyday And It Helps Me Think More I Really Like The Emoji's
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Very good but not quite as good as season 2.  Cannot wait to see what happen in season 4 now that Mary is a widow.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I liked the plot and the placement in history.<br />I learned a lot about a time I have a lot of interest.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Bought this for my 8-year-old daughter, and she started off getting frustrated & fussing every time it fell off the track, but now she's a bit of a whiz on it, and plays with it for an hour or more. She delights when she reaches a higher number than her dad!! It's a great, battery & noise-free (apart from frustrated kid sighs) toy to keep kids busy, and we frequently take it -on-the road :) None of us have made it all the way through yet, and that is part of the fun challenge of it :) She love's to show it/share it with friends and show them how it's done!
074401493X|5.0|A great companion with the game The Last Of Us for the completionists or for those who like to have a detailed in game guide for their favourite game. It is a high-class hardcover and detailed game guide with tons of information and detailed info about the locations, collectibles, trophies in the single player campaign and also in the factions - the multiplayer part of the game, which I haven't even touched yet.<br />It is only my second guide I bought from BradyGames, the first one was the Half Life 2 game guide I bought a long long time ago.<br />It comes in plastic wrap and in a styrofoam protected book sized wrap you have the slick looking \\"firefly\\" keychain, which I instanlty hanged onto my car keys ring.<br />It's a wonderful looking limited edition game guide with an exquisite hardcover mat finish cover and a wonderful the last of us logo exserted from it.<br />So to sum up, it is a perfected game guide with a sleek looking mat finish and it comes with a cool firefly keychain.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Great insight into what makes special people special. Well written and very addicting, I highly recommend it to anyone curious about the world and the people in it

B007D2XSW0|1.0|Like every one else I too think that this app has great effects, frames,etc. But, it doesn't save the picture. Come on Amazon, check the calendar, today is not APRIL'S FOOL DAY.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|When I saw trailers for this movie, I admit to being extremely hesitant about watching it.  There were a number of reasons for this, the first and foremost being that sequels/prequels/remakes of any movie are always a crapshoot, and trying to update or add to a classic film such as \\"Wizard of Oz\\" is even riskier.  And despite \\"Wizard of Oz\\" having its own set of flaws (it's admittedly trippy and corny, and the special effects, while phenomenal for their time, show signs of age), it's still a beloved classic by many, so any attempts at a re-imagining or addition to the tale would be met with skepticism and scrutiny.  The fact that I'm a huge fan of the \\"Wicked\\" musical, which has it's own take on the land of Oz and the backstories of some of the classic characters, didn't help either.  But I decided to give the film a chance anyhow.<br /><br />The verdict?  This film looks gorgeous and acting is decent, but a bad script bogs everything down and is bound to give many viewers headaches.<br /><br />\\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\" follows Oscar Diggs, a sleight-of-hand magician traveling with a second-rate circus through rural Kansas.  Something of a womanizer and egomaniac, he dreams of doing great things... but even he isn't prepared for destiny to come crashing down on him when a tornado sucks him into the fantastic land of Oz, where two witches immediately declare him the king of their world.  At first Oscar is thrilled, but the witches tell him his newfound throne comes with a price -- to rule Oz he must fulfill a prophecy and destroy the Wicked Witch who killed the previous king, and thus save Oz.  Armed with only his wits and parlor-magic tricks, and with the aid of a sour-tempered Munchkin and a wisecracking flying monkey, Oscar sets out to defeat the witch... only to find out that who's wicked and who's on his side isn't clear, and that he may end up becoming a pawn of more malevolent forces.<br /><br />Perhaps this film's greatest strength is in its appearance.  The visuals are GORGEOUS, with vibrant colors, imaginative creatures and scenery, good special effects, and beautifully rendered costumes.  Oz looks every bit the marvelous land I imagined from the books, with its own surprises and its own dangers, but it also pays visual homage to its predecessor in many ways.  And in a few areas it even manages to improve on the old film -- the evil flying monkeys (more like bat-winged baboons in this incarnation) are obviously CGI, but they're genuinely terrifying in this film, instead of being people in goofy costumes.<br /><br />The acting in this film is decent as well, and the actors do the best they can with the script they've been given.  James Franco does a superb job at playing Oscar Diggs, and his performance somehow reminds me of Robert Downey Jr.'s rendition of Tony Stark in Ironman -- an arrogant playboy who gradually develops a heart and a sense of honor as the film progresses, and something of a gadgeteer genius.  Rachel Weisz is obviously having too much fun as the villainess, and Mila Kunis is genuinely heartbreaking, creating a sympathetic character even in her most over-the-top moments.  Michelle Williams is incredibly bland in comparison, but then, she isn't given much to work with in this rendition of Glinda the Good.  And the supporting cast has some great moments, most notably Joey King as a China Girl (no, not a stereotypical Chinese girl, an actual girl made of china -- it makes sense in context).<br /><br />But the script is what brings this movie down.  The actors do their dogged best to bring the characters to life, but they're given very little to work with.  James Franco plays an excellent copy of Tony Stark, but that's just what it feels like -- a copy of something we've already seen before.  The \\"trickster becomes a hero\\" plot has been done before, and while old plots can be given a fresh twist and done again, it felt like this movie didn't bring anything new to the table.  And it becomes difficult to root for Franco when he womanizes everything in a skirt, treats his friends like dirt, and does precious little to redeem himself by film's end.<br /><br />The three witches suffer the most, however -- they're all cardboard cutouts instead of interesting characters, and while it's interesting to see the two wicked witches play Oscar as a pawn in their game of power, it becomes tiring when said games descent into a love triangle.  Mila Kunis does manage to bring some pathos to her role, and was on the verge of becoming a decent character... but the filmmakers decide to throw all that out the window and use a combination of magic and \\"jilted lover\\" clich&eacute;s to abruptly turn her into a villain.  And after seeing a far more realistic and heartbreaking fall to darkness for this villainess in \\"Wicked,\\" her turn to evil in this movie felt like a bad joke.<br /><br />This movie feels like a fantasy version of \\"Avatar\\" in my mind -- gorgeous to look at and with some interesting ideas, but with a tired plot and uninteresting characters to go along with it.  I'd watch this film again, but only because of the visuals and the valiant efforts of the actors to salvage something from the script.  In the meantime, I prefer \\"Wicked\\" as my \\"Wizard of Oz\\" prequel of choice, thank you...o root for Franco when he womanizes everything in a skirt, treats his friends like dirt, and does precious little to redeem himself by film's end.<br /><br />The three witches suffer the most, however -- they're all cardboard cutouts instead of interesting characters, and while it's interesting to see the two wicked witches play Oscar as a pawn in their game of power, it becomes tiring when said games descent into a love triangle.

B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app works great, I have never had a problem with it so far. Very simple to use and understand.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|While out of town one weekend me husband saw this movie on the television and had to buy it as he liked it so much
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Played for about 15-20 min and the game was over...the puzzels are ok, should get harder to solve but don't.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I enjoy this app because it is quick and easy to get to when I want to show my pictures. Always great clear Pics or videos.
B002NANLCE|4.0|Certainly one of the most original and interesting sci-fi novels I've read in a while. The premise is that a cutting edge physics experiment at the CERN particle accelerator somehow causes humanity's consciousness to leap forward by twenty years for a couple of minutes. We are then left to explore the aftermath of the phenomenon, especially in terms of the science that has made it possible and of its philosophical implications (particularly the issue of free will). Sawyer nicely bounces around building his characters so that we care about what happens to them, exploring the physics underlying the flashforward event, and (a bit less successfully, I must say) examining the philosophy of the situation. The only disappointment, unfortunately, comes at the very end, when things take an unexpected but - it seems to me - artificially forced turn that doesn't seem to really add anything to the book. Still a very good read, providing some interesting food for thought.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This is a fun word game.  It starts off easy, but a few of the Memphis were hard.  A fun app
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this app sucks such a waist of time installing it looking at it, realizing this will never help you, and then having to go and uninstall it.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Its an awesome program but the collage feature only allows you to add 2 pictures.  I tried several different things, resize picture, rename picture and it still only allows 2 pictures. Fix it and its at 5 star program!
B000ICXQU6|5.0|Julia plays Erin in this awesome portrayal of a real gal who starts off with hard times but learns to make lemonade out of lemons!  Another one of the great movies of all time that is a must see for me at least once a year.....brilliant!  To make another comment...Erin went on to do a TV program that was designed to help women know what to do in dangerous situations...it was a great program; wish I knew what she was up to these days..haven't heard anything about her for quite some time.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The DVD of the movie Chicago is especially well-photographed and gives you the opportunity to replay certain favorite scenes. My friend had never watched it and didn't know the story or how wild the plot is.  Some of it is blatantly outrageous!  He doesn't like musicals but we enjoyed this one VERY MUCH!  There are so many richly choreographed scenes and all the actors and dancers really give it their all.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE being able to purchase music that I can listen to RIGHT AWAY, in the MP3 format!!  It's on my Amazon Cloud, it's on my Windows Media Player and it's also on my MP3 player (which I bought from Amazon!) and that way I can NEVER miss listening to them!  No matter what song, what CD, Lady Antebellum never, ever disappoints me!  They are just THAT awesome!!!  I also got the CD in the mail a few days after downloading the MP3 version.  So I have MANY ways to listen to this AWESOME music! :)  Thank you, Amazon!!  :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love how the plot continues from the first book, New characters introduced, and cliffhanger ending. Can't wait for the movie!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Parent or not, this book should be read by everyone who thinks children are born innocent and remain innocent. It is a slap on the face written so superbly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cant wait for season 4. The action and suspense in this show is phenomenal. I bought season three and couldn't stop at just one episode. My son and I stayed up all night watching the whole series!
B00975L81Y|4.0|What all these reviews seem to miss, is the HUGE glaring difference in how Dani sings on this album, vs previous albums.  This is not a copy of their last two releases, this is step into new territory.<br /><br />We should of all saw this coming, but I for one, didn't & I'm happy, cause it blew me away. Dani has pushed himself, to me, he has a sort of Iron Maiden feel when he using his more singing voice vs his demonic (which he still does wonderfully).  It's amazing. I don't understand how any real COF fan could hate this, they ought to be ashamed, but we'll give em a break & let come to their sense, hopefully aural.<br /><br />I've only mentioned how awesome Dani sounds on this album, so now it's time to say that the music is just as amazing. This album should put Cradle at an even higher place in the world of metal, as they didn't sacrifice anything that made them who they are. They didn't sell out. They pushed themselves to write an album that doesn't sound identical to anything they've done yet, which is awesome. Great job COF.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game.  It can keep me occupied during at those commercials while watching my favorite TV shows...or when I'm waiting at a train crossing for the coal train to go by.  The graphics are great.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a true classic and one the greatest films ever made in my opinion. Bogart, Holt, and Bedoya are great, and Walter Huston is...well...superb! I highly recommend this film!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love it! Fun movie! Would definitely recommend to anyone with small kids or maybe just a Kid at heart! Can't wait to see #2
0143124544|5.0|Oh. My. God! I loved this book (she says recovering from a whole host of emotions!)<br /><br />Louise (Lou) Clark has lost her job, her options of a new one at the job center are rubbish until one comes in to be a private carer. Going in with no experience and the idea of looking after an old man she sykes herself up and finds it is nothing like she expects. Will is a grumpy, cheeky, angry, young man who isn't interested in a whole lot since his accident leaving him a quadriplegic. Lou and Will have to find a way of working together and soon changing each others lives as they know it.<br /><br />This book had me hooked from the first handful of pages. The banter and attitude between these two is brilliant. Lou is basically a misfit, take me as you find me kind of girl, Will was a high powered business man with a lust for life and everything physical. Two years since his accident and he is still in a world of anger, hurt, annoyance and pain (not to mention the health issues). You couldn't pick two more different people to be thrust upon each other and watching their relationship and how they respond with each other was captivating.<br /><br />The writing is so smooth and powerful you can see the characters coming to life and pulling reactions that I can honestly say I haven't experience many times (if ever before) and I have been devouring books for years. I think this book struck so much emotion with me as I could relate to each of the characters and where they were coming from but mostly it is just a fantastically written book. My first encounter with this author and I will definitely be reading her again, 5/5 for me!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|To me this game is super fun and very addicting I can't stop playing it. It's sort of a mix between a brain game and just a regular game to play with your friends and family see who can beat the level first or fastest.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game it's a fun way to play with people you don't know and you don't have to feel like anyone is cheating or letting you it's a fair game and I hope you enjoy it.!!:)
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Minecraft fan - check!<br />Lego fan - check!<br /><br />This is a nice set for collectors and playsters!  I picked up (2) of them, one for each kid to play with (although one is still too young).  My oldest loves this set and carries it around.  I definitely kept the box since it carries this and the extra parts really well.  Bonus that it comes with the new Lego removal tool.<br /><br />This set does contain a high number of the 1x1 tiles, so they are more prone to being lost; this set came with a lot of 'spare' pieces.<br /><br />I love the Lego Cuusoo idea!
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was very well written and I am so thankful that different people had told me about the story line or PLOT and ideas the first one and bought  the next. Two I enjoyed all three and the story just made you feel like you were or wished you were taking the story and living it.
B005LAII80|4.0|This was a good action flick that you don't really have to pay attention to.  Some of the action shots were a little wacky, but overall I enjoyed the movie.  I know this was an independent film and I hope that the success of this film enables them to create a sequel, which i would also gladly pick up.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show is awesome! We are all absolutely hooked and can not wait for Season 2 to come out. It's intense thrilling and packed full of suspense.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This is a great movie, and they did a masterful job on the bluray conversion of this.  Looked fine in 1080p and sounded great through our sound-bar.  As with all of the older movies, I try to wait until they are fairly cheap ~$10 before I pick them up again.<br /><br />I am also amused that this is rated PG....good for the kids!
1592402690|5.0|As a Gen-X'er in my mid-20's, I'm about as far removed from the Beatles and the British Invasion as today's kids are from corded phones and 8-track cassettes.  Even still, I grew up heavily schooled by my father in the fundamentals: analog recording, Vox amps, three-part harmonies and power chords were in my vocabulary by age 10.  I largely ignored the Beatles until this point in my life, but a librarian at my local library was clever enough to place this book on display right where I happened to sitting a few weeks ago.  I grabbed it casually, started reading and was completely swept away.  Geoff's story is absolutely incredible and extremely exciting to read.  The insight into recording industry in the early 60s is captivating and the collection of stories spanning over a decade with the Beatles is sure to almost any reader into a lifelong fan.  Much to my Dad's delight, I'm a total Beatle fan now.  Better yet, I finally feel like I have some perspective on what it was like before the era of digital, infinite track ProTools production with AutoTune.  A golden era indeed! Now, all I need is Doc Brown's Delorean so I can go back in time to experience it myself!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book even more than the first book..it is inspiring and truly keeps your attention. I would recommend this book to all that LOVE to read. I am ready to read the next book now. Great job Suzanne Collins.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|The premise of this book has so much promise, which makes it so disappointing. It just does not deliver. I found it to be contrived. I give Lehane props for trying to pull this off, but it falls just short of the mark. One is almost able to suspend (question) belief, but not quite. Lehane is a good writer. The narrative is strong and that gets you through. Read if you are a fan, otherwise skip it if you are considering other options.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like subway surfers, you'll like this game. The minions are the bonus. If you have an original kindle, it takes a while to load sometimes.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I don't read many books, but this one I loved. Your an awesome man & have been through a lot. Look where you are now amazing
B00EH49DXA|5.0|She is pulling of another super big hit! This is not one of her bests, but it is up there and i RECOMMEND this song of everyone...has a powerful and strong meaning to it as well. She is growing up, that is why she is less jumpy in the song. Ily Katy Perry<3 #KatyKat #Roar #Recommend
0060537639|4.0|I heard of this book and wanted to understand how it might have been possible for China to have explored the world before Columbus.  The book is highly entertaining and trots out lots of interesting findings that seem to suggest widespread exploration of the world by the Chinese prior to 1423 when China &#34;closed up&#34; and turned inward.  The greatness of Chinese society and accomplishments up to the time is well documented.  But the extent of its exploration is not.  The argument Menzies makes is far from air tight, it is full of holes, but there is a tantalizing amount of evidence that is at least consistent with his theory and his recounting of his own exploration to find this evidence is a good story.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|never recived it,can not talk to anyone to get money back, very dissapointed,fist time this happened nd now i dont want to buy anything else ,will tell everyone i can about this

B007D2XSW0|1.0|Tried to use this app, wouldn't even open a picture on my S4! Tried several images from my gallery and nothing, just a blank page.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|i hated every min of it, its not my type of movie, watched it because it was recommended but honestly its stupid and gory. not for me
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love the hourly forecast feature. The app works just fine with no complaints from me. Definitely worth the price--free!
B00181JGI2|5.0|This is a classic film that I rented to watch with my wife. Its odd, funny, and has enough human tragedy to keep it engaging. Watch it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I finally was able to appreciate this show since I didn't really comprehend the subject matter when I was watching it as it aired. Lots of thought put into the show and with the amazing cast it is definetly one of my all time favorites. The only down side is that the box will scratch the disks as you take them in and out. I solved it by putting each disc in a piece of a small sandwhich bag.
B001V5CIFI|4.0|We avoided this movie when it came out because the trailer seemed really dark.  My kids are all older now and we just watched on a whim.  Everyone in the family loved it!  Not to be a spoiler, but if you liked Mary Poppins you will like Nanny McPhee.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I loved it from the beginning now can't stop watching it! Can't wait to watch season 2 and 3,and 4?

B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This movie is awesome!!!!  Most people think it's just the ponies as humans (as in a spin off of the show), but the regular ponies are there.  They beginning starts as ponies then goes into the human world.  It's a must for any My Little Pony lover!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I got this game downloaded a while ago but didn't play for long.When my daughter became obsessed((I could hear her yelling at the game).I decided to play. I'm liking it now!<br />What I have to say is I go on several times a day & even middle of night if I'm up. SO how does it show a restart of consecutive days when I do NOT MISS ANY?!?!<br />Wish it was easy to get something back!!<br />All in all I like this game! (I like breeding games for some reason-Tiny Monsters just a little more.)
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|I have always loved this movie. So I just wanted to own it. I think the movie is wonderful. Great romance.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super heroes Unite is a fun and entertaining movie.  It have comedy and action and the Justice League. My 5yr old watched this from start to finish.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Game play is smooth, graphics are fun and very colorful!  And the music is not annoying. Sound effects are appropriate to the game.  Great fun!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|It was great to see the story behind sound city and see where it is now. The movie was filmed well, both entertained and taught so much. The sound quality was incredible. A great experience all around.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Uno and Friends is a really good app!<br />I play it all the time. (well whenever I get the chance) I really love this game because if you have like 6 minutes to play, you have enough time to play a quick game of the fun,active, and fast moving game!
B0086700CM|3.0|This is the same as Temple Run 2 - my granddaughter plays it and says it is OK.  I have not played this game.

B008GB1DXI|5.0|Robert Paul Lanza (born 1956) is an American Doctor of Medicine, and Adjunct Professor at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine.<br /><br />He wrote in the Introduction to this 2009 book, \\"This book proposes a new perspective: that our current theories of the physical world don't work, and can never be made to work, until they account for life and consciousness. This book proposes that, rather than a belated and minor outcome after billions of years of lifeless physical processes, life and consciousness are absolutely fundamental to our understanding of the universe. We call this new perspective biocentrism. In this view, life is not an accidental by-product of the laws of physics. Nor is the nature or history of the universe the dreary play of billiard balls that we've been taught since grade school... rest assured there is nothing New Age about this book. The conclusions of biocentrism are based on mainstream science, and it is a logical extension of the work of some of our greatest scientific minds.\\" (Pg. 2) He adds, \\"this book is not going to discuss spiritual beliefs... It will onlly observe that invoking a deity provided something that was crucially required: it permitted the inquiry to reach some sort of agreed-upon endpoint.\\" (Pg. 8)<br /><br />He notes, \\"[there are] more than two hundred physical parameters within the solar system and universe so exact that it strains credulity to propose that they are random... These fundamental constants of the universe---constants that are not predicted by any theory---all seem to be carefully chosen, often with great precision, to allow for the existence of life and consciousness... The old model has absolutely no reasonable explanation for this. But biocentrism supplies answers, as we shall see.\\" (Pg. 7)<br /><br />He proposes Seven Principles of Biocentrism: 1. \\"What we perceive as reality is a process that involves our consciousness\\" (pg. 23); 2. \\"Our external and internal perceptions are inextricably intertwined. They are different sides of the same coin and cannot be separated\\" (pg. 39); 3. \\"The behavior of subatomic particles... is inextricably linked to the presence of an observer\\" (pg. 59); 4. \\"Without consciousness, 'matter' dwells in an undetermined state of probability. Any universe that could have preceded consciousness only existed in a probability state\\" (pg. 81); 5. \\"The very structure of the universe is explainable only through biocentrism... The universe is simply the complete spatio-temporal logic of the self\\" (pg. 93); 6. \\"Time does not have a real existence outside of animal-sense perception. It is the process by which we perceive changes in the universe\\" (pg. 110); 7. \\"Space, like time, is not an object or a thing. Space... does not have an independent reality... there is no absolute self-existing matrix in which physical events occur independent of life.\\" (Pg. 127)<br /><br />He suggests, \\"'Theories of Everything' that do not account for life or consciousness will certainly lead ultimately to dead-ends, and this includes string theory. Models that are strictly time-based, such as ... the Big Bang as the putative natal event of the cosmos, will never deliver full satisfaction or closure.\\" (Pg. 162)<br /><br />Lanza's seven Principles---while intriguing, and congenial---go significantly farther than the evidence he adduces to support them. Nevertheless, this thought-provoking book will be of great interest to those looking for speculations about the \\"meaning\\" of life, and the universe.perceptions are inextricably intertwined.

B009GX7IRA|5.0|The members of the cast really come across as an authentic team. Not sure why the network would want to mess with the mix by letting &#34;Ziva&#34; go. If that occurs, it could put NCIS into the &#34;rut&#34; that so many previous tv series have fallen into when the revolving door begins to erode away the authenticity of the story line.

0684803356|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />  The title of my review is the question that encompasses and permeates Hemingway's deceptively simple and straightforward war saga in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (hereafter FWTBT).  This existential question certainly torments FWTBT's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American ex-patriate, Spanish professor, and bridge demolitions expert allied with several Spanish communist guerrilla fighters against the fascists in their late `30s civil war.  Robert certainly doesn't want to deal with this abstract dilemma.  An efficient, meticulous professional, he merely wants to destroy a strategic bridge in order to slow the fascist advance.  But, this task is not so cut-and-dry as it seems.  Like an unemotional surgeon, Robert has to time the explosion precisely in order to delay the fascists enough so that the main communist forces led by General Golz can arrive in time to retaliate.  This means there is plenty of idle, \\"dead\\" time to not only plan the demolition, but also to somewhat unwillingly get drawn into the lives, hopes, and fates of the guerrilla fighters.<br /><br />  And what vibrant, compelling, unforgettable characters these fighters are!  One of the most admirable fighters is the elderly but capable and loyal guerrilla veteran Anselmo who helps Robert execute the complicated demolition and attack lookout logistics.  Despite his war experience, Anselmo wrestles with qualms about killing others, since it conflicts with fading but still strong religious convictions, but he constantly convinces himself that it is for the good of \\"The Republic\\".  In spite of himself, Robert mirrors the same misgivings, even though he is a self-professed atheist.  An even more conflicted guerrilla veteran is the swinish but cunning Pablo, who was once a dedicated insurrectionist but may have lost his nerve because of new materialistic longings, especially for horses.  His allegiance to the cause is uncertain, especially to Robert.  There is the alluring, violated, seemingly fragile and traumatized, but nevertheless determined revolutionary Maria, with whom the surprisingly (to him) smitten Robert shares a passionate relationship.  Then there is the plump, matronly, wise, outspoken and totally indomitable amazon Pilar, wife of Pablo and fierce protector of Maria, the equal of (and probably superior to) any man.  She provides Robert comforting adages, observations, and moral support.  She has her own misgivings about war, fighting, and killing like the rest of the group, but her patriotism and the promise of a fair Republic, as well as her sturdy personality, keeps her going.<br /><br />  As I said, despite his best efforts to distance himself from the guerilla fighters' personal dramas and remain practical and professional, Robert finds himself drawn in.  Although FWTBT gives the lie to war's depiction as continuous, monumental action (in the novel, it is often quiet and dull with only occasional, sporadic bursts of fire and action), it seems to see the Spanish civil war as meaningful and important, unlike a lot of wars.  FWTBT hints that Robert sees this war the same way and that he wants to contribute to the communists' worthy cause of freedom and autonomy.  Not only that, it also seems he wants to perpetuate his grandfather's heroic Civil War legacy, and expunge the cowardly shame of his father's suicide.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, even worthy wars can demand actions that can be unconscionable in peacetime.  For example, Pablo's potential for betrayal prompts the guerrilla band and Robert to debate whether to kill Pablo.  Again, killing is supposed to be wrong,but in this case may save the lives of others.  But as counterpoint, Pilar relates the grisly tale of how Pablo, she, and several citizens of a Spanish town captured several fascists (including priests) and made them run a deadly gauntlet.  Even though it felt right and pleasurable to beat and humiliate this evil enemy, and even though theywere \\"losing their religion\\", Pilar still felt remorse for such barbaric actions.  Not only were they barbaric, they were futile; the fascists took the town anyway.  No wonder Robert struggles to keep a clinical, impersonal perspective on this war; he fears that if he cares too much, he can't do his job effectively.<br /><br />  Even in his intimate relations with Maria, Robert keeps this arms-length attitude.  Make no mistake, he appreciates her company and feels she has made his life sweeter and more substantial, but he also resents the fact that it happened too late and in war time and that war could end it.  But of course Maria's mixture of unjustly tarnished innocence, her fierce devotion to him, and her staunch revolutionary parentage endears Robert to her and evokes protective feelings equal to Pilar's.  He even goes so far to say that he is \\"married\\" to her and one with her and describes plans on how they will live their lives together in Madrid post-war, though FWTBT is a wee bit unclear as to how sincere Robert is about all this.<br /><br />  As the war continues, and the bridge demolition time nears, this existential struggle plays out, most tellingly in Robert's internal monologues.  Throughout FWTBT, his admiration for the guerrilla fighters rises and falls, his opinion of the war oscillates between worthwhile and incompetently chaotic, and his will to live and fight waxes and wanes.  The chapters on the fascist's horrific besiegement of stalwart communist guerrilla fighter El Sordo, the Robert's guerrilla fighters' noble but impractical desire to help El Sordo, and guerrilla fighter Andres' resolute but probably futile efforts to get Robert's message to General Golz to delay his attack because the advancing fascists were not vulnerable enough - all this reflects Robert's vacillating thinking.<br /><br />  To the very end of FWTBT, Robert struggles.  Does it matter whether he blows the bridge up or not?  The fascists will come anyway.  Robert and his band must retreat, including Maria, whom he may not ever see again.  Finally, a leg injury forces Robert to make a choice between two terrible actions that might be considered dishonorable at most times.  However, in war time, either action might be seen as a noble self-sacrifice.  Whichever Robert chooses, it will finally convince him that, in at least this circumstance, life is indeed worth living, fighting, and dying for.<br /><br />Some observations:<br /><br />1. Like Hemingway's other war novel \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (see my Amazon review if you are interested) FWTBT deals with the pain and the elation of war, love, and inevitable death.  I believe FWTBT is the greater novel because unlike \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" it finds hope where there is no hope to be found.<br /><br />2. The \\"thees\\", \\"thys\\", and \\"thous\\" in the dialogues between Robert and the guerrilla fighters sounded a bit artificial to me.  Of course, FWTBT is based upon Hemingway's experience, so I must assume the dialogue is authentic.  Still, it sounded like an Amish community.<br /><br />3. As in \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", the love interest Maria in FWTBT is decidedly compliant, obedient, and almost worshipful to her man.  Of course, the circumstances in both novels explain that most un-feminist attitude.  Still, it can sound like Hemingway's private romantic fantasy, especially with that unintentionally comic (to me) phrase, \\"Did the earth move?\\".<br /><br />4. If you haven't read FWTBT and plan to, keep a Spanish dictionary handy.  Hemingway does translate most of the Spanish phrases he uses, but not all of them.  Furthermore, be warned: many of the Spanish phrases are obscene, if amusingly so.were \\"losing their religion\\", Pilar still felt remorse for such barbaric actions.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I aplaude Sheryl for writing this book, for sharing details about her own insecurities and struggles as she &#34;leans in' but most of all for discussing a subject that must be discussed again and again and again until people get it (not only women, but men too).

Weather you agree or not with the statements presented on the book, it will open up your mind to issues that must be resolved that are only being swept under the rug. READ IT
B001AQQR2S|5.0|This movie has been watched countless times.<br />Everyone loves to watch it,even my grand children.<br />a must to watch.great movie
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This novel is certainly one of my top 2 or 3 favorite novels.  I disagree with some who say it is difficult to read.  Although the plot moves slowly at first, this work is not about the plot.  It actually reads very easily since it is basically a very simple story.  You can read it at a fast pace if you choose to.  There are no subplots, difficult characters to figure out, changes in timeline, etc.  It is just a story about a family traveling west in their truck and their day to day trials.  Of course the story conveys complex human emotions, politics, history, and religion but does so with a simple story.  This is the beauty of the work, to say so much with so little.  There are many worthwhile discussions to have about this story, one is \\"did the Joad family know they were suffering as much as they were\\".  This novel also made me think about our modern lives today.  Will I ever appreciate a cup of coffee as much as Pa Joad did?  Don't get me wrong.... these workers suffered much, that is for sure.  One of my favorite passages is the description of a farm at nighttime with horses vs. tractors, it is beautifully written.  Enjoy this book.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|Whats good about it is you are able to use your own photos as well as preinstalled ones. You also get to have a large variety of pictures or a flag or even a meme photo for your &quot;crown replacement&quot;.  Plus, you are able to share it with any social app on your kindle.  Whats bad is the phrase you put has to be short or you must make the words to small, and thats always sucky.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I never watched Castle when it originally aired.  However, I caught a few re-runs and thought it was really good.<br />I was hooked.<br />The story line develops each season, and the cast is great together.<br />I will end up buying the entire collection...<br /><br />Good Stuff!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun! I am such a big fan of both of the movies. And don't get me started with the cute little minions!!!!!! I just &lt;3 them!!!!!!! One of my dreams is to have one minion of my own. It would be so cool!! And this so why I absolutely love the minion game.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This was not what I was expecting.  I dont know if it was suppose to be funny or not, but it was<br />I locved the makeup and coustumes and makeup.  The people that did that work deserve an Oscar!!!
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|An unexpected offering from Joe Bonamassa.  Was unfamiliar with Beth Hart but very impressed with how she handled different genres of 20th century music.  Her rendition of Billie Holiday's &#34;Strange Fruit&#34; is amazing!  I'd like to hear an album of Beth and Joe within their more comfortable blues groove!  This recording is excellent!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|For example, Pontius Pilate. I've never considered that Pilate had no reason to hear Jesus' case. He'd been crucifying people for years. Jesus was just another one. The book is full of things that make you wonder. But at no point does he say that Jesus didn't live.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Not many rappers out there like him. Gotta give him props for rapping the truth with a nice flow and beat. His other songs have nice flow too. Glad i bought the whole album.
0671015206|5.0|The opening is classic and humorous. As the authors develop their insights about true millionaires, they provide a definition that is encouraging and realistic. How do millionaires become millionaires? Read this book and you'll learn the simple truths about how to become a millionaire too! Would you like your children to become millionaires too? Teach them the principles of this book!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Just hooked it up to charge it, and it worked perfectly as soon as it was charged. This product is worth the money in my opinion.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Wish they made more good movies like this!  Johnny Depp is great as usual in this unusual story which is charming and actually filmed in Spokane, WA.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book read all 3 books!! There was a little of everything from romance to suspense would recommend.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This is not a great movie. It is a fairly interesting concept with really spectacular visuals and Tom Cruise acting as Tom Cruise, but it is the overly ambitious script that leaves the movie wanting.  It was just too derivative of too many other movies (warning Spoilerish):  the Matrix, Reign of Fire, Planet of the Apes, iRobot, and even a hint of The Truman Show with too many strands to pull together via too many plot holes to really be a cohesive project.  Morgan Freeman, perhaps too frail and old, is underused.  The ending is contrived and hoaky a la (Spoiler again!)... Independence Day.  The movie does a great job of immersing you in this new world and the thin mystery behind it is slowly, if not deftly, revealed over the course of the film.  It's fun escapism, but the film does not have much to say really, about the human condition.  Neither did Aliens I or II or Star Wars but great sci-fi films either introduce something entirely new and make a fictitious world very real with a great story to tell, or use that world as a backdrop to comment on something about mankind (Signs, for example, where the new world of aliens was used as a backdrop for how a torn and hurting family could come together and renew faith in each other and God).  One or both of those elements need to be present in sufficient quantity for a Sci-Fi film to move from \\"Fun!\\" to \\"Amazing!\\"  \\"Oblivion\\" had some neat elements of a new world with very effective visuals and it had a little something to say about what makes a person human (memories? love? the will to survive?).  So that makes it a somewhat disappointing:  6/10. This film was fun and not amazing and a little bit of a missed opportunity.  Worth a rental for sure, but not in the pantheon.  Those who gave it 5 stars leave little room for actually great science fiction.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It works great and is easy to use. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I plan on purchasing the no ad version it's only .99 cents
1451648537|1.0|Steve Jobs was a terrible person, and this book is terrible. Very appropriate. The book reads like one of the American Scholastic volumes from the 60's and 70's: \\"Ben Franklin was a man who had a house that was...\\" or \\"Thomas Jefferson was a man who had a wife who....\\" blah blah blah. Extremely uncolorful and monochromatic writing, but what would one expect from a top-level journalist? This book was written in a very pedestrian style, which might be suitable for some people.<br /><br />As for the subject material... OUCH. I'm sure glad I never met the sociopathic manic depressive known as Steve Jobs. I've known others that have considered him the spawn of satan after working with him, but I never knew the full extent of his vile personality until I read this book. Denying paternity of your first-born, parking in handicapped spaces, what a total dick. I'm surprised someone didn't beat the crap out of him, or maybe that was something that got conveniently left out of this dreadful book.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading a good murder mystery after this depressing load of manure.
B008VSEJPK|5.0|Ok - so, I only ordered this because my special ordered &#34;Roger Nichols Recording Method&#34; wasnt available yet - and SURPRISE, very good resourse for anyone wanting to get a fresh digital recording perspective. It is not only informative but, is full of practical useful ideas, and humor. Easy read and more than worth the time.  Much better than the book I was waiting on !
B002G9N0LY|5.0|Fantasia is one of my all time favorite Disney films. The quality of animation at the Disney studio reaches it's pinnacle with Fantasia (and Pinocchio).<br /><br />The one thing that this laserdisc (and VHS counterpart) has that the DVD and Bluray doesn't have is the original Deems Taylor introductions (albeit the abridged versions). When this film was reissued in 1946, Taylor's wrap-around intros for each musical piece were shortened and remained that way for the next five decades. Unfortunately, when Disney was restoring the wrap-around segments in 2000, they were able to salvage the footage, but not the audio, so the narration had to be redubbed. Therefore, this is the only way to hear Deems Taylor's original narration. Even though it isn't 100% true to it's original presentation in 1940, this version I prefer, because it's what I grew up with. Not to mention that this is the version that most audiences from previous generations will be familiar with for the most part. And this transfer holds up very well too. The colors are vibrant and the sound is breathtaking.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is awesome all and all but takes forever to load.  Otherwise I would have rated it 5stars.  This is why I rate this 4 stars.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Tom Cruise at his worst. Once again he carried that signature cut that never heals on the top of his nose. Yeah that's all I remember to say about this sleeper. Morgan Freeman is great. But rarely seen.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this.  It instantly tells the weather.  This is very much helpful to me.  I love the weather.  This is why I rate this 5 stars
B00CATSONE|5.0|It's short but one of the greatest books on personal development I have ever read. It contains real, short and to the point answers on some enigmatic questions related to success.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Every time I try to use this app it doesn't open and I have to shut off my kindle because of it
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|This movie is not just about sushi. It's about Japanese culture and relentless effort for perfection. I found it very inspiring.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|This game is really fun and it works really well. But I don't get why you have to pay money  after a few levels.
0007466064|5.0|This also is a brilliantly written book by George R. R. Martin.  You get to know all of the colorful characters and are rooting for the good guys and booing the bad ones. I hope we won't have to wait too long for the next book in the series &#34;The winds of Winter.&#34;
B005D4YOJ6|4.0|I wear 11 1/2 but the 12's fit just right!  Great sandels with heavy duty soles and toe space.  No real break-in needed.
1469220725|5.0|I'm so glad I bought the series.  If you have read the other two, you MUST read this one too.
B003EY7JH6|5.0|This was my first book by Asimov and it has me wanting more. I am glad he was so prolific.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used the previous version daily and loved it. The new version is so counter-intuitive and useless I ended up deleting the app. Such a shame. Please rollback to previous version!<br />-
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Game of Thrones takes several episodes to begin to understand the number of potentially complicated relationships But once the series gets going, it gets going! It gets more and more complicated
B003MC5N28|4.0|I read this for school and I am quite Impressed. It has a great plot. The protagonist, Jonas, is brave, kind, and intelligent.
0316286443|4.0|Purchased as a gift ..<br />She loved the book and when i looked through it, it was in great condition and great photos
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Weak script, too many holes. Constantly questioning what's what and why? Not engaging nor interesting enough.  The only good thing is the special effects ....
0316286850|4.0|Purchased as a gift ..<br />She loved the book and when i looked through it, it was in great condition and great photos
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|The different settings make it great for everyone in the family to learn to play. It is exactly as described if not better,
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great song for a great price<br />a must have for music buffs!<br />Great sound for the mp3 cannot be beat
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|What starts to throw me off in the series is the tendency to make it all ok. Bad stuff happens because accidents happen (and the season finale is the most representative moment of this), but conflicts between characters seem to be less and less developed, and more thrown towards petty little discussions that eventually amount to no actual plot development. Granny is still the most interesting character in the show for me... and this is very telling as well, since she is the one who seems to have no arc of herself, rather, she seems to intervene in other plots to solve them.<br />It was mostly a disappointing season, but the way things are set up at the end are promising, unless writing keeps taking the show towards this &#34;all is well between good people&#34;, and keeps avoiding fissures within the house.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Great song for a great price<br />a must have for music buffs!<br />Great sound for the mp3 cannot be beat
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I can't get into this book - made it not even 20 pages.  reviews made me interested but not for me
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|And appreciate this application.  A bit elementary, but fun and easy to access on my Kindle Fire. (and now I'm adding 3 more words in order to submit my opinion --- kinda silly if you ask me)
B007THA4FI|3.0|Not the normal JK Rowling. Takes a bit to get into it. Good read eventually. Nice drama and mystery read
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|If you love the original Star Trek you will love this box set.  It has original as well as  &#34;enhanced&#34; episodes.  You just can't go wrong with this set.
B009WUBERW|4.0|But I still enjoyed it.  Lots of action, will watch it again. Lots of action, will watch it again. thanks
B0081336FO|5.0|No sophomore slump.  Just as wry, witty, and smart without being absurd, like some other Sherlock Holmes interpretations.  This season had surprises!
B0012GTZFC|5.0|I am only 1/2 way through this book and I have already learned a great deal about myself and where I am in the Stages of Tribal Leadership.  Not from a Leadership perspective, but from an individual contributor perspective.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning how to create/be a part of something that you alone cannot create.
1416575464|5.0|My Son-in-law started looking at the book and was impressed with how the different styles worked together, as well as the teachability of the book. I have already had a little time to look at it and am looking at the &#34;how to decorate and put ideas together&#34; aspects of its information.
1442358238|5.0|Very good book read by the author.  It kept me guessing all the way through and I was very surprised at the end.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I couldn't be happier with it. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it without getting in the way.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app has been on my wish list and now I got it for free. I wanted it mostly for the image overlay feature. I too thought it wasn't saving my images but found them in the camera folder. I had to scroll through a boat load of photos, but finally found them. Wish it would post to Facebook from within the program, but I used the file manager that came on my Toshiba Thrive to post to both G+ and Facebook. I'm a happy camper! Thank you Amazon and esDot Development Studio.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|this is a more accurate take on the Robin Hood legend.  The times were a lot more earthy and I liked the look and mood of the film rather than Hollywood fantasy.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This was my second time to see this movie...and I read the book! A very good portrayal of a difficult time in our history. You will laugh and cry.
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|Que podiamos esperar si no un libro, el pais uno de los diarios de mayor reconocimiento en hispano america nos regala esta colecciom de sus 25 años de vida, una excelente recopilación
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I am a mom of 3 boys and we watched this as a family and all enjoyed it.  Great movie.
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|I watched this movie and thought it was excellent. Yes, most of the movie was predictable, but what movie isn't now a days? So, I'm not concerned about that. What I do like is how well the movie was made. So, what did I like? I liked the cast! I liked their acting skills. I loved the jokes. The directions was great and well put together.<br /><br />What's going to make or break this movie is the jokes, and from what I saw from the audience in my theater, we loved it!!! People can really relate to the jokes in this movie because the story was set up to relate to each joke they had. I don't what it is exactly, but the jokes seem fresh and funny. The jokes didn't feel forced to make someone laugh or too absurd.<br /><br />I would say this is the R rated version of Grown Ups 2. I did like Grown Ups 2, but this movie: This is really for the Grown Ups! lol
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This is a great movie.  I recently saw an exhibit at the  High in Atlanta, about Frida and Diego so I was anxious to see this movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great brain teaser, wish it was longer. It would be great if new ones became available like when new versions of Angry Birds Seasons do.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Days have past and still no post to FB from my earlier attempts. Plus, I do not even have the option to email unlike the screenshots display such an option. I uninstalled. its in the cloud if they ever get around to fixing.<br />***UPDATE*** Still not FB post<br />***UPDATE*** Just tried to post an edited pic to FB approximately 5 minutes ago. Still no post. Did not get a confirmation message. the only action I seen was the the dial stopped circling. Was I supposed to receive a confirmation message? Dunno. all I know is my post does not show. Tried it again. Still no confirmation. Will wait to see if it posts.<br /><br />like many reviews preceding me, unable to save. searching the file structure by way of ES File Explorer, I am unable to find the folder for /sd/Picshop,/sd/DCIM/-(Camera Roll), hell, even if I choose to browse and save in a folder of my choosing, the end product is non-existent. The developer troubleshoot even the most simplest responses to determine where the issues reside.<br />if indeed the trouble lies with the user, advise the user of a work around or develop the app to perform as apps are intended. Simple. take picture. edit said picture. save desired outcome in a location where someone can find it.<br />doesn't Amazon have personnel who test drive apps of the day to ensure there are at least minimal issues that require mitigating?
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Is the worst app now why did they have to change to the crappyest app ever.  so mad had to get new phone for the weather :(
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|It's a bit too slow for my tastes, even with the speed up option. Perhapes adding a triple speed option.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Truly a story with a twist. Freeman and Cruise both did a stellar job telling a great story. Visual effects and story both excellent.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We love Downton Abbey and were pleased to find this two season set on sale.  It was a great deal and we'll be able to re-watch the series whenever we want.  Thanks, Amazon.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great character development , dialogue  and wit.  I love the facial expressions of Lewis who is always screwing up but somehow redeems himself.  There is always a good plot line too.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie belongs in the home of anybody who has kids and loves movies. Great characters, wonderful humor, important life lessons for kids (and others). And it is just plain fun, fun, fun!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy the game. the ads sick but at least there is only one at the start of the games and not all thrum the game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I don't see what all the fuss is. It's good enough as a book. It was OK. I'll pass on the movie.
B009J3K4MI|5.0|Fine packaging and a well written history of RCA Living Stereo mark the quality and value of this collection. The transfers to digital seem quite close to the warm sound of the original analogue Lps and the performances are historically notable - especially the Munch BSO and the Reiner/Chicago.<br />The inclusion of a Living Stereo demo from the late fifties is an interesting way to understand marketing in an &#34;more honest(?)&#34; time/
B007L4HFDI|4.0|Great to watch and kept us all glued to the screen. Looking forward to number 2 and 3 in this series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a good game. I like the graphics. Overall fun and totally worth my time. Horse lovers will enjoy playing the game for hours.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price this is great. It does what it says and also this is the first generation of this product - thus it should get better with time. I would recommend this to others. It was easy to setup and use. Tested with an Amazon Kindle HD and worked! Will be trying this with iPhone and Android phone in the near future.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Both my 6 year old daughter and I love this game! You can play and have a great time without spending money on acorns. Love that they give you the opportunity to win acorns instead of just buying them. Have had some trouble with special items and had to start over and reset game to fix some problems. It was just as fun the second time around though!
B000UR9T7I|4.0|We have now watched all 3 SpiderMan movies - and will watch them again in the future. Good actors. Wonder if there will be a fourth movie?!
0763617105|5.0|This is exactly as I remembered it.  I bought it as a gift to pass on to the next generation of young parents to read to their young ones.  It is a terrific book, which I highly recommend.  My boys (now in their 20's) still remember it.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this as a graduation gift for our grandson. This book was impossible to find in bookstores this time of year.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|My friend turned me on to this band 8 years ago. I have devoured everything I could get my hands on from them since. I was a little leery after the disappointment I had with Surtur Rising, but this album put those feelings aside. I love this album, start to finish!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you like 100 Floors, you will like this even better! A really great puzzle game.<br />Levels are challenging but don't get you stuck in one place. Great brain exercise and a good way to pass time. Very recommend.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This site has changed many things in order to manipulate people to spend real $$$. Losing fans for sure!!! Payout are so poor you can only advance after spending $$$ or weeks to move one level....getting frustrnating!*
B008PZ69T8|5.0|While the book was so poorly written and so lame, the music is wonderful.  I would not be surprised to learn that someone other than the author of this book which was neither romantic or sexy or a turn-on, chose the music she mentioned in the book.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Having followed the Downton Abby series, I was curious about its precursor, Upstairs, Downstairs.  I was not disappointed and enjoyed season 1 enough to start watching season 2
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is one of my favorite games.  This one has several ways to play.  I would recommend this version to anyone who enjoys this game.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|I love the features, but if I can't get it to save, it really is like a bad game. Please fix so I can use and it gets 5 stars!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game it keeps my interest  and can't put it down also I redo rooms after rooms<br /><br />I can sit for hours  and not even know it
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|Raunchy. Funny. Endearing.  Exactly what I expected from Seth Macfarlane...plus Mila Kunis is adorable. I loved it.  Screw Teddy Ruxpin.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|love this series,  now i have to find something else since i am all caught up.  give it a try.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm generally NOT a fan of sci-fi books, so the fact that I give this one 5 out of 5 stars is pretty impressive!  The first line was an immediate hook for me, and I simply could not put it down.  I fell in love with the characters, hurt for them, feared for them, mourned for them.<br />Reading this, I felt the same basic emotions I did back when I read Stephen King's THE STAND three decades ago...although I feel this book was a bit less convoluted and much easier to stick with than The Stand.<br />Be prepared for a few sleepless nights...you will NOT want to put it down, and even when you do, the book will occupy your thoughts.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Enjoyable continuation of the Ender story. Kind of slow in a couple of places, but still worth reading. I'm looking forward to reading the next installment.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This has a very different twist to the whole zombie idea.  The story had a very similar plot to Romeo and Juliet, even the names of the main characters are similar, no matter, it was well done, sweet and my girls love it.  They watch this move at least 3 times a week.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Wife enthusiastic and addicted Immediately [but nothing in any of the roles connect for me - a very dull posturing crowd reveling in privilege and borrowed credentials and a drama with soap-opera characteristics - but that's clearly a minority view on my part.]  Needs re-watching in order to get every character solidly in mind, and having the discs allows that in a way that allows a much higher appreciation, apparently, than the TV original presentations allowed.  Worth having in your library.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Good movie. Nice twist. Mr. Cruise still has it. Morgan freeman was good as usual. I will recommend to my friends.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|For a drama without even a single character with any redeeming social qualities, this was a remarkably good drama to watch.  Clearly inspired by the Ian Richardson version over 20 years ago, it is darker and all too reminiscent of current Washington DC's ethically impaired real life cast.  Spacey's performance is outstanding.  A bit much to take all 12 hrs at a single sitting, but still leaves you wanting more.<br />Attractive packaging. Arrived in the mail earlier than advertised and earlier than special handling.
B007DA2FHG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I felt the representation of the horse' life was not realistic enough. I liked the story line.
B009Z59ZNE|4.0|Overly cute in the tone and repeated use of the Shakespeare/Richard III habit of addressing the viewer directly, but with a storyline offering a view of the post-Thatcher government time that makes me wish I'd paid more attention to events in the UK at the time,  As in the Spacey remake, a drama almost completely bereft of any admirable qualities for any of the characters (except a mythical King). Richardson is a very good lead, but, though 56 at the time, looks a little too aged for the sex action (think of a Mitch McConnell centered romance).  Makes me want to read the book(s) behind it all, for some reason not offered as a package with the DVDs as an option by Amazon.<br />Arrived in the mail earlier than advertised and earlier than special handling would have achieved.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|After reading a few &#34;deep&#34; books this was a nice airy book about young love. Was a g-rated book, at least in my opinion, and I would recommend it to to pre-teens. It touches on some real life issues that face teens today. Even tho I am far from being a teenager I really did enjoy this book.
1451626088|5.0|If you like the English historical novels by Phillipa Gregory, you won't be disappointed by this one, which centers on the daughters of The Earl of Warwick, known as &#34; The Kingmaker.....&#34; It's particular focus is Anne Neville who married Richard III, but also tells of her sister Isabel, who married Richard's brother, Clarence, who is later drowned in The Tower in a barrel of Malmsy. Very strange indeed, but he was too much of a threat to Richard. I felt that Phillipa presents a rather congenial outlook on Richard, who throughout history, has not always been presented in the best light...Did he murder the two princes in the tower? Many think so. In any event, it is a good book and a look at the lives of two women in the center of the royal tales of their time.<br /><br /> .
0670026557|5.0|Im not quite finished with it but from what ive read so far i am thoroughly impressed with every chapter. this is a book that i'll save forever and pass onto my children.
0399226907|5.0|The book was enjoyed really by kids of all ages.  Great to teach counting, and sequence.  Nice teaching book for our home.
6305127697|5.0|I have looked for this movie for years !! a great movie must see movie arrived very very quick was quite surprised!THANK YOU!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun game, same concept as the card game with added goals within each hand. Good graphics and neat special effects.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|I will cut to the chase here: this is a very well done \\"tilt maze\\" game but after trying it on three different devices (a 10\\" Tegra 2 tablet and two phones (one older with a single core, one newer with a dual core). I can definitely say that the responsiveness of the game depends at least in part on a fairly decent device with very good sensors.  This cannot be the dev's fault because this is true of all apps and games that are \\"tilt controlled\\". As a FAOTD this is well worth a try (even though it's pretty large for what it is, to say the least!), as a paid app, don't expect miracles out of an older or \\"bottom end\\" device.<br /><br />To be sure, this is an excellent \\"first entry\\" into the Android ecosystem from this developer!
B009C7JS14|4.0|This app does what a good weather app is so supposed to do: It gives you the weather. The temperature, humidity, and time show up every time you bring this app up. So does the question to upgrade the app. This is really no problem. If you don't want to upgrade, you just hit &#34;No Thanks&#34;. While this can be annoying, the app was free, and I think it is churlish to complain about something you got for free.
B00932A4XE|2.0|It was boring, stopped halfway through and finished watching the next day.  Cameron Diaz is cute, granted, but that's about it for any storyline.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game. The graphics, the music, even the different accents for the number caller for the rooms representing other nationalities show great attention to details. A lot of fun!
0345529057|1.0|This guy is demented or something. All the books are filled with blood, guts, violence and crazy people who love to kill. I couldn't finish reading it. Sorry to the people who raved about this guy. If you are Christian, stay away. He's demonic in my opinion.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Once I began reading this book, it was impossible to put down. My heart totally went out to the mother,  Laura. I totally understand protecting your child, but Jacob literally frightened me. All I could envision is that's how a serial killer must start. The dad, as a DA, surprised me many times. Hope there is a sequel to this book. Was left with unanswered questions.
B000I3UMKM|1.0|This week, I meandered to the bathroom at midnight and slipped on a cold, slimy slug, right on my bathroom floor.  It was highly more stimulating AND entertaining than watching \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\".  To think I stayed up late to watch this garbage.  I spend most of my days with my seven year old.  She is more intelligent, more entertaining, and more sophisticated than \\"Holly Golightly\\" any day.  It's absolutely amazing to me to see what cliff the Lemmings will jump off of, all in the name of appearing sophisticated enough to quote from a movie like \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\".
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Very unpredictable show, keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next!  Can't wait for the next season to be available.
B009POHHR6|5.0|very good story. the art is an homage to the old days and i think they could have done it better but the story is soo good it makes up for it.. the digital copy took me some getting used to how to navigate the comic but once i go it figured out it was not a problem
B00D2K40WY|4.0|this is a good app very fun just wish u didnt have to pay for all the adds and that you could get all of the stuff for free

B0049VZ222|5.0|I have been adicted to this show from the very first episode. It is a great series, very creative and great acting. Everything about it is exceptional. I am so glad that I started watching.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone Girl is a fascinating example of the phrase \\"two sides to every story\\". A good read with many twists to keep you interested throughout.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Listened to the Bruno Mars tape on the way to his concert.  We felt it helped us enjoy the concert more because we were in touch with the music.
0385474547|1.0|I really think government schools should stop force feeding sudents bs of this tripe while trying to hammer democrat values into kinds who are better off without them.<br /><br />England was colonial.<br /><br />Did the countries it colonized do better than they would have?<br /><br />No one knows.<br /><br />But stepping knee deep in this the western world is guilty crap is horrible and depressing.<br /><br />Better by far to have young atudents enjoy ayn rand tom woods and john allison milton friedman and peter schiff adn be poastive free neterpirse and successful.<br /><br />End government school, end the fed, never vote democrat and be polytheistic.
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|I saw this movie at a drive in.  Lots of action, great music and it is definitely a popcorn movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Finished the entire season in less than a week. Addicting and entertaining! Not like anything else on TV right now.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Again,Phillipa researchs her history and brings you back to that time.  Enrichs my understanding of Britains and Scotland history.  Politics were involved back then as well as it is now.
B00BHU9CCO|3.0|Can't understand why writers have one character call another 'stupid' without any regard how those indirectly offer sanction to young kids to do the same thing.  It seems trivial to some but it is not.  Just ask anyone who studies child psychology.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The game was pretty good all around. There were a little too many hidden object scenes if you ask me, but otherwise I would definitely recommend it
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Probably won't go down in history like &#34;As a Man Thinketh&#34; or &#34;7 Habits...&#34; but still a refreshing read with new insights on a much needed topic in todays complex world.
B002M89UMW|5.0|This was a great movie, worthy of praise enduring at least the length of twenty characters. If not two more.<br /><br />Thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|By far one of the best book series I have ever read. Keeps me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I never wanted to put the book down
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|try flat it is awesome u know like awsome totally right awsome that's right awsome ok. :-) :-) :-D i LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!
0688014291|4.0|This was a quick read. Good material!  Good for parenting as well as managing in a business setting.  The cost is high for such a small book.
0446555002|3.0|I have to say, like most readers that the Cabinet of Curiosities was my favorite book in this series.  I didn't like Wheel of Darkness at all.  I didn't understand Corrie's story at all and thought it should have been omitted.  I am still not sure if I like this character.  I would have rather had D'gosta involved more or Hayward.  Even bring back Nora Kelly, I like these character much better than Corrie.  I didn't at first really mind Constance Greene's part but it soon got old, especially when her doctor was only involved.  I think there needed to be more suspense, less gore, less superhero qualities and more character involved in the action.  When the book turned to Brazil, it went took quick, didn't really make sense on how this character could do so much and things to turn around so quickly and all is better?  So many things could have made the action more suspenseful and gripping.  I found after a while I was skipping my way through the book.  The authors did more telling than showing or allowing the reader to realize the situation or what was going on.  Preston and Child should look at Cabinet of Curiosities, Relic days and see how they wove their stories together and do the same in the future books.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Always enjoy reading the Sigma Force books.  Very interesting science and history woven into the storyline.  Being a fan of The Big Bang Theory tv show, I loved the reference to Schrodinger's cat . And they say you don't learn anything from watching tv.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I understand the commerce side of it but this is definitely not a game to have your kids play unless the parental controls are in place for purchasing more energy etc. I am having a hard enough time not giving in to it. a kid shouldn't even have to make that choice.
B000000H3W|5.0|Beneath The Remains got me hooked on these guys. But Arise is when they really came to their own. It is a flawless thrash metal album. I wont go into detail for every track but I will go over a few notable pros and cons about the album. And if you're a new listener, some things you may or may not like.<br /><br />The production is just about perfect. A lot of emphasis has been put on the guitar tone as well as Max's voice. While you can still hear the drumming and symbol work nicely, the listener can tell, just by the production, that this album was meant to beat your brains in with a smile. The albums artwork is just beast by the way. Max's voice, one of the most brutal in thrash behind Tom Angelripper of Sodom, Ventor of Kreator, and Bob Reid of Razor. His voice just naturally sounds like he woke up in the morning and downed a bowl of nails in under a minute. The drumming, some of the most powerful I've heard from the guys. Take \\"Arise\\" for example, during the breakdown of the track, the drumming demands authority and that you recognize its presence. Bass, not so much noticeable but not a problem really.<br /><br />Pros: Guitar tone is just about perfect. Production is nice. The drumming is powerful and demanding. Max's voice is as brutal as ever. The band adds some melodic riffs and breakdowns while keeping the intensity they are internationally recognized for.<br />Cons: (For new listeners) Max's voice may take a few spins to listen to or to get used to. Bass isn't really audible.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons. This is one of the best thrash metal albums outside of the Big Four. This and Beneath The Remains can rival anything that came out of America during the thrash scene. Albums like this prove to me that 99% of the time, the underrated bands are some of the best. So what are you waiting for? ARISE from your chair and go get this.
B009ZE27US|1.0|don't use this app it dosent work!!!! it will always give you  the wrong age so it is the stupidiest app I have ever seen!!!! don't buy it!!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I loved this show, want to see the next season. I would watch again and again.<br />Thanks for the great shows.
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider solitaire is fun and addictive. I too have spent more hours than I care to admit playing spider solitaire.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Super convenient to have on the carousel of your tablet. Easy to use and it's free!! That's the kind of app I love!!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I am pleased with every part of this order. the product is GREAT and I am very pleased with the seller. this is a great step back in the best time in music.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|The objective is simple and game play is smooth.  There are no hidden costs (in app purchases) and no intrusive permissions.<br />For anyone who enjoys labyrinth games, this is a good one to get.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This is the lead single from Mother Monster's upcoming album ARTPOP. As an avid Gaga fan I'll admit I was expecting an amazing song, but I was not prepared for the musical greatness that is Appluause.  It has topped the iTunes charts in more than 50 countries (so far) in only two days! Paws up and give this woman the applause she demands, and rightfully deserves!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was loads of fun and just challenging enough to keep me interested but not so difficult that I felt it was impossible. I highly recommend you give it a try!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather collection I thoroughly enjoy on Bostrom movies to this as being the pinnacle mobster movies how could you go wrong on Blu-ray I hope anybody… Really enjoys thanks
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It does not follow the books in detail but very well done. Now I am able visualize the characters as I read.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|this movie is great see the movie is about these people taking a whole year to find all these different kinds of birds.  a good movie.  may sound dump but is is funny.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I loved this app. I wish it had more font options and border options. Just more ways to be more creative. I used picnic before it was removed I'm just used to many many options but this is a great app
B000O8OTNC|1.0|broken tool. I was regularly using this sharpener one day when the sharpening part of it snapped off. Would not recommend and had to throw away.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The screen didn't always respond to the finger flicks, and by having to keep your hand over the screen, it impeded my view.<br /><br />The graphics were WAY COOL, but the game play was too frustrating for me to keep.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this for my kindle, works great, always a good reminder!!!<br />Don't hesitate, this gives all your options on what to clean up.<br />I have found it to be very useful.
B00847KFDS|5.0|He chose all the right people to do this album ,the remake of all these songs are amazing . I wish they could all tour together,
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very tasteful and keeps you wondering what drama will happen next. Can't wait to see the next season. Keep up the good work PBS.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is much more challenging than I expected. When the game starts it asks for your age to adjust the game to be age appropriate. I did that and found that it was too hard for me, just because I'm an adult doesn't mean I'm great at video games. So, I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it and lied about my age. Now it's fun and I don't feel overwhelmed. I really enjoy playing this game. It's well animated, and has enough variables to keep from being repetitive or monotonous.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|comprehensive, yet simple and intuitive to use. beautiful interface. love that it makes label recommendations when adding new feeds. definitely without a peer as far as rss readers go.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In conversation a friend was talking about the book and from that conversation it peaked my curiosity so in obtaining the<br />finishing one had to purchase the trilogy.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I love this Movie! So Great with so much done to is it to make you feel like your right there with them. The feelings of Hope and Dream believing once again. The movies is done so wonderfully that is she have been in the Oscars. The movie is meet for the young children, but in my opinion its meet for everyone. Everyone has a center all you have to do is find yourself and believe in yourself. I really hope there will be a part two too this movie. I would and will tell everyone about this movie that just how good it is.
0425263916|2.0|I think it was written for low minded folks  No drama ,no ,highs no lows. Just sex in a less than attractive way
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I loved this book right from the beginning.  Just when I thought it was figured out, I realized I was only a quarter way through the book and it was a dead end.  This happened many times throughout the book so it keeps you going.  Not sure how I feel about the ending.  UGH!
0425263924|1.0|It reminds me of  Good morning  ....tr... . I can not believe it. No substance what so ever.50 shades at least had some bone to it
B00E193TM2|4.0|Great album, enjoyed every song on it. Only gave it a Four out of five because it sounds  similar to the previous album But some songs are unique. Other than that, it's definitely worth the buy.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. a good way to unwind from your day and at least for awhile forget about everything.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|It's a great deal, movies 1, 2 and 3 quality it's extensively improved, the 4th, looks the same as on a dvd. But still it's great!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun love it when you change stages and battle keep up the great work it's a really good game make more
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Our day will come...seems a bit haunting now, but her voice and recordings are timeless!<br /><br />I love this cd, and choose it all the time.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Def a free game certain things will take longer to build but completely cash not needed. Great interaction good graphics in battle and plenty of addiction to be formed. ENJOY :-)
0446554995|3.0|I am a huge fan of Preston and Child's Pendergast series and other books by them.  I have not been disappointed yet...until this book.  I fairly flew through the first two books of this trilogy and was waiting with baited breath for a conclusion that I couldn't even to presume to guess at.  Finally, and oh, the horror.  I was SO disappointed.  Pendergast always strains the bounds of credulity but this book was just boring and disjointed.  It was boring!  I'm sorry, guys.  It's hard to live up to the hype but I expected this power duo could.  But I am thrilled to find out they have a new release, and I bet it will be great.  I certainly haven't given up on this dynamic duo.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I don't understand how this app can be promoted by amazon. I'm glad this app was given for free because I would have been very angry to learn pictures cannot be saved. I have done my part in changing up the resolution format of the pictures to different save locations. The results are the same, nothing saves. This app needs to be taken out of the app store.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I liked it but they could have had way less gory scenes for my liking :-)  It didn't bother my hubby though....
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I play this on my kindle fire it never  works and always kicks me off<br />It use to work just fine I don't know what happened
B00000DRVV|5.0|For anyone who was young in the 70's or those who want to actually FEEL the concert experience from the late 60's/ early 70's...you will love this!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's a really good game but I'm making this review for coins lol but it is a pretty good game
B009G8GRX6|4.0|It was good, but not the best.  I really enjoy the track Madness.  Muse has not really been on my radar until I heard the song.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|In keeping with the tradition of offering quality entertainment, BBC once again did not disappoint.  I recommend this series to anyone looking for poignant stories of country life in England around the turn of the century, with particular emphasis on her structured system of government and sadly also the definite segregation of the classes.  Additionally I was equally enchanted with the artistic aspects of the show  which in my mind rendered certain scenes fitting for an oil painting.  Thank you to the creators of this series for their careful attention to every detail so as to have me begging for more at the end of each episode!
B004G606K8|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight was my first fantasy novel over twenty years ago.  I remember not being able to put it down.  I recently purchased the Kindle version and I felt like a teenager again.  Great story.  Well developed characters.  This was the series I compared all other fantasy books to for years.
B002YCVWXQ|4.0|Great movie, but it's a shame that I had to use a different service to watch it as the streaming quality from Amazon was terrible.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This book kept you reading for the shear enjoyment of it. Anyone fond of animals would keep going to the end even if their fondness was not necessarily for felines. I'd suggest any of my fellow cat loving friends give the story the opportunity to learn more about why they love cats as well as good-at-heart people.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I downloaded it and I requires wireless access I am not a huge fan but hey it's something to do when you get bored
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version is what I was looking for.  It's simple, familiar, and quick to play. I recommend it for<br />senior citizens.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it would be Amazing but it glitches sometimes. I love the new tracks and the way you can get gems... definitely worth four stars
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. Passes down time well. Only bad thing is it takes a lot of time to earn the coins for buying the games.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Too cute my daughter and I love playing with pets. It's a fun moment for our day, and educational in ways. Lots of cute pets to collect, hate that some of them are so expensive though.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I wrote a review a long time a go for this head-set. The problem with my old one, was that I didn't have the drivers for the head-set installed. After doing that I fell in live with this headset. And back in the day when i got it, it was 115$, now it's 98$. This is by far the best headset for this price range, I've tried others, like the hyperx cloud. The 7.1 surround sound is amazing for games, bass is nice in these. Once the drivers are installed the user has complete control of what they want to hear. Bass, and treble are all adjustable.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|this cheesy movie. I enjoyed this take on an old story.  Liked the special effects and characters.  A good recommend for family night.
B002MFULQO|5.0|A great drama in a real life event, well acted.<br />Casts well deserved shadow of doubt on the single shooter theory.
B008NA2JMQ|4.0|It was an interesting story... I felt that it skipped some details but then realised that these details are covered in a subsequent book. I think I might enjoy the second book more as it covers more of the story with the FBI.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Music, and Acting is terrific.<br />The classic story line is almost believable with a good mix of drama and whimsy
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I really can't say much about it.  Silly but good if you want to veggie out with an action type moive
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Personally, I don't consider a tablet or phone a good platform for a photo editor because of the hardware's limited horsepower to accomplish the task.  I only downloaded this app to test it because it was the FAOTD and I hate an app getting a bad rap just because of a bunch of 1 star reviews from users with a limited OS saying they can't see the files the app saves.  I assumed they just weren't able to see the saved files.  But, having tried PicShop, I have to agree it does not save changes.  I even used es File Explorer to search for the saved files--no luck.  Since this not a \\"lite\\" or \\"test drive\\" app, that is unacceptable.  I've reported an issue to Amazon for this problem.<br /><br />Ignoring the problem with not saving the changed photos, the App is easy to use, has more functionality than the built-in Android photo editor and performs well on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1.  But all that functionality is wasted if you can't save the changed photos.  If the app did save changes, I would still only give it 3 stars simply because of some bad choices the developer made when designing the app.<br /><br />1. It relies on the Android Gallery to select the pictures to edit.  Android's built-in photo editor operates the same way.  Gallery is notorious for not showing current files because of its incomprehensible refresh rate.  Even using Android's photo editor--Select a photo from Gallery, save it, open another Photo, then try to go back to the Gallery and select earlier edited photo--you won't be able to see it.  Usually relying on a component of the OS is usually a safe bet but not in this case. -1 star.<br /><br />2.  While PicShop gives you a bunch of choices on what size of file to save, it does not let you choose the filename or location to save the file.  If this is not part of the \\"doesn't save\\" bug, then it's a poor choice and merits -1 star.<br /><br />I'll be watching for an update to fix the save problem.<br />--------------------<br />Update : New version 2.91.1 The app now saves but only to default location-- \\"custom saves\\"  produces a zero length file.  Added 2 stars.The app now saves but only to default location-- \\"custom saves\\"  produces a zero length file.  Added 2 stars.
1936891026|3.0|I have read two chapters and have put it down because its a little plodding.  Hopefully it will be more interesting in future chapters.  It came very highly recommended.

0821221841|3.0|My mistake for not doing my homework before purchasing this book. The majority of the book is about camera gear and it reads as a history lesson about the gear available during Ansel Adams' prime.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that is going to help you improve how you 'see' as a photographer this probably is not what you're looking for. Though, there are a few golden nuggets in this book they are far and few between.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one game that no one forget about, this game is awesome and i played it a bunch times before and it's fun to play
0143106651|5.0|I got this book for my 10 year old grandaughter. I read and reread this classic book as a child and knew she would love it. Some books have condensed or watered down version. I wanted Louisa May Alcott's original story.  This book met my expectations and my grandaughter loved it.y.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This album is flawless.  The songs blend so well into each other and are so beautiful that you won't mind when it turns over.  I listened to it on drives for over a week straight before I swapped it out and then I swapped it right back in the next day!  Makes a great pairing with Enya, Enigma, Dido, Evanescence, even Dubstep for a little variety.  Well done!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am in my late 60's and never thought I would be able to use a Kindle Fire.  This has been the best\\" to me gift\\" I ever bought. I just added Google to my Kindle and the things I can find out now are mind boggling. My advice is for everyone to own a Kindle Fire.
1932100660|5.0|There are lots of diets and diet books out there, normally they each promise that if you eat a certain food or follow some special trick you'll become healthy and live a long life: the China Study isn't like that. The China Study is based on an enormity of research and actual studies, it is not based on anecdotes, hearsay, popular tradition or the opinions of the status quo and yet what the China Study says is in line with the greatest wisdom of humanity from the Judeo-christian tradition and the Bible (Genesis 1-2, Daniel's diet) to the knowledge of Asia (India, China, Japan) and the ancient greeks. What the China Study says is basically what human beings have always known based on their own inner intuitions: we are plant eaters.<br />  The funny thing is that the China Study doesn't actually talk that much about the China Study itself: Campbell uses the China study as his starting point and the framework within which he discusses the role of diet in health. The results of the China Study are extremely vast and deep and would have required several tomes: Colin T. Campbell brilliantly synthesizes the most important findings and results and manages to create a wonderfully concise and practical lifestyle: THE WHOLE FOOD PLANT BASED DIET, a vegan diet based on unrefined foods with starches as the foundation. Campbell then shows that the greatest medical data has always pointed towards the vegetarian paradigm and discusses the gravest health issues that afflict the western world: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, obesity, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, kidney problems and osteoporosis. This is where i believe the book is really really strong, it's easy to manipulate one or two studies to say what you want them to say but here Campbell shows how the China Study findings confirm studies from the 50's, 60's, 70's , 80's and 90's, he discusses the Adventist studies , Dean Ornish (heart disease), Esselstyn (heart disease), Ancel Keys (role of saturated fat), Framingham (heart disease) , the pioneer of lifestyle medicine Dr. John McDougall, Roy Swank (Multiple Sclerosis), Dr. Morrison and Burkitt (role of dietary fiber) only to mention the most important: what emerges is a rock solid vision of nutrition.<br />  One of the most interesting parts of the book is Campbell giving his readers a behind the scenes look at what happens in the world of nutrition and governmental institutions (not very pretty), the man has enormous experience and prestige and knows what he is talking about, he was on the boards making many of the recommendations!<br />Campbell comes across as a surprisingly humble man throughout the book, in his latest work \\"Whole\\" he seems to be quite disappointed and surprised that even though the China Study has had an enormous impact worldwide, plant based eating has still not been accepted on a large scale by the general public. Sadly the animal food paradigm still remains very strong within the western world.<br />I highly recommend this monumental book to anyone interested in nutrition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always played Solitaire and now to have it on my Kindle fire is a real treat.  It can just take away the stress of the day.  Also you never know where you will be waiting.....Dr's office, Airport etc. I just luv' my Kindle Fire and you will too.
B008HK3XKO|2.0|The kindle case doesn't stand up properly with the kindle in it.  It needs a rubber strip or something so it keeps from slipping and will stay stationary.  If it wasn't for the postage,  I would return it.  Not happy at all.  The price of $25.00 is too high for something that's not what it says it does and that's stand up.
1452000247|4.0|While reading \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale\\" I felt I was inside a turbulent nightmare within a maze. The pace of the narration quickens in a fashion similar to the changing of gears in a sports car. Every chapter is accompanied by lots of curves and gears shifting forward, merciless accelerating words and sentences. The book starts like that same sports car: parked, still, almost motionless, but soon it begins to move and it will not stop until the end.<br /> The chapters speed up and, even when introducing new characters and situations, continue to pick up the pace, giving the impression of not wanting to grant the reader a respite. The characters and situations are as unique as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" but on steroids.<br /> The book has some intriguing statements -the tell-tale signs of a good writer-: \\"I am the Path of Information, so just ask what you need to know.\\" It also has other darker declarations, much darker: \\"Spilling evil into the world is an act of mercy.\\" There is also the question of having to give up. At least that is the impression I had from the following line: \\"All of the souls deserve help, but some are out of our reach.\\"<br /> Finally, one can find in poetic-like statements things like: \\"An honest stranger becomes now a friend...\\" This is most intriguing because it is also true. Aren't many of us looking for honest strangers to befriend?<br /> Nice, stimulating reading: four stars<br /> Jake Taylor
B009439HP8|5.0|Another rock-solid offering from the Sword. They manage to walk the tightrope of referencing great bands of the past (Black Sabbath for example) while still sounding contemporary, with tight, heavy riffs, soaring vocals, and some great fantastical lyrics.

When Robert Jordan died with the series unfinished, I was very concerned that his masterwork of fantasy would be derailed by a non-existent or poorly-executed ending, but this is not the case. True, I will always wonder what a pure Robert Jordan version of his last books would have looked like and how the world of the Wheel of Time was altered due to Brandon Sanderson's influence, but I have to say I'm glad Sanderson rescued the series from the crisis caused by Jordan's untimely death. The last volume is well done. The last battle proper is a massive, epic, grueling affair, in no small part thanks to the inspired decision to feature it in a blockbuster chapter that approaches 200 pages in length. The fate of the world, the heroes, and main protagonist Rand al'Thor is wrapped up in a very satisfying manner that I wouldn't dream of spoiling for readers.
B00133KFGW|4.0|i LIKE THIS.  WE ENJOY WATCHING THIS MOVIE.  UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE MANY MOVIES AND NOT ENOUGH<br />TIME IN THE DAY TO PLAY THIS MULTIPLE TIMES.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This movie had kind of a slow start.....but I stuck with it.  It actually turned out to be a nice comedy.  Barbara can be very funny when she wants to be.  I enjoyed this movie, but it is not one that I would watch over and over again,  Try watching it on a rainy day....it worked for me!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Both the writing and the acting are good and great moments abound.  The characters are coming into their own and are getting quite good and creative in dealing with danger and their daily lives. Although Rick has emerged as the leader, other characters are pretty strong. I hope to see more strength and smarts from Maggie and her sister.  Both those characters are underutilized right now. This is easily one of the best shows in television. Season 3 was better than season 2. I hope season 4 keeps up the trend and that the writers don't suddenly start relying on unsatisfying props (like too much human drama within the group when there are other things for everyone to focus on).
B004TI5N38|4.0|great writing, great characters and great plot - all in all, an excellent read - I will continue to read his new books
B007D2XSW0|5.0|So glad I got this app from the free app of the day! Totally awesome! So many filters, frames and editing options!
B005I64U34|5.0|Great flix with fantastic special effects.  Can not say anything remotely good about the Ultra-Violet system--worthless piece of crap that makes you say &#34;Why did I bother?&#34;  Good story line and well acted without all the usual BS of this genera
B0097EWK3A|5.0|What fun I had playing this game! It is just what I was looking for in a mystery game. I am truly looking forward to playing the sequel.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love the show, it always leaves you anxious for the next episode. Don't ever stop the series.  I would very much enjoy the opportunity to see an episode being made/ recorded. I like most all the characters. My family enjoys watching it together.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I have limited time to workout so I appreciate short but intense workouts and this does the trick. Good for all fitness levels as you can easily modify by adjusting weights or modifying movements.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Like others have reviewed it doesn't save on  s3 you can lower quality  try to change location but it fails to save a new edited picture file or overwrite original. Effects were nice enough.  Maybe in the future is will be resolved.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was amazing how did they make it o my God it is amazing I love it tank you soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love falling into the period and feeling a part of the house.  I enjoy the interactions between the family and the staff.
0762445262|5.0|It's tiny and it works! I got it for my husband for his birthday and he loved it.<br />As long as you're aware that this is a MINI kit you'll be happy.<br />There's no assembly required and it already has a battery inside.<br />You take it out of the box, turn it on, and voila.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|As I said it worked just once. Any attempt to run it failed. Uninstall/install does not help. It goes as far as dispayng the dev logo then chrashes (Xperia Z/Android 4.2.2)
B0064MGU98|5.0|Started watching this show about the third season, but missed the early seasons. Glad I was able to start from the beginning. Explains some of the questions I had.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Touching and inspiring movie. Bought one as a gift then turned around and had it buy if for myself as well even though I have seen it already.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I got this for free app of the day. It won't even save. Don't fall for it. You will thank this review.
B00821OX98|3.0|Season one is not the best season but if it even slightly interests you, seasons 2 and 3 (so far) are much better
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Interesting.  It is fun to learn things when you read.  Things you would normally not think about in your every day life.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have now played Mystery Manor for a month, I don't believe in paying for things in a game with real $$$. So as I said if you have a lot of time to play now, and then,  it is a lot of fun!<br /> Its hard enough to keep me interested but I do get discouraged when my energy runs out so quickly.  I am playing this on my kindle and if you have bad eyes, it can be a real challenge!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Bought this fan for my AMD Vischera Processor, Processor runs at 5.2Ghz and temp never goes over 55C even while playing games. It's a big fan so make sure you have the room in your case, runs quiet and am very happy with it. Plan on going towards water cooled on my next build but this is definitely a great buy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun and very realistic game for kids. Great for learning facts about horses. Great time passer alot of time filled for kids to learn.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I have to use a flex arm for my computer monitor at work and I used a simpler flex arm in the past.  This product is much more elegant and mechanically finished.  The movable joints hold their tension extremely well and require much less adjustment than what I've used in the past.  Highly recommended.
0062255657|3.0|Neil Gaiman has attained the status of an international literary icon at a considerably younger age than most who achieve it. And so with the publication of his newest work, the novel \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane,\\" there has been an out-pouring of publicity, reviews, and fan response.<br /><br />I very much wanted to join the exuberant bandwagon and initially I did. In a tweet early in my reading, I wrote: \\"I've just started Neil Gaiman's `The Ocean at the End of the Lane.' It's like running one's hand over fine silk. Exquisite writing.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, about halfway through the book my enthusiasm began to taper off. Eventually, it got to the point that I had to push myself to finish it.<br /><br />What happened? Two things that I can identify.<br /><br />Though the writing remained smooth and lyrical, the constant use of similes, many of them introduced by \\"as if,\\" came to irritate me. Because the story is in essence a fantastical fable, it seems that it was necessary for Gaiman to utilize imaginative literary devices such as similes to describe what is indescribable in terms of the commonplace world we take as everyday reality. I'm no expert in the genre of fables but I would hunch that other writers throughout history have been able to evoke fantastical scenes with considerably more subtlety than the technical bluntness that I experienced in this latest from Gaiman.<br /><br />Secondly, and here I clearly acknowledge the shortcoming is mine and not Gaiman's, I guess that I'm just not that into fables as a genre. I adore imaginative fiction that takes me into a different realm of experience. But a fable as depicted in this work by Gaiman left me uninspired.<br /><br />And I regret that because I so wanted to love \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane.\\"
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|This is the first backpack I've owned since high school (and that was over 20 years ago!).<br />This is a top notch backpack, as it has room for all HP laptop computer, and plenty of room for other \\"goodies\\" as well.<br />I've had some Case Logic camera cases, but this is my first backpack from them.<br />It's lightweight,sturdy and very well made.<br />Recommended!
1939416019|4.0|The story is full of mystery and intrigue. The characters are well developed and mostly believable. The good guys were easy to love and the bad guys easy to hate. I particularly like it when heroes get justice and when bad characters either get their comeuppance or do something to redeem themselves. All these things happen in this book. The story was pleasantly fast paced. There wasn't a single dull moment. I did find some of the events to be too abrupt. The main character goes from being hated one day to being absolutely adored the next. People can be fickle, but not that fickle. I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but the way the main character goes form being a commoner one day to being a hero welcomed into the king's family the next, to being a criminal almost immediately after that is way too implausible. To me, the character is still too ordinary to get that much attention. There is no doubt he is special and on his way to being extraordinary, but it's too much recognition too quickly. I feel the same regarding the love interest. Young people can be impulsive. But to so violently defy their parents to go meet someone they just met in secret is a bit extreme, unless there is a character flaw that leads to this tendency and I don't think that is what this author intended. The author tried to portray it as a magical 'love at first site' situation. And I suppose that since this is a fairy tale kind of story, it can happen. But I'm having a difficult time 'feeling' it.<br /><br />I loved this book enough to purchase the second one in the series. It will be interesting to see how the main character's magical abilities develop, to find out how it is the knight used to live outside the ring, to find out if the suitor and the king's eldest legitimate son will get their comeuppance, learn more about the destiny sword, and to find out more about the wild savages living outside the ring.
B00005N6KG|1.0|The product is great for running, although I wish the cord was slightly longer.  They only last a few months before the right ear phone eventually stops working.  The new price is too high, so I now need to find an alternative.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|the movie was unwatchable because it was so scratched am unsatisfied with the quality of the disk for the price I payed
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I never saw it coming, I wished that it had a much happier ending but with a book like the Hunger Games I guess this is the best we could hope for.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I been enjoying the name so far. Wish there were more costumes for bannanas. Either way my fiance and I have been competitive with it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|As a sequel from the original leps world title I have to say it still a magnificent game and has gotten better than the original title 60 &amp; more levels and better graphic changes than the first time leps word is like mario titles but a bit different also different from the first time is theres more gimmicks and better physics . Its a nice platformer good job NER Brothers I give it a 9.7 out of 10.0 !
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is by far the best version of Jane Eyre.  The only thing I wished that it did was give a little more at the end.  The story continues but the movie left me wanting more.
B005M5PENG|5.0|I love everything about this show from the storylines, actors, sets, even the cars they drive!!!! such a fun ride
B0086213XW|5.0|It stayed with me for a long time after I watched it.  Explores themes of true relationships/ grass is greener/ romance/ family, etc.<br /><br />Beautifully set in Toronto.  Great acting.  Funny, and moving, worth a watch!!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|love love love Star Trek. What can I say! Love you, Bill Shatner!!! and the whole gang. my favorite movies.
034580404X|4.0|I have only just begun reading this however; it has drawn me into it already.  I like the way this author writes and I hope I will enjoy the entire series.
B00E1L9N8E|3.0|I love this movie.  It follows the book almost exactly and it captures the feeling of the jazz era in every aspect.<br /><br />That's not what I'm reviewing.  I'm reviewing all of the hype about being able to pre-order the Amazon Instant Video version of the movie and have it released one week before the DVD movie.  I bought the instant video version, which was supposed to be released yesterday, and it never came.  There was no information provided about a delay in the service and there is no information provided about a different release date.  I've had great service from Amazon Instant Video in the past and this is incredibly disappointing.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian Michaels knows how to work you! I am guilty of buying lots of work-out DVD's and trying to find the one that I like best. I have to admit that I didn't use this one long but it is a good workout and I may start it us again. I like to keep variety in my work-outs...not do the same routine all the time. So, I am glad I purchased it!!
B00CPZ7DBW|3.0|This is an okay game, almost a no brainer but I like the graphics and sound. I would recommend it for a younger person so they can see where the birdy is going to land.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I use this app for all of my pictures!it is just so fun and i love to use it for special things like back to school pictures!!!! If you are into photography and editing, get this app!!!!!!!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The app had some very good functionality but ultimately a disappointment because the images fail to save. I tried repeatedly to modify several images and none were able to be saved no matter what I tried.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very cool. I love that you are in a different place every month and that you can get special boards for every place. Overall one of my favorite games.
B009R659L8|5.0|I love, love, love Mary Higgins Clark as an author.  I like the twists she weaves through out the story, her characters and the smooth easy read she gives.  I try to read her books slowly because I don't want them to end.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Made me want to buy a backpack and go on an adventure. Very descriptive at times and less so in others, which made it more than just about hiking or the PCT.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Edit: 12/12/2013 - Developer fixed the save issue. Back to 5 stars.<br /><br />I remember having this app on my HTC Evo a couple of years ago and loved it. Now I downloaded it on my S4 and it will not save photos. Will uninstall more than likely.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an awesome read, some might say it as radical or maybe even crazy, but that is what is needed when describing war. We are so protected by the government and the media does its best to just get a good story that we never truly get to hear what goes on. I honestly felt like this book was more informative than watching CNN or the local news  when the war was raging on. Wonderful read and recommended for those who in my opinion want truth that we as civilians or maybe even others who served need to hear.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|If you want to relax, enjoy a good story, and great soundtrack this is the film for you! The acting isn't too bad, and the overall calm mood created by the setting makes this a great lazy Sunday movie.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Awesome game, it's addicting trust me. You will love it as much as I do. Easy to play and extremely fun.
B008JFUN50|5.0|I have never been a hardcore sci-fi fan but this movie definitely has a nice light scifi feel to it.<br /><br />This movie has a similar feel to District 9 but with a bigger budget and more star power. Money and actors are definitely not the way to an instant classic but it definitely helps in this case, especially when the star power is Matt Damon.<br /><br />This is the kind if movie that gives me hope that I can enjoy the sci fi genre. It feels to me that scifi rarely gets the Hollywood treatment, and when it does it is full of cliches and melodrama. I am happy to say that this movie is an exception.<br /><br />What I really appreciated with this movie was that many scenes could have easily gone a certain way but instead the movie makes a slight tweak to liven things up. Even the gun battle sequences seemed to have something fresh to them.<br /><br />If I had to choose I would still watch district 9 first but this movie was still fantastic. I think that if you are looking at this page because you enjoyed the creators first film then this movie is worth giving a try.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind though is that there is a strong political message in this movie. This seems to really enrage people. I understand the placement of the message though it does feel forced and heavy handed. If this kind of thing isn't something you can brush off than maybe you should stay away.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Gets a bit repetitive, but there are enough worlds and vehicles to unlock and improve.  It's especially great for those times when you've got 5 or 10 minutes to kill.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|In an era where mainstream music is not very good, Its nice to hear something good on the radio. I hear \\"radioactive\\" quite a bit on the radio, but when I decided to listen to the whole album I realized that there were many more great songs from this group. Favorites are \\"demons\\", \\"amsterdam\\", and \\"tiptoe\\".
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i loved it it made me feel emotion this rickrordian has out done himself this book out of my opinione is the best so far out of all his books i cant wait to see the next
B00005LK94|5.0|Bought it for my in-laws. They loved it and have watched it 5 times. Highly recommend this DVD. I will see it next!
1476734941|5.0|The FastDiet makes sense to me and is easier to do than any other diet I've tried. Limiting myself to 600 calories per day, twice a weeks is easier than dieting everyday for the rest of my life.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|I like it somewhat but the problem is i wanted to make a youtube video on my kindle fire and i look at the app. I was expecting it to be recording whats on screen. But of course its not. At least its free... BUT IT SUCKS
B00DUGCLY4|2.0|... or this game will be over.  It was an okay game, but too easy, and *way* too short.  Just when the items were getting a slight bit more challenging, the game ended.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very good movie. It really brings you into the graphic experience with the individuals. Very interesting and suspense-filled. You definitely need to watch this. The most incredible part is that it's a very accurate account of what really happened with this family.
B003UBTX72|5.0|As biographies go, this is very satisfying. It is not especially articulate but it is candid, honest, and convincingly sincere. Keith Richards provides a moving account of his childhood in south London, his hookup with Mick Jagger, and the beginning of the rock and roll juggernaut known as the Rolling Stones. But there is much more to Keith Richards than the Rolling Stones, and through his life and various exiles (usually because he was wanted on drugs charges), he spent considerable time in Switzerland, France, United States, and the West Indies. He provides portraits of many blues and rock stars and traces his own musical influences carefully and with gratitude. Mick Jagger is clearly out of favour, but of all the original Stones, only Charlie Watts appears to be a close friend. Richards admires him immensely. There are some wonderful anecdotes and Richards is honest about his addictions, both drugs and alcohol. It is a long but fascinating biography--one of the very best in this difficult genre for authors.
0385349947|5.0|This book tackles on the most vital issue in the society which is the role of the women. In the early years women should only stay at home and take care of the family. As we approach the modern world, women become a partner with men in any areas of work; however, women did not really stood up and take control and responsibility. This book is a great wakeup call for every woman to understand that women's actions, words and thoughts can influence. Buying and reading this book would not only inspire women but men as well.
6305263248|5.0|Whoever did the casting for this movie nailed it perfectly. It has all my favorite people. DeNiro, Reno, Bean, Skarsgaard, Pryce, Lonsdale. Even a cameo by German Olympic skater, and super-hottie, Katarina Witt. Then throw in that the whole thing was filmed in France (Paris, Arles, Nice, etc.),  and add to that unbelievable car chases and shoot-outs. You get perfection. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie and I never tire of it. Kudos to director John Frankenheimer !!  This movie easily beats the 'Jason Bourne' series with Matt Damon. I only wish a sequel had been made.
B00069FLC2|5.0|Saw The Shadows The Final Tour on youtube. Love The Shadows, but couldn't stand waiting for video to load on youtube. For me it's an educational tool, to study Hank Marvin, the way he works his Fender Stratocaster. Awesome performance by The Shadows.
B008BC1YG8|5.0|A real nail-bitter from start to finish!! Fox's ability to change character at the drop of a dime is very impressive!!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey is a very gifted violinist and her music is unique, lifting and food for the soul.  I came across her songs by chance one day, then searched for albums she had performed on, listened to to only a few of the song samples and knew that this had to be part of my collection.  And her ability to dance while playing is a real treat to see.  If you like the violin and music that is in a class of its own, then Lindsey's album is the one to have for your own.  I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids got me into this game and I am hooked. Fun graphics, you do have the option to buy coins, but I have not yet.
0345536886|4.0|This is as really fun legal novel. Its not really a legal thriller in the way THE FIRM or THE PELICAN BRIEF are, but rather its more of a straight novel with some comic overtones as well as a bunch of dramatic scenes. The story revolves around a two man law firm called Finley and Figg which operates on the shabby fringes of the Chicago legal community. First a bright young lawyer walks out on his job at a large, prestigious firm and winds up working for Finley and Figg. Then, the firm gets sucked into the middle of a gigantic mass torts case involving a drug called Kraoxx. What follows is filled with suspense, double dealing and high drama.<br /><br />Grisham is a master at dramatizing how the American legal system works and this book lifts the curtain and shows the reader what goes on in mass tort litigation. As usual, Grisham's portrait of the legal profession is balanced, demonstrating that while the law is a worthy profession that provides a foundation for the orderly operation of daily life in the Republic, it also contains more than its fair share of sleeze balls. But above all, this is a novel and the characters are so engaging that the story just zips along. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of John Grisham's writing or anyone looking for a fun read about the practice of law.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|gives me the entire Smodco podcast family. Great app. It has almost. every. webcast that they do. ITS free but I would be willing to pay
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who likes to read about foreign cultures as well as anyone who read Hosseini's other books.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow. Was not expecting that! A bit slow in the beginning, but beautifully written, with a wonderful turn of phrase. Once I was hooked, could not put it down. A perfect, chilling read for the beach. Going to look at Landay's other books.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|I usually don't have problems that others describe when downloading apps, but this time I did.  As many others have reported, this app does not save the pics after they've been edited.  I didn't try to share them after editing, but IMO there is no point to having a photo editing app that does not save the edited photo.
B00415Z9VA|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband's B-day.  We both love Amberian Dawn, so it was a present we both enjoyed.

B000U0O9FM|5.0|If you have seen and appreciate the movie, you are only appreciating a taste of the real story. Read this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a very nicer app with good games.my little sisters love to play it. I reccomend this app for anyone. bey cool
B000W93CHC|4.0|This book goes deep into the weeds of 14th century politics, religion, trade and medicine. It also features one of the most in-depth discussions of the plague's impact on the feudal system I've ever seen. The story itself is a soap opera that feels repetitive in places, but it's certainly a page-turner.
B005PK56TA|5.0|pretty scary...I loved it, I haven't completed the series, can't watch it too close to bedtime, I'm afraid I'll have nightmares
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|Most famous movie actress , had tons of attention... but was very lonely<br />Stumbled upon a normal, hard working man

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. Super fun to play, it's addictive and entertaining. I hope the make more games like this one.
B0009A40ES|4.0|I absolutely love the movie. Bale as Bateman is inspiring, everything from the voice to the overall look and he plays unhinged so well. Fans of the film should also check out the quiz book [[ASIN:B00EF536D4 8:30 res at Dorsia: A Quiz Book Based on American Psycho]] because it's one of those films that makes you want more...and American Psycho 2 certainly didn't deliver on that.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|It a good game but took away 1 star as still haven't found any instructions on setting the thing up
B008M0NDOK|4.0|Got this for about $9 on sale. I figured, even with 7 games officially supported, and really only 2 worth using this with (N.O.V.A. 3 and Modern Combat 3), it would be worth it. Well, it is. Sort of. The controller feels surprisingly good in hands considering the boxy, non-ergonomic design. The rubberized analog sticks feel very comfortable to use for extended periods of time (e.g. 2-3 hrs of continuous play). The controller is good at power management. It automatically goes to sleep after a brief period of inactivity (~5 min) and also if you turn off Bluetooth in iOS settings.<br /><br />I would've given this a full 5 stars if not for the flimsy shoulder button design. A couple weeks in, primarily playing N.O.V.A. 3 multiplayer, the right shoulder button (used for firing weapons) has lost its 'clickiness' and now feels mushy, giving no feedback as to whether it's pressed or not, and occasionally sticking (making guns fire endlessly in game). At sub $10 (I see it is now further down to ~$6), I am not too disappointed. I figure I can just get another one when this one completely gives out, without hurting my wallet. Still, it is something worth to consider.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-small enough to be portable (disregarding the included stand) but not too small to be uncomfortable to hold<br />-excellent button response times<br />-rubberized analog sticks feel great<br />-good battery life (~10 hrs active use on fresh batteries)<br />-good at power saving when not in use<br />-included sturdy stand (can be used with pretty much any other tablet/smartphone)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-shoulder buttons (used for firing/aim assist) are not durable.<br />- top corners a bit sharp and uncomfortable<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />Know what to expect from this product.<br />-It is made specifically for select few Gameloft games (seven in total).<br />-It only works with new(er) iOS devices which fully support those games (namely, iPhone: 4, 4S, 5; iPad: 2, 3, 4; iPod Touch: 4g, 5g).<br />-It will not work with any other games (unless hacked).<br />-Since Apple's finally added \\"official\\" game controller support to upcoming iOS 7, don't expect continuing support, or new games, for this product.g).<br />-It will not work with any other games (unless hacked).<br />-Since Apple's finally added \\"official\\" game controller support to upcoming iOS 7, don't expect continuing support, or new games, for this product.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Lighthearted buddy show with episodes built around the world of law firms.  The 'law' is very light; emphasis is no relationships and humor under pressure.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|I purchased this to give as a gift.  When it arrived there was no plastic around the box and appeared to be used.  I was very disappointed.  I ended up going to WalMart and purchasing the exact same thing brand NEW for a few dollars less.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|It's still a great read regardless of having seen the movie. It's even better since it is available as a loanable book for Prime members.
B003F48E4W|5.0|We vacationed in Capitola since I was a baby so I know all these landmarks. In the 70's I spent a lot of time at night on the boardwalk and surrounding areas, so I love this movie for that alone. Funny horror movie with some really great lines.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Keeps the format of stylish funk, R&B combos with his Michael Jackson-esque high pitched singing from previous works. Also keeps the idea of having long tracks that go one direction then halfway through take a sudden turn, almost as if they could be split into individual songs themselves.<br /><br />I don't see this winning over people who hated JT's previous albums, but if you're someone who loves his older stuff like I do, you won't be disappointed.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The series has weak moments and inaccurate legal basis but the casting is great and the story lines keep us watching
B004EPZ07U|4.0|A lot of people hate this movie, and I can see why. The CG green suits are weird, they futz around with the origins of certain characters, etc. The protagonist is often goofy (using a giant ring-powered Hot Wheels racetrack to save the day??) And the bad guy's head looks kind of stupid :D<br /><br />But I enjoyed everything else. It's a fun action movie with a lot of space scenes (of which there's a dearth of at the moment, so it makes a nice change). The alien landscapes and creatures look great, and Hal Jordan is your typical charming, irresponsible guy who grows up to be a hero, who's entertaining to watch.<br /><br />YMMV, but Green Lantern is really enjoyable. The only thing I thought really needed changing was the stinger with Sinestro. While they hint at his motivations during the movie, I felt he needed to do more to establish why he does what he does in that last scene.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As much as I love the story, I would get a little frustrated when the author would start a new section with all new people and it took a while to see what their relationship would be to the people I had already read about. It was also quite a span in time and I wanted to know more about what had happened to some of the people. I would, however, certainly recommend the book to others.

B007N5YJWK|3.0|I own this film on Criterion DVD edition, but decided to pick up the Blu-ray in the hope of getting superior sound and picture. Unfortunately the difference between the DVD and Blu-ray is hardly detectable.<br /><br />The 39 Steps is one of Hitchcock's early directorial work based on John Buchan's adventure novel. The movie features many themes that would later become Hitchcock's trademarks. The wrong man accused of a crime he didn't commit, a gentleman villain, and a fiesty heroine who helps the hero in crisis in this film foreshadow similar elements in subsequent movies like North By Northwest. The fast-paced thriller takes place across the wide-open Scottish landscape, in a blend of humor, car chases, narrow escapes, gunfire, and political satire.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the film itself. In cinematic storytelling, it's classic Hitchcock. However, the grainy original footage from the 1930s shot with the equipment of its time doesn't improve much with Blu-ray. If you don't own any version of this film but want to preserve it on a long-lasting format, the Blu-ray purchase makes sense. but if you have the DVD version, the Blu-ray may not be necessary.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I would have liked to have heard more about being in Heaven if Eben was permitted by God to tell it. I would recommend this book to the more worldly educated who focus just on their mind as being the ultimate truth. He experience had several common experiences that a close family member of mine had when they were passing into Heaven during about a 60 day terminal illness. I enjoyed this book. I am also a doctor who was not born again into the family of God until I was 52 years old. I also had a glimpse into the unseen realm of God and experienced His unconditional love and forgiveness. If you have doubts about eternity I recommend this book.
B000YGIIQI|5.0|Good down to earth read about his life and how hard it really was. Not everybody is born with a silver spoon in their mouth and he was not one of them.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|My friend had recommended this book to me, and upon hearing her description I was expecting something that turned out nothing like the book. The book was very good, but I kept expecting different things to happen in the book. Also, it irks me when a character such as Q is so stubborn and obsessed on one thing, ignoring family and friends. Gosh it just bothers me! But anyways, the most important thing is to read this book without any expectations, and just let the light come in.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I thought this app would allow me to browse Youtube and then download videos for offline viewing.  It is not bad for browsing videos in fact the interface is quite neat, kind of like the Apple TV interface.  It seems ot have a problem getting the thumbnails to the right size, they are either too small, leaving a heap of black space around the grid of thumbs or too big, stretching off the screen but with no way to scroll to those off the screen.  However, my main complaint is that when I click a thumb it asks me if I want to &#34;perform this action&#34; in the default Youtube app or the browser.  Well, d'oh! Neither thanks.  If I choose either it then starts streaming the video in the chosen app, with all the stop start downloading and playing that entails.  So, instead I use GrabIT which is nowhere near as slick looking and has its issues but it works.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|I am glad I got this app on FREE day. The app will NOT save and will NOT post to facebook. What good is a photo editing app when you cannot save what you did. The program \\"appears\\" to go through the motions of doing something. The little spinning thing spins. But the photo is no where on the phone and never posts to facebook even though it looks like it will.  Piece of Junk. Do not pay for it.  From looking at other reviews, some very old, looks like this saving \\"feature\\" has never worked.
B0080M3OGW|1.0|For big name actors this was a big time flop! Meryl Streep's acting was so much like all of her other early roles that I found her sappy and the plot made me uncomfortable and annoyed.  It centered on a happily (I believe) married man meeting someone else's happily (it seems) married wife on a computer train and both pursing e an outside romance with each other.  I have known too many marriage that have gone this route and don't find it fun or interesting.  We stopped watching it long before it ended!

1452000247|5.0|Peter , A Darkened Fairytale is what I would say is more of a hybrid tale that brings together the traditional elements of the old style tale served up with an array of New Age concepts that will have young readers along with older ones hanging on to every page. What's not to love about a young boy who is trapped in a magical box? Peter, is not your ordinary chap, who begins his brave journey into different realms as he meets the most interesting characters and creatures including fairies, elves and monsters. I couldn't help but love the zany creatures he meets and the crazy names of most of them. I loved Hally, the character named for his halitosis condition. Children will love how Peter is portrayed for his bravery  as he deals with even the darkest and evil creatures .<br /><br />William O'Brien surely knows what children crave as he has captured it all here. He keeps the pace fairly fast moving as it will keep young minds engaged. The book also has a poem for each character so children have a `keepsake' as to remember their favorite character. As a teacher and reading specialist I would say this would be a perfect read to for grades one through five. I can already envision all the oohs an awes coming from the children as their teacher reads to them.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|its quite nice works well on my smart phone. For me though, print is to small.<br />gams are good. But I am a reader, so it doesn't quite work well enough for my usage
B00BB67UNW|4.0|The impressive cast of name actors Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mark Wahlberg, Barry Pepper and Kyle Chandler is what drew me in to checking out this movie on DVD. The story will grip you as it's a tale of political corruption but all the characters are not quiet what they appear to be which makes it all the more appealing.<br /><br />The look, as explained on the excellent 30+ DVD extra is that classic film noir only on color stock. This to me gave it a far more grittier '70s feel to the setting of New York City. It works in many scenes especially the bar scenes. I didn't think it worked so much in others and I can't really put a finger on why.<br /><br />That's the thing. This movie could have been great. Don't get me wrong it's very good but it's not a classic by any stretch. In a strange way I actually found two lesser female characters much more interesting than the leads. Walhberg's secretary/assistant played by Alona Tal was that sassy \\"broad\\" you see in the old film noirs but updated and came across as a real strong female presence in Wahlberg's life now as a private detective.<br /><br />The other is Wahlberg's girlfriend in the movie played by Natalie Martinez nailed her part but she's gone halfway through the movie (no, she doesn't die so I haven't spoiled much).<br /><br />The whole movie just seemed slightly off kilter and not in a good way. Also, I hate to say this but I felt Michael Beach as police commissioner incredibly hard to understand. He's a mumbler in this movie. Half the time I was having to turn up the volume to hear him say his lines. Very very odd because he plays a crucial role in the story.<br /><br />To be blunt, Crowe also had the mumbles in some of his scenes. Maybe they should have hired a better sound editor or just told the actors to speak up.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|this could use some sort of prompting, or search related guide. I went thru the first few scenes no problem, but then came one that did not seem to have all the clues apparent. It's hard to stay interested when there doesn't seem to be an answer.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|The Conjuring is about two paranormal investigators (Ed & Lorraine Warren) who help the Perron family that has moved into a haunted house. It is partly based on a true story. In 1952, the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic Research and opened the The Warren's Occult Museum. They claimed to have investigated over 10,000 hauntings during their career. The Warrens were among the very first investigators in the controversial Amityville haunting. Though Ed passed in 2006 (in real life), Lorraine is still involved as a clairvoyant and trance medium. Automatically the film will be compared to Poltergeist, Amityville Horror and Paranormal Activity. It stands up quite well for modern audiences. As the supernatural turns their lives upside down the film provides shades of \\"Poltergeist\\" where the family, investigators and a local cop try to gather evidence and suppress the evil. Plenty of jump scares. While it isn't perfect I give The Conjuring some credit for being a fairly good horror movie (Hollywood seemingly hasn't been able to do much of that since the 1980s). The performances are good and the story works but it can be predictable in parts. I wouldn't say it is absolutely terrifying but it does have some good moments. It seems moviegoers can't stomach the old R-Rated horror films anymore so The Conjuring manages to bring some of the old magic back. I am happy it grossed over $100 million in the US and even more worldwide. Hopefully more R-Rated horror movies will be made. Director James Wan also did the original Saw but this film isn't quite as shocking as that one. There isn't much in the way of gore at all compared to Saw but the film works well as a supernatural suspense story.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1, Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish<br />Supplements: Conjuring: Face-To-Face With Terror, A Life In Demonology, Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.

B005LAII4E|1.0|I thought the first GI Joe was horrible, but was surprised when the sequel fell even lower.  I took hot pokers to my eyes, which was not as painful as what I was watching.  Glad I waited until Redbox had it; a dollar and change is a compliment to this film.
B005LAII3U|2.0|Colin Farrell was great in Minority Report. I'm not sure how he ended up in Total Recall and Fright Night because neither film gave him much to work with in terms of dialogue or story. Total Recall is about a guy who discovers his identity has been tampered with. The original story was very creative but this version is watered down despite the larger budget. It seems they didn't put as much into sets, creativity or plot in favor of action and special-effects. What's the problem? This film has none of the fun or ultra-violence of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990 version. This is dark, depressing and redundant at times. It recycles sets from Blade Runner, Judge Dredd and other films which looks cool but ultimately feels paper-thin because the story is eschewed for computer effects. The effects do look good but are not totally convincing because of how overdone they are. It's somewhat of a chore to sit through at times because it seems like Farrell and his lovely co-stars are setting something up but they never get off the ground. They had great source material in \\"We Can Remember it for You, Wholesale\\" by Philip K. Dick but that doesn't seem to be a source of inspiration here. Total Recall managed to gross only half its budget in the US; it bombed in theaters. The worst part? They don't go to Mars! The story is about \\"The Fall\\" (which is some kind of underground elevator) and how it will save us all. Don't ask. Amazingly this movie gets a 2-disc release with special features. Check out the original Total Recall instead.

B005KA188S|2.0|It is cliche but the original Fright Night (1985) is far superior. The remake isn't particularly scary or atmospheric and not all of the performances work. Fright Night is a dark vampire tale about a guy (Charley) who discovers his neighbor is a vampire. Colin Farrell's performance was good but we note many women like Chris Sarandon as well. The absolute worst character was Peter Vincent. David Tennant is miscast here and nowhere near as good as Roddy McDowall's performance. Peter Vincent, the vampire hunter, is reduced to a Vegas sideshow wearing a lot of fake makeup. Charley isn't nearly as charming here and his girlfriend is an absolute bag. Evil Ed wasn't the dedicated method actor from the original either. The movie isn't terrible but it grossed only half of its budget in the US which is always the kiss of death. The movie struggled to find its audience because it isn't scary enough for a horror movie nor does it have the charm of the original. The soundtrack and comedy don't quite blend the way they did in the 1985 version. I must admit horror-comedy is extremely hard to do but the original was rewarded with a Saturn Award for Best Horror. No notable awards were connected to the remake. The Blu-ray picture quality is average but the audio is very good. There is 26 minutes of total bonus content.

B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|* SPOILER WARNING *<br /><br />Overall I blame M. Night Shyamalan for this failed project. IMDB ratings show an astounding 4.8 where Evil Dead (remake) manages a 6.5. Wow. So if you were looking for a cool sci-fi movie with scares and action you might find this somewhat bland. This is no Alien. It is surreal, thudding and insomnia-curing at times. There isn't any other way to describe it because the performances are average, the dialogue is full of one-liners (when we hear it), the special effects are average and the story was below average. MNS fails to expand his premise in any meaningful way (a problem that has plagued him recently). Earth is now very dangerous and poisonous but must be traversed by the father and son team of The Smiths after their spaceship lands on Earth. Will and Jaden Smith are good but we don't see much of Will Smith. He is injured and unable to accompany his son for most of the movie. When Will Smith does get screen time (he is a supporting actor at best) he doesn't make the impact he could preferring to let Jaden take the spotlight. The focus on Jaden is OK but he can't do it all by himself with only the environment to interact with. The movie has surprisingly little mood which is normally the strength of the director. There isn't even much action to keep the story going. This is sci-fi/drama. It's just Jaden fighting creatures and getting hurt by nature itself. The Smiths will fight another day but MNS's career has been on the decline. Domestic gross, which is still a key benchmark for many studios, is about half of the budget. In America where you are expected to make your money back on day one (or the weekend if you're slow) then After Earth has bombed financially, critically and with audiences. For a much better Smith film, check out I Am Legend, Men in Black or Independence Day. Shyamalan's best film remains The Sixth Sense.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Subtitles/Captions: English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />After Earth gets 2-discs (Blu-ray / DVD + UV Digital Copy) in this release.

B00BEIYL6G|4.0|(The original title was \\"jOBS.\\") This bio-pic details the corporate life of Steve Jobs, the legendary entrepreneur who founded the Apple conglomerate. The more we scrutinize his life, the more we love him AND hate him.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Ashton Kutcher (\\"New Year's Eve\\") as Steve Jobs, college dropout, social misfit, brilliant strategist and ruthless businessman. This doesn't gloss over his personal failings or his intractability; it does touch on his lack of personal hygiene...smile...<br />  * Dermot Mulroney (\\"Jolene\\") is Mike Markkula, the first venture capitalist to take a chance on Jobs (please see my JayFlix.net review of \\"Something Ventured).<br />  * Josh Gad (\\"Love and Other Drugs\\") is Steve Wozniak, one of the original garage gang who shared Jobs' dream. His departure is wrenching.<br />  * Lukas Haas (\\"Lincoln\\" and he was the little Amish boy in \\"Witness\\") is Daniel Kottke, the long-time friend who did drugs with Jobs during their Reed College days and went to India with him.<br />  * Matthew Modine (\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\") is John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to bring a friendly face into the board room.<br />  * John Getz (\\"Blood Simple\\") is Paul, Steve's father, whose garage workroom they used to build their first 500 circuit boards.<br />  * J.K. Simmons (\\"The Words\\") one of Hollywood's premier utility players, portrays Arthur Rock, the practical rock in the path of our impractical protagonist.<br /><br />This is rated PG-13, so you can expect mild profanity and some drug use; but be prepared for a LOT of corporate shenanigans and power plays as Jobs is fired by his own hand-picked board. This does NOT probe into his foray into movie making (i.e. Pixar), his health problems, nor his marital situation. What DO we see is a brilliant, complex man portrayed by an actor who surprised me in every frame!

I was impressed with the manner Robert Mason told his story. I loved it as he commenced right back at his rookie days and early training, and his determination to make the helicopters. His operations in Vietnam are well related and kept me on the edge of my chair. and made me read more,. I could feel for him as the end of his operational period drew close, and wanting to complete his tour alive.Sadly many people on the home front don't appreciate or understand, what our people on active service are going through. I can recommend this book to anybody who loves military information.

B004132HZS|5.0|What can I say? Superb acting, writing, cinematography, editing, and music. Laugh-out-loud moments. Extremely attractive male leads. It is a television experience that is just plain enjoyable. Everyone I have showed this to, loved it.
140006922X|5.0|Riveting read. It may completely challenge what you have been taught and believe about Jesus as the Christ. The book paints a really good historical picture of the world in which Jesus lived,and what he may have really been about? Asks more questions than it can possibly answer though.

0786890932|4.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE PLOT & CHARACTERS<br /><br />A lot of reviewers on GoodReads seemed to dislike this novel because they saw the movie version first and were disappointed in the book. I in fact, saw the movie 'P.S. I Love You' before I read this. But I watched it years ago and really didn't remember that much of it. So I would probably recommend that readers either 1) read the book first then watch the movie or 2) watch the movie, wait a couple years so you barely remember what happened and then read the book.<br /><br />'P.S. I Love You' was incredibly depressing until a little over half way through. Holly was in deep grief, like 'didn't get out of the bed for days on end' part of grief for her late husband. If you have a significant other you will (or I'll be surprised if you don't) start to think what if you were in Holly's position. But, as I stated it gets better over time. Holly's grief lessens as she lets happiness and opportunities into her life.<br /><br />Something that I found kind of interesting and I might be alone on this one, was that I found most of the men in the novel to be horrible. Gerry was the exception, Ahern (or perhaps Holly?) painted a picture of Gerry as the ideal man, the perfect man, a Godlike man... Other men we encountered had their flaws.<br /><br />**SPOILERS START**<br /><br />Daniel sort of harassed Holly for a month because he was in love with her and wanted them to be together. When they finally see each other again at the end of the novel... Daniel had unexpectedly realized that he was still in love with his ex-girlfriend and was back with her. For the entire novel, Ahern wrote it like Daniel and Holly were going to get together, they didn't and frankly get a copped-out ending.<br /><br />Declan, Holly's younger brother, filmed Holly and her friends when they were drunk as skunks and submitted their adventure as a documentary in a contest. His documentary won and was televised all over Ireland. Holly and her friends were humiliated. Teenager Declan didn't really seem to care that he has mortified Holly, he just cared that he had won an award.<br /><br />Then there was Ciara's Australian boyfriend, Matthew. Ciara, Holly's wild younger sister, came back to Ireland from Australia because she had a fight and broke up with her boyfriend, Matthew. In the fight, Ciara suggested that she should 'just go back to Ireland and never come back' and Matthew responded that he'd be completely fine if she left and never returned. Ciara did go back to her family's home, expecting Matthew to call and apologize. Months go by and he never did. Ciara believed that Matthew was the love of her life and was intensely upset by their separation. Holly even suggested that perhaps it wasn't 'meant to be' between the two of them. However, at Ciara's birthday party, Matthew arrived and asked for forgiveness and of course Ciara accepted his apology. It might be just me, but if your boyfriend doesn't contact your for the better part of a year after a tiny fight, then why bother? Matthew the boyfriend didn't have any redeeming qualities besides the fact that he was Australian.<br /><br />**SPOILERS END**<br /><br />Overall, it was a really good book. Great characters, interesting story line. Did it make me want to read more from Ahern? Hmm... not at the moment. Maybe someday.friends were humiliated.

B009UX2YAC|2.0|This is a highly adicting game which is why I only rated it 2 stars instead of 5. I also think that thier only goal is to get you to buy stuff and buy more coins so that you can unlock stupid characters that don't change the game at all.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|it sucks becouse it takes forever to unlock someone in the game so don't play this stupid game ever in your life it stinks
1452000247|5.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale by William O`Brien<br />Reviewed by June Starrs<br />Rating 5 out of 5 *****<br /><br />I`m June, I was approached by William to do a review of Peter. How could I say no, I was already intrigued from the book`s cover picture.  I am not a fantasy writer or fantasy reader. I read romance and thrillers and write contemporary romance.  My chosen genre is far from William`s work. So, I took on the challenge and I am glad I did. Maybe I could read another genre after all. I know I could never write a fairytale, I will leave that one to William.<br /><br />A somewhat darkened tale leapt out on every turn of the page, deeper and deeper into a captivating spellbinding story about a little boy named Peter.<br /><br />Beautifully dedicated to nana and others who helped and inspired the author, you know this will be a promising read. The author`s childlike vision of the world is certainly evident throughout the book. There are places in the book I`d like to take a fantasy visit too myself, but other places, no way! Be warned.<br /><br />From the onset we meet Peter`s family and Mrs Kipple who owns a small shop. Peter loved to often explore the shop full of all kinds of interesting old bits and pieces. There are lots of areas to explore, things to open, to touch, to smell; the ideal playground for a young boy like Peter.  Peter is drawn to ornate boxes, he loves boxes.<br /><br />Peter is just turning ten years old and his real life at home and at school, as he had known it - changes.  He was drawn into unknown territory in a fairytale world. What did he purchase in the shop? Mrs Kibble has a Birthday surprise for him. What could this be?<br /><br />The author very effectively transitions into every opening chapter with a description of the setting. There are many scenes and fantasy tales throughout this book. The author uses all the senses to transport the reader to that exact place with Peter. I felt I was shadowing Peter on his journey. Wanting tohold his hand and guide him too. But, I couldn`t - this was all down to Peter.<br /><br />The author uses sentence structure well to engage the reader. Without giving away too much, I was struck by; the author writes, \\"The ____ you hold will allow your journey to begin, although it may not be as simple as you think.\\"  The item he holds is needed for his journey, he needs to treasure this and keep this safe; will he manage to do this?  The book is spiritual in parts, I love the passage the author writes; \\"Even in the darkest dark there could be light.\\"<br /><br />William`s many interesting human, animal and fantasy characters have been built strongly. Well described and thought out to fit their place in the story. I just love the idea of a spectacled, well dressed bird...that speaks. The names given for the fantasy characters I am sure will be cherished by a young person`s audience; that too of many an adult.<br /><br />Although a dark journey; this story is filled with wonder and magic. What are the odds of meeting a mushroom in a snowball with a warm personality? Reading the story I was thrilled to find out how fairy dust is made and what happens to our teeth when the tooth fairy takes them away and I am in my forties!<br /><br />Peter is an inquisitive, determined little character who has many obstacles to overcome. He finds love and friendships along the way; some are darkened untrustworthy friendships. Peter learns hard and has to think fast.<br />I found the last chapter emotional. I had stepped into Peter`s world for a while and wanted to be with him for a while longer.<br /><br />I am not a poet and I know it (Bet you haven`t heard that before) - William adds to this book a selection of short poems about the book. It is a lovely reminder of the characters and the fairytale within. I am sure readers and listeners would delight in this collection time and time again.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to young people with a higher level reading ability. Toparents, grand-parents, carers etc who would read this book to their child.<br />I would also recommend William to approach Primary School Key Stage 2 and High Schools Key Stage 3 (U.K) (If he has not already done so) This book would be ideal for the school`s library and to be read in small group work and as whole class work. I am confident that William`s book would be great to read in schools and to be reviewed as part of the curriculum by pupils.<br />I`m sure too that many an adult would take a delight in travelling with Peter through this delightful book.<br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Reviewed by June Starrs<br />Follow me if you like on -<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|The game itself is fantastic with great graphics and you can play with real people on Facebook. The bad part is you can only play a few games without having to pay. I would buy this game if it would be unlimited, but 2.99 only gives you about 15 hands, then you have to purchase again. They even had one set of tokens for 34.99 and even that wasn't unlimited! Seems pretty pricey for a card game. Yikes!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I admit I had read reviews on the book and on Sanberg's Ted talk. I noticed an interesting split - either it was loved or hated. I found her words insightful but did not see the unlikable powermonger Jewish b!tech slant I saw mentioned in a few negative reviews.....it only served to highlight the idea Sanberg mentioned about how a woman gains in power she becomes less likeable. A good wake up call to women to understand what affects and influences our thoughts and actions and take personal responsibility for what we want. We can choose the path (unconsciously or consciously) or it will be chosen for us. I prefer to choose or die trying. Thank you  Sheryl Sanberg for voicing what needs to be said.aa

B000FC12Z0|5.0|I love how the book kept you on your toes. I really like the way it ended though. You should read it to find out how killed Ratchett.

B004X2M9VY|5.0|By the end of last season, I thought Matt Smith’s portrayal of the Doctor was good.  By the end of Season 6, I thought he was FANTASTIC.  His humor and quirkiness really shines this season and the show’s excellent writers do a great job developing his character along with his companions, Amy Pond and Rory Williams.  In this season, Amy and Rory are already seasoned companions of the doctor so they are less naïve and contribute more to the Doctors’ endeavors.  I admit that I wasn't crazy about them last season but their character development this time around really made me care about them.<br /><br />As with the other seasons, there is an underlying plot throughout all of the episodes but this is probably the most intriguing one thus far since you see the Doctor die within the first 10 minutes of the first episode and watch Amy, Rory, and River spend the rest of the season trying to figure out how to prevent it.<br /><br />Notable episodes include “The Impossible Astronaut” which introduces a creepy alien race called the Silence; “The Doctor’s Wife” which is a strange but interesting love story between the Doctor and his TARDIS; “The Almost People” that shows the comical interaction between two Doctors; “The Girl Who Waited” which is very dramatic and emotional;  and the season’s epic conclusion “The Wedding of River Song”.<br /><br />Be sure not to miss the Christmas special that aired before this season (it’s included in the Matt Smith Specials).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictive... Makes you work your brain in a creative and fun way!! This is one app I would happily pay for!!! More rooms PLEASE... I'm already jonesing.... :(
B0093LINT2|2.0|This thing was a nice idea, but blue screens several times a day, even though we purchased all of the directly recommended components for it through amazon, of course it takes a while to discover this so it's now 34 days after we purchased it, 10 days after we set it up and we can't return it per Amazon.<br /><br />DONT BUY THIS ONE.....I was excited about possibilities, but they don't exist if it's not reliable.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|What was early in the book a paradoxical anti-rule designed to defeat flyers' attempts to get grounded on the basis of insanity -- you had to request it, and the request disproved insanity. What could be saner than wanting not to be killed? -- metastasizes by the end into the contemporary security state's motto: we have the right to do to you anything that you can't keep us from doing.
0525478817|5.0|I am not going to recap the story, because that has been done a thousand times- but I do want to express to you, the reader, the effects that this book had on me.<br /><br />I felt guilty after having listened to the audiobook version of this. The Fault In Our Stars is a book that deserves to be read and not just listened to. To take the side of Peter van Houten, we can get lost in the day-to-day mundanity of having all this information at our fingertips, that it is all readily accessible. In a way, it takes the romance out of the experience of this book. That is not to say that the audiobook version was bad, but quite the contrary. The narrator, Kate Rudd, did an outstanding job; she had the attitude and spunk of a teenage girl, but could also project emotions that made you cry. I mean this literally - not want to cry, but to actually breakdown and start crying.<br /><br />I can't quite explain to you how much I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the only way I know how to describe this is to let you know that this is my first review over a book. I have read through all of the Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow books, Game of Thrones, Divergent, Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Odd Thomas series, and several more that I can't think of right now. I read every book in all of those series, and loved every one of them. While I kept finding favorites among those series, this book tops them all. I have felt sad, and have laughed while reading books before but this was different. I don't know how to explain that after finishing the last of the book, I had a lump in my throat for at least 4 hours. Just recalling the book long enough to write this review has reformed the lump.<br /><br />The emotions in this book felt surreal, such that John Green knew exactly how to play me like an instrument - picking out individual notes that resonated within my innermost self. Do yourself a treat and read this book, you will not regret it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Probably The #1 free app. It's such a fun game for everyone on the go or even under your own roof. There are so many levels to play. Hours of fun for anytime anyone or anywhere. &sect;&szlig;
1250007208|4.0|Cinder started out a bit slow. It was hard to get past the futuristic remaking of a classic tale. Once I did (around chapters 3 or 4) it got very interesting and sucked me. I had a hard time putting it down. Great story line and writing. It did end rather ubruptly  and I was disappointed when I could not find a copy of the next book in the series on Amazon.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Cant say enough good things about this book.  I am a slow reader so it can take a while for me to get through a novel.  I read this book in just a few days, I was riveted.  I will not spoil any of the story for you but I will say that I was disappointed with one part of the story.  Anyone who reads it will probably have the same small gripe. This is an outstanding book regardless of the small flaw.
034580404X|5.0|These books were awesome!!! You can definitely feel each emotion from the characters.  There is a lot that happens and you must pay attention. I have read these books multiple times. Love them!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An epic sci-fi drama that is deep in character development.  I am not good at writing literary reviews but I can say that this series is by far one of the best I have read in a long time.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This app is so Awesome I have not seen anything like it. I will use this in school and let my friends use it to.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|What an enjoyable summer read. The characters and all the ways their lives intersect make this book a juicy little soap opera. It's been a while since I've read \\"one more chapter\\" all day and into the night; I will definitely be reading this author again.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good for when you're bored. Somewhat of a challenge. Took me about 30 minutes to solve all the levels.<br />Good game considering it was free.
B000J5XS3C|2.0|There are too many flaws for me to have actually kept this. I thought the first unit I bought was defective but after receiving and trying a second one I realized that this is how they were built. (1) There is no power switch and having to plug-in/remove the plug all the time gets pretty annoying. Not a deal breaker but not very intuitive or practical. (2) The indicator lights for the input levels don't work. If you put the input at ungodly levels you will get lights but they are completely inaccurate. (3) The headphone jack audio is completely muffled when the audio is fed back in from the computer. The best way to describe how terrible the audio is would be by placing a speaker under your bed and listening to your audio that way. This means anytime I record and want play back I have to switch to a different pair of headphones or switch jacks with the same headphones. All in all this doesn't cut it for me. Personally I think something else (comparable in price or even more) might be worth in the end. Unless I received two duds in a row expect these same issues if you plan to use this with the same application as me.<br /><br />On a good note when I was able to dial in the input levels the sound was pretty decent. As long as you don't need the headphones for playback through the mixer and you keep your input levels the same you should be just fine with this.
B006ICGH56|5.0|GREAT CHARACTERS, STORY, ACTING!  THIS IS THE FLICK THAT PUT RUSSELL  CROWE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE AND PROBABLY MADE HIS CAREER!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It is a fun game of uno! I think it'll be more fun when more of my friends start playing!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I would not sure I would be able to sit through this movie due to the subject matter.  I remember with horror watching the tsunami that hit Thailand.  This is well acted, the filming is superb, the story gripping and rather gruesome at times.  The young man who plays the oldest son, Lucas, does a tremendous job.  This is not just a story about the tsunami, but a story of a family.  The evolution of Lucas from a somewhat selfish young teenager to at times being in charge of helping his mother and the emotional and physical challenges he had.  How he at times was a scared little boy, then at times was emotionally and physically strong and took charge, to being selfish and then empathetic is a wonderful story.  Intense YES, but worth watching?  YES
B00171AN8K|5.0|Amazing music, not necesarrily great singing, but the lyrics are cool, the rock and irish punk mix is awesome and the guys are amazing. Love this band

B0034G4P4O|5.0|I have seen this movie three times since it came out. My siblings and I were introduced to Tintin as preteens when we lived overseas. My family's first official pet, a white toy poodle, was named after Snowy; Snowy passed away several years ago. When I first saw the character Snowy in the movie, it brought back some memories!<br /><br />I thought this was a great movie version of the comic books. Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Thompson & Thompson were perfectly portrayed! My sister-in-law who had never read the books was bothered by the Captain's drinking, but I knew that was just like his character in the book (Tintin's character does a good job of showing how he disapproves of this behavior during the course of the movie). In regards to the storyline, Tintin and his adventures are just that, they are adventures! There isn't some great moral or I would say a particular message that the comic books are trying to get across; they are just about a young man and his dog and the mysteries that they attempt to solve, the adventures that cross their paths. I think the movie does a perfect job of showing that.<br /><br />The movie is family friendly and would be appropriate across ages, but it does have more violence than most kids animated movies, because of the type of story that it is. It has a couple of mild swear words, but no inappropriate or dirty humor, keeping it just like the comics. As a fan of Tintin, I really think the movie was made for the fans, not necessarily as a kid movie, but probably to introduce new people (children) to Tintin. It may not have done a good job of that, but Tintin has been around for years, and has never become popular in the US. If you haven't read any of the comics, you should definitely try them. They are comics that I would want my children to grow up reading, good, clean mysteries, with an intelligent protagonist, trusty sidekick, and fun and interesting secondary characters.
1594202249|5.0|For some reason this book has been on my mind.  I read it several years ago when it first came out, and really liked it.  I have read pretty much all of Pynchon's work, and I want to make clear that I don't disagree with any of the negative reviews here.  But I was watching The Big Lebowski on cable the other day, and it struck me that this is cut from the same confusing, pot-driven, crime based view of California as that movie. The Dude reminded me of the detective here. My guess is that if you don't get The Big Lebowski, then you probably won't get this, either.  So, this is hardly a complete review, just a thought that crossed my mind, since both Inherent Vice and The Big Lebowski really stick with you, in their bizarre, fractured view of life.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book is well written and easy to read. It is very applicable to many of the scenarios encountered with typical IT teams today.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is a book you won't be able to put down.  It evokes so many emotions...anger, joy, sadness, hope, love, and the undeniable power of the human spirit.  It's a book that makes you want to live in Southport, NC!

B004ADH1RI|5.0|I loved revisiting The Goonies.  Fun characters and a strong forward moving plot. Just plain fun and adventure. I recommend The Goonies
B0028KF4M4|4.0|I enjoyed Season 3 and I'm a huge fan of Jimmy Smits but it wasn't my favorite season.  Nothing wrong with it and very watchable but a bit awkward at times.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I can't imagine watching the movie after reading this book. It was so good, I can't imagine what they could change and make it as good as the book!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I decided that a 5-star rating was the best recommendation I could give to people who enjoy Beach Boys songs, rather than reserving it for classics in the vein of &#34;Pet Sounds&#34; or &#34;Sgt Pepper&#34;.  If Twisted Sister is more your style, disregard it.  If you are a passing fan of the band, you will probably both be entertained and educated by the wide variety of songs on show.  If you are a lover of all things Beach Boys and keep a running debate on the quality of albums such as &#34;Holland&#34;, &#34;The Beach Boys&#34; and &#34;Sunflower&#34;, you may well be surprised.  Although the perfunctory performances of &#34;California Girls&#34;, &#34;Good Vibrations&#34;, &#34;Fun Fun Fun&#34;, &#34;Surfin' USA&#34; etc. are all present and correct, many long-forgotten album tracks and hidden gems from the '70s and '80s are also performed, as well as two new numbers from their 2012 release 'That's Why God Made the Radio'.<br /><br />How do the boys go?  It's pretty obvious that Brian, Al and Bruce aren't singing much of their own falsetto any more, but their ability to harmonise remains their greatest strength.  Mike Love takes the lion's share of the vocals - nothing much has changed there - but each member has the opportunity to lead; even David Marks is given leave to take Mike's part on &#34;Getcha Back&#34;.  They've even gone so far as to include &#34;Forever&#34; and &#34;God Only Knows&#34;, led by isolated vocals from Dennis and Carl respectively.  The only person who really takes much notice of their instrument is David Marks, who takes lead guitar on almost every song, but as he was never in the band to sing, this is forgivable.<br /><br />Is it a nostalgia fest?  If you were expecting anything else, then you don't appreciate the purpose of reunion concerts.  Nevertheless, they and their backing band (made up mostly by Brian's world-class support team) do our memories justice and, inevitably, have us singing along once more.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Why spend money on this game when u could spend hours doing something productive for society.  In my opinion this is a waste of time and money.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|SO much potential, but like many reviewers stated, it will NOT save. Serious bummer. Would give ZERO stars until this issue (which goes IGNORED by the developer!!!) is fixed.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moTNMGB0ISKOHM]]this might be the best product ever. i see some reviews that this stuff is no good. they must not be using it correctly. use as directed and you cant go wrong. i can finally wear all my favorite gloves again. used on astars, icon and others. used on the thumb and fore finger of 6 pairs of gloves and still some left in the bottle. so far after a couple weeks of regular use it still works great. only apply to the area of your fingers that actually touch the screen or you are just wasting it. it is a black liquid so if your gloves are any other color they will be black. i didn't care applied it my white Astars anyway. it says you need to reapply every couple months so i bought a couple bottles as back up.<br />* edit 8/16/13 I noticed a few people mention screensavers. I just wanted to point out I have a MiniGuard High Definition Screen Protector on a Samsung Galaxy Note with Alpinestars SMX-2 Air Carbon Gloves. I also noticed people say Any Glove was overpriced. 2 pairs of Astars and 1 pair of Segura gloves cost well over $200. Lets just say I had to reapply it every month (which I wont) a $20 bottle would last over a year. That is well worth the investment so I can wear my favorite gloves again.I would gladly put my treated gloves in a head to head test with my Icon pursuit touchscreen gloves.*
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is so fun I love it so much you should download it I rate it 5 star it can be tricky at some parts
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game and shooting varmits.  Though having trouble adding friends. Yet all in all an entertaining game. Lol
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome huge blessing for my life. helps me stay on track and facilitates my Bible reading.  and when I'm too busy to read I can hear it. while doing other tasks.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This series covers the reign of King Henry the VIII of England. It started out a little slow but after the first couple of shows things really get interesting and then you're addicted. After getting through season 1, it was basically all I watched through the end of season 4. Not something I would recommend for anyone under fifteen and even then it's a little much. Very good adult entertainment especially for anyone who enjoys the age of European kingdoms.
B001BC2ZS6|3.0|I feel this book was very well written until an abrupt ending. I feel there should have been a longer ending that at least explains the reason for the ending. Other than that, this book was written very well and had a very good sense of mystery. You could never put the book down because there are so many things u thought would happen next.<br />This book was quite short and easy to read. I would recommend this to anyone with not a lot of time or someone who is just reading for the sake of it and wants to read good classic to read this book.
B0030B621W|5.0|Great movie - full of suspense and mystery. It kept my attention perfectly and that's hard to do because I have ADD. :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I could not be happier with my purchase. Product was excellent, service was very quick and it was exactly what I expected at a great price.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|We weren't sure what to expect from this movie.  On the one hand, it looked like a Twilight knockoff with witches; but on the other, it had Jeremy Irons.  As it turned out, the movie was on the Jeremy Irons side.  I hate romance but loved the romance between the main characters.  They were both smart, weird, and just smarmy enough to make it totally enjoyable to watch.  The only reason I couldn't give it a full 5 was that it dragged towards the end quite a bit, and we didn't get as much of the smart-aleck quirkiness that we did in the first half of the movie.  Still, it was a great movie, and I'd really like to read the Caster Chronicles series now.
B00634GHJA|4.0|Cool app lots of good features some fun tools to play with nice user friendly app would recommended to friends
0812550706|5.0|As much as I don't tend to like political dramas (sci-fi or not), this book was super accessible and I could hardly put it down.  It was exciting, realistic, and heart-wrenching at times, watching everything Ender went through (socially, mentally, and physically) as well as his sister Valentine.  Every character was deeply explored to the point that I felt like I knew every one of them.  I got the feeling that the author didn't know how to write kids, but he got around this perfectly by writing children who are abnormally advanced and more adult-like than child-like.  I'm really, really excited for the movie now (trailer here: [...]
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I was very skeptically of this game because of the title and how it looked but decided to play it anyway. I am happy I did..great game.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I can't thank the author enough for bring this story to the written page. I never thought such an occurrence could've happened over the skies of Nazi Germany.
1400069289|5.0|A great book from end to end.  It is incredibly well written and full of useful information that is readily applicable to your own life.  It sheds light on every aspect of habits, how we form them and how to modify them.  Do yourself a favor and buy your copy today! :)
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I saw it at the theater.  To me, it was one of the best sci-fi I have seen.  I'll put it in the same category with Blade-Runner, The Matrix, Terminator and the likes.
B00CF0ETBE|5.0|In 1991, CD box sets were the music industry's newest fad.  The CD itself had been commercially available for just 8 years at that point, and the back catalogues of many great artists had either been rushed to market in the mid '80s with little thought for quality or had been sorely neglected.  This was the year the newly-rechristened Sony Music (resulting from the merger of CBS Records and their Japanese operation with Sony) launched the Legacy label in earnest; Warner Bros. bought the Rhino label and soon made it into their answer to Sony Legacy; and the late lamented PolyGram (bought up by Universal in 1999) launched its Chronicles label - all of this to the purpose of consolidating their back catalogues from the labels they owned or distributed and producing a new generation of digital remasters that sounded better and covered more ground.<br /><br />Atlantic, owned by Warner Music, had given us the first of several Led Zeppelin boxes the previous year; in 1991, they gave us Yes' Yesyears box and this set from Crosby, Stills & Nash.  As CSN's catalogue with Atlantic consisted of just 4 complete studio albums (Allies doesn't count, as it's a mix of live and studio tracks), plus 2 studio and 1 live album under the CSN&Y banner (with Neil Young, of course), this box had to be fleshed out with tracks from various solo albums from all three core members and also from the 3 studio albums by Crosby & Nash.  Also, many of these tracks were recorded for other labels (C&N did two LPs for ABC/MCA, Stills had 3 solo albums on Columbia, Crosby and Nash had one apiece on A&M and Capitol, respectively, along with the solo albums all 3 did for Atlantic), so there was much licensing to be done to make this a complete and comprehensive set.<br /><br />But what an amazing set it is!  I first bought this in the fall of 1991, shortly after its release, from one of my favourite record stores of the time, the sorely-missed Tower Records, and as I hadn't heard much of the material previously, this was a revelation.  Of course, the hits are present, many in their accustomed forms, but the first disc kicks off with an alternate recording of Stills' lyric tone poem to his one-time lover, Judy Collins (\\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\"), that actually features percussion prior to the final coda with the three harmonising \\"doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\\" while Stills sings a difficult-to-understand line about Cuba!  There are early recordings and demos to be had in great number - \\"You Don't Have to Cry\\" sung in a different key, Crosby's first attempt at \\"Guinnevere,\\" Crosby & Nash's previously unreleased cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"Urge for Going\\" - and the what-ifs later on - the CSN&Y versions of \\"Homeward Through the Haze\\" (recorded for the ultimately-scrapped 1974 album Human Highway, which would have been their best record ever, so the legend goes) and \\"Taken at All\\" (which ended up on Crosby & Nash's third studio album, Whistling Down the Wire, minus Stills and Young's contributions) - and a studio recording of \\"The Lee Shore,\\" a gorgeous Crosby ballad that only appeared on the 1971 live album 4-Way Street.  There are, of course, solo recordings - a few tracks from Crosby's 1971 album If I Could Only Remember My Name (\\"Laughing,\\" \\"I'd Swear There Was Somebody Here\\" [Croz' haunting tribute to his girlfriend Christine, killed in a car crash in 1969], and an alternate version of \\"Song With No Words (Tree With No Leaves)\\" featuring Nash), Nash's \\"Military Madness,\\" \\"Simple Man\\" and \\"I Used to Be a King\\" from Songs For Beginners, and a fair cross section of Stills' solo works (\\"Love the One You're With,\\" \\"Old Times Good Times\\" [featuring Jimi Hendrix, with whom Stills was close friends], \\"Change Partners,\\" \\"Johnny's Garden\\" and \\"Turn Back the Pages,\\" to name a few).<br /><br />While not everything in the CSN collective canon is completely wonderful, most of the embarrassments were kept away from this set; happily, it does represent this supergroupat their very best.  There is a booklet included with a decent essay (anyone needing more details can find the book \\"Crosby, Stills & Nash,\\" which will give you their history from the highest highs (the early meetings at Cass Elliott's house in Topanga Canyon that produced such magic) to the lowest lows (Crosby's addiction to freebase that put him in jail in Texas and very nearly ended his life) and everything in between), and notations from the lads themselves and many of their colleages on every track - Stephen Barncard, who engineered so many of their recordings, and Jerry Garcia, who added the famous pedal-steel licks on \\"Teach Your Children\\" and assisted Croz on IICORMN, add their observations.  And as this set was released in 1991, it only covers up to 1990's Live It Up album (also known as the \\"Hot Dogs on the Moon\\" album for the bizarre cover art); it closes, fittingly, on 1970's \\"Find the Cost of Freedom,\\" originally the B-side of the \\"Ohio\\" single and otherwise only available on the best-of set So Far.  Perhaps the greatest revelation is the uncut full-length take of \\"Almost Cut My Hair\\" from CSN&Y's Deja Vu album, which begins with a false start, Crosby's admonition \\"OK, not *quite* that slow!\\", and then continuing through a lengthy jam to a cold ending.<br /><br />As I say, this was the beginning of the Age of Box Sets, so we weren't yet to the point of oversaturation or newly-remastered versions of the original albums with bonus tracks added that were first issued here.  In 1991, this was a real treasure which gave me a greater love for the works of Crosby, Stills & Nash, along with a will to find all the vintage albums.  In 2013, it's an old friend welcomed back for a new generation.  Thank you, Atlantic, for giving this one a second wind!  (NB:  For anyone interested in the CSN antecedents, the long out-of-print Buffalo Springfield box is also making a return trip - due out in September - but I have not found on Amazon's US website, only on the UK site.  It, too, was an interesting set that will be nice to see on the shelves again, and Neil Young's Archives, Vol. 1: 1963-1972 makes a fine companion piece to both; I recommend it if you can find it, and it should still be available here.)at their very best.

B00AQO1VYY|5.0|What a great deluxe edition!! I love it!!!! I mean, I really, really love it!!! I love the dvds it comes with, also!
0385474547|2.0|this book was a complete waste of time. the only reason I read past the first ten pages is because it was a part of my summer reading for my AP Literature class. do not buy if you are looking for enjoyment while reading.
B0093QDGEO|5.0|This movie was entertaining and really funny. It is vulgar but hilarious. The cast was really good and the lines were funny.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Worth every single penny  if you like fantasy games this is the second best game you'll ever play. The first being minecraft
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Images randomly open sideways and can't be rotated. Can't go from an image to the program via the images &quot;share&quot; link the way you can with every other image editor, etc. It does have potential, though.
B003ZHVJFA|5.0|The scenes are money and the chicks are smokin' hot. Def a good buy for the price of admission.<br />Pleasant surprise!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|But end it already.  You know what is going to happen in the end, so stop adding so many twists and prolonging it.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|I started this book interested in the back story of one of my favorite bands for the last 30 years. I was surprised by the honesty of John's personal struggles that soon emerged from his meteoric rise to fame. I had no idea he was so naive, so unprepared, and so lost. This book is a fascinating story about a band, but more so about a man finding himself in the midst of unimaginable madness. It reads like fiction, made more poignant by the fact it was, and is, one man's very real life.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This was a decent movie for what it truly was: Summer Action Flick. It could have been better, but it also could have been worse. If you want a movie just to watch or have some background noise, then by all means pick this one up
B008D37J6O|1.0|I needed a player that would play m4v video. It would NOT play the m4v movie on my kindle. I have another player on my kindle which also does not work on m4v movies.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|If you are wanting a great plot, spectacular character development, and a....well this movie isn't that at all. This is your typical Arnold movie. Cheesy one liners prevail and the plot is simple. It is a formula that has made Schwarzenegger a very rich man.
B008OOYALE|3.0|was really happy with this on my iphone. I then lost my iphone and switched to playing on my kindle. after 4 months almost everything was available as before but still the spell shop and trading center don't work. on top of that the amount of food It takes to evolve dragons now is absurd. this isn't as fun for me anymore.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|Even the free game is fun!  Too cute!  My daughter plays it almost every day.  I recommend for any youngster.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I just played through to the end of the single player campaign using the kindle fire.  This is a great way to play some magic on the go.<br /><br />Positives:<br />- good to play on the bus<br />- nice introduction to a lot of newer cards<br />- draft is cool<br />- multiplayer seems like it could be fun (haven't tried it)<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- forgets my settings often<br />- forgets which character graphic I pick<br />- forgets that I played a creature with bloodlust<br />- forgets I kill creatures<br />- must be something that happens when the kindle goes to standby.<br />- easy to screw up searching for basic lands<br />- cpu rearranges attackers, easy to accidentally block the wrong creature if you are not watching closely<br />- auto order blockers didn't pick the enchanted creature out of two of the same blockers<br />- UI locked up when I destroyed one of 3 blockers and tried to select another card to cast during the same phase.  had to restart.<br />- unlocking one card per game is deathly slow, stinks of greed controlled game design.<br />- card selection interface is clunky.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|This movie kept me on edge and the twists are confusing. The futuristic atmosphere is always captivating. Just watch it!
0316044695|5.0|that the real story of this book was about Michael Murphy, also a SEAL, who was a member of the team that so valiantly lost his life in the fighting.  Michael posthumously was awarded the Medal of Honor.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This fits not only my Kindle, but also my cell phone and now my new tablet. It is sturdy and I'm sure it will last for years to come!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I enjoy the game. I have told other  friends, now they play too.  It is. Great. Try it you will like it.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|For a change the easy Sudoku can actually be done in less than 10 minutes and provides a sense of accomplishment.....makes you want to keep coming back for quickies...next I will move on the medium puzzles...
0439813786|5.0|Even though this is a children's book, I found it very engaging. The pictures were downright beautiful, and the story had a vintage style to it which I loved. The 500 + pages of mixed pictures and text really create magic with the vivid pictures giving you a sense of Paris and what Hugo was experiencing as he progresses through the story. If you have already seen the motion picture adaption, still pick up the book!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The movie itself is a classic hit which I have watched the DVD many times. The Blu-ray brings out much more beautiful details and colors. If you liked the new Cleopatra Blu-ray, you will also like this.
B000MR1V22|5.0|It was truly a dark comedy but it shows the reality with which we all live.  Loved it and will watch it again.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|A little different from the TV show that introduced me to Walt Longmire, but did enjoy Craig Johnsons style of writing.  Good story telling, almost like you are sitting there listening to someone spin the yarn.  I would not call this &#34;literature&#34; - just good, down to earth story telling from a writer who understands a story line with twists and great character development.  Will read more of Longmire mysteries - and continue to watch the show on TV.
B003719GGS|5.0|I bought this book with the hope of becoming a better husband and to understand my wife better. It was an excellent read and I learned a lot from it. I would highly recommend this to anyone in a serious relationship.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|A decent sudoku version and downloaded fine on Kindle Fire.  Nothing to write home about but a good distraction when needed.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I am not really a Brendan Fraser fan but he does a great job in this one.  I also loved Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek's characters.  They were a lot of fun.  It was just a good flick.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love it can't get enough!!!!!! I would buy again and again and again!!!!  Spider-man is great at beating up guys!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game!!! To many adds thought. Lots of fun!!! Wish you didn't need so much money to get things...I think the items should be less money and gems..but it's a fun game!!!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I love this charger its just like having your phone plugged in to a wall charger. I have a Galaxy S4 and charges no problem I have owned a few chargers from walgreens that died on me. But this is an amazing high quality product and would recommend to anyone. Also i havent tried charging two devices at the same time but i'm sure it could handle it. Its worth the money just wish the black one was available when i bought mine
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It was great it worked perfect but it was slow tho but I like it so...I guess it was AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B000GG4Y32|5.0|good sale
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a really good choice for me. I really enjoyed it. Romance novels are my favorite book to read
B005LAII44|1.0|I hated this movie and wish they hadn't bothered to make it. I would give it less starts but couldn't leave a review to warn others then. They kill off Channing Tatum  and didn't keep the other characters from the first movie. Bad bad bad. I can't say enough bad things about it to make you understand the depth of my disgust and disappointment.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great for the next one of of Narnia Narnia full full movie in the morning morning I was a a a KINDLE FIRE HD HD case case for the next next one one of the next one of the next next one of the next one of of Narnia Narnia full movie in the morning I was a KINDLE FIRE HD HD case for the next one.
0385474547|4.0|I haven't had time to read the book but look forward to reading it in the future. I'm not sure at this point what inspired me to order it but will be better able to make a review after I read it.
B008Y6YCB0|2.0|Movie takes a long time to develop.  Turned it off after about 30 minutes as everyone had already lost interest in it.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|It was a great show and the special adition comes in a cooler box. I bought this for my mom whos a big fan of the show and she was vary happy with it.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I am very pleased to be introduced to this genre and this first novel of the Harry Hole series. Reading Redbreast, the second one, now.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|While I was glad that I had rented this from Amazon instead of paying movie theater prices, I found myself really enjoying this movie. The cast is great, and there's a great mix of comedy and things exploding. This movie is worth renting and seeing, at least once.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic puzzles.  Not the usual repetitious puzzles of just finding the same objects.  Would like to find more like it.<br /><br />Klgroth
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the progressive and clever puzzles.  Not impossible but sufficiently challenging to keep it interesting.  Look forward to future levels.
B00AKFG15S|1.0|Jeffrey Archer is a very commercial author. I'm sure he plotted the ending first in the vain hope that the reader will want more of the same. A triology should have a proper ending!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I'm not crazy about self help type books, but this one was great!  I have been unhappy with my employment(even after obtaining a business degree...that has gotten me no where!) and have always hoped to do my own thing.  James Altucher's words are inspiring.  It was nice to read that I'm not alone in feeling the need to break away from the corporate world. I am comfortable with sitting at a desk, but there is no passion and the minimal pay is not worth it.  This book has helped me see that \\"anything\\" is possible, and I am now more motivated than ever to finally make a change.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Even with his degenerating health, I was more than happy to see that Sir Pratchett hasn't lost a step when it comes to the Discworld and Sam Vines et al.
1616551607|5.0|If you love Final Fantasy you'll definitely love this artbook. The quality of the book, pages, and artwork is beautiful. All the main art and concept art that never got released is really impressive. Overall, a great buy for any collector or lover of the Final Fantasy games.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a real fun game if you can AFFORD to play it. I was really disappointed that i couldn't really play but a very small amount of time before i would have had to use real money to play and its not worth it to me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is great, really like the review it has when making a mistake. Would definitely recommend this to friends..
B009CCBCU4|5.0|I devoured this first part in no time. Since I'm a Mexican myself, having studied until high school in Mexico City, I can follow this book very well and historically it is a little jewel of Mexican History.<br />The author is very well documented and her light and enveloping love story really makes you believe, you are in the middle of the Mexican temples, Palaces and markets. My 5 stars go to her just for being so entertaining and so true to the truth.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I've tried Google CSE, but found that Chrome is much better.. maybe I'm missing something but I'm so use to chrome and will stick to it.. sorry but it's hard to change your ways at me age..lol
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you like British TV, this is tops.  I recommend starting from season 1, however, as the story builds on itself.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Just a few words  on Shane, the blu-ray release. This is a classic western to begin with as most other reviews have pointed out. However this blu-ray release is simply perfect. PQ couldn't be any better. I have been to the Grand Teatons many times and its almost like being there. This movie is amazing on blu-ray. A must have for the lovers of the western genre
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so entertaining my 7 year old can't stop playing it.  He loves how every level poses new challenges.  My 2 year old simply loves seeing the minions in action as his brother plays.
B00011D1OA|4.0|This is a wonderful movie! I saw it while in High School. The Two-Disc Special Edition is worth the extra money. It has been beautifully restored and plays well on our DVD player. If you like classic musicals, then this will be a nice addition to your collection.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I've always been drawn to this time period as a major event in English history....HBO has pulled out all the stops for this series \\"The Tudors\\".  Production, creativity, costumes, writing....all well done. Even at times it may not be entirely accurate, it's still very engaging and entertaining...I watched all 3 seasons in a week due to being completely hooked.  In fact it's created a new interest in obtaining more information regarding the Tudors and the next generations following Henry's death. I'd like to see more cable series done in this format.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|The author has an exquisite talent for writing, the pace of the story is impeccable. I have read many highly acclaimed fantasy novels/series the past few years and this one stands head and shoulders above them, not only for the plot, but also (perhaps mainly) for the way the author draws you into the world he's created (from the very first page) and keeps you drooling for more throughout. I can unreservedly recommend this book to anybody who enjoys fantasy. If I had to pick other authors that have vaguely similar style to this, I'd say maybe Brandon Sanderson or Brent Weeks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't like many books. But I would read this book a million times over.<br />I would recommend by anyone who sees the world in a different view than most
1476734941|5.0|My husband and I are not overweight by much, but out clothes were getting tighter and even though we eat healthy and work out, portion control is our issue ( and snacking, sometimes). That ten pounds this decade (we are in our 50's) just seemed like it was there to stay. I read this on the plane on the way to vacation. I am not a person who likes to skip meals, but this seemed doable. I handed the book off to my husband, and as soon as he finished it, he said &#34;let's start&#34;&#34;. We are in the third week. I have lost 3-4 pounds, and he has lost 5-6. I am a college professor, not in the science field, but the research studies Michael cites are from legitimate universities.<br />  Weirdly enough, you do look forward to the low cal days! Not really a &#34;fast&#34;, because you get some breakfast and dinner.<br />  Some suggestions: Buy a food scale that weighs in both grams and ounces. There are many on Amazon. Also, I think you need to be a good eater and not binge like crazy on the normal days. I don't mean limit yourself, but if you are a compulsive overeater, this will not work for you. I had a few weekends where I had wine, dessert and a big dinner, but still dropped the weight. Finally, I have a hard time doing a strenuous workout on the &#34;fast&#34; days. I save those for the normal eating days. A light walk or bike ride is ok. Some people may be different.<br />  The thing about this is, you don't have to worry about what you are putting into your mouth every day! Yes, I go to bed hungry, but you begin to realize you are not going to perish, and you wake up the next morning not really that hungry! give it a try!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I first heard about this book on the National Public Radio. It starts off as a funny spoof of corny sci-fi TV series with an equally predictable plot, but then evolves into a complicated and emotional story that leaves you feeling inspired. The only thing that would make this better, in my opinion, would be more descriptions of the characters and settings in the first part of the book. Regardless, I finished the book in 5 hours because I couldn't put it down, and have recommended it to all my friends.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Lots of stuff gets destroyed but the plot is hardly enough to carry the action. Really just a bunch of shoot-em-up eye candy with a few jokes/references to the whole series. Worst of the series.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Humm...  let me see you got Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow & Hawkeye coming together to fight for a good cause.  The supporting cast is also great.  Over all just go see it, you won't be disappointed.  If you are well sorry.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is great! I suffer from a severe mental illness and was very much able to relate to the characters, but the best part is having my family watch to see a glimpse of my world.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable allows for a greater length for connecting my kindle. I have greater flexibility in where  and how I charge my Kindle.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|The concept of the movie, as far as the attack upon emotions by a drug empowered police state was pretty good. The acting was not too bad, even though it felt like the storyline was missing something. That something was development of characters - the audience is asked to care deeply about characters that have only barely been introduced. However, by far the biggest problem with the movie is that it is basically another V for Vendetta knock off. You take one side and paint the most grim and sadistic picture of it that you can and then you present it as the Christian Church. You then have a hero futuristic warrior with extraordinary skills go to wipe the \\"evil\\" regime out for the glory of the human race - for freedom. The evil guys in this movie are dubbed \\"clerics\\" in a system that represents itself with the Jerusalem cross and that is lead by a \\"father.\\" It left me realizing that the whole movie was just another propaganda piece against the Christian Church by Hollywood, and not even an original one at that. Of course, the irony is that the \\"church\\" in the movie stands for pretty much everything that Christianity is against. In reality, the search for a society without emotion comes from Greek philosophy - it is called Stoicism! In the end, this movie was just pathetic....
B004GK2B6Q|5.0|My boys read ALL 15 books, and were thrilled to learn it was a movie too!  They watched it 3 times, and said they loved it, 5 stars!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this photo editing app works very well. It is very intuitive and well thought out. It makes editing photos very easy.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Like the rating, it was ok and I am sure that Renner will grow into this role. The ending without a drought is what will make me watch the next Bourne Legacy or whatever it is called.
B005HSL626|2.0|I did not care for this game the skill level is below my standards.  May be good for young children.  I would not recommend for age groups that want to be challenged.
044022425X|4.0|I have read all of the Outlander books and have pre-ordered her next in the series. I love Diana's writing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A lot of fun and challenging day & night.  Can be enjoyed by all ages.  So much fun can be addictive.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Interesting story line to include some pretty typical sci-fi plot holes. Standard work for Mr. Cruise but a somewhat odd fish out of water appearance by Morgan Freeman.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Like this game, it challenged you to think about structure weakness in order to win at each level.  I would recommend for users of all ages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a great puzzle game its a combination of seek and find versus strategy.<br /> I just wish therewere more levels
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I enjoy this free pinball app and so did my family.  Fun for beginning pinball wizards.  I would recommend it.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Apart from some silly editing issues and repetitiveness of descriptions (i.e. how many times can a character look at another with a new respect etc)... the entire series is a MUST. Wow, what a story. I have read all 7 and i made myself sick from continuous reading. I simply could not stop and cannot wait for book 8. I think Morgan's writing in itself has a lot of room for improvement, but the story telling... just like her vampire journals/legacy... out of this world. Loved it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|lots of fun to play agaionst others and enjohy it each week when it comes out with a new tournament
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've heard Kite Runner is a great book. When I saw this one I got not knowing anything about it. Wow, what an amazing story teller! I enjoyed everything about it and will most likely read it again. Now off to get Kite Runner!
B0083Z614S|4.0|is a book that i have heard about for years, it is really for a younger group, but having not read it, i finally did as it was a free book. it was fun and glad now i know what everyone is talking about when they say The Secret Garden Book!!
B0073HNL3Q|3.0|I started reading this book intrigued by the premise in the description and thinking it could be something really different in the genre - someone who has died looking down from Heaven and finding ways to point the police to her killer, but ended up quite disappointed because it didn't offer what it promised.
0670026182|5.0|Absolutely beautiful book by the most talented Katie Quinn Davies. I first heard of Katie through her wonderful blog & was most excited to hear she was releasing her own book. I rarely purchase cook books these days as recipes are so easy to come by online - this book reminds me why I love books. Visually stunning, beautifully tactile and has Katie's touch all over it. The attention to detail is amazing. I am far from an accomplished cook which is why this book appeals. Recipes are fabulous - accessible & easy to prepare - and the photos genuinely inspire you to try new things. A must buy book & I hope there are more to come!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked it and so did my 11 year old son.  Tough enough to make you think - but not too tough.
B007REAIUE|5.0|Love the beats and melodies. Great cruising music or for just hanging out with friends.  Looking forward to more from him.
1576754227|2.0|There are many books which sell volumes.  Best-selling books can be best selling without new ideas.  This is not a book about new ideas, this book consolidates some simple steps on how to avoid procrastination and be more effective.  Nothing new on the ideas either.<br /><br />The problem I have with the book is I disagree with underlying thoughts and principles, such as<br /><br />1) only 2% of folks can work without supervision<br />2) email is not useful, and further, that 80% of email is a waste of time and can be deleted<br />3) make your work effective so that you can spend more time at home, enjoying.  work is like eating frog<br />4) focus on finishing the most important task BEFORE starting any other tasks<br /><br />And a few...<br /><br />To get more done in less time, this book can be finished by reviewing the chapter index and skip most part of it.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The app will not save photos. I have searched the phone. If they are saved, where are they? Using HTC Evo 4g
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's Facebook and it seems to work better than my mobile phone so.  Look forward to using the camera function for pics.
B005LAII4E|1.0|This was a really,really,really bad movie. I only gave it one star because it wouldn't let me put zero. They could have made a bunch of movies if they only had decent writing.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I like that it doesn't let you make a mistake; sometimes you need the extra brain boost. One of the better android versions.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|It's just a basic case for my Kindle Fire HD. It only fits the Kindle Fire HD 7in. Definitely does the job, and the look is standard black. Goes with everything.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it and sorry I have to wait for season 4.  Great cast, fast moving drama in a period that is my favorite....no cell phones or computers in any of the scenes, wonderful to see when people actually talked to one another and life was much slower.  Can't wait until season 4 begins!!!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|it is a hard puzzle but it keeps you thinking. I just keep trying . love it. bigger puzzles work easier.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I recently read the book and wanted to see if the movie versions held up. I watched this one first and the 1998 version second.I have to say this one was the better of the two. I thought it portrayed the characters more truthfully, despite what others have said.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|it's country from another country. These catchy folk tunes are what all the hipsters are into these days. While they aren't really breaking any new ground musically, they still do what they do well.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Movie starts off good, but at some point towards the end the story annoyingly leaves out important details about the the hell is going on. I had to do online research to figure out what the hell was going on. Turned out it's a pretty common search topic.
B00C061I3K|4.0|it still has those daft punk touches of electronic voices but it's very conceptual in nature, especially the tribute to giorgio moroder. It's mostly upbeat, dance-y, a bit trippy, a bit funky. If you are a fan of pop and dance you can't help but like this record.
B00DULWFZE|5.0|I love this album from start to finish. Glad to see all 5 input their creativity solely with no one telling them anything.  Creative control.  Bsb4lyfe
B00E8B1358|3.0|If you like studly men.. With muscles that go on forever... Man humor and lots of explosions then you will enjoy this movie. It's a sit back and enjoy the scenery kind of movie.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|One of the best documentaries I have seen, music or otherwise.  Disc one is so amazing, I have already watched it a dozen times.  I would pay twice the cost just for disc 1!!!  Disc two is not as great, but it is good to see some of the reunion footage.  Disc 3 the concert is concert footage which you could not see on showtime originally.  A great addition to the first two parts.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Action packed and very funny movie for parents and teenagers alike. Very good blending of real actors and special effects.
B008476HBM|5.0|The book may be 200 years old, but Jane Austen's sense of humor and understanding of human nature is timeless. The story is captivating, fast paced, and sprinkled with quotable nuggets of wisdom.
B000JIHP88|2.0|The mobile worked only a few times and then jammed and wouldn't turn unless i pushed it. Really disappointing as my baby hasn't been able to enjoy it.
B00846REIS|4.0|Not as edgy as Fifty Shades. Enjoyed the first and second parts in this story. The third installment not so much.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Mesmerized a room full of children and 3 adults.  Highly entertaining and enjoyable for all.  A must see for ages 5 and up.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Not as edgy as Fifty Shades. Enjoyed the first and second parts in this story. The third installment not so much.
B0027WGWQ0|5.0|this was an awesome story it tells you how you should and should not use rhe satisfaction of the good and the badof all thingsin life
B000065K6N|5.0|To me and my wife this is the best movie so far in the movies he has created so far. Very glad thw movie came fast and in the very good condition it was in. No complants for us.
B001UE27X8|5.0|Jazz was going through some tough times in the '70s and while Miles and Herbie went in the funk direction, Tony and Bill got together and showed why traditional jazz still had legs. Sadly, Bill was on the cusp of his final decline and I believe it shows in the second album recorded a year after the first one. But the first one is a treasure for the ages. Just sublime!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|What can i say but very good movie. I am very happy it came to me in a speady manner and in the condition it was described.
B001974DG0|5.0|A true classic in its own right.  Powerful. Worth rereading again and again.  Einstein lives on in every reader's heart.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this version of the bible, especially the audio part where I can listen and read at the same time.  I also love the different versions and they are easy to access.I would recommend it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I like the fact that I don't 'HAVE' to believe this and can prove it to myself. Pam's a good conversational writer.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|The book is not that bad but it is very to understand. Some parts you can't even understand at all.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My 3 year old is obsessed with dinosaurs. So we play this game together. He love collecting money and new dinosaurs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is epic get you mine &amp; craft on survival mode  you can get mods for this app and on creative mode you get unlimited stuff  you can play this when ever  you make your own world connect with friends you can play on realms it's fun it awesome<br />please get this app I promise it's a blast have fun and a nice day
B005L38QK2|5.0|My Razer Naga is in the trash after less than a year. Bought this  mouse and not going back !!  Love it
B000ID37RM|4.0|The acting style seems a bit dated given the age of the production, but it's one of those films that must be seen at least once---after having read the book, which, as is often the case, is better than the movie. We streamed it via Amazon's instant video. The visual and audio qualities were excellent.
B004Y1QKKK|5.0|excellent ! Very witty and intelligent He reminds me of Mark Twain and his observations of the society of his day. . .still relevant now.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is so much fun! Very addictive wish more of my friends were on it to play against them too!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is pretty entertaining. The puzzles are quit easy but it still gets you to think. It would be a lot more fun if this was more of a murder mystery type game. I still enjoy it though.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I am a big fan of mixes of the new and old, so the &#34;pop violin&#34; movement over the past few years had already caught my interest with groups like Escala and Bond. But both of these groups take a big back seat to Ms. Stirling. Her mix of electronica and violin is so spot on, so upbeat where it needs to be and downtempo where it makes sense, that I find the only additional thing I could ask for from this album is an additional 10 tracks!<br /><br />If you haven't already heard of Lindsey through her YouTube channel, I recommend you go over there now. And then come back and purchase this album. You won't be disappointed.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|Sudoku is always fun.  Though this app could be better.  The animation just slows down the time it takes to finish the game.  After you've completed a 1-9 strip or block, the animation kicks in.  You have to wait for it to complete before you can touch another square, but the time is still ticking away.  Also, after playing awhile, there seems to be a repeat in the algorithm.  I keep getting games where once I complete a series of 8, the number 2 starts to fit in.  Then there is always the trio of 3,4, and 6.  These three numbers seem to always come in group of row or column.  Over all, Sudoku is a good time waster.<br /><br />Update: Much faster with no animation option.<br />131219 - Update: Disabling the animation does make it faster, but this app keeps feezing up and crashing on my Galaxy Note N7000. Why does it need 100MB to run?  So I took it down to two stars.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I bought this watch (the first time) a couple months ago.  It came in a fancy blue box with easy start up instructions.  I set the watch to the correct time and went on my merry way.  I took the watch off to go to bed in which I dreamt about my new and beauteous watch kicking ass and taking names.  I woke up the next day, strapped my watch on and noticed that it was no longer ticking.  For some reason I shook it (like that would help anything), well lo and behold the watch started ticking like nothing was wrong.  The time was of course about 15 hours slow (just kidding I probably only sleep like 12 hours).  I don't know much about watches, but after reading the reviews about people saying that their watches, \\"ran a few minutes fast each week,\\" I figured that watches that only start after a flick of the wrist were probably not working properly.  Amazon replaced it very quickly, but the same problem happened with the second watch. I thought, \\"what a fluke, two watches with the same problem.\\" Amazon replaced it for a second time, again very quickly, and you've probably guessed it taking the tone of this review into account, the watch had the same problem.<br /><br />Now I haven't found any other reviews that say their watches are doing the same thing, but three different watches is enough for me.<br /><br />-Update- I know everyone was dying to hear from me again.  So I looked at more of the reviews and other people (1 star reviewers) seem to be having the same problem.  I gathered that the problem might be due to the fact that it is a mechanical watch and is not supposed to have a battery but instead uses energy from your body.  So it's a great watch if you want to wear it 24/7 and cross check it with another watch every hour or so.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a world where my wrist cannot be free and unhindered to do as it pleases for longer than 60 minutes.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Both of us thought it was a waste of $4.99!  Horrible, empty film with no story line.  It was also hard to follow. Thought it would never end!  Sadly it did nothing for the film that Tom Cruise & Morgan Freeman were in it.  Chimpanzees would have sufficed in the roles.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Just what I was looking for! Great for new players as well, the tutorial really helps you learn a lot!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Humor ( made me laugh out loud), and suspense, This one has it all !  Very current with today's world.<br />My favorite of the series, thus, far.
0452289963|5.0|I was a single mom working at a supermarket, the book was a birthday gift from a co-worker. At first reading it I was confused, then as I got to the middle I started understanding it more and more. At the end I had an epiphany, went to college, join a gym, I started living, dating enjoying life. Now I am happily married to a successful guy. It didn't all happen overnight, I worked hard, challenged myself, and now living a new happy life. Through my connection with God, my inner self, and the words and wisdom of this book, I've turn it all around.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Worth the buy. I love playing this song really loud.. feel good song. I am so glad lady gaga is back.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I finally got to see what all the hullabaloo is all about. After watching various scenes on You Tube, I got the dvd to watch the entire movie. It was like Glee, except there were no Glee recaps every 10 minutes after a commercial break. The singing was well done and the humor was enjoyable. This would make a great addition to any making music with their mouths kind of people.
B008476HBM|5.0|I really admire how the author made this  romance novel so innocent and intelligent. I have read contemporary stories that were set in this time period but not half so interesting. The verbal banter is extraordinary, and the title is so fitting. A must read!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I grew up watching and enjoying this movie every Christmas as a child. I'm in my late 20's now and still enjoy it just as much now as I did back then, so I finally decided to upgraded from VHS to DVD. After reading so many bad reviews about the DVD and Bluray versions, I was kind of worried about what I was going to receive. The DVD came today in the mail, so I decided to preview it before I watch it this Christmas. To me the picture looks fine, even though a lot of people complained that the sides were cut. And yes, the widescreen version does not include the song \\"When Love is Gone\\", but to me that is a plus. I always thought that part was slow and boring and would fast forward it anyway. To me this is still one of my favorite Christmas movies and I look forward to continuing the tradition of watching it for years to come!
0345535421|3.0|I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO FAR, BUT CAN ANYONE ELSE CONFIRM THAT THIS EDITION OF CLASH OF KINGS STOPS AT PAGE 648 AND JUMPS TO 713 WITH NOTHING IN BETWEEN. I HAVE JUST COME UPON THIS WHILE READING IN MY HAMMOCK.... KIND OF CONFUSED HOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD GET PAST ANYONE? ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS IN THE BOOK THEY ORDERED FROM AMAZON<br /><br />THANKS...;)<br /><br />NEAL FROM NASHVILLE / ASHEVILLE
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great basic calculator that does all of the functions I ever need to do. The screen is big and clear. Perfect!!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love this game, but it's a little heart breaking that I can only play two games in 45 minutes because I have to wait for another scratcher ticket. It sometimes freezes or says my game is no longer available and it still takes my coin.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|What was exactly as I expected since I knew the songs, thank you. Writing reviews for things like this often seems pointless it should be optional to give more than a tar rating.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Excellent adaptation of the book, in a more modern set, a must see, cant wait for the next season! !!!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This season's plot line is tied together very well and the introduction of Matt Smith as the Doctor and Karen Gillan as his companion were great choices.
0553386697|5.0|After attending a recent training seminar given by Tina in an overseas location, we decided to read further on what Tina was propagating that evening! So after we bought it from Amazon, we delved right into it!<br /><br />It is so easy to read and yet the truth of the matter is, we often as parents may sometimes react to our baby/children instinctively instead of using our \\"higher\\" brain. We ourselves felt what an enlightenment after reading the book and learnt a lot from it. We also felt we have had the opportunity to understand ourselves better!<br /><br />Strongly recommend this book to all parents & parents to be. :) Enjoy!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I love donna! She's so much fun and really pushes the Doctor outside of his comfort zone. They sure know how to write final episodes.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Thus was a book that from the beginning I knew I wouldn't be able to stop until I got to the end.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|This is not your average apocalyptic, vampire or zombie movie.<br />I had to add this to my collection of good &#34;Horror&#34; movies.<br />The characters are believable.<br />The story is quite unique & you will find yourself getting into this movie<br />from start to finish.<br />I won't give away the story line here,but my favorite character is &#34;Mister&#34;.<br />He is someone you would want around in any scary situation! LOL!<br />Enjoy!. Dee
0763660531|5.0|Each page is like a script of a timeless play, in which each word is carefully chosen and there is not one superfluous pen-stroke.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Certainly the star studded cast attracted me as did the landscape of scouting of baseball prospects. The characters were fascinating with Eastwood and Adams dealing with a not uncommon disconnect between elderly father and successful job obsessed daughter. Baseball provides a splendid backdrop for the main plot hook of the father/daughter dilemma. Timberlake as the love interest is compelling although appears a little too young for Adam's character. A happy ending helped! Look, this movie is not about brain surgery but it is a feel good little movie with no aliens, explosions, or saving the planet. No unnecessary graphic sex, gunplay or violence. It's a story of real people ala Woody Allen, and I wish there were more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. I can create anything I can think of. I would recommend Minecraft to all gamers. I just can't stop playing it. It provides hours of fun. Just don't let the creeper kill you. They get you when you least expect it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It was recommended by a friend, and I am so glad I gave it a chance.  Great television! Love Alicia and Peter.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Didn't think I wanted to watch another lawyer show. But I watched a couple of episodes and got hooked right away. Love the cast and the story lines. Surprisingly good show. Highly recommend.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I cannot get the app to save on Samsung S3 from T-Mobile. I've tried many different ways even playing with different resolutions. Save just doesn't work.<br /><br />It's a shame because this app has a great interface and nice capabilities. I will change my rating if this issue can be fixed.
0061122416|5.0|Starting with a prologue that by itself makes getting the book worth it Paulo Coelho never lets up.  The symbolism throughout the book echoes great literature.  From desperation for food and water to the mindful wisdom on thoughts of change we are reminded how our humanness rocks with the rhythm of nature. Aside from the soul bearing ideas of Personal Legends and the Elixir of Life the story's primary character's sojourn of experiences makes for a fun read. Yes, home is where the heart is. Dare we ask for more.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This movie is a great sci-fi flick with a decent, not too overdone plot and a very good cast.  It suffers perhaps only from relying too heavily on its impressive visuals and less with the human element, and sadly it also includes a few gaping plot holes or unexplained elements that could have been easily been battered down with an additional rewrite.  The action is good, and it has a unique style.  I enjoyed it in spite of the flaws I alluded to.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I enjoy the writing, the cast, the production values.  I think it is good entertainment and keeps me interested.<br /><br />I recommend it to everyone I talk to about television.  Thank goodness for streaming or I would have missed the great first season.<br /><br />On to Season 2!

B006T9Y278|5.0|This is par none my favorite movie. Very few movies can make you feel so many epically raw emotions. Winds the audience through this labyrinth of drama beautifully
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Are you tired of Skynyrd's (the current carnation of them) lame output in the last 15 years? Then let 'em go, and grab ahold of these guys! Charlie Starr and co. of Blackberry Smoke play music and write songs like the OLD Skynyrd of the '70's! This is REALLY what southern rock is all about! Twin guitars, honky-tonk piano, a solid rhythm section, and Charlie's southern-soaked vocals are kicking some serious butt and taking names...including mine! lol  These guys rock it up, but they actually (and easily) slip to more of a country sound here and there with great harmonies and all...and there's nothing wrong with that, because they hearken back to REAL country, not the rap/metal-infected garbage you hear on country radio these days. I highly recommend this album and their previous effort, Little Taste of Dixie. Both albums are solid throughout, with great playing and great songs! Actually, if you're looking for long jams like the Allman Brothers are known for, you won't find them here, as the songs are their main focus. In concert, though, these guys jam, for sure, so check 'em out when they come around!<br /><br />In addition to catchy melodies and solid, guitar-heavy music, the lyrics in Blackberry Smoke's songs are fantastic!...not the same 'ol fist in the air \\"I'm a redneck and proud of it!\\" themes that you hear too much of in crappy country music these days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for southern rock fans!!
B009MVM09W|5.0|One of my all time fav's!! Yes yep yessir-e bob Oscar worthy at every turn  Too cool for words. hula hoop.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome when you can go into your friend's world with WiFi access.<br />If you go into survival and change the difficulty it will take away all the monsters.<br />You will regenerate your health Hearts.If you can,make a trap to catch the<br />Monsters. There is no blood or bad language. It's good for 8 or older.<br />You can still die if you go too far in the ground and fall in creative mode.<br />Really great game if you ask me.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Excellent book that is vintage Crichton.  A not implausible scenario, with scenes ready for the big screen. Reading it as an e book I found myself using the Kindle 's dictionary features for his descriptions of plants and animals . Enjoyable and sad to think the man will not be providing us us with  further  adventures.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|A favorite movie of mine growing up and finally sat down with my daughter and let her watch it.  She didn't think she was going to like it but ended up really enjoying it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really enjoy Temple Run 2.  The game is addicting and the addition of challenges was genius.  However with most recent update now ads pop up after each run.  This is annoying and disrupts the flow of the game.  Would be a 5 star review if not for that.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This follow up book to the Secret really makes it come together. Gratitude has always been the key, but this book makes it easy to either start or grow your gratitude practice and experience the truly amazing results.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is a really really really good time killer. Like any other game it gets harder as you play it.
B000FC1HBY|1.0|The criticism about the last Harry Potter book fits this series better--camping across fictional Eurasia(?)  Boring, Boring, BORING! A , but not a good one.gift
B008HK3XYK|5.0|So far she says it works great. She rides the bus (30 + minutes) into work everyday and she has no complaints.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the acting. Wish they would.ve kept some key characters that were lost, but that seems to be part of the the storylines.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Oh my goodness I love this  game it is so fun I could play for hours and it is also cute because it is inspired about the little minions
B001UU75WK|5.0|I had never heard of Fringe, but after canceling cable in favor of streaming devices, I have had to expand my horizons in order to avoid boredom. Long story short, I am addicted to this show. I love the characters, the concepts, the plot-and plot twists...but most of all...I LOVE Walter Bishop (and equally dislike Walternate). I am nearing the end of season 4, and hate knowing the finale is around the corner. These are characters and relationships that I will truly miss.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like it its a fun game that they need to make more of I love being able to control your own town like the Simpson's tapped out and when these games are free you really need to get it.
B0062LU85S|5.0|I was familiar with a few of the songs from the soundtrack, but I was pleasantly suprised to find that I enjoyed the entire album.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is extremely entertaining for anyone who loves minions. the mini games can be a bit confusing but as a whole the game is really fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a way fun game, it's very addicting and hard to put down, I find myself saying one more time more than once! Suitable for kids and adults alike.
B0045QE3GM|1.0|I believe Roxy Music was pure genius, and loved Ferry's early stuff.  But this was just c###.  Iit is OVERPRODUCED, OVERLY &#34;SLICK,&#34; and artistically lazy coming from someone like Ferry.
0345803485|1.0|I wish I could UNREAD the few chapters I did force myself to read.  The absolutely most atrocious writing EVER... and I am a huge fan of apocalyptic literature which can get pretty awful.<br /><br />Do not,  for the love of GOD,  make this horrible mess into movies!!!  UNLESS the movies can be better and more believable than the books.<br /><br />These books are an embarrassment to the people who live this Lifestyle.  Those who embrace the M/s D/s lifestyle are far more sophisticated and honest about their needs and expectations. These books make a very serious and binding relationship to many people and make them look frivolous and foolish. Write what you KNOW not what a misguided imagination thinks up.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game is ok but can't look for a lot of help still play it cause I can't find any other games I like to down load.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|The movie was great until the part when the boys were turned into donkeys.  The boys were nervous and anxious about what was happening.  Lods need to be 7 or older in my opinion.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|i love this app so much it is amazing I love the riddles and how challeinging it all is so coolio
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book because I could participate in experiments that actually made a difference in my life.  It was uplifting, practical and very inspirational.  One of my favorite readings!!!!
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Not a bad song on this Cd.  Can't wait for the new one to come out.  Going to see them live in October.
B0093SSNQ8|1.0|I want a part of my life back.  As soon as it started I thought it was over because all the credits are at the beginning.  They must have known most people wouldn't finish watching the whole movie.  Did people actually get money for this garbage?  Bottom line: This movie really sucks.
1603429999|4.0|My wife is the knitter and I purchased it for her.  When she gets stymied in her circular knitting, it has helped.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a nice &#34;feel good&#34; movie. I liked it a lot.<br />A movie you could watch as a family.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This app is useless. No help what so ever.  Not worth the time to down load. Save yourself the time
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|great story line and a shocker towards the end.  Never expected it to evolve like it did.  Super entertaining, especially if you like SciFi
B007FEFLTO|3.0|His writing style seems to have become more direct, simple. I used to like his books a lot more. I'm not sure if it's his books have changed or if my taste in books has changed. For such a long book, character development could be limited. I enjoyed the Pillars of the Earth series much better.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I used this sharpener on my Bear Grylls serrated and fine knife and I managed to get it sharpened in a matter of minutes. This product is cheap, useful, and preforms as it is advertised.
B005544TRQ|3.0|Its so so, Just a bunch of egos getting in the way of each other. Lame and typical law office crap.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Watched this with my 4 year old.  I was putzing around the house doing other things and then found myself parked on the couch watching it.  It was catchy, the characters were very appealing and the movie really didn't take itself too seriously.  My daughter has now watched this movie at least a dozen times and has the music memorized.  I love that it has such an affect on her.  She also has a lot of the choreography down.  The HSM movies were difficult for me to watch.  So hokey and over the top sugary sweet.  This one was cute, light, catchy, and surprisingly entertaining for a four year old and a 42 year old.  The choreography is really impressive.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Great for kids to learn on and does not cost to play with in app purchasing a big plus does not need the internet. Works great on both kindle and kindle hd.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Loved this book! Great follow up to If I Stay.  Good to know how the story ended for Mia and Adam.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is way better than the first one to me because you are actually being chased by a monster otherwise the first one you are being chased by men that is why I love this game.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I would recommend this cd to all types of music lovers! it's very enjoyable for all!<br />very original and a little bit different from everything you here anymore. phillip Phillips is a true natural!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I go through episodes like candy. Awesome drama and good actors. Especially surprised by Michael j Fox. Love it and recommend it
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|This is sheer entertainment clothing the sad demise of Sound City. A bittersweet account done so amazingly well that holds you: glued to your seat.
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|A feature-length \\"glee\\" with less drama and more humor. Light entertainment and some fun music.  It won't change your life but it will keep you entertained!
B005LAII12|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone. It was a gift and got here a little late but that was FEDEX's fault.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|great movie, great picture, shipped quickly, great deal, If you consider yourself an action movie or comic book fan then you have to own this in 3D.
B000I3PERS|5.0|Really well done in all ways! really got me fired up and Ive seen it 100 times! One of my favorite of all times.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Well my parents were a little iffy at first but then then they saw how much fun I was having with it and they said I can online and play with other people since there is no chat just messages
0316247545|5.0|I have to say I am very impressed with this little book! It's informative, well-made, and looks good on any shelf.<br /><br />First, I have to give props to the guys at Little, Brown and Company for making the book look so much like something you'd find at Twilight's library. The entire cover is exquisitely detailed with ornamented gold and jewels, not real or metallic of course, but still quite beautiful. Also, inside the cover is a broad spectrum of quotes taken out of the show, from the Mane Six to the Cutie Mark Crusaders and even a few background ponies. It was something I wasn't expecting, but was thrilled to see. The feel of it being a genuine Equestrian book is not limited to the cover. The book has a distinct feel of wanting to hide the fact that it's a human book, which is pretty cool when even Star Wars books feel like they were made on earth most of the time.<br /><br />The sections in the book are well written and concise, so don't expect three or four pages detailing each character. But they provide a nice character sketch for the Mane Six, the Princesses, and many background ponies. Derpy is of course ignored completely except for a single image of her napping on a cloud, but that's not really an issue to me. Other sections include information dealing with the series' antagonists, as well as locations in Equestria.<br /><br />A good chunk of the book is taken up by the episode synopses. I kind of appreciate this, as it is a nice little guide for people who are generally unfamiliar with the show. I can just flip to a section in the book when I'm showing the series to a newbie and they can quickly choose an episode that suits them. But for veteran fans like me, it's more or less wasted space. I still like to read the synopses once in a while, but they're not my main focus.<br /><br />The next section of the book is a section of song lyrics. This is a good thing for me, as I love to sing the songs and the lyrics are a big help in memorizing the many songs in the series. A small nitpick I have is that the spoken and sung parts of some songs are not separated, which can be confusing.<br /><br />The last section is small, but significant in my mind, in that it is basically a shout-out and thank you to the bronies for being such loyal fans. One thing that I love about Hasbro and The Hub is that they really embraced the fandom and try to make the show for us as well as for little girls, and this is just one more reminder of what an awesome and rare privilege we have.<br /><br />Finally, the book is littered with little tidbits and behind-the-scenes information, including several whole pages written by the cast and crew. This will be the biggest draw for fans of the show, and it is fun to read what goes through the minds of the creative teams responsible for putting together this awesome show as well as see a lot of never-released concept and pre-production art.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'd buy this book again if I had the chance. I don't think it's worth the asking price, but if you can get a deal on it, go for it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minoin Rush is the best game ever!!! i love the rush that goes over you when your going at full speed. this is a must have game for all ages. you experience despicable me 2 through the entire game. you really get to ezperience the movie in a amazing game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just needs more floors. Like this is something I could do all night. Love problem solving. Please add  a lot more floors.
B005H9B44A|4.0|A must see before watching the Avengers!!Solid script and great special effects.Watch this movie in 3D for a thrilling ride.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have played several puzzles but this one kept me wanting more rooms....I hated when it came to an end. Looking forward to more of The Room in the future.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Written in futuristic, what might be or what could happen, terms, this book was an awesome lesson in being grateful for what we enjoy in the her and now!  Excellent story plot, character development, and theme, this book was recommended to me by my granddaughter and I highly recommend it for any age group 8 years and up. Younger children that have difficulty with abstract thought may not understand the style in which it is written.  A MUST READ for old and young alike!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is so fun! If you like a good challenge, go for this app. Great pass time activity for all ages
0425263924|3.0|I wasn't so impressed with this book.  I did have to read it to find out what happened to Gideon and Eva, but I was all the way into Chapter 13 and nothing much was going on.  I found it a little boring and slow.  It wasn't terrible, I do love the love story between the two, but I thought it could have moved a little faster.  If you're a fan of the first two books in this series, you will find it to be okay, not great, but worth the read.
B0036FYO12|4.0|This movie has a fast moving plot and a surprise twist at the end.  We enjoyed it.  Had read the book
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I loved this documentary. If you love good music, check it out. So very cool. The soundtrack is awesome too.
0425252868|5.0|While this in not the kind of book that I normally read, I read the book because it was highly recommended.  I will have to say that shortly after getting into the book, I found it very difficult to put down. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a father, grandfather, uncle that flew in the European and North African theaters of WWII. For that matter all of could stand to gain some insight into the minds and hearts of these men who flew as allies and advisories in the skies of Western Europe and North Africa. It explains to me a lot about the band of brother attitude that I saw from my father and uncles (all flew in WWII).  Excellent book.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It's an OK app, but when I try to look at a popular video, it just says that it may take a while and loads forever and ever. In fact, the video never even shows up, it just plays the audio while the ads are there in the middle of the screen. Also,the audio never stops playing even if I go on something else until it's done. And while I know I'm asking a lot, please forgive me, I have a slight OCD, the quality is way better than if you're on Youtube on the web on the Kindle, but I'm sure you can get that quality that's 1080p or however you're supposed to write it. I would love to love it, you just need to fix some things and I will.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|I am enjoying the plot and storyline so far.  They have us very enthralled!  Looking forward to watching more!  Loving it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was pretty flawlessly written with no holes in the story line.  It was hard for me to predict what the next twist in the story was going to be.  To read about someone being so malicious, manipulative, and cunning was fascinating.  And to read how it ended was just a big wow for me.  I hear that it may become a movie in the future; that would be awesome as long as the production is as close to flawless as this book.  It is an easy read, as well.  An average to expert reader should be able to blow through this one fairly quick because it is a page turner.  It's hard to write a review without giving away the plot, so I'll end here.
0375812024|4.0|Cute product. Have always loved Richard Scarry, and my son gets a kick out of the ending with the balloon landing on everything.  Fun reading with your toddler, especially if they are into vehicles!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this is my favorite book of all time. I don't know how to explain it, but I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My kids love this--great to pull out when you need a few minutes of quiet ditracted time, like at the doctor's office or when you're on the phone!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not bad.  Keeps you interested.  I really like G5 games.  My only complaint is needing to buy energy, other than that I'm enjoying it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Felt like your living in the period. A more logical biblical explanation of the time.<br />His knowledge of history is remarkable.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Was working great now takes forever to load the pics. Only loads correct when connected to WiFi. Please fix this
B00296A4F4|5.0|Go away sue. It must have been a blast to be a part of Glee. First episode in season five will be a tear jerker.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like app. It gives weather information right when I need it.  I can plan my bike rides and other outside activities.  I like the map, the way it can show the bad weather that coming to your area.  The only thing missing is the radar part, they used to have this.  They should bring it back.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|This book captured my attention from the start. My only complaint was the ending.....it left me wanting more! He develops his characters so beautifully and then brings them together.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|It's Harry Potter.  Well made flight of fancy.  Looking for a deeper issue?  Light up Discovery or History or Bio.  This is strictly entertainment and it does it very, very well!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game there is, fun for all ages. You can play with your Facebook friends, and make new friends. If you like bingo game you will love bingo blitz!!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|As always, left me wishing it wasn't over. Loved Jack in a team!  Going to download the next one now.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am amazed at how quickly it charges my Kindle ,I can get ready for bed  and it charges after playing most of the night
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|O.M.G. as they say...this is the next best thing after &#34;WTC=World Trade Center&#34; and &#34;Flight 93/United 93. Long movie but packed with a lot of information. I teared up at the end of the movie for multiple reasons 1)Tears of sadness that all of those innocent people had to die. 2)SUPER happy when the body bag revealed U/OBL (Usama/Osama Bin Ladin) for the last time. If I could rate more than 5 stars i would...trust me.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This is the best document editor app I've ever used, and it is free to boot. I've had great experiences using it on both my Kindle and on my phone.
B000YAG00A|5.0|Since the late 90's, when I was in High School, I have been told that this movie is a must watch and that this is the movie they make fresh recruits watch before entering the Marines...supposedly. I like it ;-)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is amazingly awesome I really like this series I would recommend this to people who are looking for a good series to read
B002ZG99QS|5.0|After watching the first one, &#34;Tron&#34;, the 2nd installment in the saga was really good, special effects were as well really good and it is much enjoyable.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Expectations must be tempered ten years later, just as in life the emotions and experiences of a love that occurs ten years after a discontinued first love are more cautious and demure than than the heady feelings and wild abandon of first love.  Yossi represents these changes with finesse, from the slightly chubby body changes to the tempered expectations, internalized expression of emotion and inhibitations in his relations with all whom he comes across in work and life.  Eytan Fox was masterful in bringing the myriad nuances of this complex and disillusioned character to the big screen.  Unless you know you only appreciate movies with loud explosions and climactic violence, this film is highly recommended for people who saw Yossi & Jagger first and loved it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Excellent! I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Can't wait to see what happens next! Truly a wonderful read!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is one of my favorites. It is packed with action. It has a great story line. But they could have made it a little more easier for solo players
B0012GMUPO|5.0|Another man trash is another man's treasure sure relates to Alice Cooper's cd TRASH. Each song is a jewel of a hit SPARK IN THE DARK AND HOUSE OF FIRE will set your heart on fire to hear these rocking songs. BED OF NAILS AND THIS MANIAC IS IN  LOVE WITH YOU will grip your heart as well because these songs are so rocking. ONLY MY HEART TALKING AND HELL IS LIVING WITHOUT YOU are heartfelt ballads that you will love to sing to. So buy this treasure chest of hits and enjoy this rocking  experience yourself.
B00DHHFKE4|2.0|I watched the movie on Netflix, and loved the story part. The story pulls you in and gives you a look at prison life. The sex life just is not my life style.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I never thought I would finish the  book. HUGO's language so formal, French words or phrases I did not know. Sometimes the word was so ancient it was not in the dictionary. I know the story from the musicals on stage, and movies. But here I am at the end.  Mr. HUGO GRABBED me with his eloquence and did not let go. I especially loved his description of the transitions from the Dark ages to enlightenment, starting with Napoleon loosing Waterloo. The universe felt it was time to change from despots to democrats. How ageless. We struggle today with the same issue moving forward some but so far to travel to reach the goal.
B004478GN8|5.0|This comes with some really cool soldiers, good weapons, and every kid that's played with it has loved it. My test is whether kids try to take it home - and they all have with this. So it's good. I'll need another one soon as the men continue to mysteriously disappear.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun but gets hard(fast-paced) pretty quickly.  It takes a long time to earn enough bananas to upgrade your minion unless you are willing to buy them.  The kids enjoy it, and it's easy to pick up.
B00ABXA1HI|2.0|So it probably does Remote Desktop well, but even my iPhone capitalized RD for me illustrating it as a proper name alluding to the Microsoft Remote Desktop. You need splashtop loaded on your computer to get this to work, which is not Remote Desktop. It may work with their server software but I'd rather use MS RD.
B006M4F67A|3.0|No real bells or whistles hehe - just a nice way to spend a few moments with an easy on the eyes app.
B0085A9J18|5.0|The Raid stands in defiance of the American action film<br /><br />While most of our action films either feature superheros in front of a green screen, actors who don't know how to fight hidden by &#34;Shakey cam&#34; or muscle heads who mow down endless waves of bad guys with machine guns, The Raid is something else entirely<br /><br />The entire plot is summed up in the heading above the title and is explained in the first 15 minutes. A group of cops are sent to an apartment complex that houses a drug kingpin and who's occupants are the criminal scum of the city. When he see's that he's being invaded, he announces over the intercom that whoever takes out the cops get's a months free rent.<br /><br />While other movies start out with an opening action sequences, a middle one to keep you interested and a grand finale, The raid inverses that. It opens with the setup, goes to action, a little plot in the middle to keep the movie together, then some more action, and then a grand finale (because more action)<br /><br />What is this &#34;action&#34; I keep mentioning? The star of this film is Iko Uwais, a martial artist the films creators discovered while making a documentary on the style he uses. He's a fighter first and an actor second. The rest of the cast is made of practitioners of the same martial art and BOY does it show. The fight choreography is incredible and rather than hide their moves with jump cuts and editing, the filmmakers utilize wide angle shots and show you the fights in all their glory. The music from Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda just adds to the pulse pounding excitement of the film.<br /><br />In case you haven't gotten my point yet, this movie is an action junkies dream, provided you dig martial arts. I highly recommend this film to anybody who wants to see some good old fashioned Kung Fu
B004UID2LC|5.0|I was quite nervous when i trust classes it after reading the most recent reviews but my security app picked up on no malware and said it was safe and it works great! I would definitely recommend it
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I haven't read a whole book since I was a teenager &  I'm glad I picked this one to start my reading career again on my new kindle fire. This book gives a wonderful insight to the world of those affected by some sort of neural damage or mental illness. Now I definitely need to see the movie!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Listening to this CD brings back a lot of memories of the &#34;80's&#34;...ALL of my favorite songs are on this CD.  The BEST purchase I could have ever made. Phil Collins still ROCKS in &#34;2013&#34;
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|I think this is a great game for everyone.  it is pretty easy so all ages can enjoy it.  I don't like that I need to be online a lot getting new levels...give levels in bigger chunks.  I also needed to give a review to get the harder levels.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Listen to this one on my drive to work every morning with the volume cranked.<br />Will the entire collection for Joe Bonamassa.
B004UJ6YNO|5.0|Love it can't get enough of do it like a dude and who's laughing now it is an amazing cd
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It still surprises me I've read the trilogy 2 times and I still want to read it again!!  #greattrilogy awesome
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|So . My game is telling me that i need to update........but there is no update on the ap store. Can anyone help?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is amazing to have such a tool to reach people I have not heard from in years!  The filters seem to be doing a good job.  Would love to learn more about the uses!!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I'm only doing this for coins so just read the title to know the greatness of this app. But it's incredibly awesome
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This book is a must read after the first book, City of Bones.  Love the new twists and turns that Jace and Clary make in this book.  Kept me turning pages, until I was done.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This was a move to watch... At first I thought it has 'all' the excitement in the beginning but I was pleasantly surprised in the end. Kept me on toes and really made me wonder now. If you want to know what I'm wondering about, you will have to watch and find out. But what a great movie in the end of it all, wow!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I LOVE THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY THE GAME AND THE DIFFERENT PUZZLES AND THE PRIZES ARE GREAT I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE UPGRADES
B00005RDRO|5.0|This matches &#34;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  In 1976 when this was made had actors busy with their job and not their star status.  It was so funny you have to watch it a couple times to get the whole gist of the movie, because the laughter gets too loud
B0036S4B6M|4.0|A good book to remember we all have some type of consequences from our actions to live with and how others are also affected as well.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I just loved this movie.  It seemed slow at first but the issue was, is he nuts or not.  The last minute of the movie tells all.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|When space is at a premium, you need an app that takes out the garbage.  That's exactly what this does.
B000VDUWMC|2.0|The biggest problem in this book is repetitiveness. The author sets forth some guiding principles in the first few chapters and then has specific examples. WAY too much time is spent rehashing how the principles apply to the examples from the chapter. This book needed an editor who didn't assume the readers would be idiots that needed the points pounded in. The author also comes off as rather arrogant, and not justifiably.  There is some interesting material here but it is surrounded by redundant filler.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|its very cute I'm a tern and I love it but so does my ten year old sister its fun and lets kids of all ages get creative and use their imagination has lots of neat tools and you can save to your gallery and on the app I recommend this app to others
B009WUBERW|4.0|Fast paced action.  Cast includes a number of older actors not seen lately:  Chuck Norris (a good guy), Jet Li (a cameo) and Jean-Claude Van Damme (the heavy).  Mostly tongue-in-cheek fun.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I like this game its very unique I recommend this to those who like games that are addictive but have a good challenge here and there its very fun and its kid friendly
0062278592|4.0|Having never read any of Neil Gaiman's work before, I jumped on the opportunity to grab The Ocean at the End of the Lane for a decent price at B&N last week. As I said in my review of Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea, it takes serious skill to be able to write a full-fledged story and pack it down into under 200 pages and have it turn out great.<br /><br />Ocean is the tale of an unnamed seven-year-old boy, whom in his childlike ignorance of the world gets caught up in a mysteriously dark and haunting sequence of events that he can't even begin to comprehend. He meets a girl, Lettie Hempstock, who lives down the lane, and she becomes more or less his only friend. One of their first conversations together involve the boy asking Lettie her age:<br /><br />\\"How old are you, really?\\" I asked.<br />\\"Eleven.\\"<br />I thought for a bit. Then I asked, \\"How long have you been eleven for?\\"<br />She smiled at me.<br /><br />Many times the he asks the Hempstocks their ages, and every time he gets a smile and no answer. When faced with situations like this or any of the other various supernatural occurrences, the boy almost shrugs it off as normal, thinking of how much of the world he doesn't yet understand, whereas an adult would act completely differently - so having a bookish child and the childlike ignorance as well as the sense of wonder and exploration that come with him  fit the story infinitely better than any adult protagonist would.<br /><br />Gaiman paints a very magical world in Sussex, with every word in its place in the fairly dark tale that Ocean is. Many encounters with the supernatural were particularly haunting, and the sinister babysitter, Ursula Monkton, was brilliantly depicted as an entity of evil, and it's a reminder for all of us who had a bad babysitter as a kid. The Hempstocks have been on the lane for a long time, longer than any mortal would survive, yet nobody knows it.<br /><br />Ocean is a particularly enchanting and magically dark tale of heroism, sacrifice, and friendship. It's the type of story that would have had me unable to sleep at night had I read it when I was a kid because of its realness, despite its magical nature. The trio of Hempstocks with Lettie at the fore were wonderful characters. The story is labeled as adult, though there's only one fairly fade-to-black sex scene that would make it so, and it's easily suitable for most ages.<br /><br />Despite the critics calling the work groundbreaking, I didn't see it as such, but it is apparent to me now why people love Neil Gaiman, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane has sold me on his work with his skillful writing and capacity for telling a captivating story.crifice, and friendship.

B004GJYRKA|5.0|.......Lee's very best.  In fact, this is the best martial arts movie ever!!!!!  The action/fighting sequences and story line are pure classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1451695195|3.0|I think this book was interesting but I would have liked to hear a bit more about heaven and a bit less about the technicalities of the science of the brain part.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Truly interesting.  It keeps you coming back! It is very well written and I can not wait for the last book!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Have read all of his books, enjoyed each one for different reasons and find them very educational as well; expands my understanding of different cultures and countries.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Granted the sex scenes are very visual, I am curious to see what happens in the next book! You come to understand the characters for more than they are.
0131480057|5.0|This is the Bible of UNIX system administration. It's quite worth to have it. And the print is really good.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Both my kid's love to play this app. The graphics are fun and minions mirror the characteristics they have on th  movie.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this book, I can already feel my thought patterns changing. Just being able to look around and notice the beauty and positive things surrounding me again is a major blessing.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|This was my first Sigma series book.  I have since read Bloodline and will search for more.  Very interesting plots and places.  They are sort of a cross between Dan Brown (Demons & Angels, etc.) and Clive Cussler books - action with a component of religious history.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Saw this on TV and then bought the video. I bought this CD copy to replace the worn out VHS copy I had. If you enjoy a great western movie then you will love this!
B00003CXRP|5.0|To my surprise, I liked this film much more than I expected and towards the end I was rather impressed. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.<br /><br />As probably everybody knows, this is the story of a guy who finds himself stranded on a small, uninhabited island, far from everything - and who has to somehow survive, pending the arrival of possible rescue. The guy's name is Chuck (Tom Hanks) and at the beginning of the film he is a kind of annoying although mostly harmless jerk. I will say no more about the plot here.<br /><br />This is a long (143mn) and rather slow film but, surprise surprise - I didn't really feel all that time passing. And I felt that I had mostly good time when watching it. The story is rather believable, the ordeal lived by the hero has a kind of realistic touch in it and with time I started to care about Chuck - and even more surprisingly, about Wilson... No, I am not saying here who is Wilson - if you don't know it yet, don't look it up on the web, watch the film and find out by yourself.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes are particularly strong and, well, yes - beautiful even, to a certain extent in a \\"Forrest Gump\\"-like bittersweet way. There is some humour, but not TOO much - on another hand there is emotion, by moments even a lot of it...<br /><br />Some lessons in survival can be learned from \\"Cast Away\\", including that you do not really need to have balls to survive for years on a desert island - but it helps to have at least one...))) Also, it is quite logical that the way out of a tight spot goes through an outhouse...))) Finally, a precious warning - even if you are oficially dead, never trust your dentist...)))<br /><br />This is essentially a \\"one man show\\" and Tom Hanks is excellent in this film, which seems like his swan song, because to my considerable regret I do not think I liked him in ANYTHING else since 2000 - and I especially hated such his films like \\"Terminal\\" and \\"Ladykillers\\" (I didn't see \\"Da Vinci code\\" and I do not intend to...)<br /><br />So bottom line, I found this film surprisingly good, I had good time watching it and I sincerely recommend to see it. Enjoy!and I do not intend to...)<br /><br />So bottom line, I found this film surprisingly good, I had good time watching it and I sincerely recommend to see it. Enjoy!
B004EPYZSK|3.0|The movie trailer was intriguing but the movie itself was a bit far fetched. Even for a sci-fi fan such as myself I found this to be full of action but the story line often went off in different directions. The actors were good but the movie fell short.
3406653642|5.0|This book should be given to all visitors entering Germany. If you follow all these 50 steps you will definitely come close to being a German or something like one.<br /> My wife is German and I have been lucky enough to have visited the land of beer and wurst numerous times. My wife bought this book for me and whilst reading it I laughed so much I had tears in my eyes. Mahlzeit and Handschuh only Germans would come up with that and gee wizz don't forget to put on your house shoes:) This book is also a great conversation piece. If your are amongst a group of Germans and feel the need to say something try any of the 50 steps and you will be certain to get a reaction of some sort.<br />Thank you so much for a fun read and good luck to all who travel to Deutschland, just don't forget to pack this book.<br />Ttssscccchhhuuuueeessssss
B0053O89WY|5.0|LOVE Big Bang! What more is there to say? No commercials, lots of laughs and reliving favorite episodes are a breeze!
B00D9T8Q3W|5.0|This book was very highly recommended to me by my friend who reads constantly  and enjoys most everything Baldacci writes. I thoroughly enjoyed this book myself and couldn't put it down, finishing in three days.  If I wasn't reading, I was thinking about the book and the characters who were so well defined. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a fast paced intelligently written spy thriller.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|Love this album. It is great music to study to. Also saw this band twice live and they're awesome! Yay!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book was amazing. This one is brilliant! Get this and you will completely love this book just like me.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Chbosky captures the mind of a young adult. Naively excited about life with a sensitivity to all things, though wishing to be to none. This has, as others have said, a Catcher in the Rye-feel to it. I question the inclusion of the homosexual theme. I feel it doesn't add to the story but rather is included because everything In pop culture today adds it in for some flair. Overall, though, I think this book reminds us of how we were in high school and provides a positive, silver-lining perspective on life without being too cliche.
B00847KFDS|3.0|I found these songs to be o.k. I am not a particular fan of any of his collaborators so I prefer the original songs to these duets. However, I do LOVE LOVE one song (Lodi) which John does with his sons...too cool! You can't tell if it's the dad or the kid(s) singing!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a wonderful challenging brain game and gets progressively harder. I would tell any one to get it! Yaya
B008GXHOFW|5.0|web swinging great. if is a awesome game to play as the spider man or man od spider sndjnfn sorry
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Very uplifting story that not only educated me about the Taliban's oppression but demonstrated sacrificial love among those so horribly victimized by that regime; it reinforced my resolve to support our troops in helping to set these people free of their oppressors.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I order an item I didn't receive it I order it in June and suppose in July 29 I don't feel like I should have to do all thus to get my items it was iPhone case this us wrong and I don't like it at all
B0064MGU98|3.0|Plotline about the jailed husband and his attempts to get out on appeal is good - that is the overarching theme of the show. But the legal cases his wife works on every week are almost always neatly wrapped up at the end of 43 minutes of each episode. It would be nice if they could extend some of these themes as well.<br />The dynamics between the two kids, mother and kids, grandmother and kids, grandmother and mother are all well handled and pretty believable.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Good movie, extremely entertaining, and an absolutely fabulous cast. Nicholas Holt is fantastic, Stanley Tucci is hilarious, and you can't go wrong with Ewin McGregor. Taking a classic fairytale and adding a new twist.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|A no brainer, requires no thought, makes you laugh, an enjoyable film.  Make sure to follow up with RED II which I though was funnier.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It goes right to your heart. wonderful novel. Author tells it beautifully. Kept me intrigued through<br />out. I would certainly recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Personally, I prefer the old weather app the best. This new app seems to be more based on wallpaper pictures. There are too many buttons to hit just to get today's forecast.
1596680296|4.0|I thought that this book was very helpful, but was also using another book along with this one.  Some of the instructions were somewhat difficult to follow. ESP for a new knitter like myself. So far I have knitted two sets of socks and will be knitting more!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is challenging and fun! It promotes fast thinking skills and manual dexterity. My ten year old granddaughter absolutely loves this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Great action from start to end. Teriffic CGI and good character developement. Nice ending as well and not dissappointing at all.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good solitaire game but I do wish they had some other versions included with it like free cell
B0000026NC|5.0|Some great music to listen to by Pink Floyd. Normally I do not like 'live' recordings, but this one is done very well. I find the music on this CD to be good relaxing background music.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My three year old really enjoys this game. It's not complicated. Yet it is fun and inviting. Great game. Highly recommended
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the minions...great addicting game. I find myself playing it over and over.  I'm looking forward to new updates for the game.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Y give us a cheat app for a game we can't even play on our kindle. Give us the game for free.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wonderful, easy read book.  Never read a book that was narrated by a dog.  It was happy and sad at the same time.<br />You come away from this book feeling good!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a user friendly game but not instantly mastered. The boards change up so you don't get bored with it. Playing with the Minions is such a blast!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This is a great show. I am totally hooked. You cant miss a moment in any episode or you willow miss a lot of information.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I strongly recommend everybody out there to read these books. They have a little bit of everything for everybody. And please just because you see the trailer and you hear about how the kids kill kids don't go around hating the movies and books you haven't even read them yet. And trust me you won't be disappointed with the movies and you really won't be anything but waiting for the movies to come out and reading the books over and over again once you read the books
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I think it's a creative app for photos and memories it holds power ,it expressed my love for family it'd so great
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Oh my !!! I absolutely loved this series. I could not stop watching it until I'd seen all 3 seasons. I'm now anxiously awaiting season 4.
