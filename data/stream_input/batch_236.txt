B00000F3KL|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a difficult movie to watch. That's my profound statement of the century.<br />From the first few minutes, you see that the director is trying to get us to focus on the atrocities that are being committed--the 300,000 people who have died--that's the reason for this mission. It helps to give some perspective.<br />I've heard a lot of criticism for the fact that every soldier looks the same in this movie. They really do seem to blend together, it's hard to distinguish one from the other. I noticed that, but it didn't bother me...actually, it made me think. We, the moviegoers on the outside, can't really tell them apart...but they can. The men who are fighting together knew everyone's name--we're the ones on the outside, peeking into their world, trying to understand what they're doing. It was refreshing to me that this movie didn't feature face shots of the \\"heroes\\" with dramatic music playing in the background. I suspect that if we were able to watch the actual battle while it was going on, it would be hard to tell the men apart. This wasn't a weakness of the movie, it was a strength. It made things seem real.<br />Another problem that people see with the movie is that there is so little character development. I've been watching war movies all my life,and so I know what they're talking about. Gone are the long, dramatic dialogues between the characters where they tell each other their life stories. I got a sense that these men knew each other--and their interaction together in the first thirty minutes of this movie doesn't seem like it's contrived to make me feel connected to the characters...and for that very reason, I DID feel connected to them. They didn't seem like movie characters. They seemed real. What you see in the first thirty minutes or so is men eating together, talking about the little things people talk about, preparing to go out and do what they came here to do--capture some men on a mission that's supposed to take an hour. That's why the events that follow hit so hard--there's a real sense of seeing real people thrown into the middle of chaos and insanity, because you've already convinced yourself that these people are real.<br />I've heard that the explosions are too big, that they're unrealistic. Ok. They might be. I suspect the director had a desire to make this movie visually stunning. But what I noticed was that during every explosion, you can see people RIGHT THERE--and so you never lose sight of the fact that the explosions aren't the central focus here--it's the men fighting for their lives.<br />Some have said that this movie wasn't historically accurate. The events didn't occur as portrayed in the movie. Well, as I said before, I'm a movie geek. And so I'm used to this. No movie can be really accurate, because you're trying to recreate events. There were no cameras there in real life--so the very medium of film fictionalizes events. Even if the men who originally went on this mission were to reinact it, it wouldn't be accurate to the way it was back when it first happened. You can't recapture events that way. The best you can do is get some actors together, work until you've got little details down (and I've heard that it's very accurate in that way, right down to the hand signals used) and then try to do the best you can to make it seem real. And they've done this. I've seen forty-year-old men sitting next to me bawling during this movie. It hits, and it hits hard. If it's not what actually happened at that time, then it sure looks like something that could really happen--because it looks real.<br />There's a line in the film where one of the soldiers says, \\"People don't understand...it's all about the man next to you. that'sit.\\" Yeah, you're right. I don't understand. I suspect that I'm not alone. But I've heard that Jesus said, \\"Greater love has no man than this: that he lay down his life for his friends\\" and it was powerful to see people putting that into practice.<br />Finally,there's a line where a soldier is dying, and he says \\"tell my parents\\" and here I'm going, \\"Tell my mom I love her!\\" I've heard it a million times before. Even if it's something that people actually say, it's so contrived that I feel unmoved by it now. But he said, \\"Tell my parents that I fought hard today. Tell them I fought well.\\" There are things I will never understand. I don't know what I feel so strongly about that I would be willing to die for it, but this guy believed in this mission. the most important thing to him was for his parents to know that he fought well. I know that it'sa just something a character in a movie said, but it really made me think...regardless of how I feel, I have to respect that someone could feel so strongly aboiut their country that they are willing to die fighting...that's powerful. And the fact that even when the soldiers were dead, they still sent others in to rescue them. They really meant it when they said, \\"Leave no man behind.\\"<br />No joke, no kidding, no exaggeration: This movie changed my life. There are some things that I will never see the same way again. And for that, I have to respect this movie. After all, it's not often that you can say such a thing, is it?lly, there's a line where a soldier is dying, and he says \\"tell my parents\\" and here I'm going, \\"Tell my mom I love her!\\" I've heard it a million times before.

B00005YUNY|5.0|This excellent production will rapidly become the Mecca of Yes on film. After nearly 34 years and counting the band had still not released an adequate visual representation of their powerful live concerts. `House Of Yes' (from the House of Blues on `The Ladder' tour) came nearest, but the 1970s attempts (`Yessongs' and `Live In Philadelphia') are sub par, and the 1996 `Keys To Ascension' video was ruined by post-production and appalling graphics. Now, finally, they've pulled it off. Two and a half hours of sublime music, intelligent filming, good direction, sensible production and great sound.<br />The occasion, as most reading this will know, is the 2001 Yes Symphonic Tour - in this case a concert in Amsterdam.  The fact that the shoot took place in Europe adds to the enjoyment, as audiences in this part of the hemisphere tend actually to listen to music rather than to yell and scream while it is happening. This removes most irritating aural distractions from the listener's perspective, and avoids elimination problems at the production end.<br />The idea of Yes appearing with an orchestra was greeted with understandable scepticism in some quarters.  The possibilities of overkill, mismatch or descent into musak were enough to make anyone who cares about their music nervous. Fortunately, composer Larry Groupe handles arrangements of classic material with taste and restraint, and the young European Festival Orchestra under Wilhelm Kietel was well settled in by the time this was filmed. Indeed they seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves.  It is good to be able to hear what they add. This was not always possible as a member of the audience.<br />The highlights of the concert are undoubtedly superb versions of three 20-minute Yes epics: `Close To The Edge', `Gates of Delirium'  (from `Relayer') and `Ritual' (from `Tales From Topographic Oceans').  The playing and the mix are top notch here. What's more, director Aubrey Powell understands the need to ensure that visualand musical events are in synch. Obvious maybe, but not evident on past Yes video outings.  Those who dismiss Yes as sound and fury signifying little might not be entirely assuaged by these performances, but is difficult for some of us not to be moved by the grandeur, ambition and architecture of their sound - even if we may have moved beyond the moment in time that was progressive rock in other ways.  <br />`And You And I', `Long Distance Runaround' (with a rather incongruous cinematic orchestral prelude) and `Starship Trooper' also come off well, even if they emphasise the fact that bassist Chris Squire's dress sense is as laughably misguided as ever. Steve Howe provides a good acoustic guitar interlude with the Spanish strains of `Mood For A Day' and his arrangement of the second movement of Vivaldi's Lute Concerto in D major. The latter makes me slightly anxious, as it doesn't really do justice to the original. But it has a few interesting harmonic quirks to enliven interest. The new material (from the `Magnification', album, 2001) is mixed in its live realisation. The longish `In The Presence Of' works well, especially the driving coda. Only the cloying opening theme lets it down. `Don't Go' is a frivolous add-on, frankly. The title track sounds pretty good here, but it lost its accents and embellishments in the actual concerts. The ability to mix the orchestra better on this DVD/video production helps enormously.<br />At the end, Yes throw in a surprise `Owner Of A Lonely Heart' (without orchestra) as well as the ubiquitous `All Good People' and `Roundabout', on which the orchestra re-appear to jive engagingly in the background. Steve Howe is clearly none-too-keen on his role in the Trevor Rabin-era material, and who can blame him? For the most part he strums, allowing keyboards sideman Tom Brislin - who plays wonderfully throughout - to adapt the mid-song solo through some judicious synth pitch bending. Howe returns at the end to add something much more guitaritic, but in his own style.<br />This DVD features the entire concert, Jon Anderson's amusingly off-kilter between-song patter included. There are visual augmentations available, but thankfully you can switch these distractions off, put your feet up and focus on the playing of all concerned. And with a set list like this, who wouldn't want to?<br />One final, pedantic point. Though the word symphonic is used carelessly as a synonym for everything involving a larger-than-chamber orchestra these days, this is in fact `Yes orchestral'. There have been laboured attempts to find sonata form in their longer works. But everyone knows that they were not written with that intent, and the symphonic moniker misses the point. Yes at their best (on the three classic albums from which over an hour of this superb film is taken) are powerful and inventive in their own right. They do not need misplaced attributions from other genres to make the credible.  Yes may look aged, but their sound has continuing vitality. Check it out.
B000066JES|5.0|This is a band that has been around for 22 years, and with each subsequent release, they stay true to what they have always been about: Defenders of the Metal faith. For those uninformed, Manowar are comprised of incredible musicians, capable of makeing whatever kind of music they want. In their case its balls to the wall Metal. This album showcases the range and scope of just how great of a unit they are. The songs themes revolve around pride & honour. From the opening track (Call to Arms) to the last (Fight Until We Die) they fight for the revelance of heavy metal music in a day in age where watered down corporate manipulated music that has all but eliminated \\"True Metal\\" from their agenda. The production is top notch (mighty and powerful) and the song selection is varied and diverse. This album is worth the purchase for just \\"Nessun Dorma\\" alone. I have heard many versions of this opera aria, from Pavoratti to Aretha Franklin, and this version is the best Ive ever heard. Eric Adams sings this song with so much passion and conviction, that every time I hear it I get choked up. \\"Vincero!\\" .....Ive heard many people (90% american kids that listen to Nu-Metal and/or Metal in general) say how they hate Manowar, saying \\"They [are bad]\\", \\"They are so cheesy\\"....etc. I believe the reason for this is because they have been led by the nose by corporate america and listen to Linkin Park or Korn and things like that. They are Sheep being led by a deceptive Shepard. Its unfortunate that they are not able to see, hear & recognize the awesome talent, power & majesty that is Manowar. Listening to this band can only do one thing: Lift your spirit up to where eagles fly! ....Hail & Kill !!! (ps. \\"An American Trilogy\\" [Which is a tribute to Elvis], is awesome and tells you that they don't care about trends and trying to be cool!)
1573222038|5.0|After reading and enjoying Sarah Waters's previous novels, I knew Fingersmith would meet my expectations.  However, I had no idea!  Fingersmith, as usual, had the gorgeous, atmospheric qualities that I think is Sarah Waters's trademark.  And of course, the writing is simply genius.  But more than that, Fingersmith is fantastic -- this novel told a darn good story.<br />Set again in 19th century London, Fingersmith begins with Sue Trinder's tale as an orphan and a thief.  She lives in a house filled with other orphaned babies and an assortment of pickpockets, or \\"fingersmiths,\\" along with the lady of the house, Mrs. Sucksby, who took care of Sue since she was an infant.  Now 17, Sue's opportunity to show her appreciation to Mrs. Sucksby finally comes -- in the form of Gentleman, a seedy con man and friend of the household.  Gentleman is armed with a plan to make them all rich and enlists Sue as his helper.  But things aren't always what they seem, and as the plan unfolds, all sorts of secrets and twists come unraveled.<br />Fingersmith is everything I had hoped it would be -- beautiful writing, a stunning cast of characters, and a riveting, compelling storyline.  I was helplessly drawn into the slums of London as well as the drab, solemn English countryside where Sue and Gentleman spend their days spinning their treacherous web.  I will admit that there weren't as many shocking surprises (for me, anyway) like Affinity, but this novel was much like Tipping the Velvet in how it pulls in the reader from the beginning with a rousing good story.  I can't enough good things about Sarah Waters, her novels, and her talent.  She's exceptional, and Fingersmith is nothing less than stellar.
B000066NW0|4.0|There are extra materials on the CD besides the music including a bonus track and two videos that are accessed through CD-ROM drive.  The track is pretty good, but the videos are of quite poor quality.  There is also a bio along with some other things that you can easily find on the internet anyway.  All in all, it's a great musical effort though.  Definitely buy this for the music and not the small amount of extra materials.
B00004TJTS|4.0|I got this movie because I wanted to laugh and feel good; which I did.  But I wish there was a warning on the front that the content of this movie may not be suitable for dog lovers; I cried and cried ...<br />It's a good movie, but it was just too sad for me.  I should have seen it coming.
0823003035|2.0|I'm a beginning artist, and I ordered this book for tips and guidelines to help me in my upcoming figure drawing class.  After a brief perusal I've decided not to try any of the author's techniques and suggestions, mostly because his own drawings, as reproduced in the book, are so flat and dull.  My own beginning classmates' drawings have more weight and energy.  Try another book--I certainly plan to.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is very good.  The symbolism is typical of David Lynch, so if you like some of his other stuff, it will help you with this one.  The movie has very powerful themes (jelosy, betrayal, etc.) which are well developed in the movie.<BR>For the most part the movie is straitforward if you can remember all the parts at the end and put them together.  I watched it 3 times in a row to figure out some of what was going on.  You almost have to because much is revealed at the end of the movie that will frame how you view the beginning.  The following text may give away some of the mystery of the first viewing, or, if you are only going to see it once, it may give you some framework.<br />The first part of the movie a dream of the real Diane Seldon (who plays Betty in the dream.)  The performancies of many of the characters is &quot;shlocky&quot; because it is the fantastic view of Diane.  Psycologically, it has been said, the dreamer plays every character.  Betty is Diane's vision herself.  Rita (played by Harring is Diane's reality love interest) plays a lost Diane, and even becomes to look like real diane.  The other characters have Diane issues as well.  When Diane awakes we find what the reality is like.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is truly a fabulous film. This isn't a film. It's pure art. Check this out if you aren't a square I-only-watch-romantic-comedies movie goer.
B000002L75|5.0|As a Depeche Mode fan I would say that this is by far the best album that the group has ever put out.  This is the album that defined the group and put them into the spotlight.  This is an all time classic album for the masses.  I love all of the Depeche Mode albums that came out in the eighties, but Some Great Reward is my favorite.  A true Depeche Mode fan would say that their favorite material comes from this album.  It is hard to mention a favorite track because all the songs are great!  I just love this album!  Fans that look back at Depeche Mode's career look at this album with much sentiment and regard it as DM classic.<BR>Some Great Reward is Depeche Mode gloom and doom at its very best!
0634022296|5.0|If you're used to getting Beatles chords from the internet, save yourself a lot of time, effort, and printing and get this book. Its format is excellent, and the fact that the original keys are used makes the song sound right from first chord. There are almost no errors in placement of chord symbols, and the chord diagrams before each song means you're going to be playing the right form of each chord listed. <BR>All that could be added to make it absolutely perfect would be the signature licks or intros, but often you can work these out from the intro chords given. <BR>I have worn this book out, figuratively. It's the best value for the buck I've ever come across. It even helps you appreciate more the creativity the Beatles showed in their songwriting. <BR>There is no way to be disappointed as long as you understand that this one if for chords and singing the lyrics; it only does that but it does it perfectly.
B00001MXXH|4.0|If you love the 80's, this is a must see. The generation is not complete without this movie.
B00005RYL2|2.0|I really like this movie.  I think it is a very beautifully shot, non-pretentious, interesting, and entertaining movie.  So why do the powers that be insist on splicing in a scene that looks and is acted so badly it stands out like a sore thumb?  It even has a jarring awful transition into the scene in a movie otherwise full of beautiful transitions.<br />If you don't know the story of this scene, here it is in brief.  The Director and Producers decided not to shoot the scene where Conner meets Rachael, to save some money.  During editing they changed their minds, and paid, out-of-pocket to set up and shoot that scene.  They called back Christopher Lambert and got some child actor and quickly slapped the scene together.  With the scene shot they went back to editing and spliced the footage in and decided it looked really bad and took it out again.<br />Fast forward to the release of the Directors-Cut and the only way to justify a Directors-Cut--by inserting this terrible footage.  Now I can't get a DVD version without this awful scene.<br />If this scene had been done properly (as in budgeted for, and done when Lamberts regular make-up person was there (I keep asking myself if this is what a person looks like on film with no make-up, or just with really really bad make-up), and if Lambert had felt like acting that day ) this could have been a very beneficial scene for the movie--but as it stands it's not.<br />I give the original release of Highlander 5 stars.  The current versions with all its \\"improvements\\" I can only give 2 stars.<br />All I wanted was a decent DVD transfer of the original movie.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I've seen this movie twice now and love it. The special effects are terrific and the goblin is humerous and creepy. This film has several clever touches and many humerous moments in it, with a ton of romance to it too. There was only one flaw in this movie and that was that Peter Parker is more of an interesting character than Spider-Man. There's more detail to him and Spider-Man just seems to be on for the ride of it all. The real character is Peter Parker, and even though he's Spider-Man there's only Peter Parker under a mask. But the film is very well done and I highly recommend that you watch it.
B00003CXXP|1.0|DO NOT waste your time, or money. Long, withered and withering. Boring with absolutely no point. Speilberg should hang his head... I wish I'd wasted my money somewhere else...
0553573403|4.0|I've read many novels of high fantasy, but I've only found a few that make you care about the characters.  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is one of those few.  Some of the reviewers here have complained that the characters and plot aren't original.  While they may have a point, what matters is that Martin actually draws the reader into the story, and makes you feel the anger, fear, and triumph of the people involved.  I have two favorite characters.  The first in Arya, a tough-minded young princess who's more interested in swordfighting than in the maidenly arts, which leads to conflict with here uptight sister.  The second is Tyrion, a dwarf whose quick and agile mind make up for his physical handicaps.  Although he is one of the villanous Lannisters, you can't help but like him by the end of the story.<br />The story involves two great houses, the Starks and the Lannisters, who compete for influence and control.  There are also several intriguing subplots dealing with other forces that threaten to intrude upon the Seven Kingdoms where the main action takes place.  There are several big surprises in the book that catch you off guard.  I should warn you that several of the plotlines are not wrapped up neatly at the conclusion, so you might want to have the sequel, \\"A Clash of Kings\\", available as soon as you finish.<br />My one complaint with this book is that the beginning is too long and features too much exposition, while parts of the ending seem rushed.  In particular, I really felt shortchanged by two battle scenes at the conclusion.  If less time had been spent on some rather plodding dialogue at the start, the novel might flow a little bit better.
B000002UQJ|4.0|The Off The Ground release by Paul McCartney was certainly a pleasant surprise for me. Many of Paul's solo efforts feature an abundance of sappy arrangments. This is not the case here as Paul resorts to displaying many creative instrumental embellishments. The different piano textures on such as tracks as Golden Earth Girl, Peace In The Neighborhood, and the rockin' Get Out Of My Life are captivating and beautiful. Some people might not like the lyrics to Biker Like An Icon but I find them just fine with the rocking melody.<br />Other than the last two songs which drag just a little bit, this a delightful record which is strong on arrangments and song structure. Not quite on the level as Band On The Run but certainly quite close. Give it a try.

0060194995|1.0|Simply put, this is a novel about racism written for people who received their knowledge about racism from this book! There isn't a single insighful moment in this overrated piece of drek, and frankly it is an insult to intelligent readers everywhere...Filled with more stereotypes than an epidode of Good Times, this novel features the archetypal White hero with few flaws, his perfect children, the maid with just the right amount of \\"colored wisdom,\\" a black amn who is little more than a dullard, and the evil redneck who actually commited the crime! The problem with novels such as this is that instead of depicting reality, they present a world where minorities are at best well-meaning simpletons who need to be rescued by perfect white males from all those \\"unenlightened\\" white meanies! Kids should reads history texts...they're more entertaining.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I enjoyed the wide-screnn DVD version. The lack of extreme detail is expected when a book is being made into a movie. The only concern I have is: Can they keep up production speed for each additional movie. Each book represents one year of school at Hogwart's. How can they maintain the pace with the actors physical age.<br />A good first movie. They should spend more time on the next one with the plot development.

B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones makes a powerful statement with her album, Come Away With Me.  Here is a CD that can stand alone in listening circles, or escape into the backdrop of some raining afternoons.  The amazing part of this album is the way it boldly stands alone in a world full of pop music.  This is truely daring and original in the sense that it doesn't copy anything in today's trendy &quot;flash in the pan&quot; music.  The great subtle sound of Norah Jones shouldn't be compared to Billie Holiday -- Norah Jones is able to blend in and become a wallflower much better than Ms Holiday.  If you like a light sound and a warm friend on lazy days, this is a great album!
0066620996|5.0|This book is for companies that truly wish to be excellent, and are willing to do all that it takes to get there.  A little tough for startups, as this book assumes a base of resources to go off and do what it takes to \\"get great\\" - but some of the basic concepts in the book are applicable to ANY business.  The first book by the author \\"Built to Last\\" was a good book - but he himself has gone great with this one.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0000636UN|5.0|If you're undecided about buying this album, DO IT! If you like a CD that you can play all the way through, this one's for you. This is in my opinion Ms. Crow's best album thus far.  Highlights include the catchy summer anthem &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot;, the title track &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot; and one of my personal faves, &quot;Get Over You.&quot;  There's not a bad song on this album and lyrically speaking it is outstanding.  Some of the songs are more heavy than others, but there's a good mix of fun and reflection. I highly recommend picking up a copy of C'mon, C'mon. You won't be disappointed.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Many people have complained that \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" isn't an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia - and, as far as I know, it isn't. Since I've never experienced it I wouldn't know what schizophrenic delusions DO look like, but if the movie accurately depicted them, average moviegoers would not want to watch it. This movie wasn't meant to be an informative drama about mental illnesses, it was just meant to be a MOVIE. Watched with this in mind, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is excellent, kept moving with the captivating acting, storyline, cinematography and music.
6305307261|5.0|This is a great movie. I cant help but wonder if modern audiences who have grown up on a diet of &quot;Friday the Thirteenth&quot; will find this too arty and slow, while those who appreciate Cinema might be put off by its horror basis.<br />If you fall into both camps, I think you will enjoy this film. It is reasonably true to the Bram Stoker yarn, but contains an extra additive with the extraordinary cinamatography, brillient and haunting soundtrack, and splendid cast. <br />The film holds a spell from start to finish and if you want the bejeebers scared out of you, this is a good way to do so.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" has been the subject of much pre-Oscar controversy; some of the charges against this film are more valid than others.  Critics have been coming out of the woodwork and accusing director Ron Howard of dodging some throny issues in his film biography of math wizard John Nash (accusations have ranged from Nash's alleged homosexuality to even anti-semitism).  In addition, the casting of Jennifer Connelly as Nash's long suffering wife has provoked the wrath of some in the Latino community (Nash's wife is really from El Salvador).  Regardless of the above, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a good film on its own terms.  Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as the professor suffering with scizophrenia.  This must have been a tricky role to play, but Crowe pulls it off without faking a single move.  Jennifer Connelly was better in the far edgier \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" but she shines in her role as the long-suffering wife.  Howard competently directs the film with feeling and at a reasonable pace, although the spotlight really belongs to Crowe.  I wouldn't look to this film for hard facts on Nash, but nonetheless I recommend it on the strength of the film's stellar performances.
0553573403|5.0|Lets get one thing straight from the start. This is not your typical fantasy. There are no happy elves dancing in the forest. Major characters die. There is not one hero with newly found magic, sword, lost inheritence whatever to save the day. Major charcters die. Good characters turn out to be not so good. Bad characters turn out to be not so bad. The characters swear, and drink and get intimate with each other. It is the realpolitik of the fantasy world. There is nothing else avalible which comes close.<br />The book achieves what few fantasy novels have - It has very real characterisation so that you and your friends can argue over who is the most likable, Secondly the plot, while VERY complex is well sketched out, has no gaping flaws and is, dare I say it- believable. Finally, Martin is a gifted writer. To jump from character to character, with EACH one having a seperate characteristics is quite remarkable.<br />I do not agree that the plot lags at all. The pieces are falling into place for a major fantasy epic, and from the introduction you know this is special.<br />I like the concepts in the book as well. The hints of loss magic, the Others, the detailed history of the seven kingdoms. Incredibly, tiny pieces buried in book one resurface in the following books.<br />Move over Tolkien, you have now lost your throne.
6305311463|1.0|Cheesy, uninspired disaster flick starring actors who, frankly, should know better: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Billy Bob Thornton.  It should come as no shock that this film is a bust; it's brought to us by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, the boys who gave us &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; which may be the worst movie of 2001.  I mean, it makes &quot;Independence Day&quot; look like &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;  Should you feel the need to watch a disater flick, please by all means avoid &quot;Armageddon.&quot;
0671578855|5.0|Having read the book a second time I have to admit that my first impression two years ago was wrong. Then I felt somewhat let down, because it was not so strong a book as \\"Komarr\\" or \\"Memory\\". Well, that may still be so but now I discovered what a brilliant book this is.<br />It's subject is not only the campaign Miles wages to capture Ekaterine's heart and hand, there is much more: sub-plots and stories about Mark, Ivan, a count's succession struggle, the Imperial wedding ... It's just a great panorama of Barrayar: colorful, full of suspense and romance.<br />Oh, and then this is probably the funniest Vorkossigan book of them all. Some of the scenes are just hilarious! Some are almost too much: the scene when Miles gets his Ekaterin could be from a Frank-Capra-movie.<br />My advice: buy it, read it, enjoy it!
B000000OXH|4.0|Okay, I recognize this may not be everyone's cup of tea.  Some of the songs are fairly weak (&quot;Never In A Million Years&quot;) but there's some outstanding bombastic drums, great harmonies, symphonic keyboards, and powerful choruses... and the icing on the cake is Steve Howe's always-sublime guitar playing.  Alas, the CD version does not have the perfect album-closer &quot;Daylight&quot; that the cassette had, but if you really want it, it's on Geffen's recent Best of Collection.<br />Standout tracks include the single &quot;Don't Cry&quot;, &quot;My Own Time&quot;, &quot;The Heat Goes On&quot; (with an organ solo by Geoff Downes), &quot;The Last to Know&quot; and &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;.  &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; has remained on John Wetton's live set lists, and it's easy to see why.
1587990717|3.0|I bought this book because a review said it presented the case for two things that I have long believe are both true and important:  randomness plays a very much larger role in our lives and in our apparent success than most people think (especially in the financial world!), and the role of very rare and improbable but quite significant events (&quot;outliers&quot;) can be much more important than many people understand.  (As someone once said, &quot;Never underestimate the simple pleasure people derive from being told things that they already believe are true&quot;)<br />Those are indeed primary themes argued in this book -- but I was expecting to see some real data, some solid statistical arguments and examples to support these claims, and the book doesn't deliver on this.  Lots of semi-pointless little anecdotes, lots of discursive comments and equally semi-pointless notes about the author himself, but very little or no hard content.  As the author himself says in the Preface about how he went about writing the book, &quot;Everything that remotely felt like work was out&quot;.  Too true!! -- and the book clearly shows it.<br />I don't begrudge purchasing the book, if only for the novel (to me anyway) concept of the &quot;Inverse Turing Test&quot; on page 62.  The original Turing test addresses the issue of whether a computer can ever be called intelligent, and says that a computer (or an AI program) should be considered intelligent if a human exchanging messages with it over an electronic link really can't tell for sure whether there's a human or a computer at the other end.<br />The Inverse Turing Test starts with the persuasive assertion that a computer running a random or Monte Carlo process can't possibly be intelligent.  It follows that if a program like this, simply by stringing together stock phrases in accordance with simple syntax rules, can generate documents -- say a typical business speech, report from a stock analyst, or Derrida philosophical treatise -- that other humans cannot distinguish from real examples of the same category written by human authors, then neither the computer nor the human authors are exhibiting any intelligence.  (No such Monte Carlo program could ever write a valid scientific journal article, because writing scientific articles does require intelligence.)<br />Hadn't heard that argument before, and it's very entertaining -- perhaps because there's so much truth in it.<br />Anyway, this book is a light-weight, and won't go in my permanent library.
B000060OFT|1.0|This version of Romeo and Juliet is a classic case of casting marketable but notably inept actors in the lead roles.  The director did a good job of passing the script of the original play through a rusty cheese grater.  Unfortunately, people were enchanted with this pulverized excuse for a Shakespeare play.  If the bard were still alive, the director would still be in the midst of a nationally televised law suit!<br />Even though I must applaud  Luhrmann's attempt at bringing this Shakespeare play into modern times, he failed horribly.  Why did there have to be a beach?...  The real Verona is landlocked!...  Also, calling the guns \\"Sabers\\" was a pathetic attempt at modernization.  If Luhrmann had simply kept the play in its original setting and combined it with real acting and real people it might have had a chance.  Actually, I doubt that even Shakespeare himself could have saved this star-crossed production.  With Leonardo, it sunk like a man with concrete shoes.
B000021YQV|4.0|Many bands today have ferocity and anger.  American Head Charge, Slipknot, Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, Manson, etc. are among the most popular and most angry.  But there are few bands that can also incorporate originality into their rage.  System of a Down does this without a catch, and without selling out.  As a vocalist, Serj is just...different.  It's just a treat to listen to him because, well, the guy can't sing.  But he doesn't try.  He's simply trying to get points out about things he hates about our country.  A lot of them I disagree with, as I am about as right winged conservative as you can get, and most of this band's lyrics seem to deal with liberal garbage.  However, I respect the band's views, and I respect them as a whole, because of the fact that they are different, but they aren't trying to make an image for themselves.  OOO, I'm #8 from Slipknot, I have rage.  My mask represents my rage!  Get it?  My mask=me?  Please.  And then there's the copying Mushroomhead.  OOO...we all have the same masks, but not really cuz one guy doesn't wear one and one guy wears M. Bison's hat.  Mudvayne and Manson are the same, they just do it with makeup.  System of a Down is just angry, but they write great music, and don't have to rely on make up and screaming to get a point across.  The best tracks are 'Aerials' 'Forest' 'Toxicity' 'Needles' and 'Prison Song'  Get this disc.  These guys are for real.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Wow.  I must take this time to offer Brandon, Mike, Dirk, Jose, and Kilmore my congratulations.  This band has taken their own sound and has truly slapped their ownership label on it.  This is my number one CD to mellow out to, but if you do it right, you can also rock out to a few of the tracks.  This is basically a melody band, however.  Brandon Boyd has a great voice, and Mike's guitars really carry a strong sound.  Unlike Limp Bizkit, the turntables aren't overdone to the point where they just sound like another guitar.  They have their own beat, their own rhythm.  I have listened to 'I Wish You Were Here' and 'Warning' over a hundred times and I have not gotten sick of them.  The whole CD is absolutely wonderful, as is the band.  A lot of people say that 'Make Yourself' was the band's best effort, but I would have to disagree.  'Make Yourself' was a good CD, but it just didn't have the intelligence of this one.  This is another perfect example of a real band, and they're one of my favorites.  So congratulations again, guys.  Hope to hear some more from you in the future.
B00005JKL8|4.0|Behind Enemy Lines is one of those movies where you know it's going to be a typical, Hollywood made movie where every cliché in the book is used.  But, it's also one of those movies that you don't really care and you just want to feel good about it.<br />With great performances by the two leading men, Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson, Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie that keeps you interested throughout and makes you feel like you're a part of it.  <br />John Moore does a fairly nice job as director.  There wasn't really anything spectacular done.  It was a pretty basic form, but I'm not complaining.  It worked.<br />The action sequences were a bit unbelievable, and that is why I give this film only four stars.  Also, I don't think the scenes were produced all that well and cleanly.  I've definitely seen better.  But to me, the action was only a sideshow to what the movie was really about.  It wasn't about people getting shot up and killed; it was about survival and how one man will stop at nothing and use his brain instead of weaponry to get himself out of a sticky situation. 4 Stars
B000002KO3|5.0|This is one of those albums that broke music through to another level.  An album that when you heard it first, you pulled over in the car, listened to it awestruck, and were blown away.  Sounds trite, but it raised musical consciousness to new heights.  A must-have for pilgrims in search of meaningful music.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black hawk down is down right awesome. Ridley Scott delivers another action packed and disturbingly entertaining movie about the incident in Somalia in 1993. Very detailed and accurate, Black Hawk Down is very realistic and full of wonderful cast members. Jamie Mead is right next to me. I love this movie and so will you.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This was without a doubt one of the best movies of all time. I can remember being 13 when the movie came out in 2000 and wanting to see it then, but my parents thought I was too young. So i finally saw it about 7 months ago and just again last night and it definatly explains the life of a rock star. and its hard. living on a bus. [bad] food. whatever and whatever. but Cameron Crowe, Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup, and everyone else did an A+ job and i think if anybody else had done it, it wouldnt have come out as real and good as it did. I own this movie and you definatly should too.
6305399212|5.0|'Aliens' is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is heaps better than the original.  The first in the series was undoubtedly seminal - who could forget when the alien bursts out of the astronaut's chest? - but this uses all the ingredients of the first film and emphasises them tenfold.  Agent Ripley (Weaver) awakes only to discover that she's been in hyper-sleep so long, lost in space, that everyone she knew back on earth is now dead.  As it turns out, there's more aliens abroad, and before you can say 'oh no not again' Ripley's taken off with a motley crew of army-astronauts to take a look at a planet where a human colony disappeared, and there's rumour of alien interference.  If this appears clichéd then it's a great credit to director/writer James Cameron that he adds just about every element possible to make this not only completely credible but also scary, exciting and even human.<br />Cameron replaces one alien with a whole colony, good special effects with better special effects and a bigger cast that's every bit as impressive as the original crew from 'Alien'.  It would be impossible to pick out the best element here, no doubt it will be different for different people depending on what they prefer.  However, it's probable that this wouldn't have been half of what it was had not Sigourney Weaver been in the lead role.  She epitomised the female action hero, perhaps even the action hero, with her role as Agent Ripley.  Strong when she needs to be, touch, bitter and now thanks to Cameron a maternal instinct in the shape of Newt, the only survivor of the lost colony and the child that Ripley never got to have.  It is this that will hold the interest of many and it's a rare action movie that can keep you on the edge of your seat one moment and then feel intensely for a lost little girl, who thankfully is a very good actress.<br />In short, this is a real classic of its genre and comes highly recommended even to those who aren't a fan of the actionflick.  This is intelligent, nail-biting and, significantly, scary stuff and not to be missed.
B00006690G|5.0|'Sometimes it seems like the worlds on my shoulder, everyone's leaning on me'  Yet Eminem is still underated, missunderstood & discriminated. Simply put Eminem is the best rapper.  Now how do you define that?  Is it the guy with the flashiest video, biggest pinky ring, the one with the most video's on MTV/BET?  Naw, its lyrics.  Lyrics that just blow your mind!  Eminem is more than a just a Wordsmith the man is a bloody genius.  Before ya'll go around talking about all he does is curse and diss his mamma, listen to the emotion, the pure honesty behind the verses.<BR> Eminem blends verbs and metaphors better than any rapper or any singer or any damn poet that ever walked.  And there's always a story to tell, agree with his opinions or not, aint no stopping the man!...I could go on and on about him but 'listen' to the CD 4 yourself.<BR>I have every thing he ever put out and imma continue to collect his music. And until any other rapper can make me feel their music like Eminem those I'll always say that Shady is the best!
0679735909|1.0|Everyone has undoubtedly heard the maxim &quot;Never judge a book by it's cover.&quot; It holds just as true when taken literally. I picked this book up for because the painting used on the cover caught my eye. I decided to use it for an oral book report in my English class. I started reading expecting a moving, amazing book. All I got was boring stuff for 495 pages with the last 5 being of any interest at all, that was 3 years ago and to this day I recall the absolute bore that this book was. The idea is interesting to be sure, but when it's bogged down by bad poetry and characters who aren't fully drawn it becomes a book that personally wasn't worth the paper that it was printed on. I may not be some literary critic, but I do know what doesn't work. If however you are looking for some good modern writers may I suggest Gregory Maguire, Daniel Handler, and Jeffrey Eugenides.

6305807086|2.0|June 10, 2002<br />\\"Being John Malkovich' can't be satire.  Its <BR>characters are too outrageously drawn to stand in <BR>for just plain folks.  It is in its own strange <BR>way a horror film, since it proceeds from a nightmare <BR>logic all its own.  However, it replaces the glee of <BR>that more simplistic brand of entertainment with a <BR>neurotic need to batter itself, its characters, and <BR>us, with endlessly glib tortures.  It envisions a <BR>world where every desire is a joke, every emotion a <br />manipulation, every character a fraud.<br />The story begins with John Cusack's character, a <BR>pretentious artist and sexually frustrated husband <BR>married to a frigid frump of a wife.  Forced to <BR>take a job, Cusack chases an attractive co-worker, <BR>even though she's something of a soulless, <BR>... shrew.  By means of a magic tunnel, all <BR>three main characters enjoy life in another body, <BR>until, after numerous kinky adventures (which are <BR>not so much tongue-in-cheek as tongue-in-canker-sore), <BR>the film winds its way to a heavily masochistic <BR>conclusion.  Without giving too much away, Cusack's <BR>characters ends up taking the brunt of things.  <BR>This is strange because his character seemed to be <BR>the only one in the film with any ambition, dreams, <BR>or a modicum of conscience.   <br />Undeniably an interesting film, but, unable to justify <BR>itself or its sexual politics, `Being John Malkovich' <BR>is a frustrating and ultimately displeasing film.<br />I recall reading somewhere that the screenwriter, <BR>Charlie Kaufman, is heavy into analysis.  Seeing his <BR>movie, I'm not surprised.
B000066NW0|4.0|Fueled by the first-rate single 'Complicated', Avril Lavigne's debut set LET GO pulls up the rear behind previously released discs from youth-minded contemporaries Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton, yet creatively it's far and away better than either of those debuts. For one, Lavigne is a better vocalist than either Branch or the savagely overrated Carlton. Two,her songs are infinitely more listenable as a whole package than either of those two(though Branch's THE SPIRIT ROOM has its' moments). Third, she's far closer in proximity to Alanis Morissette musically--like AM, her strength lies in melody. Unfortunately, the similarities with Morissette don't end there.She also has an extremely awkward way with a lyric,though thankfully doesn't indulge in the verbose meanderings that undermine much of Morissette's work. Highlights of the set include the previously mentioned 'Complicated', the rock-etched 'Losing Grip',and Goos Goos-sounding 'Anything But Ordinary'.Ultimately,the awkward lyricism is a minor quibble--pseudo-teen angst never sounded so good.
B00005JKJA|3.0|June 10, 2002<br />`Mulholland Drive' is David Lynch's sad and horrendous <BR>valentine to Hollywood myth and the young women without <BR>number sacrificed in body and soul to keep it going.  <BR>It is a gaudy but somehow still sentimental tour of <BR>Hellish La-La Land.  Like many of his other films, <BR>`Muholland Drive' is both simultaneously enraptured and <BR>disgusted by its subjects, lending the finished project <BR>Lynch's trademark perversity.<br />An interpretations of the film's narrative is pointless.  <BR>I don't know which characters, or incarnations of <BR>characters, or simulations of characters, are meant to <BR>be extant.  In the end, it hardly matters.  They are <BR>manifestations, not people.  Best know that going in.  <br />More problematic is Lynch's need to stray from his main <BR>narrative, his worst habit as a filmmaker, since his <BR>comic deviations are often more enjoyable than the main <BR>action of the film.  As is the case here.  Some of the <BR>subplots included here, those belonging to the characters <BR>of the Director and the Dimwitted Hit Man, are great fun, <BR>but they vary greatly in tone from the central story <BR>involving the two main female leads.  This is especially <BR>damaging in the opening hour of the film, before the <BR>women's tale has become properly engaging.  An unwise <BR>move in a film this long.<br />There is no rating to give a David Lynch film other <BR>than a rating dead in the middle.  To some he is <BR>unwatchable, to others untouchable, so best split the <br />difference.  If you haven't seen `Lost Highway' or `Blue <BR>Velvet' or any of his other works, there's no point in my <BR>trying to figure out for you whether or not you'd like <BR>them.<br />Heck, I don't even know if I like them or not.  But <BR>they're usually worth a look.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney, did a great job with this CD. I am glad she made it!! The first track is Oops!... I Did It Again, in this song she mentions the Heart Of The Ocean necklace, from the movie Titanic...! Which Titanic is one of my all time fave movies. So the first track is Okay! I reall love the second song, which is Stronger. It is a fast song,and great!! One of the other songs, I like is Lucky... this song is the best!! But why does Britney play Lucky, n' the music vid? I don't get that :-S! Anyways, if u like Spice Girls, N Sync, etc then this is the CD for you if u like pop music...!!! I reccommend you all to buy it...<br />My favourite songs are, stronger , lucky, and when your eyes say it....!

J.LO does great acting and great singing..! What made me what to get this album is her song Waiting For Tonight..., I loved that song very much! And so now I've got this album, and love it alot. And my most favourite song on this album is Waiting For Tonight (of course!). So if you get this album, I'm shure you'll love it.
B000002NBY|5.0|This CD was made in the mid- to late 1980's and features collaborations with many different performers and many different styles.  Here, you will hear various South African artists, like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Boyoyo Boys, and Baghiti Khumalo; the Everly Brothers; the east L.A. band Los Lobos, the cajun band Good Rockin' Dopsie and the Twisters; and Linda Ronstadt.  Listening to this music will take you from the bayou of Louisiana to the heart of Africa.<br />The first thing that struck my attention is the use of percussion and accordion.  This is the emphasis for the songs rather than the guitar work.  The second thing is the blending of Zulu and English lyrics like in the songs \\"I Know What I Know\\" and \\"Homeless.\\"  Both things are a breath of fresh air into Simon's work.<br />The two stand-out songs on this album, for me, were \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" and \\"Under African Skies.\\"  The former was very popular on MTV at the time, and in concert, Paul Simon usually played this song twice through the early 1990's.  That is just how energetic it is.  The latter has Linda Ronstadt who has such a great voice.<br />I would highly recommend this album.  The rhythm is catchy and will get your toe tapping.

B000002KKC|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's TUSK took a beating from the same public and critics that had so adored their earlier RUMORS, which remains one of the most popular releases in recording history.  But time has been particularly kind to TUSK, and where RUMORS remains Fleetwood Mac's penultimate pop statement, TUSK now plays as the band's penultimate &quot;art rock&quot; statement.  The entire tone of the album is quite unlike anything Fleetwood Mac--either in earlier or later incarnations--ever created, and as in the earlier RUMORS the music here reflects the various emotional states of the band's members, states that range from nerve-wracked edginess to a resigned and tranquil sadness.<br />The edginess here comes largely from Lindsey Buckingham, who launches a series of jittery and frequently vitriolic recordings with the jumpy &quot;The Ledge&quot;--recordings that read very obviously as manifestations of his on-going frustration with former lover Stevie Nicks; Nicks in turn responds with a series of songs that possess a tone of exhausted romantic splendor, most notably in &quot;Storms&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Child.&quot;  And the blue-voiced Christine McVie, in the midst of her own private traumas, balances out both with a series of tranquil sounding recordings that nonetheless possess an often meloncholic tone, as in the opening cut &quot;Over and Over.&quot;<br />As usual, the thing that holds these diverse recordings  together is the way Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie's voices blend and the whole band's talent for generating a cohesive musical sound.  Although &quot;The Ledge&quot; would seem to be a Buckingham diatribe against Nicks, she offers one helluva back-up vocal on the piece; it is impossible to imagine Nick's &quot;Sara&quot; (which Nicks subsequently described as about her brief affair with Mick Fleetwood) without the gloriously dripping and soaring back-up vocals of both Buckingham and Nicks; and Buckingham and Nicks's background blends give McVie the perfect setting for such soft-rock cuts as &quot;Over and Over,&quot; &quot;Brown Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Never Forget Tonight.&quot;<br />Throughout the entire recording the band as a whole is first rate, sharp-toned when required and dreamy when appropriate.  And to my mind, this is really the last cohesive Fleetwood Mac recording, the last time the entire band would work as a team to create music: later recordings such as MIRAGE and TANGO IN THE NIGHT would certainly have their points, but they were largely made with each vocalist recording independently from the other members of the band.  TUSK is glitchy, edgy, meloncholic, dreamy, explosive, and quietly haunting, and while its unusual nature prevents it from being a popular favorite it is nonetheless Fleetwood Mac at its best.

B000002L7Y|5.0|If you remember A-ha fondly from your youth, grab this disc. If you like pleasant, atmospheric electronic pop music, grab this disc. If you appreciate talented male vocalists, grab this disc. There are many reasons to add &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; to your music collection.<br />A bit oddly, I suppose, &quot;Take On Me&quot; was never a song I liked, even if I thought the video was excellent. &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; was my favorite back in those old days. And it's still a great piece of pop music, in my opinion.<br />However, &quot;Living A Boy's Adventure Tale&quot; and &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot; are fantastic song. &quot;The Sun...&quot; in particular is worth a listen.<br />The rest of the tracks on the disc are also highly entertaining, with none of them feeling like &quot;filler&quot; to me.
B00005MNP7|5.0|BLONDIE had been kicking around for several years before the band exploded into public conciousness with PARALLEL LINES, an album that made the most of Debbie Harry's sensuous voice and the band's \\"new wave\\" tone that fused punk and pop to impressive effect.  EAT TO THE BEAT was the follow up, and although it stayed very much in the slick mold of PARALLEL LINES it did not repeat so much as elaborate the previous album.<br />On the whole, the recordings here are at once edgier and softer than those found on PARALLEL LINES, with \\"Atomic\\" similar in feel to \\"Heart of Glass\\" but considerably jumpier and \\"Sound-a-Sleep\\" echoing Debbie Harry's vocals for \\"Fade Away and Radiate\\" but softening the instrumentation to create a gentler tone.  And then there are the knock-outs: \\"Dreaming\\" has sometimes been called the band's best single with its typical BLONDIE punk-pop fusion, both \\"The Hardest Part\\" and \\"Die Young, Stay Pretty\\" have a truly funky feel unlike anything on PARALLEL LINES, and \\"Union City Blue\\" possesses an English-toned wall-of-sound quality.  My own favorite of the set is \\"Slow Motion,\\" which is just flat-out fun.<br />The re-master here is very nice, and the additional live cuts are interesting although not entirely in line with the album as a whole.  If you're a BLONDIE fan, PARALLEL LINES should still be your first purchase--but EAT TO THE BEAT should be a close second.  Recommended.

B000063UR2|5.0|Wow! I just watched the director's cut version of Legend after years of loving the US version, and I must say it's like two different movies. It's not just that they edited the movie differently, but the script was actually slightly changed. In the Euro version Lilly was clearly a \\"princess\\" and she was just a lady in the US version. I also thought Lilly seemed a little more bratty in the Euro version. When Jack actually pleads with her not to touch the unicorns, she gives him a wicked little smile does it anyway. And as others have noted the pace is much slower in the Euro version.<br />I see here that many people didn't like the Tangerine Dream score, but it really made the movie. It created a postmodernist sortof fairytale by mixing the classic plot and themes with the modern score. Jerry Goldsmith's score was not nearly as emotional. <br />The DVD is great though. You can watch the version you want and see how they created that beautiful set.
B000007T2Z|5.0|This 9-piece collective remain one of the important avant-garde purveyors of jazzy, experimental rock.<br />Listening to this album was actually a music geek moment for me. I had never heard the album, only heard it described. I was expecting a sort of noisy, experimental record like a Sonic Youth's SYRs. For the most part, that's what I got; shambling, majestic, noisy symphonies of diverse sounds. However, In the middle of their epic twenty minute first track, I got a mind-blowing, wonderful surprise. One of the best and most evocatively expressive guitar instrumentals I've ever heard busts out. It's called 'The Cowboy' and it was so moving-- these beautiful blue slide guitar notes and tinny jangles just build and build to an unbelievably mindblowing crescendo. Honestly, it's as good as anything Link Wray, Duane Eddy or Dick Dale have done. Then we go back to a krautrock/psychedelic long-player.<br />Thats GYBE in a nutshell; a band that can get things done in any genre. They're even better live.<br />Come on, kids. Put something else experimental in your stereo besides Radiohead!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Beautifully grim and Brilliant! are the first words that come to mind after seeing Donnie Darko for the first time. Astonishing and Clever are the first words that come to mind after watching Donnie Darko the second time.<br />*minor spoilers* What do you get, when your stuck inside the mind-inside the dreams-of Stephen King right as he falls alsleep whilst reading Alice in WonderLand? <br />Answer:....Donnie Darko<br />When in the middle of the night a jet engine falls from the sky, crashing into the bedroom of Donald Darko, Donnie has only a six foot rabbit named Frank to thank for saving his life. Frank then kindly informs Donnie that the world will end in twenty-eight days. Over the course of the next month-with armegeddon inevitable- Donnie follows the bunny (a'la Alice style) through a wormhole into a tangent universe where he sleepwalks and reeks havoc on the schools water mane; falls in love; has many more creepy encounters with Frank the bunny; theorizes the true nature and existence of Smurfette; exposes a kiddie porn publishing ring; and uncovers the principles of Time Travel. <br />Without getting bogged down in details of the synopsis, Donnie Darko simply put is: pure feat in filmaking. Never before has a film noir been able to capture and convey such raw beauty. Never before has such a dark and grim premise been so cleverly told,<BR>through painingly-pretty blue skies, descriptive and creative random blurbs of literature, genuine and concise dialogue, and an ending that brings us back to the beginning, which we quickly learn is the beginning...of the end. <br /> <br />One of the highlights for me was the use of music, including an awesome and refreshing alternative to the cliche' part of a movie where we meet all the characters, and a group of characters meet for the first time- exchanging dry, predictable, formal dialogue. Instead the creators chose to pan from afar, mute-out all sound, and play-from very beginning to end- the appropriately symbolic song, &quot;Everybody wants to Rule the World.&quot; Throughout Donnie Darko the device of music is carefully and purposely implented to create a genuine feel of the late eighties era. The soundtrack is so deftly used, it sort-of becomes its own living character.<br />It is a rare feat when a movie remains even from opening scene to the closing credits. Donnie Darko accomplishes this rarely reached goal though consistently superb cinematography, descriptive prose delivered by colourful characters, dashes of humour, splashes of romance and a huge cerebral heaping of the Philosophy of Time Travel- coupled with the fear of knowing &quot;that every living being on this planet...dies alone.&quot; <br />Fear&lt;------------------&gt;Love<br />Cellar Door<br />(p.s. to a previous reviewer) The song &quot;Notorious&quot;,by Duran Duran, was released in 1986--not 1992.  Which only leads me to question your dedication to Sparkle Motion!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|john mayer's room for squares is one of the best cd's to hit the market in a long time. Not often can you buy a cd that you really like more than 75% of the songs.  John Mayer is extremely talented, his music is refreshing and ecclectic and I hope this is the first of many great pieces of music we get from him.
B00005O5CM|3.0|At first glance, this film would appear to be a rehash of &quot;Clueless&quot; - especially when comparing the equally blonde, likable, and rich characters played by Alicia Silverstone (Clueless) and Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde).  However, after 30 minutes, you start to realise that Legally Blonde is actually a fish-out-of-water story.  Elle (Reese's character) is a fashion major and sorority girl from a (fictional) west-coast university who decides to go to Harvard Law School (in pursuit of her boyfriend).  She barely makes it in (a scene that contains the film's funniest moment: &quot;Don't we encourage diversity in our program?&quot;), and shows up in Massachusetts dressed in hot pink with her chihuahua in tow.  In hearty contrast are her classmates - serious law students toting Masters degrees and dressed in beige and grey.  The story is basically how Elle buckles down, learns to work hard, and wins the approval of her peers and professors while remaining true to herself.<br />The movie only works because of Wotherspoon's protrayal - Elle is completely likeable, even when she starts off as a spoiled rich girl.  The movie doesn't dwell on artificial crises thrown in Elle's way (in fact, the cut scenes on the DVD include a few of these, which the editor wisely eliminated).  Instead, we are drawn in by the character and are cheering for her to make it through the law degree.  In addition, to the untrained ear, the legalese is convincing, not a parrot of filibuster courtroom scenes from past movies.<br />The DVD edition, oddly enough, may be more than most people would expect for such a film.  There are 2 audio commentaries, some short featurettes (one enumerates all of Reese's hair styles, something like 32 in total), and a pop-up video trivia track.  All are entertaining to some degree, if occasionally repetative.  Most interesting are the cut scenes, including an introduction to each (and explanation why they were cut) by the director.  All of this (including both widescreen and P&amp;S forms of the film) fits on a single disc (2-sided).<br />Therefore, for a light-hearted, fun film, check it out.  If you are already a fan of the film, the DVD includes lots of goodies which recommends it over the VHS tape.
B00000BKI4|4.0|I first heard track 1, Holes, on a not so good movie, Panic.<BR>I could not find the soundtrack and there was not listing at the end of the movie.<br />I heard a song by Mercury Rev on MTV's 120 minutes.<BR>I knew that was the voice.<br />This band is different-unique.  They may remind you of some bands in the 80's but with an updated sound. <br />We need more innovative bands.<BR>Why is it that you can only hear good music on the internet or 120 minutes?

B000002JST|4.0|This album can really rock the house. Bon's screeching vocals and Angus' screeching riffs will make your ears bleed, but as Martha Stewart always says 'That's a good thing'. Probably one of the weaker Ac/Dc albums of the 70's but it's still a great look back to when rock ruled the air waves and a time when people would have laughed at names like P. Diddy. Buy it if you like Ac/Dc. If you don't... why are you even reading this. Best songs are Let There Be Rock and Whole Lotta Rosie, but the song Overdose shows why Angus have had a guitar playing duel with Jimi Hendrix.
B000068TPN|4.0|As much of the Vietnam War becomes forgotten except as it is experienced through the movies about it, this movie is an important addition to the genre.<br />... The story told here is an honest one about brothers in arms who went where their country sent them and did what they were asked to do. The message is not dissimilar to that seen in many WWII movies but severely lacking in movies about this conflict which seem to find more \\"truth\\" in such movies as \\"Platoon\\". While that, too, is a great film, it must be remembered that the acts portrayed in it were the exception, rather than the rule.<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" examines the first battles of the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and a force of some 400 men defend a vulnerable position from attack by as many as 4,000 North Vietnamese entrenched in the surrounding mountains. The tactics, the motivations, the emotions and, ultimately, the terrible cost are examined through the eyes of Moore, his top Sergeant (played flawlessly by Sam Elliot), Moore's wife (Madeleine Stowe), an intrepid chopper pilot (Greg Kinnear) and a photojournalist (Barry Pepper).<br />The battle scenes are realistic - though not quite as harrowing as \\"Black Hawk Down\\" - and the characters are more clearly drawn than in that film.<br />Overall, this is an excellent look at true heroism and moral conviction in the face of adversity and almost overwhelming odds.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I would have to say that this movie is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. The whole backwards-forwards concept is positively mind-bending because it is very non-linear. While watching this for the first time, I remember getting really upset with trying to figure out what exactly was going on because I would immediately forget what had just happened in the previous scene. On the second and third viewings, I realized why this was happening. Our minds work in a very linear fashion-we're used to seeing the cause BEFORE the effect. In this film, the cause comes AFTER the effect, which we aren't used to seeing.Add to that the forward plotline of Leonard sitting in the hotel room, explaining his story over the phone and we're left in a constant state of disorientation, constantly asking ourselves &quot;Okay, what just happened here?&quot; We end up in a predicament, much like Leonard's predicament, where we think we've gotten something figured out, only to have the rug pulled out from underneath us a minute later. An ingenius concept, if you ask me.
6304539258|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece, probably the best movie I've seen in my life, and I've seen alot of movies. In recent years though, some groups of individuals, got tired of the films popularity, and tried to get others to dislike it. When you ask them why they don't like it, they really can't tell you, because there isn't one thing wrong with this film. It is not religous, and doesn't support pantheism, that has been a topic that has come up, after the Catholic Church caught a glimpse of Darth Maul, and they started a huge contraversy. It isn't a religous movie, it's a classic movie about good v.s. evil. I've yet to see anything that was done so well. The special effects are incredible in both versions, and they actually look real. No matter what anyone says, facts are facts, and the fact is this is the best movie ever made!!!!!!!
B00005YU1O|3.0|Waking Life. Waking Dream. Dreaming Wake. Dreaming Life. Life Dreaming. Wake Dreaming. It'll make your head spin if ya think about it to much. This movie to me, is  not about an entire film. It's about moments. One moment. Another moment. My favorite moments are the ones that have neat endings. Like the guy talking to the boy and is mysteriously filling up a bottle with Gasoline. (Ummm  I wonder what for.) And the man in the bar \\"testing\\" out his gun. Those were great. Some of the conversations are forgettable. (Alot of the inbetweeen ones) The beauty is you can hate one and love another. The ugliness is that if you rewatch it ya hafta sit through it all anyway. Too bad their isn't an editing feature to include only the ones ya liked. It's a mixed film, with mixed reviews. I didn't like the lack of a plot, no tension, which frankly made me a little bored. Once the main character FINALLY gave us a reason to stick to the end, (he revealed a problem to which he wanted an answer too) It's funny how everyone is giving him all this advice but they don't tell him the ONE thing he really wants to know. (Maybe thats another point the film gives off) The beginning sets up all the rules for ya. The man driving the boat like car explains how things will proceed from then on. You're path is random and so is the movies path. The text commentary is a neat feature and will help with sources of info and other possible questions.<br />Is it too much at times? Yes. You hafta committ yourself to finishing it or you can easily find your way to the stop button. Rent it before you buy it.<br />The Animation is great but can destract at times from the talking as others have mentioned. And I need to see it again to understand the ending. <br />The movie does come off as a \\"college\\" or \\"village voice\\" type movie for new age hippies or stoners. It's ideas can be intruiging or laughable depending on your point of view. I enjoy that they weren't offensive, like they didn't disprove God or anything. It's very objective and you take in what you want. The film may cause discussion afterwards with friends or colleagues IF you can remember anything that was said. <br />It's a mixed film. It was NOT nominated for best animation because drawing on people is more of a special effect, rather then creatign from scratch which is harder to do. although I too agree with the Jimmy Neutron nomination being utter ... They should change the title too Best Children's Film. To call it best animated film is a joke since we all know the hollywood peeps don't take the time to watch anything they don't take their kids too.<br />ANYWAYZ<br />See it, it won't change your life, but then again it's not supposed too, it's just a movie.
B00004TDRD|3.0|This isn't scary, it's down right hystarical! SS did a great job with this movie, but the shark still, and always will look fake. It's time for a remake. Great soundtrack. I can't believe this made people scared to go swimming at the beach, I can't see how. Someone needs to explain that to me.
B0000584V3|5.0|What style of music is Opeth?  I don't know.  They use some death vocals, but this is not death metal.  It's not folk.  It's not rock.   It's not traditional metal.  Opeth fuse all those styles together.  And surprisingly, the fusion doesn't sound forced or pretentious.<br />Blackwater Park is at once more \\"accessible\\" and less heavy than their earlier releases.  Death metal fans may be disappointed at the folkishness.  Non metal fans who've never heard Opeth may still find some of it too heavy.  But I think most open minded people will immediately sense beautiful melodic music with occasional heaviness.<br />This band is incredible.  They cannot be ignored!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie makes me want to laugh and cry, usually at the same time so I just end up choking on my own emotion.  I mean that as a compliment.<br />The DVD is great, too.  It has a ton of out takes (20), a video of Mad World, two commentary tracks, the self-help videos from the film--with their own commentary track, and then a bunch of stuff from the website.  Plus, probably a  few things I forgot.<br />And best of all:  All this stuff is on one disk.  No muss, no fuss.  No disk swapping.  Which is why DVD is supposed to be superior to Laser Disk in the first place.  Right?<br />If anybody involved with the film ends up reading this:  Thank you.
0064407667|1.0|When I read this book, along with my two boys, we kept reading in hopes of finding something to catch our attention.  This book was boring and morbidly sad.  It is truly a bad story in every sense of the word.  The author was indeed correct in the Introduction.  I won't be reading any more of the series, it's not good reading. Perhaps there should be a warning attached to alert parents of the depressing qualities of this book.

B000002IOW|5.0|This is a very different Rush album.  The band is well-known for its mix of unique lyrics and vocals backed by an ever-changing orchestration of music, and Presto is no different.  However, what makes Presto so good is the rhythmic feeling to it.  From the foot-tapping, bouncing pace of &quot;Scars&quot; to the melodic and sometimes haunting chorus of &quot;Chain Lightning,&quot; the album gives both the mind and the soul something to jam with.  This is one of the top Rush albums, along with 2112, Counterparts, and Moving Pictures.  Definitely worth it for anyone who likes great music.
6301969294|4.0|the fountainhead is a good movie as far as it goes.  having just read the book again, i realize that a lot of characters and events are missing, which would have made the movie more interesting.  gary cooper is an ok howard roark, but a little old for the role.  patricia neal is good, but the best character in my opinion is raymond massey as gail wynand.  his delivery and overall performance are outstanding and he was the right age and build for that role.  it's worth seeing to see his performance.  their one big mistake was killing gail wynand off at the end.  didn't happen in the book.  all in all a good watch.
B00005ATQD|3.0|I believe I understand Eyes Wide Shut now. It teaches a lesson that is so hard to learn. The lesson of simplicity. Just as the catholic priest's outfit teaches truth to be a small and simple white patch lost in confusion, darkness and compexity, this movie teaches that the sexual union is a very simple and wonderful truth created to bond two people together in love. When this simple and powerful act is complicated and divorced from its proper context, it creates a self perpetuating elaboration. When the simple act of sexual union which is designed to lead us toward each other and to the love that waits for us in each other is directed outward, then that person begins an ever outward journey on a road that never ends. Each step of the road becomes more and more elaborate in its attempt to find the true treasure which is never found \\"out there.\\" The metaphor of over the rainbow used in the movie to symbolize the false search was apt. The lesson Tom and Nicole learned was that the moment they looked away from love and allowed their sexual energy to look outside that love, they began to walk the path of despair. Each of their fantasies became more and more elaborate, her's in her mind and his in a brush with the masters of elaboration. The big house with all the satanic sexual ritual was close to the end game of complexity, yet these people which got off the track long ago were no closer to finding the Grail. Satisfaction can never be found \\"out there\\". At the end of the movie Nicole tells Tom that it is important that they go home and F--K. This statement is important because it tells us and clarifies for them the roads they had begun to walk. They had forgot the simplicity of love and how the sexual journey is always toward each other. They had each withheld their sexual energy and waited for an opportunity to release it along those dark roads of elaboration. Tom had many tries at finding false union out there but clearly a higher power protected him from certain disaster but also taught him an important lesson. They had to F--K, not make love, because that act was necessary to release all the false sexual energy they had built up on their false quest. Unless they released it and allowed it to burn off they could never return to Love. Love is very delicate and will diminish or die in the presence of false sexual energy. Love is simple, and sex is the simple journey toward each other and toward the love that we give each other. The moment it becomes more than that, or other than that, then like the Illuminati we chase our tails forever, ever building greater and greater elaboration and lies to hide the knowledge that we have forgotten the truth. Just as Dorothy from the Wizard of OZ learned that she already had what was best, so Tom and Nicole also had to endure the tornado and meet the wizard to understand they always had the ruby slippers and the power to return home.
B000053GTF|3.0|There are some videos missing like Think Twice and Only One Road. These videos should have been included. I agree Because You Loved Me should have been original video.
B00004YYDI|4.0|the uncut version truned to be more compelling. Not sure why it was cut in the first place. I did not find anything disturbing uncomfortable. What ever you do, don't by the American version.
6303686745|4.0|Just like the book, this movie is SOOOOOOOOO LOOOOOOOOOONG in its storytelling.  Unless you are REALLY into this type of movie (Pseudo-Soviet 1960's warfare) it is just not worth the watch.  The end, though, is rewarding.  It's as though the director gives you compensation for sitting through the movie by handing you an ending that is real, dramatic, timely (1962, pre-Kennedy Assassination New York), and most of all, satisfying.  Just like the end of The Omen, the end leaves so much spectulation about the future (the flashing images gave me nightmares about New York's demise, just like Damien's apparent bonding with the President in The Omen!).  You want to know what happens next, what the country does, how the American people react, but you are happy nonetheless that the end so elequantly is slammed to you.  I recomend this one to all history fans, ESPECIALLY those with an affection for the Cuban Missle Crisis!
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem is the greatest rapper in the world.  The Eminem Show is his greatest album yet.  Here is what a rate every song.<br />1. Curtains Up (Skit)<br />2. White America - A very good song.  Score: 5/5<br />3. Business - One of my favorite songs.  Score: 5/5<br />4. Cleaning Out My Closet - Another very good song. One of the slower songs on the cd.  Score: 5/5<br />5. Square Dance - My second favorite song on the cd. It has a weird chorus.  Score: 5.5/5<br />6. The Kiss (Skit)<br />7. Soldier - An okay song. I don't like the chorus but the verses are alright.  Score: 4/5<br />8. Say Goodbye Hollywood - Better than \\"Soldier\\".  Again, I don't like the chorus but the verses are good.  Score: 4.5/5<br />9. Drips - A good song but one of the worst on the album.  It features Obie Trice who is a very skilled rapper.  Score: 4/5<br />10. Without Me - You've all heard it.  Score: 5/5<br />11. Paul Roseberg (Skit)<br />12. Sing For the Moment - They used the beat and chorus from Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\".  A very good song.  Score: 5/5<br />13. Superman - A very, very, very, very good song.  One of the best on the cd.  Score: 5/5<br />14. Hailie's Song - A good song.  Eminem isn't that good of a singer though.  Score: 5/5<br />15. Steve Berman (Skit)<br />16. When the Music Stops - One of the worst songs on the cd.  I love D-12 and their cd \\"Devil's Night\\" but this song isn't that good.  I like all of them except Bizarre. He doesn't really rap, it sounds like hes just talking.  Score: 4/5<br />17. Say What You Say - A very good song featuring Dr. Dre.  They diss Jermaine Dupri.  Score: 5/5<br />18. 'Till I Collapse - The best song on this album.  It features Nate Dogg who sings the chorus.  Score 10/5<br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy - My third favorite song on this cd.  It features Hailie Jade, his daughter.  Her voice is kind of annoying but its still a great song.  Score 5.5/5<br />20. Curtain's Close (Skit)<br />Overall this is the best cd ever since The Marshall Mathers LP andthis more than twice as good.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wow! This movie is amazing! The special effects will blow your mind! Spider-Man blends utterly thrilling action with some light comedy, drama, and even a bit of romance! It's the ultimate movie-lover's movie. I really enjoyed it a lot, and what made it even more amazing was having Kirsten Dunst play the role of Mary-Jane, the object of Peter Parker's affection. A beautiful face, and excellent talent. Tobey Maguire is also a great young actor, full of spunk and after this movie, I'm sure he's going to be a \\"breakthrough\\" actor, totally mainstream. I can't wait for the next few installments in the Spider-Man series with Tobey and Kirsten. This is a great movie, take the family and some friends along and enjoy!

6305077630|3.0|This has got to be one of the funniest movies that came out in the 80s!! Even though the DVD is discontinued I was recently watching a talk show where Bill Paxton stated that he just layed down a commentary track for a special edition of Weird Science so let's all wait for what will have to be one of the best releases on DVD!!!!!
B00005JKJA|1.0|I ADORE thought provoking hard-edged films(ex. requim for a dream , memento , etc). Anything that will get my curisody to run wild. Laura did quite a good job performance wise.<br />However this film did NOT impress me at all, it was hyped up to be something it wasnt.<br />This simply was not a good movie.<br />My recommendation rent Memento or Donnie Darko instead.
B00003CWOL|5.0|This movie is witty and hilarious!  Sure there are the prerequisite Kevin Smith fart jokes, but that comes with the territory.  Linda Fiorentino (MIB) is believable, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek are hilarious, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are clever, Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy) is coniving, Alan Rickman (Harry Potter) is sarcastic and Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (Jay and Silent Bob) are awesome!  This movie has tons of cameos--watch for actors from Kevin Smith's other movies, as well as George Carlin and Alanis Morsette. <BR>This movie shows the good and bad of organized religion and makes you think about the meaning of beliefs, faith and ideas.  It also shows you that you can't believe everything you hear...you have to use your head.  <BR>The DVD I have doesn't have directors commentary, which I wish it did...but I think that there is now a souped up version of this DVD that has deleted scenes and the like.  <BR>Excellent flick....

B00004Y6O9|5.0|One of the greatest party albums of all time by one of the greatest party bands of all time. These young tearaway Americans knew how to rock and enjoy themselves to the limit and beyond.<br />Discovered by Gene Simmons of \\"Kiss\\" after playing the American Club circuit they were rushed into the studio with experienced rock producer Ted Templeton and came out with this raw product.<br />At the time (1978) it was given no chance, a fully fledged Rock 'n' Roll album at the height of the seventies disco scene. However, straight to the top of the charts it shot, almost single-handled killing of disco (for which we should all be eternally grateful) and giving Van Halen 4 top ten hits along the way.<br />As for debut albums this one just about tops the tree, especially for a bunch of total unknowns.<br />At least half the songs on this eponymous debut are still considered one hundred percent solid gold classics. Each band member establishing their own character in every song. Frontman and show man extraordinaire Dave Lee Roth pants, rants, screams, and pouts his way through the album like the old tart he was. Sticksman Alex Van Halen made his own sound, very heavy drums with plenty of double bass work and open high hats, always pushing the other members of the band to the limit. Michael Anthony was the ultimate good time rockin' bass player. In later years he had a guitar painted and shaped like a bottle of Jack Daniels.<br />But the man who really grabbed the headlines was the soon to become legend Eddie Van Halen creating his own unique style with legato, palm silencing, fat rhythms, finger pinching, and hand tapping; almost every song starts with something original from the man. After the opening salvo of \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\", Eddie is allowed to let rip with \\"Eruption\\" one minute thirty seconds of guitar that would change the world of guitar rock forever, revolutionizing the guitar community and inspiring a thousand imitators into the heavy metal lexicon.<br />A magnificent debut for sure, but maybe the band should of held onto a few of their blockbuster tunes to bolster the lean years that started after 1984 and continued to the present day. (I mean, does anybody even know who is lead vocalist with them now? And does anybody care?)<br />But on this album Van Halen amply demonstrates their drive showmanship, sense of fun (Ice Cream Man) and musicianship throughout, blowing the needle off the scale on such tracks as the old Kinks classic \\"You Really Got Me\\", \\"Atomic Punk\\", and \\"Ain't Talkin About Love\\".<br />Turn it up and turn on.

B000066JES|4.0|Good to hear MANOWAR back in action after an agonizing wait. WARRIORS OF THE WORLD is a cool disc with lots of inspiring metal anthems & classy arrangements...in particular, (The Ultimate) Singer Eric Adams really stands out on the operatic ballad NESSUN DORMA...and when you thought the CD was ALL anthems & ballads, the band shreds through a trio of fast, blistering death-metal attacks: HAND OF DOOM, HOUSE OF DEATH and FIGHT UNTIL WE DIE. Manowar prove once again they are the most talented musicians in all of heavy metal. If there's a flaw, it's in Joey DeMaio's rather cliched lyrics--even the most battle-hardened Manowar fan (me) wants to hear something new once in a while besides KILLKILLDIEDIE. This CD blows LOUDER THAN HELL off the map, but falls bit shorter than the heights of TRIUMPH OF STEEL or SIGN OF THE HAMMER. Still a good value though.
B00005PJ8I|5.0|Tom Hanks give an explosive and nearly solo-performance in this riveting film from Robert Zimeckis, the Oscar-Winning director of \\"Forrest Gump\\"<br /> A simple plot, a Fed-Ex worker's plane crashes to a remote island and he must find a way to survive until he is found.<br />  Big, whoop, it's so much more than personal survival, constant symbolism, underlying meanings of the everything from the title to Fed Ex's motto \\"The World on Time\\".<br />  And anyway who stings Hanks for crying over a volleyball could not of understood the film. Yes, it's a volley-ball painted with blood named Wilson, but just watch the film again, and find more to it.<br />  Helen Hunt gives a superb performance as Hanks' wife. That's about it.<br />  Simply, Crowe was good, Gladiator was ok...but Hanks.....when was the last performance that was to the magnitude of this? The fact of whether or not he survives the island is not the point, there is so much more....the middle part of this film (him on the island) was the last part of the movie that was shot....all the physical and mental that Hanks had to go though for this role should have earned him the Oscar.
6303430570|5.0|This film was shot in Black and White due to cost factors, but it ends up working perfect, where Color would have fallen short.  It takes place mostly between two stores, a Convenience Store, and a Video Store.   The dialog between the two clerks and other main characters makes this the funniest film I have ever seen.  It needs to be listened to, and not talked through, and watched at least 5 times to be appreciated, and to catch all the subtle aspects to this film which makes it great.  The reason that B/W works so well is because it is like watching the film on those B/W video security monitors.  This film is not Great, it is Amazingly Great, and required viewing for anyone with a sick sense, or sarcastic sense of humor!!!!<BR>...
0792163710|5.0|Of all the injustices in this world, Shane debuted the same year that From Here to Eternity was released. Of course the latter scooped most of the Academy awards for 1953, and in my opinion only because westerns don't garner as wide an audience.  Shane was meticulously researched , scripted and directed. Every performance was flawless, and Brandon De Wilde being denied best supporting actor is an absolute crime.  <BR>       The film immediately grabs the viewer when the Ryker crew intimidates Joe Starrett who is then joined by Shane. The underlying stuggles of right and wrong, even Shane's attraction to Mrs. Starrett only add to the emotional human drama. My wife, a devout Western hater , absolutely loved Shane and the tear meter was flowing at the end when Shane leaves the valley with Little Joey calling for him to return.  This movie is without doubt a top 10 ever made. Recent releases like Titanic although well done lack the human drama and connection that Shane makes with the viewer.  <BR>         My only gripe with the DVD version is the editing out of the last dialogue of the movie as Shane goes over the mountain and little Joey crying out &quot; Bye Shane&quot; . Why the studio did this is a complete mystery . Otherwise this movie is a masterpiece on DVD with clear crisp video images and very good sound.

B000003EUL|5.0|I fell in love with the Brahms Second when I was still very young, and Richter's performance was the one I started with. None I have heard since has lived up to the standard Richter set. Claudio Arrau, for example, sounds hesitant and dissected compared with Richter's blazing technique and superb musicality. The second movement, in particular, cannot be improved upon in any way. Having Richter's amazing performance of the Appassionata on this CD is the icing on the cake; as one reviewer said, he is simply on fire. Particularly considering the mid-list price on this CD, this is a must-have disc in any decent classical collection.

B00005QIPH|3.0|&quot;Is This It&quot; is definitely a refreshing change from the vapid stuff that's so popular these days. I must admit though, I haven't been as taken with the Strokes as I am with the White Stripes. The Strokes lack the raw emotional energy of the Stripes. Although that's probably not a fair comparison, since raw emotion isn't really what the Strokes are about.<BR>The songs could use a little more complexity, a little less repetition of chords. And &quot;Last Nite&quot; is almost directly lifted from Tom Petty's &quot;American Girl&quot;. Listen to each song one after the other, the similarity is astounding.<BR>I do feel that the Strokes are on to something, with their back to basics retro sound and their often ironic lyrics.<BR>Let's see what they come up with next...

0064409422|5.0|My review is about four children that entered into a bizarre world. Their names are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. The thing that is so bizarre about this world is because it has mystical creatures, strange looking animals and people and a White Witch. In the beginning, Lucy the youngest, walks right into a wardrobe, and there she finds another world filled with odd things. At first no one believes her until they all walk in. There they all get seperated and meet interesting creatures...<BR>   I decided to read this book a long time ago because I had it since the Fourth grade and didn't read it ever since then. I use to still remember how amazed I was after reading it especially the animals in it. At the time it was one of my favorite books, unlikely it still is one of them. I would truly recommend this book to any open young minded reader.<BR>   To me personally, my favorite part was when the kids defeated the White Witch and came running out of the closet. Well, that's because the children can look back at what they all went through and learned a little something more about each other. This shows how much they have learned throughout this wild experience.

Its high time this movie is brought out on DVD.<BR>Guess this was one of the most gruelling roles Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons have ever played - climbing those cliffs and through the muck of the rain forests.<BR>Also a suggestion - IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO ALSO INCLUDE THE MUSIC TRACKS OF THIS FILM IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES SECTION OF THE DVD. Music Director Ennio Morricone would agree with me on this.<BR>Also since movie is based on a true story of the Guarani tribe, it would be enlightening if the special features could throw some light on the Gaurani tribe or the advent of the white man and Christianity in the rain forests of latin america.

B000065U1N|5.0|...I'll be one of the first to give readers a review that has nothing to do with my political orientation: <BR>It is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, it thrills you, scares you, and puts you through a whole wide range of emotions like an excellent movie should. The actors are believable, the special effects are awesome, and the plot stimulates your mind. You pull for the heroes, and want the villains to meet destruction (unless you sympathize with Somalians who shoot at people with rocket launchers). If people let go of their critical analysis of the time period, and just enjoy the movie, I think anyone will love it.
0553381687|4.0|I'm not, in general, a fan of high fantasy, but I've enjoyed almost everything Martin has written in the past, and several of my friends recommended this series very highly, so I decided to give it a try.<br />It's a very good book, but make no mistake: It's long.  Martin is telling truly EPIC fantasy here, with a large cast of characters, a far-ranging domain, an extensive backstory, and lots of politics and infighting (not to mention the outfighting - as in \\"out fighting on the battlefield\\").  The degree to which it works for you will largely depend on how much you like the characters, and care about their troubles.  Martin's rotating-point-of-view style (a different character is the focus of each chapter) works quite well, particularly when you see two sides of the same events, as happens several times.  While some of the characters' stories are there mainly to illuminate other characters (Ned's daughter Sansa, for instance, doesn't really have her own story), others are quite compelling, particularly Tyrion Lannister - the intelligent and outspoken dwarf - and Jon Snow - Ned's ... son sent to guard the northern wall against the horrors beyond it.  Tyrion is clever and funny and always entertaining to read about, while Jon is deeply conflicted and has been placed in a difficult situation which ought to have a great impact on the rest of the world before long.<br />A Game of Thrones largely concerns the power plays between Ned Stark's family and the Lannister family, to which the queen of the realm belongs.  The king, Robert Baratheon, is an old friend and comrade of Ned's, but has become strangely quixotic as he'd gotten older, and he seems oblivious to some of the real problems facing the realm, and Ned's days at court occur as the stability of said court is rapidly disintegrating.  Of course, it all ends up in war, but it's a carefully-crafted and meaningful conflict, which does come to, well, a resting point by the end of the novel.<br />However, it all feels like just the prologue to the real story, as there are much worse dangers hinted at elsewhere:  The beings beyond the northern wall, who seem to be getting more active as the long winter approaches.  And Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of the last Targaryen king, whom Robert and Ned overthrew 15 years earlier, who is engaged in her own adventure across the ocean which might prove at least as dangerous to the Seven Realms as the northern creatures.<br />The next few novels will not be very successful if they focus primarily on the ongoing conflicts among those within the Seven Realms.  The next novel has to start bringing one of the other threats out of the darkness or the story will quickly become idea-poor.<br />I wouldn't rate Game as highly as Martin's earlier novels Armageddon Rag or Fevre Dream, but it's quite good.  It's going to need a big payoff for the series to be wholly successful, though.  Currently slated for six volumes, I hear, I hope he's got a lot of neat tricks up his sleeve, because an ongoing run of intrigue and mundane battlefields isn't going to cut it for me.like just the prologue to the real story, as there are much worse dangers hinted at elsewhere:  The beings beyond the northern wall, who seem to be getting more active as the long winter approaches.

B00003CXI1|4.0|don't watch this movie without reading the books first because it sells it short.  in order to make the movie less than fifteen hours long, they had to do a lot of cutting.  they barely had room to get in all the major plot points.  unfortunately, the character development (one of the things that makes Harry Potter so cool) suffered a lot for it.  you have to read the books to truly appreciate the movie.  i know there's a lot of hype around the books, but it's one of the very few books that actually deserves the attention it is getting.  for those who already are familiar with Harry and the gang, this movie is like a homecoming.  you already know the characters, so the lack of character development (or inaccurate character development) doesn't really matter all that much.  it does capture the atmosphere and the mood of the harry potter books very well and is worth buying simply for that.  the special features are also really cool, and fun to play with.  on it's own, the movie is a good one.  it's fun and fast and very magical.  as part of the Harry Potter story, it's best if you just accept it as a visual aid to the books.

B00004Z1MN|5.0|Upon seeing the first trailers for \\"Frequency\\", I realized that this could be an extremely good movie. Upon seeing it on video, it quickly become of one of my favorite movies. I am still kicking myself for not going to the theater to see it, adding to my regret that the movie did not do as good at the box office as it should have.<br />Simply put, \\"Frequency\\" is a movie about second chances, regrets, justice, and reunion. Dennis Quaid, one of my favorite actors, puts in an outstanding performance as Frank Sullivan, fire-fighting baseball-lover extraordinaire, who dies in a warehouse fire in 1969, leaving his child and wife alone.<br />Fast-forward thirty years- it's 1999, and Frank's son John is working for the NYPD as a detective. John and his partner come across the remains of a woman killed a little over thirty years ago in a series of slayings dubbed the \\"Nightingale murders\\", as most of the victims were \\"Nightingale\\" nurses. As this discovery gives John a chance to close one element from the past, an odd appearance of the Northern Lights in N.Y. somehow messes with time, allowing John to communicate via a ham radio with his dead father.<br />From here, the two Sullivans hook up to stop the \\"Nightingale\\" killer across time, with results that must be experienced by the viewer. As Frank and John change past events, John's present becomes a combination of his real past, and the new one being made. But the question becomes- will John, being in the future, reach back and save his father from the fiery death that awaits him?<br />With great acting, superb storytelling, and emotion galore, \\"Frequency\\" is a tale that draws you in and, while you suspend reality, grips you till its heart-stopping finale. \\"Frequency\\" proves that movies can still be magical.
B00001NFCY|5.0|They may have been tagged as another Pearl Jam rip off, but nothing could be further from the truth! Creed definitely showers the listener with inspirational power ballads and uplifting melodies. While the best song on the entire CD is without a doubt \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", an ode to fatherhood, the band tackles everything from heartbreak (track #3 \\"Beautiful\\") to the terrible crime of rape (track #10 \\"Wash Away Those Years\\"). Front man Scott Stapp's spiritual, touching lyrics are only reinforced by the hard rocking of his fellow bands mates Mark Tremonti and Brian Marshall. This CD is a must have for rock lovers everywhere!
0679746048|3.0|Susanna Kaysen has done a very good job of criticizing and joking about the very serious problem of personality disorders in her memoir \\"Girl, Interrupted.\\" <br />Kaysen was only in her teens when she tried to commit suicide by taking 50 Aspirin. She states that she didn't really want to die, just to kill off the part of herself that wanted to. This rationalized thinking does improve the overall theme of the book. From her theories on the \\"brain interpretters\\" to her self-discriminatory evaluations of her teen troubles, Kaysen faces the problems uniquely with not only interest, but genuine light-heartedness.<br />The problem comes in that the book is written so lightly, it's hard to tell if Kaysen was honestly a mental patient or is only writing a \\"purposeful fiction.\\" Her poking and prodding at an individual's self-doubt of sanity does prove some points simply without the \\"psycho babble\\" in most mental hospital accounts. <br />Susanna talks about her shortcomings and failings as a teen. From her too-flirtatious personality to the doomed-from-the-start marriage that saved her from further mental hospitalization. She recalls admissions in sexuality with other patients. Her recollections of those who were finally able to recover and those whose conditions declined after leaving McLean Hospital. Her impartial and emotionless recount is good from a non-judgemental standpoint, it even would help people dealing with \\"wrist banging\\" and \\"is that an armoire or tiger in the corner.\\" However, the book is too short, too uninformative. She doesn't inform us how her failed marriage affects her. Why her borderline personality disorder was stopped short, her emotions on leaving the hospital, even her details of her perception of herself today is not as clear as it should be.<br />I applaud Susanna Kaysen for her brave recovery and admission to such a difficult problem. Her ability to make light of a troubled past is very admirable. I just didn't think the book was as satisfying asit could have been.
B000066JES|1.0|I have been a loyal and huge fan of Manowar since Battle Hymms came out in the early 80's. Over the years some records have been better than others but I always loved them because it was Manowar. \\"Warriors of the World\\" [is really bad]! I can not beleive this is the same band that wrote \\" The Gates of Valhalla\\" and \\"Blood of my Enemies\\" . I have been defending and standing up for Manowar since I was a little kid. Every [person] who made fun of them or did not see what was great about Manowar was a mission for me to get them into their music and vibe.  I've been to every local show and even had dinner with Manowar after a show once in NJ. But I have to say that this record is a big dissapointment. The lyrics and music are absolutly horrible. Usually the Metal Anthem song (Brothers of Metal etc...) is the worst track on a Manowar record. The Metal Anthem on this record is the only one I can listen to. The rest of the tracks are garbage. I really think it's time for them to hang it up. Joey and Eric have lost their way. Plain and simple : If your a fan of such songs as \\" March for Revenge\\" , \\"Bridge of Death\\" , \\"Hatred\\" and other great Manowar titles leave this record on the shelf. I already spent my hard earned cash on this horrible record. You shouldn't have to !

B000002KIE|5.0|... .<br />Johnny Rotten and his band transformed rock music and I really wonder how much of the punk attitude and look would have developed the way it did if the Pistols hadn't epitomized it so brilliantly.  Yes, the Ramones and the Clash and many others were making punk music of great quality, but I think we have to recognize that there was something different, of a higher order, going on here, regardless of whatever Malcolm, Johnny or anyone else might say about \\"swindles\\" and \\"filthy lucre\\" and so on.  Of course, they're not going to just come out and say, \\"yeah, we were brilliant social transformers\\" and I'm not sure that we can say their contributions were \\"constructive\\" in any sense. They wanna destroy, after all... but in any case, this CD is just the soundtrack to something much bigger that I think you need to more fully reckon with if you haven't already.<br />Of course, the Sex Pistols' moment has passed, and it's kind of futile to go chasing after it now.  But I was fortunate enough to be a teenager when this music came out, and I saw the whole thing unfold before me, in a way.  I got my hands on the import singles as they came out (not the first one, Anarchy in the UK, though.  I had to get that in a French pressing since the British was already banned and couldn't be exported.) To hear \\"God Save the Queen\\" and \\"Pretty Vacant\\" as new releases, obscure and incredibly out of fashion as they were in the context of 1977 rock and disco music, was indeed a revelation to me.  So when I go on at length about this CD, it's with all that in the background. (I also saw their last concert at Winterland in San Francisco.) <br />In short, the music on this disc is powerful, emotional, exhilirating, iconic, historic, profoundly individualistic, and worthy of your respect if you want to understand postmodern humanity.  Now I'll leave it up to you to determine just how serious I am when I say all that.  But in any case, \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" is a landmark recordingand a lot of fun too.

If you blues-loving Americans have anything else to buy across the pond, add this CD to the list. Even with import duty it'll save you a dollar or two on buying it in the States, if you don't pay a fortune on freight. Quite why an American CD is so much cheaper in the UK than in its country of origin is a question Amazon might like to address sometime. I'd love to know the answer!

0930289234|5.0|Ah, Watchmen. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br />1) The quality of the writing here is astonishing. I mean, all false modesty aside: I've read the New Testament, Shakespeare, Joyce, Toni Morrison - you name it. Alan Moore's writing is at that level. Seriously.<br />2) The artwork is incredibly beautiful. Dave Gibbons works squarely in the tradition of such comics greats as Wallace Wood and Bill Elder, but takes their work to a whole new level of symbolic complexity. Just the draftsmanship here will take your breath away.<br />3) The sense of cinema Moore and Gibbons bring to the work is beguiling. One almost has to look to films like Citizen Kane and Touch Of Evil (and novels like Ulysses and The Sound And The Fury) to find an analogy to the enormity of their accomplishment in this medium.<br />4) The juxtapositions of words and pictures are wonderful. Moore and Gibbons are constantly playing text off illustration (and vice versa) to often stunning, often hilarious effect.<br />5) \\"Marooned\\", the comics-story-within-a-comics-story in Chapters III through XI, is one of the most harrowing things I've ever read in my life.<br />6) I love the way the story, like Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, ends up where it begins. As Manhattan finally says to Ozymandias, \\"'In the end'? NOTHING ends, Adrian. Nothing EVER ends.\\"
B00005JKQZ|2.0|This film details the life of brilliant Princeton professor, John Nash, and hit battle to maintain his sanity in the face of schizophrenia.  After many trials and tribulations with the disorder, his work gets recognized and he receives the Nobel Prize.<br />There are several inaccuracies in the film, while other details get left out altogether.  The most glaring error?  They couldn't even get Nash's theory right!  The example in the movie is not a Nash equilibrium.  What were they thinking?  How did this screenplay win an Oscar?????<br />The storyline is slow in spots, and borrows its main plot element from the Sixth Sense (to some degree anyway).  It does work decently enough.  Ron Howard showed absolutely no ability to convey emotion in this film, instead choosing to drown everything out with that hideous score any time a scene with the potential for emotional impact came along.  Jennifer Connelly was ok, but her perfomance was not memorable by any means.  I didn't find her performance all that believable, but I think that's more the fault of the script.<br />There is only one redeeming quality to this film, and his name is Russell Crowe.  Ironically enough, he was the one main person involved in this film not to win the Oscar (though he should have).  He is the reason I find this movie to be \\"all right\\" instead of a huge disappointment.  He really seems to capture the psyche of Nash, and his performance is very believable.  He lays the groundwork for emotional scenes which unfortunately get ruined by Howard with that score.  Only minor nitpick was that Russell looks a little too built to play Nash,<br />The best description of this film was from something I read online (sorry, don't remember the exact source):<BR>\\"That which was good, was not original.  That which was original, was not good.\\"
B00005JL9B|5.0|This is the only review i've ever wrote for amazon, adn that is becuase of the amazing impression this film has made on me.  Yes this movie is very violent and deals with high school students fighting eachother for thier lives, but you have no way of understanding the depth this film has unless YOU SEE IT. I can not wait for the dvd release, ill buy it ASAP. do yourself a favor and pick this one up. I doubt you would be reading the review if you dont like this kind of movie anyways. Thank you Kinji and Beat for such a great movie!
0380789035|5.0|A friend of mine told me, more than once, that I had to read this book. He was quite insistent about the whole thing because he knows I have an abiding love for all things mythological, especially Norse. I had picked it up, put it down, you know the routine, but didn't acutally buy it till I had a long plane ride looming in front of me. Turns out I should have listened to my friend to begin with(and I liked the book enough to actually tell him that, too.)<br />The thing that caught my attention, and held it as the book went on, was just how clever Gaiman was in terms of weaving bits of Norse mythology throughout the story. I sat there, shaking my head, smiling, as something familiar popped up, fell into place. This whole aspect of it was so wonderfully done that that would have been enough to sustain me, to keep me thinking about the book long after I reluctantly put it aside.<br />But, the thing is, Gaiman created some really wonderful, compelling characters to popluate his America. Shadow was a wonderful protagonist. I liked being in his mind, following him around, waiting to see how he'd handle whatever was going to come at him next. He's never adequately described(except for everyone constantly pointing out that he's &quot;big&quot;)and yet you get a picture perfect image of him in mind. And there is a score of secondary characters that, as long as they meant you no harm, you'd eagerly welcome into your life.<br />There are some aspects of the novel that seem unfinished. One particularly that I would like to have seen more of was Shadow's encounter with Bast--it seemed like there should have been something more there and I would have ate it up if there had been. And there are other little tidbits/questions that are never assigned an answer or explanation. However, this doesn't take away from the novel, but instead compels you to come up with some explanation of your own.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, didn't want to put it down, and will definitely pick it up to read again. Plus, I just bought *Neverwhere*, so Gaiman must have left a favorable impression in my mind.t up to read again.

B000068TPN|5.0|I opposed the Vietnam  war and still do but my opposite number is right--this is a great movie (I also suggest the book and the ABC special where the soldiers return to the Ia Drang valley after thirty years) This movie isdedicated to the Americans AND Vietnamese who died during the battle of the Ia Drang. It is thoughtful, respectful of the enemy and gives our soldiers the credit they were denied when they came home. I have  gotten into rows with \\"Anti-War\\" friends who protest any effort to glorify our soldiers. They talk the talk but basically were chickens--with ideology but no empathy.  Communism has nothing to do with it.   whatever  The  Vietnamese were as the book says a brave and worthy foe--and our soldiers (who the chicken anti-war movement jeered) were brave and worthy--heroes in what I regard as a monstrous war.  I was crying after the movie. I was ashamed I did not go to Vietnam--even though I would have gone only as a medic.

6302413931|4.0|It was the original movie that so impressed me and still does.  It's the original that I have in my collection.  <br />To understand this film, one must realize that it is a subjective view of the war in Vietnam.  It is not the war as it really was, and I do not believe that the intent was there.  The intent was to portray the inner turmoil of the principal characters.  Many of these characters are not truly military types.  They are plain ordinary people whose lot in life put them into a dirty, nasty war.  <br />This is a must see film, and that is not saying that you will like it, or consider it worthy of the four stars I give it.  It is a must see film so that you're aware of it.  And try to realize as you watch it that this is a story of man at war as much with his inner nature as in the physical enemy.  <br />Lots has been said about this film, and I have given you my slant on it to be read in conncection with the perceptions of the other reviewers.  You might not want to see it as entertainment, but if you give it a chance, it will stimulate you into using your mind, and though you might well come to different conclusions than others who've seen it, you will have exercised your mental facilities while watching this
B00002Z88D|2.0|You know, there is a very good reason parrellel 5ths (which are used %90 of the time in most metallica songs) are avoided when composing classical music. It starts sounding baaaad. Low crunchy guitars do not compliment violins, cellos, flutes, ect.  The orchistra instruments must screach and wail to compete with Metallica's crash-bang-grunt playing style.  I promise you, you will be SICK TO YOUR STOMACH about 3-4 songs in.  Maybe if they went acoustic (like that will ever happen), it could have worked. DO NOT BUY THIS.
B00004U30D|4.0|Right from the beginning, you get the message of aloneness of the person and lack of communication in the family.  The filming here is absolutely spellbinding.  You see image after image of the family so eerily apart.  And there is something of this in each person's everyday life.  That's one reason why this film is so darn disturbing.  <br />This is not an easy film, and I suspect many viewers gave up on it early, rather than try to meld with it and understand what it's truly about.  And don't expect me to tell you what it's truly about, because I am sure that there's a subjective element here and that film has different messages for different people, if they will open up to receive it.<br />There are touchy issues here, and it is so easy to misunderstand what the movie is saying.  It sure isn't saying that happiness is reverting to the teenage perspective.  Kevin Spacey's character does this, but I don't believe he has really found happiness or satisfaction.  He, and each character here, is seeking in his or her own way to make sense out of the life they are in, and each has moments of frustration.<br />Like so many looks at life, though, this movie presents more questions than answers.  Each somehow messes up, and the question is how could each have done better.  Maybe by melting the separation which is so feelingly portrayed here?  <br />Lots of intelligent and well meaning people hate this film.  If you haven't seen it, I would say to see it and form your opinion.  And if you saw it, but hated it...hey, maybe a second look?  Might be worth a try...
B00005JKGK|1.0|This movie can be summed up in six words: Asian women good, Asian men bad.  <br />The positive portrayal of Asian American women in this movie comes mostly at the expense of their male counterparts, which is extremely disappointing.
0783226063|2.0|Trying to squeeze the entire book into a mere two hours was a mistake from the beginning.  The subtelties and intricacies that make up the story are largely absent in this rushed collection of events.  Many of the main characters have only a few quick lines and are then quickly shoved aside by the action.<BR>  <BR>  David Lynch's portrayal of the Dune universe is a pseudo-psychedelic vision tinged with acid green.  Since when is Thufir Hawat's anti-venom produced by a very skinny white cat?  Why are the Sardakaur portrayed as big monsters wearing baggy silver space suits?  They swat at people with their big arms, have green gas swirling behind their faceplates, and run about like claymation technozombies.  What a disgrace!  The emperor's elite troops are supposed to be rugged veteran swordfighters, NOT funked up astronauts from the fourth planet of the Braxomeel system.  The mentats look awful.  They have munchkinland hair and wear bright red lipstick.  Feyd Rautha should not have been played by Sting with his greased up cherry-orange koolaid hair and silly adolescent sneer.  Why does pulling tubes out of a still suit cause someone to bleed to death?  Ridiculous!<BR>   To cap it all off, the Fremen get rid of their knives in the final battle and start using wierd boxes that shoot mysterious cosmic rays.  In the book, it was all sword fighting!  The battle between the two toughest armies in the known universe was spoiled.  The silver suited Sardakaur morons run around in circles as they are all blasted away by magical beams of quasi-protons.<br />What an insult to a great and sophisticated work of literature!  Half of the important scenes are edited out or cut to a sliver and yet the script includes a scene where a navigator visits the emperor in its spice fish tank.  David Lynch's Dune is an attempt to compress too much into too little and it fails to capture the enigmatic spirit of Arrakis despite a dazzling array of special effects.
B00005JKGK|1.0|This movie can be summed up in six words: Asian women good, Asian men bad.<br />The positive portrayal of Asian American women in this movie comes mostly at the expense of their male counterparts, which is extremely disappointing.  There is no Asian male the same age as the main characters who is portrayed in a positive light - instead they appear prominently as rapists, wife beaters, and simply dorky.  And there is also a blatant double standard - in the happy ending one main character divorces her Asian-American husband for his concern for splitting their bills 50/50, whereas another main character stays with her caucasian husband after he openly admits to cheating on her.
B00003CY6L|5.0|The men in my house may sneer, but my 13 year old daughter and I love good romantic comedy (and John Cusack!).  This move was a fun evening for the two of us.  Don't pick it apart, just relax and enjoy.
B00003CXDV|4.0|What a fun film. I enjoyed this enormously. Especially Sigirney Weaver doing comedy. She has some of the best lines.<br />This directly takes a slap at the Sci Fi Genere and Sci FI conventions overall. (Not to mention the egos of certain famous Star Trek Celebrities - without using their names.)<br />The DVD is fun and the best part is the Duel Language. The entire movie has been sub-tracked in the Alien Language. Like anyone could understand it, but just watching it is histerical!<br />Tim Allen and all the cast are great and it is has wrap-around ending. Very cool. This is one for the whole family.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I really love the way the planes flew through the house very naturally.  Even on a Dolby Pro Logic system, it sounded so real.  The transition of the air planes flying from the back to the front was very accurate, real-like, and smooth.  Also, having this in a 2.35:1 original aspect ratio, it gave more breathing room for them planes to fly, unlike some butchered up version you'd get on VHS.  Speaking of which, I saw the first 5 minutes of Pearl Harbor on Pay Per View and it was Pan and Scanned to a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and it was bad.  It looked too tight.  Imagine what having it P&Sed down to 1.33:1 would look like.  If you want to see this movie, don't watch it on PPV, or any of the movie channels, but watch it on DVD.  The special effects and the visuals will blow you away.  My Passive subwoofer was rockin' too.  I was surprized.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I'm getting annoyed at all these people criticizing &quot;18.&quot;<br />&quot;It's more of the same.&quot;<br />&quot;It sounds like PLAY.&quot;<br />&quot;It sounds like B-sides of PLAY.&quot;<br />Enuf already. Moby makes music his way. If you want something different, find another artist. You got a limited attention span? Find some other amusement. Find some other wagon to jump on. If you can't accept a man who has developed his own style, a style that works, mind you, if you can't accept this album for what it is, leave already.<br />Yes, &quot;18' is similar to PLAY.<br />But as an album it's even BETTER than PLAY.<br />Cohesive, melancholy, brooding, anthemic, and ultimately uplifting, it is the perfect album for writing to, making out to, working out to, or slipping on headphones and walking to.<br />I will admit that the best moments of PLAY exceed the best moments of &quot;18&quot;, but overall Moby has outdone himself here.<br />This will probably sound arrogant, but I think intelligent listeners will really get a kick out this album.<br />Radiohead may be blazing wild new trails year to year, but you can't hold it against Moby for sticking to and perfecting his.
0553275976|4.0|This book, written in the 1980s about New York of the early- to mid-1980s, while not fresh, is certainly not irrelevant. Most of the character types are clearly recognizable as extant forces in the city and the nation.<br />The plot of the book is nothing remarkable per se. It takes a while to materialize and is mildly interesting, but nothing about it is especially clever. A bad, dumb, white guy -- rich and insensitive of course -- is screwing around on his wife with a golddigger. Through circumstances beyond his control he is involved in a seemingly minor incident that balloons up and takes over his life, making it, and him, into something very different, (and, we presume, better) than it, and he, was before. Along the way, some good guys pop up, some bad guys pop up, and some guys you thought were good but turn out to be bad pop up. <br />Wolfe does a good job in getting into his characters' minds and letting us in on what they're thinking and feeling along the way. Wolfe's writing gets in the way of the story, however. He is overly descriptive of the surroundings to the point that one soon tires it -- at least I did. It came to the point that I skipped over entire paragraphs devoted to descriptions of furniture and wall hangings. <br />Some of the more memorable parts of the book involve the parties the rich white guy and his wife attend, with hilarious, almost Vonnegut-like descriptions of the attendees' laughs. Wolfe also does his readers a service for a look inside the fourth estate. To those of us who think the news media have a particular axe to grind it is enlightening to see them cast as mere grubbers, each after his or her own moment of fame. (A phrase from another book -- The Martian Race by Gregory Benford -- comes to mind -- \\"the snout of the media pig had worked its way under the tent...\\")<br />It is amusing to think that many of the events so central to the plot are now meaningless due to technology - cell and satellite phones, the Internet and cable news, and the widespread availability of credit cards, to name a few. All in all though, this is not a bad book. It is overly long and tedious in spots, but it's worth reading if for no other reason than it provides a look back into the marvelous '80s, and a reminder that human nature never changes.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is one of the funnest movies I have ever seen.  Val Kilmer's hero is witty, yet tender.  Jean Marsh played an incredibly believable Queen Bavmorda.  I thought Joanne Whalley was beautiful.  Billy Barty's role was memorable too.  I can't say enough good about this movie.  I give it 5 stars!!!!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Lynch is either insane or brilliant!  I started viewing this with low expectations, given my disappointment in Lost Highway, but the next day and the day after... I was still thinking about this film and curious about Lynch's intent and the layers of mystery.  (For great insights, check out the reviews on the Rotten Tomatoes website.  Read about his use of color, the connection the the Black Dahlia murder case and other clues to really appreciate this film.)  He repeats a lot of themes and metaphors in his films.  Fans of Twin Peaks (TV series and the film) and Blue Velvet and Eraserhead will recognize Lynch's techniques. Again and again, he gives us quirky, baffling imagery that both amuses and terrifies.   I think ultimately, several of his films to date are progress toward a film not yet made, one that will be his signature piece.  I suspect that if the rumor of Lynch making a movie about the Black Dahlia is true, that could be THE movie for Lynch.  He certainly is able to create the atmosphere -- we see dreamy, starry-eyed optimism that morphs into desperation and terror.  I think that with Mulholland Drive, Lynch is closer to this realization than ever before.
B00005ASHM|4.0|I like the Beach Boys, but I have to admit that I prefer their earlier California style hits (e.g., Fun, Fun, Fun) and I'm not a big fan of 60s music.  Nevertheless, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is undeniably a beautiful CD that still sounds great today.  \\"Sloop John B\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" were top 10 hits in the US and \\"God Only Knows\\" and \\"Caroline, No\\" cracked the top 40, but all the songds sound great.  Brian Wilson's voice has never sounded more beautiful and the harmonies are near-perfect.  As a bonus, \\"Hang on to Your Ego\\" is included (it was recorded at the same time, but not released).  It's a great song and may be familiar to alt rock fans via a remake by Frank Black.  The liner notes are also terrific and include comments from Brian Wilson as well as a song by song description.  Great CD!
B000062TU1|5.0|Let's make this short and sweet. After buying this exact DVD from Amazon, I have played it over and over. The DVD extras are worth the price alone as you can do everything Harry did before getting to Hogwarts. The trivia games will test even the most astute Harry-phile. Not to mention the movie itself is fantastic. After seeing it in theaters, I went out and bought the first three novels in paperback and read each cover to cover. Now I wait for Book Four to be released in paperback, so I can continue my Harry Potter story following. All in all, this movie is fantastic as it doesn't leave hardly anything out from the book. My only sadness is that Chris Columbus will not be directing the third installment, as I feel he has a real knack for this series. So buy it, enjoy it, and as the commercial says...BRING THE MAGIC HOME.
6305280762|2.0|It had three times the budget of \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\", yet it's less than half as effective. Towering Inferno proved once again that more money, more stars, and more hype don't always account for much when it comes to good filmmaking.  Irwin Allen tried a little too hard here to duplicate the extraordinary, and well deserved success and praise he had with Poseidon.  Unfortunately the result is an overblown, often boring, big-budget mess.<br />**SPOILER AHEAD**  The dumbest part, and most shameless Poseidon rip-off comes near the end of the movie with the whole idea of \\"lets destroy another beautiful room (hosting a gala event) with as much fire, water, and death as possible.\\"  It's The Poseidon Adventure all over again, just 135 floors high this time.  I mean really, how was Irwin Allen ever going to incorporate all those wonderful flooding rooms and corridors of the S.S. Poseidon into a ridiculously tall skyscraper (which we are expected to believe would have been built on top of the San Andreas Fault)?  By blowing up huge zillion gallon capacity water tanks on the roof, and the three floors just below of course!<br />The movie is dedicated to \\"the firefighters of the world\\" and was intended to pay homage to their heroic efforts.  Unfortunately the film succeeds in doing just the opposite--continually exhibiting just how bumbling, helpless and ineffective they are in a situation like this.<br />The real action sequences are few and far between, and many of them are so long and drawn out that they hardly induce heart-pounding excitement or suspense.  Most notably a scene in which Bobby Brady and others try to climb down a mangled staircase for what seems like hours.<br />Towering Inferno is not completely awful, but it certainly can't hold a candle (no pun intended) to the true ruler of the disaster genre, \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\".
B00006690F|5.0|Em is truly one of the illest MCs in the history of hip hop.  You can't doubt his skills and he can beat the competition at their own game.  He burnt Jay Z on his own track and has everyone in the game looking over their own material two or three times to see if it even stacks up.  Thats when you know you got skills, when cats are afraid of you.  The Eminem Show has everything you could want on it, and just when you think it will drop off at the end, Em picks it up and lites a fire under you.  If you don't have this album get, its the best thing you can ever do.  If you manage to get you hands on the DVD, its ten times better
6304698623|5.0|Very few recent children's movies portray young characters who are capable of kindness, empathy, intelligence and who possess, as well, an adventurous, imaginative spirit. A child watching this movie sees Sara practicing all these attributes and is treated to lush and artful cinematography that, during a few of the scenes, nearly takes your breath away.  It reminded me of some of the Latin American literature classified as &quot;magical realism&quot;.  I am grateful that Alfonso Cuaron has directed a family movie that I, the parent, will enjoy watching again and again.  I think that the children watching this film will also benefit on many different levels.  The film may be different from the written version but it illustrates an important topic with its treatment of the classic story; how it is possible for people/children to face adversity.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I've been reading.  I notice that people really like John Mayer.  I've noticed that other people really don't like him.  Technically, I should hate him.  Why?  He does appeal to the teenie boppers a little too much.  He is a little too happy.  He is a little cocky (only applies if you've seen him live).  He is a little too good looking.  Comparisons of him to Dave Matthews are thrown around too easily.<BR>Why don't I hate him?  He puts on an excellent live show.  He is a highly skilled guitarist.  He is a charismatic performer.  Here's a perk for all you boy-band haters: In some of his shows, he makes fun of the Backstreet Boys (oh oh, and he keeps his shirt on).  A final reason I like him: he writes songs like 3X5.  It has a mature message, and beautiful imagery.  <BR>Mayer writes some songs that appeal to the pop mentality (Body is A Wonderland, No Such Thing, and Love Song For No One (I swear, he must have been thinking sitcom theme song with this one)).  But, he goes a little deeper with other songs that, while too naive for HIS age, are things that college age kids go throw, and teenies THINK they go through (Great Indoors, Not Myself, St. Patrick's Day; and my favorite, 3X5). <BR>When Mayer comes out with a new CD, I hope he pursues more meaningful topics, but his current release is a lighthearted escape from my usual deeper and more mature taste.
B00005MP58|2.0|I adore the adaptation, the actors, everything. I would love to give this the 5 stars it deserves, I own the miniseries on both the 6 VHS set and this special edition DVD. For convenience sake, the DVD is well, easier; no more waiting to rewind and plugging in a new tape every hour. However, if this is your reason for upgrading, I say burn it from your tapes.<br />This DVD is such low quality, you realize from the first scene the degredation, you can barely see Netherfield when Bingly and Darcy first consider the property. The cuts between episodes are choppy and startling at times, the music does not always align correctly. I ignored a similar review when buying mine, thinking that I am not such a stickler, or film buff that I will notice so much, and I admit here I was wrong. I now cherish the Netherfield ball because for some reason the color and sound of that scene is far superior to the rest of the film.<br />Even with the low quality sacrificed, still they could not fit it all on one disc with extra features on the second? This DVD is deplorable; and I truly wish the reformatting was entrusted to one of the many fan'atic's, of this otherwise near perfect film, who would have done it credit. I can only hope a remastered version will be released.
B00005OAIE|3.0|John Mayer is awful?  John Mayer is awesome?  Now, who am I to believe?  There don't seem to be many in-the-middle music lovers out there when it comes to John Mayer.  If this is possible, I like this CD, but I think it is horrible.  I have been told that I am a music elitist.  They're probably right, but I seem to find room for Room for Squares (excuse the pun).  It offers lighthearted themes, which run the risk of becoming boy band material.  And while I tend to like different music (Saves the Day, Jump Little Children, Ben Folds, Starsailor, and most of all Travis) with more meaningful themes, I do like Mayer.  Perhaps it's because I saw him a year before the hype, when he was opening for the Wallflowers.  I often get to say I heard him first, and I just eat that up.    <BR>  If you haven't heard John Mayer, and don't want to because you think he'll lower your status as a music lover, just give it a chance.  Try to block out all the hype and all of the responding negativity.  They're both wrong.  <BR>  Just listen to Mayer.  You can hate him.  You can love him.  Justify your responce though. That goes double for all Mayer lovers.  You seem to only be able to say &quot;Dude, he like totally like rocks my world.  Oh... My ...God!! He is such a hot new performer.&quot;  Kudos to those who don't like him for your great justification and suggestions for more established/talented/unique/just plain better artists.<BR>For those with short attention spans, John Mayer is: Catchy at times, soulful at times, naive at times, mature at times.  He is listener friendly, but generally sincere and intelligent.
B000065U1N|4.0|one of the better war movies out there,good graphic's.
068484267X|5.0|\\"Angela's Ashes\\" is about a young irish-american boy named frank MCcourt,who lives through the poverty of the 1920's. He is born into a poor family in New York to his parents Angela Sheehan And Malachy MCcourt. They later move back to limereck,Ireland hoping they will have a better life. Frank tells about his harsh life growing up at those times.<br />My favorite part the book was when his baby sister was born.Frank had many siblings in the past, but most of them starved to death back in New York. His sisters name was Margaret and looked like her mother with black curly hair and blue eyes. margaret was so special because she was the first daughter to be born in the MCcourt family. Her father loved her very much. Every time she started to cry,he would sing to her until she stoped crying. I thought this was very nice of the father.<br />I would recomend this book to people who like to read about the harsh realty of life. This book helped me realize that I should appreciate what I have. this book goes into detail about the how hard it was to live at those times.
0312958455|5.0|I have read most, if not all of the Harry Bosch books by this author, although not in sequence. I felt that this one gave me as good an insight into Harry's character as one is likely to get. Harry has been suspended from duty for assaulting his commanding officer. Of course, being Harry, he had a good reason. The guy who has little or no field training completely ruined an important interrogation in which he had no business meddling in. That is the sort of thing which gets Harry's attention and coupled with his lack of respect for the man as one who should be commanding detectives, he sort of takes things into his own hands.<br />This gets Harry some time off and while he is contemplating his past conduct with the help of a psychologist, Harry decides to use the time to try and solve a very old open murder case. The murder happens to be of his own mother. Harry's Mom was a prostitute/call girl whose body was found in a dumpster. Harry was eleven at the time and living as a ward of the state.<br />With his detective skills Harry starts to stir into the past and in doing so numerous possibilities arise as to who his mother's murderer is and some of them are people in high places. This is a whodunit which will keep you up and reading, longer than you might care to and I guarantee that the answer will be only part of the surprises that await the reader. This is a fine read!
B00005QG9J|2.0|That pretty much sums it up. So does the fact that this sounds like if Sugar Ray went to Graduate School. To be kind, this is actually a lot better than most of what's out there. But that's not really saying much.
B000063DHL|4.0|Here we have the sixth studio album from British masterminds Harris, Dickerson, and Smith.  Murray and McBrain may have minds, but they haven't mastered them yet.  Following the HUGELY succesful World Slavery Tour of 1984-1985, Maiden releases this album in familiar fasion.  8 songs, with the same band members from the previous 3 albums (I know Clive Burr drummed on Beast, but thats quite irrelevent).  The twist with this one however is the introduction of synthesizers.  Critics were quick to point out that Maiden \\"can't use synths\\", afterall they are a metal band.  Anyway, It's not a big deal.  <br />Having been a Maiden fan since 1985 and after hearing all of their work, I rate this album better than anything that came after Seventh Son, equal to Piece of mind, but not as good as Powerslave.  Don't be afraid of buying it, I just place Powerslave as the definitive 80's 'thinking mans' metal album.  Noteworthy tracks on Somewhere are Alexander The Great, Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, and Stranger in a Strange Land.  Deja-vu and Sea of Madness rock as well.  My only problem with this album is the repetition of the chorus in many songs.  How many times does Bruce have to say 'caught somewhere in time' or 'Heven can wait'.  This is a problem that plagued Maiden from this point on; taking a perfectly good chorus and beating it to death.  Other than that, it is a fine album.  The guitar work is excellent as usual, the lyrics are thoughtful, and Bruce's voice is still in the zone.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|As if the guitar playing weren't enough, how about those harmonies? Plus there's elements of motown, classical, and punk. Not too many people know that VH had seriously flirted with the idea of being a punk band. But they made an 11th hour decision not to go in that direction. You can hear what might have been on songs like &quot;I'm On Fire&quot; and &quot;Atomic Punk.&quot; More than anything, this album swings. Especially &quot;Jamie's Crying.&quot; Overall, this is the most energetic debut album ever. It makes all the silly rock music currently out there sound even sillier.
B000002N3J|4.0|... Her pop savvy is illustrated by a sixth sense when it comes to working with the best people - especially songwriters. I wouldn't call myself a Madonna fan, but she always does great ballads, and the best ones are all here. 'This Used to be my Playground', 'I Remember' and 'Live to Tell' are examples of classy, sophisticated songwriting and a crisp production. With the exception of her cover version of 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore', 'Something to Remember' is a great compilation of sophisticated ballads spanning the whole of Madonna's career from the mid-80s to today. A great gift for just about anyone.
B00005ATQD|5.0|The late master Stanley Kubrick has always provoked thought through his films.  In &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; he showed us the importance of a free will and in &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; he almost humorously showed how men are turned into killers (just to give a few examples).  But this final work, and probably his greatest should hit home to almost everyone in our society, simply because it's a commentary on monogomy.  <br />The movie follows an ideal couple, whose marriage is challenged through psychological and physical infidelity.  Kubrick shows us how dangerous fantasys can be, sometimes even more than physical confrontations.  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; cuts through all the superficial answers and shows the reality of our animalistic natures as humans.  But even though their urges go beyond the line of reason, they still as partners, strive to maintain their union.  Nicole Kidman's last line in the film almost shockingly states the pure, true mold to their relationship and to almost all relationships.  Ugly truth, but deep down.<br />The performances by both Kidman and Cruise, were very well played, this being said by probably the MOST anti-Hollywood spectator out there.  They really impressed me, what can I say.  Not only is the plot grade A, but the imagery is, well, like all Kubrick films, very spectacular.  Like all Kubrick's dvds, unfortunately, the package is very unsatisfactory.  I have no idea why all his dvds give you just the bare minimum.  Either way, it's the only thing out there and the movie itself is definately worth the buy.
B000002GQH|5.0|\\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" followed \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\". This album has a darker feel to it than \\"The Lost Chord,\\" which periodically became lightly whimsical (\\"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume\\" as an example) and was generally upbeat.<br />\\"Threshold\\" begins with a somewhat paranoid interchange between several characters that in a few short sentences explores individuality in modern computerized society. While Graeme Edge is generally upbeat in that he says that as individuals we can \\"...perceive the web they weave and keep on thinking free,\\" the sinister tone of \\"Big Brother's got your number\\" starts the album off darkly. From this beginning, the other songs in the album are now interpreted by this initial tone. Furthermore, the closeout by the last three Mike Pinder selections, \\"Have You Heard\\" parts 1 and 2 and \\"The Voyage,\\" end the album in a melancholy fashion that also reflects on the other tracks, of which many are melancholy themselves.<br />In spite of the dark mood of the album, it is still great for those times when you are a bit moody yourself. For some reason I enjoy listening to this album when it's raining outside, or when I'm feeling down. You would think that the album would drive me further into the depths of depression, but it does not. Instead, it tends to make me think about why I am depressed and ultimately overcoming those issues cheers me up. Okay, it's a little weird, but it works for me.<br />How is the album? Very good. This album was again experimental and further associated the Moodies name with progressive rock. The dialogue at the beginning of the album and \\"The Dream\\" by Graeme Edge seguing into \\"Have You Heard Part 1\\", followed by \\"The Voyage\\" which then takes you back to \\"Have You Heard Part 2\\", while being a signature feature of Moodies albums, was still very new to the world in 1969. While the music is very mellow, even for 1969, it was also in some ways more dreamily psychedelic than \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\". As examples, the aforementioned Mike Pinder selections, \\"Never Comes the Day\\" by Justin Hayward, and \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\", an awesome way-too-short song by Justin Hayward and Ray Thomas. This album is great for a bottle of good wine, a dimly lit room, perhaps some black light posters (seriously!), and whatever else you want to add that fits the mood.<br />The lyrics are often cryptic in this album, for example, just what the heck do the lyrics of \\"Never Comes the Day\\" by Justin Hayward mean anyway? One enjoyable feature of Moodies lyrics are that that is exactly the point of the lyrics: they are intentionally cryptic. Yes, they meant something to the authors. However, the authors are often vague enough to allow you to interpret them to fit your own life. The Moodies have traditionally been able to make lyrics sufficiently vague that they can easily be interpreted to fit your needs, while making very listenable songs that don't really have to be interpreted. I believe this album may have been the best of the classic 7 to achieve both these abilities for a majority of the songs. A very interesting approach that works well for the Moodies that others have not been able to pull off nearly as well or at all.<br />Graeme Edge, as noted above, has two selections on this album. I truly enjoy \\"The Dream\\", which may be Graeme Edge's very best \\"poem monologues\\" on any album by the Moodies. There is a lot of symbolism and true blues in this poem that is the perfect lead-in for the three Mike Pinder selections following.<br />Ray Thomas authored \\"Dear Diary\\", \\"Lazy Day\\" and coauthored \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\" with Justin Hayward. \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\" is by far the best of the three, and I think is the best song on the album. \\"Lazy Day\\" is likely the most whimsical song of this CD, and perhaps the least blue.<br />Mike Pinder, in addition to the last three songs, also penned \\"So Deep Within You,\\" a love song about knowing what's in your lover's heart. This song isvery beautiful and easy to understand. Mike's contributions to this album are consistently good and among the best of the album.<br />John Lodge wrote back to back love songs, \\"Send Me No Wine\\" and \\"To Share Our Love\\". Both are fast-paced (for this album), and both are good. \\"To Share Our Love\\" is the better of the two, and exploits John's voice well.<br />Justin Hayward, in addition to the excellent \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\", also wrote \\"Lovely to See You\\", which is a song of friendship helping alleviate the blues (which you may need after listening to this album!), and \\"Never Comes the Day\\", which I think is a song of love, but it's mixed with other concepts that are difficult to put my finger on. Regardless, it's a good song.<br />If you are a Moodies fan, buy this. If you are not, and want to listen to something different, buy this. Is it dated? A little perhaps, but not a lot. The lyrics are about concepts that transcend time. This album is incredibly mellow. It is the third album of the second incarnation of the Moody Blues, and the last album by the Moodies to be this spacey and psychedelic. After this they begin to tackle issues of the environment and how we treat each other and our role in the universe. This album is very unique and should be part of the reason to induct the Moody Blues into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (why that hasn't yet I haven't the foggiest clue). It is fitting that this album was released in 1969, a fitting close to an exotic decade.very beautiful and easy to understand.

0553296981|4.0|1.  This book is all about a young thirteen year old girl who is Jewish, and this is her diary about how she got through life in hiding.  The story is about her diary, and everything that she had written.  The diary is about she lives daily and she tells the diary everything that happens to her and her family.  In the beginning, she tells the diary that she calls Kitty, everything about her family and her childhood. Later on, she tells about her life and when something happens, she puts it in her diary.  She tells how her family and two other families go into hiding.  Later on, she tells the diary how unconfident she was and how scared she was.<br />2.  I didn't like this book because it was especially long, and it got boring after about 60 pages.  The way she wrote in her diary was repetitive, and it seemed that she was doing the same thing everyday.  It didn't seem like anything was changing in her life. The way she just played around with boys was not that good of an impression.<br />3.  My favorite part in the book is when Anne talks about when boys always follor her around and fall in love with her.  The way boys just fall over heels for her is amazing.  I like how the boys walk her home on their bicycles, and talk with her on their way to the house.  I like how when she knows that the boys are going to far that she just walks away from them.

6305161879|4.0|Starting with the commonplace idea of a jewel robbery gone maniacally wrong, actor John Cleese and director Charles Crichton manage have created a madcap comedy that remains fresh, even after 10 years.  George (Tom Georgeson), assisted by his girlfriend Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), his best pal Ken (Michael Palin) and Wanda's 'brother' Otto (Kevin Kline) has orchestrated a robbery that has only one fatal flaw - none of the participants have any intention of sharing the loot.  In short order, double-crosses seem to grow on trees and George finds himself under arrest.  It is only fitting that Wanda and Otto simultaneously discover that the jewels have been moved 'for safekeeping.'<br />It doesn't take very long for Wanda to figure out that her only hope of regaining the loot is through George's barrister, Archie Leach (John Cleese).  Wanda works at seducing Leach while fighting of Otto's psychotic fits of jealousy.  Ken, in the meantime, attempts repeatedly to kill the only witness, an elderly woman.  Unfortunately, he manages to assassinate all three of her dogs in the process.<br />This is a set up for the combination of slapstick, vulgarity, and tongue-in-cheek comedy that British films are noted for and Americans love and it is delivered with an almost evil verve.  Cleese is determined to take no prisoners, and the landscape is littered with car crashes, fallen masonry, savaged canines (fake savaged canines, please) and hapless victims.  Only the fish (also called Wanda) has no funny lines, and fares no better than her companion 'Lunch' does.<br />The film has an R rating, which I think is exaggerated.  In reality, its vulgarity and sexual innuendo are hardly noticeable when compared to what is accepted today.  I certainly think teenagers can handle it without permanent damage, although you may have to explain to them that certain phrases don't bear repeating.  At this price, expect a bare bones DVD.  No added games, no interviews, just the film in French and English, in both wide screen and standard presentations.  Even so, this is a classic comedy that will bear much watching., in both wide screen and standard presentations.  Even so, this is a classic comedy that will bear much watching.
0140143505|4.0|I just read this book in less than two hours and I am left with a very nice feeling about &quot;friendship&quot;.  Friendship comes in many forms and this book is thereby proof. If you love books, love talking to your friends about books and have had a long distance friendship, this is a book you will be able to relate to.  The mere descriptiveness of these letters amazes me. <br />I also was completely unaware that this was a true interaction. I have since come to realize that is the case.  I was reading this book believing it was fiction until I actually realized the author was one and the same.  I'm pleasantly surprised by my own innitial confusion.<br />I have a friend in England I have never met in person.  But he's still my best friend. I'm going to send him a copy of this book. It says what I have never found the words to portray.  It saddens me that Ms. Hanff never made it to England.  I can only hope that will never happen to me. This book inspires me to save more and more pennies to make that trip happen.<br />This book is just plain great.
B00005Y23E|5.0|This album is great.  The first cd is great, and the extra tracks are really pretty good.   The second cd is pretty good too, and it is interesting to hear some classic Marley remixed (ex. Buffalo Soldier).   The second cd is worth the money, as are the two extra tracks.   The packaging and liner notes are great, so if you're looking for some good, all-inclusive Bob Marley music, go with this album.   Personal favorite: &quot;No Woman, No Cry.&quot;  Even for the casual fan, this is the perfect album.   I liked it so much, I just recently bought it on vinyl for a more authentic sound.   Definetely buy this cd!
0446608955|5.0|See, this is where the saying &quot;Don't judge a book by it's cover&quot; literally comes in.  Even though mandy moore is on the cover, it's ok.  The book still rocks!  It's so touching.  It starts off a tad bit slow, but once you get about 20 pages in, you just wanna keep going until you finish.  Also, If you are going to see the movie, SEE IT FIRST!! DON'T READ THIS UNTIL YOU SEE THE MOVIE!  Trust me, I made that little mistake, and was critizing the whole movie.  Especially since they put it in 1996.  That just annoyed me.  I'm not saying don't see the movie, because you should because i loved it almost as much as the book, but the book is much better!  It's A must read.  I became a Nicholas Sparks Fan and have read many of his books since then.  I have read this book over and over and over!  So just think about it.  Read the first two chapters, and I'm sure you won't be sorry.  (Ignore the prologue.  Just do, and get started with the actual book!)
B00005JKG9|5.0|In short, this movie is one of the greatest, most over-looked, under-appreciated films ever made. I have yet to see a movie since the release of \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" that presents a better ensamble. (not to mention the incredible chemistry, as each player seems to feed off one another) This movie is w/o question my favorite flick of all time. Yet, I can go to the store and find 12 copies of Mariah Carry's \\"Glitter\\" on DVD and not find this one. Hey studio people, what the hell are you guys waiting for?!?!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is a thoroughly entertaining fantasy, fun for children of all ages. The movie's release worked out well for me because I had just finished reading J. K. Rowley's book at a friend's insistence. <BR>    Wisely, the movie takes us quickly through the early material of the book. Any more coverage of Harry's life with his Muggle relatives would have been tedious. Instead the film gets quickly to the good stuff after laying only the necessary foundation. <BR>    Harry, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermione, and the students and teachers at Hogwarts are all perfectly cast. Emma Watson's &quot;Hermione&quot; is a delight in every seen. Each member of the all-star cast is so well costumed and in character that he or she does not distract from the storytelling. It took me a while to recognize John Cleese and Richard Harris. <BR>    The first view of Hogwarts, the school for budding witches and wizards, is visually stunning. The special effects are so linked into the storyline that one tends to stop taking notice of just how remarkable they are. <BR>    If there is a shortcoming to the movie, it is that it attempts to achieve two purposes in a relatively short space of time--it must introduce us to these characters in their very unfamiliar world and it must tell the tale of the sorcerer's stone. This ambitious undertaking keeps things moving pretty quickly, and require plot resolution a bit more quickly than one might like.<BR>    Nonetheless, this movie leaves you anxiously awaiting the sequel. The DVD provides lots of interesting ancillary materials and curiosities.
B000022TSW|5.0|South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a great movie.  It has tons of jokes and will keep you laughing the whole entire movie.  With a great plot and a awesome ending I encurage  everyone to see it.  South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is ten times as good as the TV series!  It has tons of surprises including when Kenney takes of his hood and you see his face.  South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a perfect movie for people who like to laugh and have fun.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I bought one copy of HP for my neice and one for a friend at work. I got to watch both and BOTH caused glitches on at least one of the machines they played on. The first copy ran great on my computer. On my home unit it jumps to the end of the scene on the part where Harry talks to the snake. My sister has similar difficulty with hers but it froze on the Troll scene.<br />I don't have to add my disgust with the second CD to whats already been said...Its awful...BUT A WORD OF WARNING. After the second CD asks you for Net access on your computer...It can download its OWN DVD player and UNINSTALL YOUR DVD PLAYER SOFTWARE from your computer. This happened to my friend this morning. Not only that but the software it replaced it with failed to work. If you aren't fairly computer literate there is nothing on that second CD worth losing your DVD program for.
B0000646UN|5.0|During the war, I lived 6 miles from the village from which this regiment left for the front. Totally authentic!  Watch especially for the 'good bye' scene at the railway station to get a sense of the undemonstrative Finnish mind-set. This movie is comparable in impact to Saving Private Ryan --  at 1/100th of the production cost.  A real gem!
B000062TU1|3.0|Generally when companies advertise deleted scenes on DVD, it means the owner can access them at will.  This is not the case with Harry Potter.  The deleted scenes were one of the reasons I purchased this two DVD set.  However, I discovered much to my chagrin that I have to play a video game to see them.  <br />Although the Warner Brothers website shows the steps to access the deleted scenes, it is nevertheless a tremendous nuisance.  I have never seen these scenes.  I really have no time for 18-step games.  I sent an e-mail to Warner Brothers asking them to send me a \\"disk-2\\" with no goofy access procedures.  I doubt if they will, but it is fair request. Disk-1 was okay.

Who would have thought that a young woman who has copped a bashing for the last 10 years would stick it out in such brilliant fashion, even though nobody had a good word to say about her!  She has come full circle and proven that she is a star in every way... with songs like 'In your Eyes','Dancefloor', 'More, More, More' and 'Love at First Sight' which are really dance oriented, club feel songs this album is going to appeal to a wide range of people.  Then we have the slower songs in 'Your Love','Tightrope'and 'Fragile' which are very classy additions to the album, and of course we can't leave out the brilliant title song 'Fever' which is a real change of pace for Kylie and shows her diversity.  But if you are looking for an easy listening album with that star quality then Fever is for you! Congatulations Kylie on a fantastic album, awesome concerts, and a brilliant career...Looking forward to the next installment in the Minogue files!

0609610570|4.0|Bossidy and Charan present what they believe is the most critical<BR>problem in business -- namely a failure to actually ensure that<BR>an organization is really getting things done (and asking the<BR>questions of itself necessary to get things done).<br />I think the greatest strengths of the book are the real world<BR>stories, illustrating key issues, and a willingness to name<BR>names (i.e., they are candid about the failings they see in<BR>public companies like AT&amp;T).<br />The only weakness, I found in the book was that I felt it didn't<BR>get past becoming very good.  That is, you can take this book and<BR>its precepts to heart, and get very good at execution.

0804115613|5.0|This book is a trip. It's a trip in space, a slow train ride to Birmingham, Alabama and a little nearby town called Whistle Stop. It's a trip in time to the 1980's, to the 1950's and 30's and all the way back to the turn of the century. It's a trip through the minds of ordinary people who have led full and varied lives.<br />It is told from the points of view of a number of different characters, many of them residents of Whistle Stop during the hard times of the Depression. Their world is so real you can taste the buttered biscuits, hear the horrified screams of witnesses to train accidents, laugh at Idgie's shocking antics and cry at Artis' lot in life.<br />Although this book is hailed as a comedy, and is very funny in many places, it is really about everything in life--life and death and laughter and tears, boredom and deep thinking and insanity and revelation and, as the blurb puts it, \\"even an occasional murder.\\"<br />I also like it because it has a touching, non-explicit, very sensitive portrayal of a true-to-life lesbian relationship.<br />I know this review was corny, but I can't help it. This book is so much fun to read and really ISN'T corny. That's all I can say.
6301954947|5.0|Waterloo, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk is a spectacular depiction of the Battle of Waterloo and the immediate events leading up to it.  Rod Steiger plays Napoleon and gives an intense performance and a vivid insight into the personality of this dictator.  Wellington is played by Christopher Plumber who likewise, gives of his best in portraying this brilliant commander.  The movie weaves an intriguing story, playing off Wellington's arrogance towards his rank and file against his skill in strategy and tactics.  The other main actors, Orson Wells, Jack Hawkins and Dan O'Herlihy all give fantastic performances.  The movie has been criticised for its glorification of war. With very little blood seen in the movie despite a plethora of death and destruction, it's a correct observation, but I don't think you will be watching this movie if you are at all concerned with the rights and wrongs of war. This movie deals with a period of warfare, which was colorful and fought with massive armies. This has captured the imagination of military and historical buffs despite it's relatively short period.  The movie Waterloo has suceeded admirably in conveying this granduer.  Let me say at this point, that this movie is huge in scale and panorama.  The battle scenes of which there are many, are pure eye candy.  No CGI here folks.  This is massive, classic movie making in its prime, and we won't see films made like this again. Battlefields are littered with casts of thousands.  The costumes (uniforms) are excellent and one wonders at how long it took to sew these all together.  I understand many of the cast were supplied by the Polish army.  Watching the movie, you are left in no doubt that the majority of rank and file cast are real soldiers.  To co-ordinate that many extras without military training would have been near impossible.  The cavalry charges are simply stunning and you can't help wondering how many horses were injured in the making of this movie, let alone actors.  The aerial view of the massed French cavalry charge against the British squares, towards the conclusion of the battle, truly lets you understand the scale of this production.  This is an utterly unmissable scene in the history of war movies.  There are many other scenes from the movie which truly capture the imagination.  For example, Napoleons reunion with his devoted troops after his exile, is tense and dramatic, while set in an insignificant part of the French countryside.  Adding to the quality of the movie, most of the lines spoken are actual quotes from the historical figures themselves. I am fortunate to own the DVD version of the movie, and while it doesn't have many special features I would recommend the DVD version version over VHS if you can find a copy, as this movie is one you will want in your collection for a very long time. I loved this movie from beginning to end. It won't be to everyones taste, but is an essential purchase for military and history buffs, and especially those who like movies made in the \\"good old way\\".

0140177396|2.0|This book was required reading in high school, and we all made fun of it. I guess it's an O.K. book but I don't recall it having much of an impact other than humor value. But I'm not a big Steinbeck fan. I guess we all have our prejudices.
0800103661|5.0|This is a great movie. All the actors are wonderful, especially Jude Law. The movie is so perfectly done, even though its a little slow at the begging, it  still kept me intrested till the very end. This is one of the few movies that can make me cry, and I love it. A great movie for anyone, I highly recomend it.
B00005QJDG|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFULL AND INCREDIBLE CD FROM DREAM THEATER.  THEY JUST DO IT THE SAME CUALITY FROM FROM THE STUDIO CD TO LIVE VERSION. THEY ARE POWERFULL.
B00003CXI1|4.0|There is a scene in the movie Galaxy Quest where Sigourey Weaver and Tim Allen have to make their way through an overcomplicated deadly maze of moving traps. Weaver shouts out something along the lines of, \\"This is stupid. The writer of this should die.\\"  That's how I felt about the designer of the Harry Potter DVD as I stepped through the 18 steps required to get to the deleted scenes.<br />Perhaps Warner Brothers thought it clever to have the kids have to play a game to get to the extra scenes. Maybe kids do enjoy this. But they should have had a fast path for adults who have no desire at all to play the silly game but just want to get to the deleted scenes.<br />Don't let this detract from the movie though. It's a wonderful film, that does a superb job capturing the feel of the book and transfering it faithfully to the screen -- no easy task, given the millions of kids who would have complained about even minor differences in the ways they pictured the characters looking and acting.<br />So, do watch the film.  But if you buy the DVD, go to the Warner site and download the FAQ on how to get to the deleted scenes. (Or maybe just wait, in hopes that Warner will get the message and come out with a DVD without the stupid game.)
B000063S6Z|5.0|He knows how to do &quot;it&quot; right - create beautiful electronic music that does'nt sound like a bunch of drums,cymbals and buckets being thrown down a flight of stairs. I think that is what his critics wanted to hear. I did not. *Whew* - he could have done the popular thing and put a bunch of forgettable dance tunes on this CD but he did'nt, this CD is great! It full of creative, energetic tunes that won't give you a headache.
B0000640SA|3.0|I want to start by saying I love this movie.  If I were reviewing the movie I would have awarded five stars without question.<br />My problem is with this limited edition dvd.  The menu system is a puzzle ten times as complicated as the movie's plot.  After ten minutes of frustration I enable the director's commentary, what followed was a low volumed monotone Chris Nolan who put me to sleep.  I think the world of this director and it would have been nice if he could have exhibited at least a portion of the excitement I felt after having unlocked the puzzle to hear him.<br />As for the second dvd I cannot say much about it, I haven't been able to unlock a single feature.  I was able to diagnose myself as a paranoid schizophrenic.
B00003CXI1|3.0|The casting of this film is perfect.  There is not a single character who does not look exactly as he or she ought, particularly Rupert Grint as the quintessential Ron Weasley.  (Now, in the second movie, as much as I love Ken Branagh, I'd adore Hugh Grant as Gilderoy Lockhart ... but I digress.)  Chris Columbus and company maintain overall a refreshingly reverent faithfulness to the book, which is, of course, a classic.<br />So why did the film version leave me slightly flat?<br />I've decided it's not the fault of anyone involved in the production but the inevitable result of condensing an entire school year into a 3-hour film.  So much of what makes the book irresistible is in the details, details which must, sadly, be excised in the conversion to a film that you can watch without a lunch break.  Hermione's application of &quot;petrificus totalis&quot; to Neville is far less poignant without the backstory of his struggles thus far in the school year. A Quidditch match without Lee Jordan's biased color commentary just isn't the same.  And, oh, how I miss Fred and George Weasley's jokes!<br />So I applaud the efforts of Columbus and crew, who have, I believe, delivered just about the best product possible.  But let no one make the mistake of seeing the movie while omitting the read the book.<br />In regard to the DVD version, I found the extras on the second disc disappointing, apart from a truly enjoyable interview with Columbus et al. on the making of the movie.  But no outtakes?  No deleted scenes?  No early peek at the making of the sequel, already well underway by the time this DVD was issued?  Color this fan disgruntled.  The movie itself deserves 4 stars, but the DVD presentation downgrades my rating to 3.

0140186409|4.0|I am 40 years old and just read this book for the first time. I found this story to be a page-turner and very absorbing. Excellent local color and superb character development. You know, I think today's younger generation could take a few lessons from this story - the stocism these people demonstrated throughout their ordeal was fascinating. The simply did what they had to do and only complained periodically (with exception of Rosasharn - who bitched and whined all the time). This is also a great review of a bleak period in American history.<br />My advice to people who haven't read it is: by all means, read it, learn something about history and the human spirit.<br />Now for the oddities:<br />1. Maybe this was symbolic and I just glossed over it, but several times in the book, drivers (including the protagonists) are squashing with their vehicles animals who have the misfortune of using or crossing the road they use. Well, that was kind of strange I thought.<br />2. Why Connie left Rosasharn is sort of a mystery. She was pregnant for crying out loud. Was her constant carping about her wanting a house and nice things just driving him bug-s---?<br />3. Noah left and was never heard from again. I suppose you could argue that this was symbolic of a family disintegrating and how they dealt with it.<br />4. Now the really odd thing. It ended at a weird spot. Not much closure. I had to check to make sure pages weren't torn out of this old paperback. Wonder if other reviewers thought that was kind of dissatisfying....?
0446310786|5.0|I tried to read this book when I was 11, and, with the help of my mom reading the first page (to get me started) I went off and read the whole thing and really liked it.  Then, the next year it was an assignment in school, so I read it again when I was about 13, and it was great again - I noticed things I hadn't noticed before.  Now at 17, I plan on reading it yet another time and enjoying more subtle things I hadn't seen before, and understanding more complex concepts that had been too far away from my own life at 11 or 13.  Anyone should read this book regardless of their age.  All people at differnt stages in their life will interpret the message differently and relate to different charactors at different levels.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This, like every other teen movie, is predictable from the start. But it also adds a couple things to keep you focused. One ex-miss popularity girl is now the outkast of the school, and her sister is the opposite. Then their dad forces them to cooperate with each other, and when they actually do its scares the hell out of him. Meanwhile the loser jock/model sets up a guy for the outkast so he can date her sister and ends up teaching everyone a lesson in love. This movie introduced me to now one of my fav bands Letters to Cleo, and also has Save Ferris, Barenaked Ladies, and others that make the movie twice as exciting.
B00005YW4H|5.0|What a wonderfully easy, haunting sound. My muscles relax when I hear her opening &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;. Great summer CD, right up there with James Taylor's Greatest Hits. She's a cross between Ricky Lee Jones and Edie Brickell. Great new talent with an old soul sound.
B000067D8W|2.0|This is one of my favorite shows, but I am disappionted that they decided to put two inferior on the DVD. This show stars the always amazing looking Tom Welling as Clark Kent, Kristen Kruek as the sappy Lana Lang, Micheal Rosenbaulm as the furture nemasis Lex Luthor, and Allison Mack as the Lois Lane parralel Chloe Sullivan. In the first episode they put on the DVD, Pilot, it goes through all the basics, how the Kents found Clark, the meteor shower affecting everyone in Smallville (one of the things that did not happen in the comic book, but after you see the better episodes you forgive the wroters for putting in), Clark's crush on the pretty but oh so annoying girl-next-door with the jelous boyfriend played by Eric Johnson(she gets less annoying in later episodes),Clark saving Lex's life and consequently becoming his best friend(a courageous but greatmove by the writers)and of course the X-Files like villian trying to kill people in Smallville. The chram of the epsiodes make you forget all the glaring faults, except for Lana, about Smallville. The second episode a bug guy attacks Smallville. Frankly, Iwas very uoset when I lerned that they were putting these two episodes on the DVD because besides for Reaper and Drone these are the two worst episodes although the premeire provides information thet you need to understand the future episodes. If you can possibly see other episodes I highly recommend it, but as for these two don't waste your money.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I heard and read all the hype about the Strokes. I was actually looking forward to a band with something refreshing to offer. I listened to this album and checked the band out live as well. I must say, if these guys are &quot;the Saviors of Rock and Roll,&quot; then we are all doomed! Every song is a bland, uninspired, boring tribute to mediocrity. There is very little intrumental talent to be found among any of these poseurs as the majority of the songs have not only the same boring, repetitive structure, but also the same simplistic riffs. There is no variation or complexity here; it's all simple strumming interjected by an occasional guitar solo. As if the poor musicianship wasn't bad enough, the singer tops it all off with the most nauseating vocals I've heard in a long time. No range, no skill, no passion. Just monotonous whining. I am not impressed.

079073804X|4.0|Two years after winning the Oscar as Best Director for \\"The French Connection\\", William Friedkin shoots William Peter Blatty's best-seller, \\"The Exorcist\\". The result is a good movie, one of the scariest ever made, but for me it's a bit overrated. There are some questions we can't do anything else but ask ourselves, even after several screenings.<br />For instance we don't see any sign of possession of Regan's body before it's really possessed by this demon, Pazuzu. Blatty showed those signs in his book, those unjustified anger waves and crisis. But Friedkin has erased them in the movie, and he's even unable to suggest them, so we don't understand why SHE's finally possessed and not somebody else. Besides the film, on the contrary of the book, which is much faster and more precise, takes much time before really starting: Friedkin loses himself in many useless and boring sequences he should have erased for his last cut, for instance Father Karras (Jason Miller, who'd have deserved an Oscar for his brilliant performance) keeping walking up the stairs and walking and walking in the streets, - what's the real use of such plans?<br />The film really starts - and we can wake up for good - after forty five or fifty minutes, when the doctor comes at the McNeil's house and sees Regan's body turned upside down by the demon, at last revealing his power and nastiness. And the suspense is terrific: Regan is now entirely possessed but Father Karras, despite Regan's incredible condition and language, despite that green and horrible puke she throws up to him, despite the evidence of the fact, despite the murders (carefully disguised), is unable to believe it, certain he's dealing with another nutcase. And when Father Merrin (Max von Sydow, astounding!), the Exorcist himself, arrives and proves that the evidence can't be discussed any more, the complete horror breaks out. Pazuzu's anger and powers and evil are at their paroxysm and Friedkin (and Blatty, who won an Oscar for his script based upon his novel - he also produced the movie by himself! Gosh!) give us some kind of opera filled with great violence, crude language, unpowerful religion and dark, cold supernatural (see the levitation scene). The atmosphere in Regan's bedroom is icy (see the cold smoke coming out from the mouths), and filled with the smell of death.<br />Besides, finally, the power of the demon is too strong for the two priests. The Exorcist is killed first and Father Karras kills himself, throwing himself through the window, after forcing the Devil to take his body. Regan is now free, but...<br />Linda Blair was only 12 when she played in this movie and her performance is amazing. Dick's Smith making-up work on her of course played a great role in her performance but she really did great. I've never seen such a young actress acting that good, playing an evil character with such conviction and realism. We also can see Ellen Burstyn in her best-known role, Jack McGowran (\\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\") as Dennings, the eccentric movie director and Kitty Winn (awarded at 1971 Cannes Film Festival for \\"The Panic in Needle Park\\") as a young, wise servant, far away from the weird character imagined by Blatty in his novel. The sound, also 'Academy-Awarded' and Mike Oldfield's music are great, really fitting the rottening atmosphere. A bit too long, especially in the first hour, but it's very uneasy to make scarier now.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Although there was (as there is always) a delay for the DVD to come out in the UK I waited and waited, and I wasn't disappointed! When I put the DVD in, the interactive menus pop up where you can either; play the concert from start to finish, choose a song to start from or choose to go and view the special features (which on the UK edition of the DVD were the videos for Slave, Overprotected (the first version), I'm Not A Girl . . and the Crossroads trailer). The quality of the video and the sound are superb and there is none sound fades out as there was when the concert was shown on TV. Some of the best parts of the DVD include 'What It's Like To Be Me', 'Anticipating', 'Slave 4 U' and 'Baby One More Time' although all the songs are brill! Britney gave her all in this concert and it is reflected in this DVD, it worth every penny, GET IT NOW YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B00005JKNC|5.0|I loved this movie!!!  It is just one of those feel good movies.  It also isn't stereotypical of american pop culture today.  Most movies today are about how much blood can be used.  This movie shows that morals do exist somewhere out there.

B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic I must admit is my favorite album by Bjork and man. The most innovative music Bjork has created is on here.<br />Homegenic is her most creative, ominous, weirdest, and coldest album so far even colder than the Arctic sounding Vespertine.<br />The music is like a rollercoaster of emotions but overall I consider this her angriest album as is shown on the explosive Pluto where she screams out her rage through feiry buzzing techno sounds, computerized voice amplification and staccato buzz sounds. Pluto is Bjork at her very angriest. I often blast this one out loud from my stereo.<br />After the explosive rage of Pluto we then head into the calm of All Is Full Of Love. This song is absolutely breathtaking. It's electronic classical sounds combined with a weird pulsating bass line in the background and beatiful string arrangements. By far the calmest song on the CD.<br />The other slow song is track 3 Unravel. It starts off with a horn and then builds up into a beautiful song with an organ and kinda of metallic beat that gives this song a misty sound. By far one of the most interesting ones on Homegenic.<br />My actual favorite is track 5 All Neon Like. I love the title. It's a fusion of classical violins and trip-hop buzz beat. It stars off with a humming violin and then builds into a techno trip-hop beat number. It's far from anything danceable but the weird beat kind of might get you to bop your head along with the weird rhythm.<br />Homogenic is almost opposite to Vespertine. Where Vespertine is mostly mellow and almost romantic Homegenic is heavy. I say go and get this CD. It's by far Bjorks most creative album and is one of the best CDs of 1997.
B0000640VN|5.0|When i first went in the theater to see KATE &amp; LEOPOLD, i though it was going to be kind of chessy. But after i saw hugh jackman face i fell in love with the movie. He did  a GOOD JOB as a new actor. I give him a 5 stars. I didnt really wanted to see the movie, because of Meg Rayan, she is not my favorate actor. She pretty but i don't like the way she walk as a pretty lady. and the way she dress in her movie, &quot;like sleepless in seattle&quot;. But she did a good job. two thumb up for Hugh Jackman with his fine self. I LOVE U HUGH JACKMAN. I own every movie Hugh is in.
6301969588|5.0|This is a very powerful film.The acting is a little over dramatic by some of the &quot;normal&quot; actors,however leila hyams is at her best.The title does'nt do this film any justice.Do yourself a favor and check this one out.
0393317552|1.0|My biggest question is the criteria for awarding pulitzer prizes.  No wonder we are all suffering from a slanted view of the world that has caused much fragmentation, misery and war.<br />Scholars need to be holistic in their views but when those in medicine such as Diamond THINK they possess one when they actually do not, they succeed in propagating THIER own perspective to the lay person.<br />A balanced, and well researched book---- this is not.
B000060P79|5.0|These guys got balls.  They're loud, they're fast, and they're wild.  If you like rock in any size, shape, or form; then you'll love Simple Plan.  If you think they're great recorded, then see 'em live.  They're one of the best shows i've been too.  They get everyone involved.  They're in there having fun and making sure that you do too....
B00003CWTH|5.0|yes, it's long.  yes, it's an ensemble drama about chance.<br />but the one reason (one of the many, but the the most amusing) is that tom cruise is an absolutely ABHORRENT actor.... everywhere else but in this film.  the fact is that you must see this film simply to see tom cruise act and act WELL.<br />this is not, and I stress NOT, the only reason to see this film.  I was introduced to one of my favourite actors via this movie: William H. Macy, who is amazing in such movies as \\"Panic\\" and \\"Focus.\\"  But I cannot in any words sum up how good this movie is - it's more of an experience than anything, something you just sit through until the end..where it all just hits you and sit back, breathing heavily for a moment, saying \\"Wow.\\" over and over while shaking your head.
0684847248|3.0|This book is definitely an intersting read but nothing that I would have picked up for leisure.  It does cover some intersting points about how one must come to accept and understand the fact that life is difficult before he or she can move past it.  I disagree with the section on Love though.  I know a couple who have fallen in love and are still that way.  And the Myth of Romantic love that says that there is a perfect man for every woman and vice versa is something that I believe in.  Peck expressed himself as someone who believes in miracles and supports spiritual growth whole-heartedly, yet he can not accept the idea of fate.  <BR>Many of the points that he makes are cliches but they do reinforce the truth that underllies them.  This book will make the reader look into themselves and see what they have been doing to reach \\"Grace\\" or to become a \\"God-like\\" individual.  And in that way, reading this book makes one want to set the highest standard of all for himself/herself: To become spiritually enlightened.  If everyone strived to discipline themselves, have genuine love, and grow spiritually relationships and society would be stronger.  If this topic is of interest to you, then definitely go read it... and even if you are unsure, browse through it...you may grow!!!
B00000HYXB|5.0|One of the best metal bands since Iron Maiden. This album is extravagant, interesting, and fun to listen to. The bits of dialogue are quite interesting, though aren't really much fun to listen to. Hearing Oliver Reed's voice is a joy though, considering his vioce is very powerful. <br />Many of the songs on this CD are absolutely riveting; Time Stands Still, Mirror Mirror, Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns), Thorn, and The Curse of Feanor. Those are wonderful metal ballads that should not be missed. <br />All in all, a great metal CD that should be owned.
0446310786|5.0|This was a magnificent book told from the viewpoint of the little girl of a white family.  This story contains elements of racism, feminism, and reverse racism. A story in which choices had to be made between what was traditional and what was right. This is very heartwarming and it never got boring.  I recommend this title to anyone.
B00000K19E|5.0|Today, the Matrix is found in almost any dvd collection, whether part of a larger collection or the only one you own.  C'mon, dvd's were made for movies like this.  With the Matrix's amazing digital effects, only the clarity of a dvd can do this movie justice.  Not to mention, this was a great movie which is spawning two sequels.  Got a dvd player?  Your next step is to purchase this movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|I'm not much for sappy romance, but there is no sap here, just sweetness and humour!  Audrey Tatou plays Amelie, the gamime doe-eyed waitress at a restaraunt in Monmarte, a part of Paris, France.  She is very quiet and lonely, as she lives by herself. The charming young girl decides to help others out secretly with mischeif of course, all the while trying to tease her love interest.  This movie has great visual effects, the cast is wonderful, and Tatou is amazing as the quirky Amelie.  It is in French, but comes with subtitles.  One of my personal favorite moies!!!
079073463X|5.0|For anyone who has not yet viewed this cinematic gem -- run, don't walk, to your local video store and rent it tonight!  The mythology in this tale -- lovers who are forever together yer eternally apart -- is breathtaking in its emotional resonance and pathos.  Matthew Broderick gives a perfromance that is both comic and evocative, and Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfieffer are luminous as the ill-fated lovers.  If you've ever dreamed of a love more powerful than all that stands against it, or longed for a passion that could survive all odds, or just yearned for a timeless story of romance, then THIS is the movie for you!  Truly, &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; is a modern classic.
0140177396|4.0|The story is about two guys that are working together as ranch workers. They go around from job to job trying to build up a stake.  One of the main characters is George. George is a small, strong man, with a keen eye, and a stolid expression. The other main character is Lennie. Lennie is a tall clumsy man, but at the same time he is strong as an ox. He has a sort of childish behavior and no sense of self-control.  Everywhere they went, Lennie seemed to get into trouble with someone.  It seemed that Lennie's lack of self-control would force both Lennie and George to quit their jobs early and try to find work elsewhere.<BR> I think that if I had to relate myself to one of the characters it would have to George. I think George and I have a lot in common, we both are always trying to solve other people's problems instead of our own.  I usually do things that other people want first and what I want to do second.  I also think the same way George does.  We both have a dream of one day owning land and not having to pay rent on it.  I too would one day like to like to not have to work for some one else. To be able to step outside and look as far as I could see and know that it is all mine.<BR> I really enjoyed the book. I think that the message of being loyal to your friends is a solid one that will never fade away.  I enjoyed just being able to lay back and read about what trouble Lennie was going to get into next.  My favorite part was the big fight between Lennie and Curley.  I think that that fight had a lot of action and really made the book interesting to read, but at the same time kept it within reason so I wasn't disgusted by it.  I really don't think there is any part that I didn't like in the book.  I don't think that I would change any part of it if I had the chance to.  The book was written so well that changing any part of it would alter the whole story.<BR>  I would recommend this book to students in high school. It has some bad language and a little bit of adult content, but I think that students at that age can fully understand the story and really appreciate its message. I think that anybody with a small sense of humor and a good sense of adventure would really enjoy this book.
B00005JL99|5.0|Kitano is cool as ever. The concept of forcing children to murder eachother in order to become good adult citizens; can anyone but the japanese come up with that?<br />The film is great. The kids don't play by the rules. The different groups make their own game inside the big game. Dialoge is typical japanese and the acting is great. Since we have seen plenty of kids going postal in real life this movie show us how truly evil kids are.<br />A film for those who like to push the visual limits of a movie and not for any Arnie-fans!
6304211740|5.0|I love this version of Jane Eyre.  The plain-ness of this version makes for a story that is much easier to relate to... and the lack of display don't detract from the romanticism of the movie, but instead make it all the more believable.  The acting is excellent and the lead characters are eminently likeable, and while complex people - yet are still easy to sympathize with... I can find little fault with this movie.  Definitely a version worth seeing!

0812550706|4.0|Just about everyone can identify with Ender.  Ok sure, you're not six years old, and you're not a military supra-genius, but I bet you remember some point in your past where you were pushed around by the school bully.  Or maybe you were terrorized by an <BR>older sibling?  Just like Ender.  I guess you could argue that the school bully, and your abusive older sibling couldn't identify with Ender, but really, we all know those people are too stupid to read anyway.<br />The unwillingness to accept defeat, while staring the insurmountable odds in the face, is a central feature of our protagonist, Ender.<br />He is a six year old boy, removed from his family to train.  Train to become the space commander needed by the forces of Earth to defeat \\"the buggers.\\"  The majority of the training takes place in the form of zero-g combat games, played with other students at the orbiting Battle School.  I know it sounds a little cheesey on the surface, but Card really pulls it off well.  Ender faces trials in and out of the game in what amounts to years and years in basic training.<br />Throughout it all he is alone, and it is his determination and clarity of purpose that gets him through.  You really just want to cheer for the little fella over and over.<br />This is a very simple novel.  It is also a very very good novel, just don't expect the complexity of Foundation or the darkness of The Gap series.  But we don't always need to read caviar and sekt books.  Sometimes we need pizza for the brain.  The simplicity, the age of the characters, and Card's religious background (meaning very little bad language and no sex) make this book an excellant choice for the thirteen to sixteen year old soon-to-be sci/fi fan.  It's the kind of book that set me on fire for reading (Actually for me it was Clark's \\"Childhood's End.\\")<br />Will I read the sequel?  Not sure yet.  The last bit \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" seems like an intriguing segque into the next book.  It really has emotional depth that the rest of the book lacks.  Maybe so.

B000065V1V|5.0|When we last heard from Bowie, he was doing well, and he still is by all means. Happily married and beginning a family, the public figure David Bowie whom we have known and loved for well over 30 years seems to have settled down from his androgynous days as Ziggy. If \\"...hours\\" didn't reflect this sense of earthly harmony--which was left at the wayside on \\"Earthling,\\" as though the album was just begging to be horribly mutated by Bowie's least favorite copycat, M. Manson--you certainly won't see it on \\"heathen.\\"<br />Since working with Brian Eno once again on the all but invisible album \\"1. Outside,\\" there's been sort of a sinking feeling like that was the last really artsy Bowie album we'd see (and what a strange point of departure it would have been). Fortunately, it seems that Bowie has been busy resurrecting demons, more specifically producer Tony Visconti who is one reason why moments of \\"heathen\\" are reminiscent of \\"Station To Station,\\" \\"Heroes,\\" or \\"Low.\\" This is not to say that Bowie relied on Visconti to return us to 1970's Berlin. After all, this is hardly the Return of The Thin White Duke.<BR>Instead, cheesy double entendres aside, this album soars with a feeling of salvation straight from the confessional. The featured single, \\"Slow Burn\\" has Bowie aching like we haven't heard nearly since \\"The Man Who Sold The World.\\" Yet there is no feeling of push and pull on the album like the aforementioned \\"1. Outside.\\" Each song breaks free on its own and resonates long after, leaving you wishing it met the 1 hour mark.<br />The guitar movements sound incredibly inspired; ethereal vocals circle lyrical styling like miniature powdered wings beaten around candle flame. On tracks like \\"Slip Away\\" and \\"5:15 The Angels Have Gone,\\" your ears will tickle until you look up, look around and wish you weren't alone. All the same, though, you'll find a sort of uncomfortable comfort from this album.<BR>In the past, Bowie has inspired artists and entire musical genres (even reluctantly at times) alike. Any attempt to climb this high or reach as far into his bottomless bag of miracles will leave any and all other artists falling flat. After all, there are nearly no other artists today who can exhibit as much merit as Bowie. And none at all could match his magnitude. \\"heathen\\" is a testament to a promise we already knew: David Bowie is the single most important artist in modern music.
B00005ATQD|1.0|This movie, if you can call it that, is one of the absolute worst pieces of cinema I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. I knew that with Stanley Kubrick it would be hit or miss. I like some of the late director's film, but others I could do without. This is one of the latter, and it's a shame it had to be Kubrick's final piece. <BR>From the confusing \\"mask\\" scenario to that piercing piano key music (if you can call IT that), this film was a mess from beginning to end. I suppose I saw it because I was curious. It got so much hype for being sexually provocative, namely for an orgy scene. Maybe what was so controversial about it was that you finally saw Tom and Nicole making out, which at least for a moment squashed his gay rumors. <BR>But there was nothing overly shocking in the sexual realm in this film. As a matter of fact, the \\"orgy\\" was very cleverly blocked in many places by strategically-placed potted plants. Instead, there was moping, brooding, and emptiness. There was absolutely no point to the plot, and when you finally, FINALLY get to the end, it's a kind of....huh??? <BR>Did the producers really think that Cruise and Kidman star power would carry this movie??? How dumb do they think audiences are? You know, we do want some kind of resolution, some kind of substance to our movies. Not just scary music, not just see-through camisole tops, not just orgy scenes. It has to make sense, and quite simply, this movie did not. Even good actors (and directors) have their bad movies.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|It captures the feel of the game... and if that right there doesn't tell you that the... thing is boring, I don't know what else to tell you... the supporting cast needs all the support they can get, and the only thing that Joile excels at is LOOKING like Lara Croft. How bout some feeling in your performance next time, lady? And when I say she LOOKS like Croft, I'm not kidding.. I heard rumors that she was \\"enhanced\\" for the role, if you know what I mean... Lack of a good plot also makes my head hurt. Paper-thin adversaries seem one-dimensional, and we learn little to nothing about her father to make us even care about that little reunion in the movie. I stopped the DVD and looked at Trigun...
B00003CX5P|4.0|Many critics who slammed this film don't realize the challenge George Lucas had in rewinding his famous saga and telling a story that started in the middle from the very beginning.  It was over twenty years after the first film, a LONG time to keep fans waiting.  Filmmaking had grown technologically by this time, but Lucas had to keep the simplicity of Episodes IV-VI.  But still it had to be interesting, the casting of younger characters had to be right, it had to be accurate, it had to give hints......see?  This is a lot for a director/producer to think about.<BR>I think &quot;Episode I&quot; pulled off all of its set tasks quite well.  It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough to warrant its big box office draw. It was also a nice starting point to build toward two bigger, better films with Episodes II and III.<BR>The actors:  I think Liam Neeson was great as Qui-Gon Jinn.  He had the serenity of a most experienced Jedi and the power of a master of sabre battle.  Ewan McGregor, almost always a jewel, was the ideal to play the young Obi-Wan.  He nails the character that Sir Alec Guinness set forth for him, and his youthful energy gives a lot to the battle sequences.  Natalie Portman was more effective as Padme the handmaiden (or is she??) than she was as the stoic queen.  Her accent was like nails on a chalkboard during the Senate meetings and other conferences.  But that's okay.  She's better in Episode II.<BR>Jake Lloyd....hmmmmmmm....he is young and precocious and cute, but there were probably better child actors out there who could have played this part.  I think Haley Joel Osment might have been good if not a little obvious.  Ray Park as Darth Maul: He is a man of few words, but big action.  He was fantastic and I was sad to see him killed off so early in this trilogy.  Samuel L. Jackson: can't wait to see him get more screen time.  Yoda: good to have you back if only for a moment.  Still a wise master, you are.<BR>Finally, I will address the issue that bothered audiences the most: Jar Jar Binks.  When I first saw the movie, I liked Jar Jar.  I thought he was quirky and kind of cute. But he seemed out of place in this movie.  He was what I call the &quot;toy character&quot; in a science-fiction films.  He was someone for the kids to laugh at, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that. Adults just find him a bit annoying after a while.  <BR>The action sequences:  MARVELOUS!!  Not too phony, yet not too realistic that a fantasy element is lost.  The light sabre battle was the best one I have ever seen.  When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan jump/flip across the platforms and land in front of Darth Maul, it is one of those moments that makes you go, &quot;Oh yeah, something's about to go down!&quot;  (That aforementioned moment:  watch it in widescreen or you lose Obi-Wan on the right.  That irritated me about the VHS release.)  The pod race scene was very good and should be enjoyed in stereo/surround sound.  Turn it up, make it like NASCAR!<BR>Overall, the movie was one of my favorites.  I know I'm biased because I'm a Ewan McGregor slave, but I did consider everything about this film so as to be fair.  I liked it, others didn't.  It happens.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I started listening to the Strokes in January. I finally got the cd Is This It in februrary, and I listen to it every single day. I love it so much. Anyone out there who loves bands like the Ramones and the Velvet Underground (my other two favorite bands) really need to check this cd out. I don't have words to describe how I feel about this cd. The Strokes are a wonderful band. People, if you don't like this cd, you must be out of your everloving mind. And for those of you who think there is an &quot;Overhype&quot; about the Strokes, or you think that Julian's voice get tiring after a while, you might as well be listening to Britney Spears or something, because the Strokes are one of the most original and extrodinary bands to date! So BUY THIS CD!
0790729725|4.0|The same year Francis Ford Coppola hit the skids with his flawed \\"Godfather 3,\\" Martin Scorcese reminded us how well-made mob movies are done with \\"Goodfellas.\\" Here's the story of the rise and fall of a mobster, covering a span of 30 years from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although DeNiro gets top billing in this film, this is really a Ray Liotta movie all the way. It's surprising his career never took off after this movie, for his performance is really good. But while this film is undeniably a classic, the DVD itself is a bust. Although it is slightly over two hours, the film is divided on both sides of the DVD. I refuse to get up off my sofa to flip this disc over when the whole movie could be put on one side.  Plus, all we get for features is a trailer. No documentary, no commentary, or anything else. If you have to have this film, you are no worse off getting the VHS tape and waiting for Warners to come out with a deluxe-edition of this great film.
6301247485|3.0|As all the other High Schools in Broward County Florida, it has become a requirement to read F. Scott Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. However, with only 2 weeks left in the entire school year, and the fear of having to pressure my fellow classmates into reading 10 chapters a day, our teacher decided to go with plan B: Show us the movie version. But don't get me wrong, the point of our lesson of watching the movie was not to be entertained and relax. We had to analyze the movie, and put up with our mentor's hints and comments as she stopped the film countless time. There came a warning though: Don't expect this film to be quite as enjoyable as the other ones we've seen&quot; (referring to the Crucable*). But she was quickly proven wrong as my Junior-English III H. class includng me was entertained by the dialogue, the expression , and the intrigue from Gatsby's &quot;James Bond&quot; appearances. Who needs &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; gore and action when the action and chaos on both sides of the tale from Gatsby is enough to  satisfy the need for entertainment (for a couple of hours)? But there came a price... and a big one too.<br />Like I said, this novel is a requirement, so to not read this book and watch the film is like driving without learning how. We were all deprived of key information on certain parts, and the beginning of the movie? We would be lost if it weren't for the efforts of our mentor to provide us with what we missed from the book. So my only advice is to read the book before the movie. Most people do not realize this but a film portrayed from a book usually leaves out info that is quite interesting from the book.<br />Cutting away though from the school-time logic, the movie was quite entertaining. Although I do not know any of these actors I can say that their performance deserves high ratings. This and the use of all those classic cars, the settings, and the behavior makes it really seem like the 1920's. Although there is hardly no violence, there are many scenes that the viewer would probably shout out: &quot;hit him, or hit her&quot;. The action in this movie is done with the use of the words, the expression of the speakers, and the way that the scene is portrayed. However as for the music... I wish John Williams could have done something with it.<br />If you do not know about this film, nor the book, here's a small preview. Theres this man named Gatsby whos obsessed with a lady named Daisy. However before becomming rich, Daisy had to turn down Gatsby since &quot;rich girls don't marry poor boys&quot;. So Gatsby gets rich, buys a mansion, and lives across a lake from Daisy... but Daisy is married. Does this stop Gatsby? No. But after hosting parties and waiting for Daisy to be there (which she never does) he goes to step 2: bring her to the house using her cousin (who lives next to Gatsby) as &quot;bait&quot;. The plan works and Daisy and Gatsby are together again... or are they. This movie has many twists and turns as well as it is unpredictable.<br />So to cut it short: &quot;Don't critisize a book turned into a film, since the book may have more advantages over that film...&quot; (*hehe*)no violence, there are many scenes that the viewer would probably shout out: &quot;hit him, or hit her&quot;.

B00005OAE6|4.0|This is the album where Bob Seger, as Bob Dylan once did, brought it all back home: the blue collar angst of a changing American economy, and the desolation of seperating from old, traditional values. Seger had made \\"Night Moves\\" before he was a success. \\"Stranger In Town\\" was made by someone who, after striving for years to attain fame, isn't sure if he can handle it. <br />     My favorite songs here are ones that haven't been played to death on the radio: \\"Feel Like A Number\\" is just as timely in 2002 as it was in 1978, and \\"The Famous Final Scene\\" still speaks volumes about the self-generated drama of a romatic breakdown. <br />     In the liner notes for \\"Bob Seger's Greatest Hits,\\" it's interesting to note that the songs from this album still bring back strong emotions, memories of speed (escape) and restless nights. Although I personally like \\"The Distance\\" better, this may be Bob Seger's finest album - a must for any collection!
B000065V1V|4.0|Well, it's been way too long since Bowie put out a really good album and fortunately that time has passed. &quot;Heathen&quot; is a lot better than I ever could've expected. The tracks &quot;5:15 The Angels Have Gone&quot;, &quot;Slow Burn&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot; &amp; &quot;Slip Away&quot; are definitely Bowie classics. I just hope after this album I won't have to wait another 20 years for another great one from Bowie.
0446608955|5.0|This was a wonderful book! I loved it. It was also sooooooo sad at times that it made me CRY! I thought that is was well written and had a good ending. The movie was good too.
B00006690F|2.0|Eminem is -- in his way -- and imaginative and engaging rapper, and his last two albums were highly inspired and chock-full of viscious energy. Production was solid and clean but usually nicely restrained and minimal (see \\"My Name Is\\" and \\"Kill You.\\") Neither the Slim Shady LP nor the Marshall Mathers LP were \\"pure genius,\\" but they were certainly good records.<br />The Eminem Show has its moments, but overall, is a definite step down. First of all, his lyrical flow (which he mentions often with pride) seems a bit stunted and clumsy on a lot of this material. The legato pacing is the same on almost every track and the wording is sometimes awkward and ineffective. The content is often boring. Eminem seems to be taking himself a lot more seriously on this record, addressing \\"big issues,\\" unnecessarily and unentertainingly. The first track is a good example. It's incredibly high-school in its petulant anti-authoritarian posturing. He actually uses the phrase \\"democracy of hypocrisy\\" ... ! What is this, a Rage Against the Machine record? When he's not taking unclever jabs at \\"the system,\\" he's still whining about his mother, all that horrible money and fame which just makes him SOOO miserable, and women. The notable addition to the content this time around is that he yatters on about how much he loves his daughter, like a giddy soccer mom. Just get a bumper sticker and be done with it. I'm sure all the Backstreet Boys fans and other teeny-bopper MTV girls out there will find it just ADORABLE, especially when he actually SINGS on \\"Hailie's Song\\" -- sounding every bit like a wannabe member of 'N Sync, a band he's often attacked and ridiculed in the past.<br />Many of the tracks here are simply boring, with a lackluster flow and nothing to really grab your interest. I kept waiting for something to happen on this record, something to really grab me, make me laugh, etc. Eminem's always been good at commanding the listener's attention -- not so much here. I was tuning in andout by the third or fourth track. Halfway through each song I was simply waiting for it to end, hoping the NEXT one would be one of the really good ones. <br />Production: the production on this album is irritatingly commercial, and commercial in a poor way. I agree with the reviewer who criticized the choruses. Boring and long and overproduced, sounding like just about everything else the mainstream music industry pumps out. They repeat themselves in exactly the same fashion at the designated places; almost every song is structured in a completely predictable and formulaic fashion. After twenty tracks it gets old.<br />The skits are dumb. I've never been a huge fan of the skit thing, but these are worse than usual. They're just uninspired.<br />With all that said, rest assured there ARE a few decent tracks and memorable moments. \\"Drips\\" is amusing, and \\"Soldier\\" would be an excellent track if it weren't for the cheesy melodramatic atmosphere of it, (particularly the chorus.) \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" isn't too bad, (though it's more whining about his mom), and \\"Sing for the Moment\\" is well executed, (though again, far too dramatically serious.) Don't get me wrong -- a somber track here and there is OK, but this album in general completely lacks a sense of humor, and a sense of playfulness. The exception is the single, \\"Without Me,\\" which is pretty classic light-hearted Eminem, viscious and whimsical at the same time. It is not reminiscent of the rest of the disc at all I'm afraid. <br />Overall Eminem's material is becoming less like fun, outrageous, in-your-face rap, and more like a whiney extended public therapy session. He's not controversial anymore; he just TALKS about how controversial he has been in the past. (Yawn.) I think this could be a sort of transitional record -- cleaning up after the Marshall Mathers LP, so to speak, closing the book on his mom, Kim, cementing his feelings about his daughter and his own press, etc. If so, fine: I hope he's now gottenit out of his system and will move on come the next release.
B00005OWEG|4.0|The first time I saw this movie I was only 13, and I wondered what the big deal was about. I thought the movie was very long, and didn't have much of a point. <br />Then came the VCR, and I promptly added this movie to my collection, because over the years, I had come to appreciate the finer points of the movie, rather than just the obvious stuff.<br />Then DVD came out. I resisted at first, but was overcome by falling prices, and grudgingly purchased first the player, and shortly thereafter, this movie.<br />I'll get the DVD vs. VHS debate out of the way now. Go buy a DVD player! <br />On to the review of the movie. Yes, it's still quite long. How long, you ask? Don't make any plans that evening. But, after watching this version with the added scenes, I wonder why they were cut out in the first place. OK, nobody would have gone to see the movie in the theater. But, after watching this new version, it was almost as though I had seen a new movie, not just a thrown-together rehash of the same old stuff. Hard to believe, but true. <br />A warning: If you decidde to buy this DVD just to see the French plantation scenes because it makes a theatrical masterpiece complete, you might want to set your sights a little lower. That's a nice way to say it's a little slow.(boring)<br />But, don't let that hang you up, this is the way the movie should have been from the start.<br />If you own the original, look into this.(rent) If you have the VHS and are building a DVD collection, buy this. If you are a fan of the genre, this is a must have. <br />I rated this movie 4 out of 5 only because I couldn't give it 4 and a half. It's almost a perfect movie. And this DVD is a good buy for anyone who enjoys good movies.
068484267X|3.0|This book is interesting because the tone is original, and there is humour, and also because of the circumstances at the time.<br />One the reader has digested this there is still about halfway to go, and the second half makes for much less fun, original, interesting reading.<br />Well worth reading - but, in my view, not worth keeping or re-reading.
B000002H6C|5.0|Probably Metallica's most well-rounded effort of the early years. A solid rocker, a little tamer than &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and very polished. I reccomend this album to anybody that hasn't listened to a lot of Metallica, or has just heard the stuff on the radio. At the time it was released, this was heavy heavy stuff, but over the years I think it has mellowed, if only because of the other music on the market has gotten much harder. Don't let that stop you however, this album still hits hard.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is a fantastic movie, with everything that one could ever want: action, adventure, romance, comedy, special effects, and a nice happy ending. Val Kilmer does a great job as the rogue swordsman Madmardigan, and Warwick Davis (you know, Wicket the Ewok) was a fantastic hero. <br />I used to love this movie as a kid. Going back, I am kind of struck by how poor the special effects seem to my CGI-savvy eyes, but it was a ground-breaking film in its time (the morphing technique was developed specifically for this movie.) George Lucas made this film, and his special effects company (Industrial Light and Magic) worked on the effects, so you know that whatever you're seeing was the best available at the time.<br />The special edition DVD was definitely worth waiting for. Both featurettes on the making of Willow are worth watching, but one is significantly newer. Also, there is a full length commentary track by Warwick Davis. That makes the DVD infinitely more valuable than the video in my mind.
B00006690G|5.0|this album {rocks]!!!!  i can't stop listening to it.  it is the best album that i have heard this year, and probably em's best work to date.  i loved the marshall mathers l.p., but this show is a bit better.  i am not usually a fan of rap music, but this is different.  if u hate rap, u should still give this a shot.  i mainly listen to alternative and metal. this album has an entirely different feel to it.  it's not like your everyday hip-hop album.  give it a shot and i bet you'll love it.  the album is very strong lyrically, despite the vulgar language.  buy it. it's worth 17 or 18 bucks.
6305696071|3.0|The charming fantasy those of us enjoyed in the theatres has been unnecessarily cluttered with &quot;additional scenes&quot;, and foul language that adds nothing to the movie, but an R rating. Why tamper with what worked? In my opinion, they should have left the original alone.
B000050HTO|5.0|As many have already written, making a 4-disc Dylan \\"Essential\\" collection out of Bob Dylan's monstrous (40+ albums!) material would be hard. So making a 2-disc one is quite impossible. Yet the \\"Essential\\" Bob Dylan does a worthy job of incorporating material from his heyday in the 60s and his more recent efforts together into one collection. I myself am a huge Dylan fan and I own all of his 60s albums, some of his 70s material (Blood on the Tracks + Desire), none of his 80s work, and his two most recent albums (Time out of Mind + Love and Theft). This collection displays all his big hits with 3 glaring tracks missing by my count: \\"Visions of Johanna,\\" \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" and \\"Desolation Row.\\" Also I would have liked to see at least one of Dylan's less famous anti-war ballads, either \\"Masters of War\\" or \\"With God on Our Side.\\" The colletion DOES include the original versions of \\"Knockin on Heaven's Door\\" and \\"All Along the Watchtower.\\" I myself prefer the live versions of both of these, but it is nice to see what they originally sounded like (they have been covered myriad times by various artists, most notably by artists like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Guns N Roses). <br />This collection rolls through with hit after hit, but it stumbles in a few places: the last 2 tracks of CD one, although both good songs, could have been replaced by any of the previously mentioned glaring ommissions. CD two starts strong with \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" but the next 3 songs, though catchy, again could have been replaced by more brilliant work (Dylan has plenty of it). Later on disc 2 we see only 4 songs representing his entire 80s work, and out of those the only great song is \\"Jokerman.\\" The rest (especially \\"Silvio\\" and \\"Everything is Broken\\") are quite forgetable, much like Dylan in the 80s. But the collection finishes strong with the raw, emotional, lyrically amazing \\"Not Dark Yet\\" which in 1997 was Dylan's best song in at least 12 years, probably more like 23, and \\"Things Have Changed,\\" another Dylan track with touching lyrics, which was only available on the Wonder Boys Soundtrack before. <br />If you are a casual Bob fan or not a fan at all, buy this collection as your first Dylan CD. But be aware that Dylan is much more than a hit single. And really, instead of a collection of songs, whole albums of his (Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61, Blood on the Tracks) should be considered \\"Essential.\\"
0385493622|4.0|Singh and Lynch have successfully presented one of the most abstract subjects in a simple to understand language. For those who put down a Maths book by looking at the complex equations: Fear Not, this one does not go too deep into equations and relies more on plain English to convey the point. I think that Appendixes could have been a bit more descriptive. Overall it was a fun read. I highly recommend this one for Mathematics appetite of Not-So-Mathematical.
B00005QZWI|5.0|i bought this CD before i saw the movie. while listening to the CD i thought it would not have the emotion to back the action in the movie, but when i saw the movie, the music that Howard Shore composed fit PERFECTLY! it matched the emotion the movie tried to convey just PERFECTLY! this is definitely one of the best movie scores ever written. while it didnt have melodies that stood out, it did not need to. its purpose was to enhance the action and emotions of the film which it did...PERFECTLY!
0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a action pack entertainment book. From the first page to the last,Black Hawk Down is filled with heart pounding action. The book takes a hold of you making not want to put it down ever! When reading this gripping novel deciding if you should go to the bathroom or continue reading to see if Eversmann will see the Somali with the machine gun in the corner before its too late, becomes a difficult decision. Black Hawk Down is the number 1 novel of all time, and a must read.
B0000042H4|5.0|Forget buying the highlights of Der Ring, GET THIS! this is the finest and most passionate recording of Wagner's magnificent Der Ring. Sir Georg Solti does what no one else, i think, can do: he interprets Wagner's Ring Cycle with passion and intensity. IT IS WORTH THE MONEY. it is worth it to listen to the entire 17 hours of operatic heaven. this music flows like a river, unending (some may find that a nuisance--after all, the quote &quot;it ain't over till the fat lady sings&quot; comes from Siegfried, where by the fourth hour Brunhilde finally shows up to start singing) and and beautiful. My favorite is the fourth opera, Gotterdammerung, which shows Wagner at his finest. by this time, Wagner understood the complexities of music--like only Mozart could in his final days--and brought us some of the most poignant and passionate music created. pay especial attention to  Hagen calling Gunter's men to greet Gunter and his new &quot;wife&quot; Brunhilde. Such passion! Or Alberich talking to his sleeping son, Hagen. Or Hagen discussing Siegfried's blood pact with Gunter as the Siegfried and Gunter left to collect Gunter's new wife. This is truly the best classical music has to offer.
B000066NW0|5.0|Most artists now don't have the vocal ability as artists from long ago and they get sold on what they look like and how sexy they can be.  This is totally untrue for new singer/song-writer Avril Lavigne.  I think that she is a great role model for young people out there wheather they want to become signers or just want their voices to be heard. Avril's voice is heard on this CD \\"Let Go\\" many, many times.<br />Let Go- this is a great openning song to the CD.  It has a great rock feel to it, yet its still danceable and of course very catchy<br />Complicated- a great choice for the first single.  it shows how life can become complicated at times because of peer persure and having to act like your someone your not<br />skater boy- this is another great song telling the story of a girl who gave up a boy and how her life turns out<br />i'm with you- one of my favorite songs on the CD. really shows her voice. starts out slow but picks up in the end<br />mobile- a great song showing what it might be like to be on the rode as a new singer or to just be so busy you don't have time for your normal everyday life<br />Unwanted- this is a great song with a lot of emotions, and very true to life<br />tomorrow- i really like this song...the first time i heard it compared with the faster songs on the CD i was like \\"where did this come from\\" and i skipped it but i finally listened to it and its one of my favorites<br />anything but ordinary- this is one of my favorite songs.  i find it very fun and easy to listen to, i've listened to it so many times, i sing it in my head in school when i'm bored.  its a great song<br />things i'll never say- this is another one of my favorites, i just really like this song and i'm not exactly sure why.  its another song thats very easy to listen to<br />my world- i can relate to this song very much, when she sings about washing her hair for an hour and taking 5 hours to straighten it, i couldn't help but laugh it reminds me so much of my sister<br />nobody's fool- this is another great song, i really like the taking idea instead of singing, i think thats really interesting<br />too much to ask- i haven't listened to this song as much as the others since i got the CD a few days ago, but its a good one<br />naked- another really nice song, a little slower then the rest, but still shows her ability to sing.<br />this is without a doubt one of the best CDs that i have bought in a while.  everyone should have this CD!!!!!!!!!

After the first track, \\"Call to Arms\\" the next 7 tracks are a little on the mellow side, but stay with the same MANOWAR attitude that we fans hail. The single of the album is great, and the following 3 tracks are the heaviest songs MANOWAR has ever penned. House of Death is heavier than Kings Of Metal and Louder Than Hell combined. Hail MANOWAR! <br />THOR GOD OF THUNDER, LET ME DIE WITH A SWORD IN MY HAND!
B0000041ZT|5.0|Shostakovich was truly gifted and this CD shows some of his best works. I have loved this CD all the time i've listened to it.
B00004XONN|5.0|when i first listened to kid a, it sound weird, more so than the first time i  listened to okc, then i listened a couple of times again to found out that was short in length compared to most other cd´s.<br />i started to listen to it a bit less over that first week however those strange electronic sounds began to be meaningful  more and more. <br />tunes like idioteque and everything in its right place were he first ones to make sense,  motion picture soundtrack was available long before on the net but this was a beautiful version.<br />but then optimistic and how to dissapear completely totally blew me away, they are so complex and expressive<br />i still think that okc is the best record by radiohead or anyone else but kid a is state of the art <br />in kid a loud guitars are even less noticeable than in okc and vocals are minimal yet  the record is a vibrant art of work<br />im not a big fan of electronica, but radiohead work is a proof that art overcomes  genre
0066620996|5.0|I've previously read Build to Last, but this book is far more essential to creating a successful company.  And anyone who's read the marketing books by Al Ries and Jack Trout will see much of what they teach reflected in Jim's Good to Great.  Especially Focus, by Al Ries, which mirrors the all-important &quot;hedgehog&quot; principle in Good to Great -- pick one thing and put the whole company behind it, shedding off all parts that do not add to the main goal of the company.<br />The &quot;Level 5&quot; leadership concept is truly this books biggest break-through, as I've not seen it discussed by anyone else.  If your company doesn't have a Leve 5 leader, you're probably fighting a losing battle if industry leadership is your goal.
B00005OWEG|5.0|After having played around with his Godfather trilogy many times over the years, Francis Ford Coppola felt it was time to tackle another one of his cinematic beasts from the past, namely Apocalypse Now, his 1979 nightmare Vietnam epic about a group of American soldiers (led by Martin Sheen) heading up river on a mission to assassinate a crazed colonel (Marlon Brando). <br />With Apocalypse Now Redux, Coppola has re-edited his original masterpiece, inserting 49 minutes of additional footage and, though interesting as history, it is debatable as to if the extra scenes actually add to the film in general. <br />Sure, the bonus footage of Robert Duvall's surf and napalm-lovin' Colonel Kilgore is a welcome addition, as are some additional scenes of interplay between the soldiers and a monologue by Brando's character, Colonel Kurtz. Others (an additional encounter with Playboy bunnies, the legendary French plantation sequence) are much less welcome, not only softening the film's grip of terror, but making it seem about twice as long as the 202-minute running time. <br />Thank goodness then for DVD, a medium that can allow viewers to easily decide which version to watch by inserting or dropping any additional scenes at their own pleasure.
B000065V1V|5.0|David Bowie has recorded his finest album, each track is pure bowie, while he does a cover of the pixies ''Cactus'' it is the title track that seems to take flight.  Bowie's voice has never sounded this pure and this strong.  Come award time the grammies should reward him for Heathen with Album Of The Year,<BR>but if that doesn't happen let it be said Heathen is brillant and David Bowie is back to reclaim his place in music may Britney and Nsync burn off the face of the earth. Long Live David Bowie
B000065U1N|4.0|I highly recommend this film. whether you like war movies or not, it is a great film and you will love it.  It was very well directed and the actors were wonderful (not to mention attractive).  But if you have a weak stomach, you may find some of the content hard to watch.<br />The only problem one might find is that there is no backround story as to why the US troops were there or what the War was really about.  If you are a person who needs information like that then it will bug you (as it did me. i suggest reading the book or information on the subject).  But you must remember, most of the soliders going in there didn't know what the war was about, or why it was any of the US's business.  They were never given any real details.  the beauty of the film is that it's more throught the soliders' point of view.  you're left wondering 'what is going on and why?'  well, so were they.<br />I can only ask that you keep an open mind while watching this movie.  don't think of it as a real event or think about the politics related to it.  it will be easier that way.  otherwise you'll be sitting there like i was wondering what in the hell were our men doing in that country.  it wasn't our war, and we shouldn't have been there.  I didn't enjoy it the first time because i kept thinking of those things.  so please, just treat is as just another movie, nothing more.  <br />the DVD:  is not the best i have seen, but is still great.  it has a few trailers (not for the movie itself though) and behind the scenes look at the filming.  and a few other things.
B00006690F|5.0|The Eminem Show is everything every one of us would love to have produced in one form or fashion. We have all fantasized about being in the position to avenge - on a grand scale - all of those who have committed injustices against us. This is an opportunity to experience it vicariously. Eminem is absolutely brilliant in his vocal delivery, and has reinforced his message with lyrical and rhythmic intensity that lands, track after track. His most chilling work is a message to kids delivered over Aerosmith classic, Dream On, wherein he admonishes them for carrying guns just because he does, explaining...\\"we're [famous] entertainers, you ignoramuses, we're just protectin' ourselves.\\" I don't usually buy rap or hip-hop, but as a rocker-slash alternative junkie, this CD just blew me away...
B000066NW0|5.0|I heard \\"Complicated\\" on the radio--fell in love with it. Finally, when I got the CD, I started to listen to every song, and it was so incredibly COOL! Think Mandy Moore, Alanis, and Gwen Stefani all rolled into one major piece of work. This CD is Jagged Little Pill on ... Just like Jagged Little Pill, I loved every song on this album--and that is very rare. The music is all written by Avril, so its all normal pains that everyone goes through (not bubble-gum, straight from the factory pop). Some of it is angsty (Losing Grip is a GREAT break-up song), some of it is just fun to sing to (Anything But Ordinary is darned catchy!). Unlike Alanis, Avril has a great mix of all of the emotions on this album, not just the ticked off ones, along with some ROCKIN guitar. Everyone will find something to love about this CD, I'm going to buy three copies tomorrow for my best friends--and that is saying something, considering how many different tastes my friends have. Avril is bringing the good old \\"write it yourself/play it yourself/sing it yourself\\" nature to alternative music that is a long overdue rebirth. I imagine that much like Sheryl and Alanis, Avril will be here long after her pop counter-parts are filing for unemployment.
B000002KIK|5.0|Never Say Die! is my second favorite album of the Sabbath albums (next to Sabotage). It has different styles of music. Swinging the Chain is like the jazz of the album. Air Dance is like the soft song of the album. My favorite song is Shock Wave because of the solo. I recommened this to people who wish to start a sabbath fanaticum.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie (like Saving Private Ryan) is a great depiction of what happened.  The movie, to me, is more bloody and violence.  My fiance started crying in the movie there was so much, she couldn't handle it.  But it was a very awesome movie.  Word of Advice: If you or spouse can't handle blood and gore, don't watch it.  But if you like war movies that are true stories, this is the movie to rent.  And don't watch it at 10pm at nite, the movie is 3 hours long. :)
B000021XS0|5.0|This is the most amazing CD I have heard in a very long time. Everyone who has any knowledge of or enjoys listening to music must get this one. The only problem I have with it when I put it in the player is which song do I want to hear first. That is a good problem to have. Please trust and listen to me, buy this CD and you will be forever grateful that you did.
0385335482|5.0|Firstly, though the character of Rebecca is somewhat of a loser (because of all the lying), I really related to her (I hate getting my credit card bills, too!!) Secondly, because her character is so relatable (like the character of \\"Heartbreaker\\"), she really resonates well with the reader. We've all has those fantasies of hitting it rich or whatever. And we've all had tons of fun spending money we simply didn't have. Maybe this book is more of a cautionary tale than anything, but I truly enjoyed it.
B00006690G|5.0|This is the first Eminem CD I've ever bought.  I loved this CD so much I bought The Marshall Mathers CD and The Slim Shady CD.  I've alway's thought Eminem was a true talent but being a 32 year old mother of a 5 year old didn't find his CD's to be something I should listen to but after seeing the \\"Without Me\\" video I had to have the CD and found that he is one of the best artist I've heard.  No I don't listen to him when my child is around but it's hard because I want to listen to him all the time. <br />\\"Hailie's Song\\" is one of the best songs on the CD and I think he really laid himself on the line to record it. \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\"... I love the fact that he let his daughter do a song with him and it's a good song too. <br /> Oh heck the whole CD is great.  Like I said Eminem Rocks.  You should get this whether your a 32 year old mom or a 14 year old teen.
080013558X|1.0|Has Never Seen the Original Stage Version.  This movie is a preposterous mess and it flopped for one simple reason: it bears little to no resemblance to the brilliant Broadway production of the late seventies.  The musical is full of fun and life, but the people behind this movie decided to go for a more cinematic version which was much darker and could and probably frequently does scare young children.  We have here Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily actually succeeding in capturing Annie (which never originally happened).  We even see the young orphan hanging on to an upraised bridge for dear life (an eleven year old actually in deadly peril?! For shame!!!!)  The added characters (Punjab and the Asp) added nothing but stupidity to an already horrendous film.  How can anyone criticize the Disney film of a few years ago?  It is much closer to the stage version than this monstrosity (and it included one of the best songs cut from the theatrical release - N.Y.C.).  I find it fascinatingly questionable that a cast of this caliber could have been involved in this disaster.  Some of Broadway's legendary performers (Ms. Burnett, Ms. Peters, Ms. Reinkin) should definately have thought twice.  Perhaps they were anticipating a rebirth of the movie musical and went about it totally in the wrong way.  I am so glad that I was involved in a stage production of Annie as Rooster.  One has to wonder how involved Mr. Charnin and Mr. Stousse were in this venture.  I recall seeing only that it was based on their original stage musical (however loosely).
B00004Z45A|5.0|Linkin Park is the best hard rock band I have ever heard. Their songs light'n my day up and they keep me awake a full day without yawning. I think Linkin Park should make more albums so I can buy them. From listening to them, it makes me think I want to make my band wih some of my best friends. I think Linkin Park is the best and their the collest band their ever was. I think Linkin Park is definately welcome to the MusicWorld. I think they should be Congratulated! This is my opinion on Linkin Park.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is a very good movie if you understand it. I highly recomend you read the book first(You can buy and preview the book ... in [any] Military History Section). You will get a better understanding of the U.N.'s purpose of the missions that were held in Mogidishu(Or as the Rangers called it, Mog). You also get more connected to the Delta Force, Rangers, and Night Stalkers that took part in the missions. I also recomend that you watch \\"The True Story of Black Hawk Down\\" on the History Channel.
B000065U1N|5.0|Mark Bowden did a spectacular job of reporting a story hidden during the Clinton years. And the producers remained remarkably faithful to the original, detailed research. By sticking to the basic story, using special effects and explosives in context, and simply letting these real heroes havee their stories unfold, &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; works out to be one of the most inspiring, well-produced, riveting human stories of the past decade.<br />The ensemble cast avoids the &quot;headliner&quot; effect of most &quot;action&quot; movies. The story, based on the real events, doesn't need a pivotal figure. There is enough credit to go around.
B0000636UN|2.0|What a waste of money! sheryl has always been one of my favorate female singer, for many reasons. the main resaon is that she is a hot chick who plays gautar and does not sing fluffy pop hits. As for this cd in my mind its all fluffy pop hits geared to geting a younger people to buy it. only thing I liked was the video for &quot;soak up the sun&quot; but the song lyrics need work really bad. the other song people seem to like is &quot;Steve Mcqueen&quot; but it is very forgetable just like the song on the cd. dont buy this buy the 93 release &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; its a way better cd.
B000065V1V|4.0|4 or 5 good songs on this album, I love &quot; I will be your slave&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot; amazing opening , &quot;5:15 Angels are gone&quot; beatifully built. &quot; Slow burn&quot; and &quot; Slip Away&quot; are also good. The version of Pixies &quot; Cactus&quot; has something missing. The Neil Young and Space Cowboys versions are ok. Bowies voice is very rich in this album and sometimes emotional. The best of all is Bowie coming back to the melodic style that I love. <BR>Good effortless effort for Mr Bowie
B000060P79|5.0|No Pads, No Helmat... Just Balls is a MUST HAVE c.d.  If you are in to bands like Blink 182 and such, you will love this C.D.  No pads, No helmet...

0786867973|5.0|What a wonderful book!  Nigella's wit paired with her cooking skills make for a great read.  Every recipe I have tried has turned out great.  It's easy to feel like Nigella is in the kitchen with you, coaching you along.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest and love for food and cooking!
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is one of the best books I have ever read. I can not believe Steinbeck can write a 107 page book and make the reader feel like they have known the character their wholes lives.  It is sad to see how someone like Lennie can be treated, but great to know that there is always someone like George to be there for them.  The ending is very good.  I high recommend this book to others.
B00005JKZT|5.0|After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring more than a dozen times and sitting with eyes widened and glued to the screen during The Two Towers trailer, all I can say is Hurry December!! Please hurry!!  (I have already preorderd the theater cut that will be out in August and the Extended collector's edition due out in November...hopefully this will help the time pass a bit faster!)For not having read the books, the gentleman who wrote the review on the trailer seems to have a good grip on the story and like so many of us 'Ringers' seems to have been bitten by the Tolkien bug!  Namarie---farewell in Elvish.
B0000640VN|4.0|I originally went to see it to take in the wonder that is Bradley Whitford and was presently surprised to like the movie as a whole. Granted, Bradley is still a hottie in this movie, but the story between Kate [Meg] and Leopold [Hugh] is very sweet and touching.<br />A must own for romantics at heart!
0140186395|5.0|A friend once asked me, \\"Hey do you know any books that I can read over the summer?\\". I said, \\"Well, what kind of book are you looking for?\\".<BR>\\"Umm... A book that is very thought provoking. A book that has an exciting storyline. A book with multiple themes. A book that would want you to never stop reading until you finished it. Oh and one more thing. How about a book with a lot of biblical allusions. Biblical allusions always intrigue me.\\"<BR>\\"Well my friend,\\" I said to him, \\"I have just the right book for you. Have you heard of the author John Steinbeck?\\"<BR>\\"Yes I have. Isn't that the dude who wrote the book The Grapes of Wrath?\\"<BR>\\"Yes he is. Well the book I am about to suggest is written by the same author. The book is called East Of Eden. Say...there is a biblical allusion in the title itself.\\"<br />This book indeed is full of biblical allusion such as the story of Cain and Abel. Some of the themes in the book include love, good vs. evil, and morality. Yes, I know this book sounds like a whole bunch of comentary and not much of a plot. But infact, one of the things that makes this book great is the great storyline. I recomend everyone to read this book. Its really fun and educational too.
B00002E224|4.0|Lately, Hollywood has been rehashing the sappy, neurotic comedy style for the Romance genre into the same film for each wave of young actors, upcoming and already situated as celebrities.  Meg Ryan has been overcast as the same, myopic lonely American woman, John Cusack equally branded with similar roles of the opposite gender.<br />What Linklater did for Gen-X with his groundbreaking film Slackers, he's given to the genre of the Romantic comedy with the same integrity and off-beat style that marks his fortitude.  Linklater has come a long way from his stomping grounds in Texas.  For Before Sunrise, he's recruited Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy into roles that seem as if written for the actors, staking his claim upon the winding cobblestone streets of Vienna.<br />The film is a venue of dialogue that is real, not pandering to emotions and melodrama.  Hawke and Delpy discuss life, love, philosophy, and death in a 14 hour window before a respective train to Paris and plane back to the U.S., possibly forever separating the two.  From this description, you would think this is a film of never ending chatter and neurotic bantering of the psyche and human nature.  Not at all.  Linklater creates an emotional connection between the couple that is sealed with kisses beneath an Austrian moon, tales of heartbreak, 1st crushes, discussions of human compulsion in cafes and a seedy bar.  The words that Hawke and Delpy speak are our own experiences, played out by two actors who seem to enjoy, if not relish their roles and dailogue that is a refreshing change from the cliches and stale bitching of so many other \\"Romantic\\" films.<br />Before Sunrise has much more hidden in the shadows and alleys of Vienna.  Allusions to Freud, Orson Welles, and other innocuous references make the film enjoyable upon an intellectual level, but the film's mainstay is it's romantic honesty that makes the movie an enjoyable romp in the hay.
0060207051|1.0|My daughter never liked this book.  My husband nor I ever cared for it either.  It didn't keep our daughter's attention at all nor did it \\"soothe\\".  It just didn't live up to all the hype.  We read to our daughter all the time and have since her birth and she loves almost all books, but not this one.  She much prefered Sandra Boynton's board books.
0140067477|5.0|In this book, you learn some things. Not important things, just<BR>things that can change your life. Confused by that? Read The Tao<BR>of Pooh and you will understand. And that's the great thing about it. It helps you understand things on a level that you could definitely (unless you are wise already, like me (har!))not normally. And another great thing (there are about 5,468)about this book is that it doesn't try to force anything on you, doesn't try to convert you to anything, etc. It't just a vault of hidden wisdom in the last place you'd expect.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Ok...so i go down to my record store and pick up \\"I Get Wet\\"...i pop it in my cd player and am BLOWN AWAY!...this cd has a great mix of 80's hair metal (but without the each song sounding the same type thing) and 80's pop (the keyborad synth type thing)...\\"I Get Wet\\" sounds like a warped \\"Twisted Metal\\" soundtrack...from the first song (It's Time To Party), immediately you think of an out of control college frat house...this cd has everything for every fan of rock...in fact, it's rock's savior.  BUY IT AND GO TO THE SHOWS!!! <BR>Dan
6305910189|4.0|OK, I got to chime in here.  Never mind the Chekov ID problem; did anybody else notice that the Chippendale dancers that played Khan's followers all appeared to be in their 20's.  Simple math dictates that if they had been stranded for 15 years all these folks were children when 'Space Seed' was aired.  There were no children seen in Khan's group in the original episode.  If these are the children of the adult (at the time) Khan followers where are all Khan's contemporaries?   Killed for by the worm-things?  Questions, Questions...

078322687X|4.0|\\"Dear Mr.Vernon,<BR>We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice an entire Saturday in detention for what we did wrong, and what we did was wrong but we think you're crazy for making us write a essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us. In the most simplest terms, the most convient defintions you see us a brain, an athlete, and a basketcase, a Princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerly yours, The Breakfast club.\\" -One of the most remembered movie speeches ever.<br />My title should sum up my love of this movie. I saw it 2 years ago and have watched it at least 1 million times since then, i'm actually amazed my copy hasn't worn out. It stars the fabulous cast Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy, as Andrew \\"The athlete\\", Brian \\"The Brain\\", John Bender \\"The criminal\\", Claire\\"The Princess\\", and Allison \\"The basketcase\\" respectively. The cast works fablously together and at times you feel you're right there with them. At first they can't go five minutes without arguing (especially Bender and Andrew) but by the end of the day they have laughed and cried and know each other in way no one else will ever know them. <br />My only dissapointment with the dvd (and the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars) is because I was a bit dissapointed with the special features part of the dvd, While the production notes were nice I am dissapointed there were no trailer or deleted scenes (I know there must be some since I have heard Judd Nelson say they shot over 4 hrs worth of film and since there are 2 scenes that are in the tv version of the film but not in the dvd or Vhs release) My BIG HOPE (John Hughes and Universal pictures are you listening?!) is that for the 20th anniversary which is approaching is that there will be a special edition dvd released and the film be rereleased in theateres (PLEASE NO REMAKE!!) I would LOVE a Sequel made but unfortunately I think the \\"Brat pack\\" label unfairly bestowed on the actors messed that up but hey we fans can dream right?
B0000069NM|5.0|I'm kinda surprised these guys didn't team up earlier, they all have a similar jack-swing\funk approach to jazz.  While a few of the songs are free form and dissonant, most have distinctive guitar melodies from Sco and headbobbing funky rhythms underneath, courtesy MMW.  <br />Medeski shows how versatile the Hammond is, whining with blues style chords, or, rapidly picking at the keys, accenting and syncopating the melody (it reminds me of turntable scratching).   This album has some nice ballads too; the organ chords are very soulful.  Sco also delivers rhythmic background chords on the 6-string acoustic, but the melody mainly comes from the electric jazz guitar.<br />It would be great to listen to another project come from this team  --jazz guitar with a funky rhythm section go together like peanut butter and jelly.<br />If you like this album, you'll like Soulive, another funk\groove\jazz\hip hop band.
0385503954|5.0|Those readers who gallop through novels--or rather skate over their surfaces--or even throw them away half-read when they become too difficult, should be warned that this one demands some thought and attention.<BR> <BR>Those who find the criminal conviction in this story \\"improbable\\" need to remember when the story is set. Actually it's all too likely, given the \\"victim\\" and the significance of class in pre-war England. (In any case: note that Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel has just been convicted of murder on far less evidence).  <br />This book's brilliant design does not emerge until the final pages, and its full power comes only upon reflection. So bring something along or you'll miss the parade.
6302842174|5.0|This is a collection of all her work from Wuthering Heights through Running Up That Hill to Babooshka. It's easy to see why she hasn't fallen into the commercial trap. An artist in every sense of the word, she cleverly uses her thought-provoking lyrics and surrealistic performances to charm and shock at the same time. A word of warning to the faint of heart: some of the tracks may leave you feeling a bit unsettled. Still, it's a great video collection, very original and moving.
B000002H70|5.0|I don't normally write reviews.. But Im making an exception for this. Nothing I can say would do this album any justice. But I will say this... Everything that is inside me is what this cd is. All the love and all the hurt and pain.  Every single song is an emotional masterpiece. Definately a must have.
6302799066|5.0|There are few scenes in cinematic history that are more indelibly etched into the publics imagination like the image of Slim Pickens rodeo-riding a nuclear bomb on its way to oblivion.  While this is one of the final scenes in \\"Dr. Strangelove... Or, How I learned to Stop Worry and Love the Bomb\\", it showcases that strangely dark comedic tone that immerses the entire movie.  At the time the movie was released (1964, scheduled for late 1963, but postponed because of Kennedy's assassination), panic over the prospect of mutually assured destruction as a result of a nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union overwhelmed the American public.  1962's Cuban Missile Crisis did little to assuage those fears.  That same year, a writer named Peter George wrote a novel called \\"Red Alert\\" where the premise was the occurrence of accidental nuclear war.  It was made into a movie called \\"Fail Safe\\" that had a very somber tone focusing on the horror of that occurrence.  At the same time, odd-ball director Stanley Kubrick decided to take the premise of \\"Red Alert\\" of make his own movie based on it.  However, during the course of scripting it for the screen, Kubrick realized that several of the scenes could be and were actually quite funny.  So, he decided to change the tone from a serious war movie to a black comedy.  The result was a truly landmark film.<br />The audience gets an early hint of its off-beat nature with the first of many 'unique' names.  Deranged General Jack D. Ripper (played with commanding menace by Sterling Hayden) decides to close off Burpelson Air Force Base to the outside world and send commands to his bombers holding at their fail-safe points to proceed to bombing targets in the Soviet Union.  Ripper's rationale is that the Soviets have invaded America in the most gruesome way possible: infiltrating their bodily fluids with fluoride(!!!).  The almost hapless administration of President Merkin Muffley convenes in an underground war room to figure out what went wrong and how to undo it.  The president's main military advisor is General Buck Turgidson; a psychotic old warhorse who thinks this accidental launch is a blessing in a disguise and that America should launch all their weapons on the Russians and destroy them while suffering 'only' 20-30 million casualties, tops(!).<br />Turgidson's view is what the U.S. may have realized had General Patton had his way at the end of World War II.  It should come as no surprise that the roles of General Turgidson in this movie and General Patton is his biopic 7 years later were both played by actor George C. Scott.  Those who loved \\"Patton\\" will see the seeds of the performance beginning to sprout in \\"Dr. Strangelove..\\".<br />President Muffley enlists the services of one Dr. Strangelove, an exiled German scientist, to help figure out how to resolve this predicament (avoiding the attack which will trigger the Russians 'Doomsday' bomb).  Dr. Strangelove worked on the A-Bomb project for the Nazis and seems to have a difficult time controlling the actions of his right hand.<br />There are too many well-realized characters to address each one individually and still do them justice.  The true star is the way in which Kubrick satirizes the nuclear policies of the time and the overall nuclear fears.  Prevalent at the time were the concerns over the 'bomb gap', the difference between the number of bombs the U.S. had versus the number the Russians had.  When the Turgidson and company become aware of the Russian \\"Doomsday' device, they complain about the 'Doomsday Gap'.  When it becomes obvious that there is no way to stop the iminent nuclear attack, the president and his advisors begin discussing ways to preserve the American way of life through the use of mine shafts for people to live in until it is safe, they argue about avoiding a 'mine shaft gap' with the Russians.  It seems to be Kubrick's intention to illuminate the absurdity of the real-life debates with the extreme concerns in this movie.  He does so expertly.  Of course, there is the one truly memorable line uttered by President Muffley when Turgidson and the Russian ambassador get into a scuffle, \\"Gentleman! You can't fight here!  This is the War Room!\\".<br />Beyond the tone of the movie, there are several other unique aspects to \\"Dr. Strangelove...\\" that also help elevate to one of the top movies in history.  Legendary British actor Peter Sellers played not one, but three (!), roles in this movie.  He is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF (who tries to talk General Ripper out of his mad plan), President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove.  He was rumored to be slated to play Major T.J. \\"King\\" Kong, but he suffered a leg injury and the role was given to Slim Pickens.  It's just as well, because one would find it hard to imagine even an actor as gifted as Sellers performing the southern hick pilot role nearly as well as Pickens did.  It is also notable that this is the very first movie that James Earl Jones appeared in.<br />The final scenes show a series of nuclear explosions, but not in a manner that depicts horror or destruction.  It is almost poetic how the explosions flash in tune with Vera Lynn's light \\"We'll Meet Again\\" song.  Deft satirical directing like that is what enables \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" to be as popular today as it was almost 40 years ago.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is THE definitive rush album.  Along with 2112 and hemispheres moving pictures demonstates the greatness of a band that has with stood the test of time.  I beleive that this album is as accessible today as it was in 1981.  The reason being the production. It's flawless. Every instrument can be heard perfectly.  The musicianship is all there...tight rythyms, intricate arrangments.  These guys have got to be 3 of the greatest musicians i've ever heard.  I personally think geddy lee is the greatest musician in the history of rock and roll which by the way I actually got the chance to say to him in person.  I don't know of to many people who can sing vocals, play bass (arguably the greatest bass player of all time along with cliff burton and steve harris) and play synthesisers, keys and pedals.  Unbeleivable.  Of course neil peart demonstrates why he's considered to be one of the greatest drummers of all time.  Some of alex lifeson's solos are pretty amazing as well.  Red Barchetta, tom sawyer..probably rush's most popular song, yyz ....a killer instrumental, and limelight are some good examples.  All in all an essential album to add to your collection.  GET IT!!!!
B00005ASIL|4.0|Nobody ever played a flute quite like Ian Anderson; and no band ever sounded quite like Jethro Tull.  And while this single-disc &quot;best of&quot; collection is not perfect, it is nevertheless an accurate representation of Tull's 30-plus years of making quirky, rarely-commercial folk-art rock.  The liner notes, written by Ian Anderson himself, are brief but to the point; and considering the liner notes are about all you get in the way of documentation with this disc, it's a good thing Anderson personally penned them.<br />And what of the music selections on this compilation?  I must confess that they are impressively diverse, spanning the early recordings and carrying us right up to the present day.  There are more early tracks than later ones; and there should be, because the earlier ones are better, and more well-known.  The inclusion of &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Dream&quot; were low-risk, but expected.  The edits of &quot;Too Old to Rock n Roll&quot;, &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;, and &quot;Minstrel...&quot; are regrettable, but tastefully done, and understandable, considering the time limits.  As it is, you get over 78 minutes of Tull on one CD, so it's hard to complain.  There are a couple of nice surprises: the inclusion of the beautiful &quot;Witch's Promise&quot;, and sneaking in &quot;A Song For Jeffrey&quot; near the end of the disc. <br />There are, however, a couple of inexcusable omissions (considering some of the song that WERE included).  Where is &quot;Teacher&quot;?  How could &quot;Skating Away&quot; be left off, but &quot;Bungle&quot; included?  And while I like the more recent songs like &quot;Broadsword&quot; and &quot;Roots To Branches&quot;, if I'd been doing the choosing we'd get &quot;Orion&quot; from Stormwatch in favor of one of those two.<br />Despite the complaints--and no matter what songs were chosen, any owner of multiple Tull vinyl albums would complain--this disc is well worth the money.  It's a valued addition to anyone's CD collection, and a fine representative introduction to a new generation of Tull fans in the digital age.  And hey, I can always fire up the CD burner and make my own mix, correcting the record company's flaws and including &quot;Teacher&quot;, &quot;Skating Away&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, and the FULL version of &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery.&quot;  Excuse me while I go take care of that!
B00005U16N|5.0|Director Ted Demme died from a drug overdose around a year after finishing Blow.  One suspects that the highly talented Demme desired to confront his own demons while putting together this first rate film.  Johnny Depp aptly portrays George Jung as a man who subtly, but most assuredly chose the path to self destruction.  He is not a victim and deserves no pity.  Is Jung a monster? Perhaps not, but he made his own bed and now has to lie in it.  Jung is greatly responsible for introducing the horror of cocaine into the United States.  He starts out as a typical teenager from a blue collar family.  Jung's father (Ray Liotta) and mother (Rachel Griffiths) raises their family in a struggling middle class environment.  During his early adult years, Jung travels to California and starts enjoying the wild parties, easy sex, and mind altering drugs.  He eventually meets a major drug seller (Paul Reubens) who partners with him to market very large quantities of marijuana.  Common sense dictates that sooner or later Jung will be arrested.  Sadly, however, Jung is not only personally addicted to drugs but also the accompanying risky lifestyle. Rational considerations therefore will not stand in the way of Jung's slide into evil and debauchery.<br />We eventually accompany Jung to Columbia where he is promoted to the major leagues of drug running.  Betrayal and back stabbing become the norm.  He meets and marries Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a woman is also a coke junkie and out of control pleasure seeker.  Hedonism dominates their lifestyle, and money is so plentiful that neither knows how to spend it all.  They flippantly make large purchases which soon bore them.  Bringing a child into the world does little to encourage prudence.  Their train is going to crash, and one can only hope the collateral damage is minimal.  Our eyes are riveted to the screen as Jung is ultimately brought to a bad end. Ted Demme may have been too conflicted to unambiguously present George Jung as a moral monster deserving of severe punishment, but we never mistake him for some sort of misunderstood folk hero.<br />Blow will force you to wonder if our drug laws make any sense.  Is it truly worth the damage to our political and public institutions to continue criminalizing such activity?  Jung, after all,  may be still be in jail, but his successors remain on the street.  I also recommend Traffic and the utterly fantastic and overlooked masterpiece, Rush.  And yes, parents should definitely encourage their adolescent children to view this disturbing film.monster deserving of severe punishment, but we never mistake him for some sort of misunderstood folk hero.<br />Blow will force you to wonder if our drug laws make any sense.

B000065U1N|5.0|After reading the book a couple of years ago, I was extremely pleased to see this story turned into a movie. What's great about this flick is that it stays true to what happened. <BR>Some people I have spoken to didn't like this movie, and in some respects, I can understand why. The movie is not a movie as such, rather a 'retelling' a 'recounting' of the sequence of events. There is no development of the characters, because there does not need to be. This is not a Hollywood 'blockbuster' in the traditional sense. It is a true story, and, as often occurs, reality is often more thrilling than fantasy. A female friend of mine took me to see this film, and its definitely not a 'chick flick'<BR>No for the great stuff. This movie is packed full of military hardware, and phenomenal amounts of ammunition being fired left right and centre. From the moment Voodoo Chile kicks off with the Black Hawks and Little Birds lifting off, my skin gets goose bumps with excitement (ok, I am a little warped). As the gatling guns unleash hell upon the enemy, you get a perspective of what really went on. Yes, the carnage caused by the US special forces is awesome, but what truely comes out, the ultimate message of the movie, is the courage and determination of the men who fought, and died, risking all to ensure that no-one gets left behind, and that is what truely seperates these soldiers. One of the coolest flicks of all times, I saw it three times at the movies. Absolutely brilliant.
0385505833|5.0|Have you ever thought of skipping Christmas altogether because of all the commercialism?  I certainly have.  Not his usual intense style, this book is delightful light reading from John Grisham, and thoroughly enjoyable from cover to cover.  Well worth the price, and a great book to have handy for a day you're rained-out or snowed-in.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Ok, I'm giving this five stars, which I rarely do, because it really does the job!  I expected this to be another one of those comic book adaptations you have to be a long-time fan to get into.  It wasn't.  The basic premise (the lead character is transformed into a super-human after a bite from a genetically enhanced spider) is easy to follow, and from there on out it's just a matter of suspending disbelief and enjoying the show.<br />Toby Maquire was adorable as the webbed hero.  His love-interest, Kirsten Dunst, didn't have much to do besides look pretty, but she did that well.  Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin may have been just a smidgen over the top, but hey, it IS a comic book story after all!  He certainly had the creepiness down pat.<br />All in all very enjoyable.  Lots room for a sequel, and if there is one I'll watch it.  :)
0790740443|5.0|The soldiers depict, to a degree, what is required for a person to do the job, no matter what.  Russel is excellent.

0064407667|1.0|Nickelodeon, the movie company behind Rugrats and Jimmy Neutron, have announced their intention to make movies from the popular book series Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. (\\"Lemony Snicket\\" is actually the pen name for Daniel Handler, who's adapting the books for the screen.)<br />Nickelodeon's VP says the books are about \\"fanciful stories and kids in an empowered situation.\\" Did he say empowered or impoverished? Having read the series' first entry--Book the First: The Bad Beginning ...--I feel like the screamer in Munch's painting, wishing to loudly warn the general public against inflicting such a book upon your kids.<br />In smugly dark-humored style, the book tells of the Baudelaire trio of children: resourceful Violet, bookworm Klaus, and baby Sunny, who demonstrates her feelings by the depth of her toothy bite. One day while the children are enjoying themselves at the beach, a vague acquaintance of theirs named Mr. Poe walks up and gravely informs them that a freak fire has burned down their house and killed their parents. And with this funhouse-mirror version of \\"Once upon a time,\\" the three orphans' lives become a &lt;i>Candide&lt;/i>-like series of tortures.<br />They briefly live with Mr. Poe's family in his gloomy house before being shuffled off to the even gloomier Count Olaf, who is their only known relative. Count Olaf puts them to work all day long, strikes Klaus when the boy dares to defy him, hatches a plan to marry Violet and obtain the children's fortune, and locks Sunny in a cage dangling from the top of a high tower when Violet at first refuses to go along with the scheme.<br />I'm sure to be labeled an old fogey for not enjoying the supposed humor of this premise, but I just don't get the joke. Much of children's literature has initially dim outlooks, of course--just think of Harry Potter's selfish uncle and aunt, or Matilda's brutish father--but eventually the children find enough resources and inner strength to overcome their obstacles and give their young readers some hope. By contrast, the Baudelaire children are subjected to one life-threatening crisis after another, and the reader is expected to snidely chuckle at their problems because, after all, it's only a novel.<br />The only good thing about the book is that it repeatedly warns its readers that nothing happy will happen in this story. \\"Lemony Snicket's\\" disclaimer on the back covers states as much, and there are similar warnings throughout the book itself. (Talk about truth in advertising!) Once again, our old friend Irony is expected to distance us from these adventures enough to make us absorb them. But if no hope whatsoever is offered for these characters, why get engrossed in their story?<br />This book seems proof enough that four million people can be wrong. I can imagine punkish collegiates embracing the novel, but I'd feel like a Judas if I recommend it as choice reading for children. As far as I can see, the book's only virtue is that it might make you treat your own children a little more kindly--starting with never showing them this book.cles and give their young readers some hope.

I haven't even watched the DVD yet, but the extras...<BR>When the case says it includes &quot;theatrical trailers&quot; you expect at least one of them to be for Black Hawk Down.

6303402348|2.0|I guess I'm the only person in the World who didn't like this movie. I am a huge movie fan and generally like Tom Hanks as an actor, but this film just didn't resonate with me. The idea that an individual who is apparently borderline mentally retarded  can go on to become a war hero, great athlete, and all around success story seems quite far-fetched to me. Our world is becoming more competitive, not less. A person of his intelligence level would be unlikely to be successful in any one area, much less several. I'm sure this will sound insensitive to some, but it's true! I know this was meant to be a \\"feel-good\\" movie, but the storyline seemed trite and unbelievable, and the superimposition of the main character into scenes with famous people such as JFK seemed gimmicky.

B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch has thoroughly, repeatedly, and effortlessly confused us time and time again throughout the years.<br />He has occasionally stopped along to let us glimpse at the \\"normal\\" dementia of humanity(\\"The Elephant Man\\") and touching hope of the American Spirit(\\"The Straight Story\\")...<br />He's also turned on a dime, unfairly invading our minds, haunting our dreams, and perhaps given us something to think about besides our own drab, little world.<br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" stands to be one that will invade your mind and haunt your dreams. Have no delusions...everything you have heard about this film is TRUE. You won't be able to figure it out upon first viewing. The sexual relationship between Betty and Rita won't make sense. The Cowboy will be an enigma with no handles to grasp onto. Club Silencio will be a familiar place...you couldn't have seen it before, right?<br />It will shock you and frighten you. It will leave you breathless and frustrated. It will make you think about it long after it's done and then even longer than that.<br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" is well worth the 2+-hour running time. It's many different things about one thing: the attempt to live what we wished was true; the attempt to escape our lives, our guilt, and our vices through dreams. David Lynch covered this ground before in \\"Lost Highway\\", just not as obvious as this film. In \\"Lost Highway\\", we were given the story of a man trapped in a circular hell.<br />In \\"Drive\\", we are given the story of two girls attempting to solve a mystery, when in reality, they're trying to find themselves. Something is happening with them...something much bigger than they realize.<br />David Lynch weaves a tale of mystery, suspence, lust, and terror in a masterpiece that is both an anti-love-letter to Hollywood and an underrated epic of enigmatic film-making. Lynch's best film to date as well as one of the best films of 2001.<br />Powerful performances by Laura Harring and Naomi Watts as Rita and Betty and a wonderful comeback-cameo for Chad Everett as a sleazy old actor. A triumph of set and sound design also help make this film an instant noir-classic.<br />Silencio...<br />--Mattnderful comeback-cameo for Chad Everett as a sleazy old actor.

B00004W50Z|3.0|Don't be tricked by the title and the familiar cover design. This is not the entire original recording. Up on Cripple Creek, one of the best cuts on the original album, is missing from this one. What is there is the same old Band music, with its unique subject matter and funky beat, and is great for nostalgic listening, but I felt gypped when I found out my favorite cut was missing.
B000065U1N|5.0|It happened in 1993, just a few short years ago. The United States sent troops to Somalia on a humanitarian mission because the people were starving. But something went wrong.  There was bloodshed.  American troops were killed.  What happened?  What went wrong?  It was all very confusing.<br />This film, based on the book by journalist Mark Bowden is an account of the operation in which American soldiers were sent to the heart of the city of Mogadishu to capture two top officials of the ruling renegade warlord who were preventing fair food distribution.  It was supposed to take a mere half hour.  Instead it turned into a nightmare as one of their special helicopters, referred to as a \\"Black Hawk\\" was shot down.<br />Within minutes the audience is plunged into that nightmare and the tension keeps up for almost the entire film.  Director Ridley Scott does a masterful job; I felt I was right there with the men, dodging bullets and caring for the wounded as a hostile mob of fully armed Somalians kept attacking.  There were no name stars among the actors and, with one exception, they were all white young men in uniforms, and so it was easy to get them confused, especially since there was little, if any, back story.  It was the battle itself that was the star of this film.  The violence was strong and unrelenting, and there was no time for either the men or the audience to catch a breath before the next horrible thing happened.  Special effects were awesome as the moment-by-moment action just kept going on and on.<br />There might have been no one central character to identify with, but that was not this film's intent.  It forced me instead, to identify with it all. And it certainly made me think about how a battle like this can take place in a distant part of the world without more than a few news blips here at home about what was really going on.<br />One of the strengths of the film is that it doesn't preach.  Both patriots and anti-war activists and the many people whose sentiments lie between these two positions can find something to relate to.  It just tells the story about what happened that day. And that story is strong enough to stand by itself with no apologies.hose sentiments lie between these two positions can find something to relate to.

B000068CNX|5.0|With 8 great seasons in the can with the 9th (and possibly final) season on the way, it's hard to disagree that \\"Friends\\" was, and is one of the most innovative shows to grace prime time television.<br />With the stellar ensemble cast we've all come to know and love (consisting of Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc), not to mention excellent storylines brought to us by the show's very talented writers, it's clear why this show remains the top prime time sitcom to date.<br />This set will feature all 24 episodes from the second season.  All uncut and commercial free.  Like the first, each episode will feature additional \\"never-before-seen\\" footage.<br />Season one was indeed jam-packed with special features and this set will indeed be no exception.  With interesting tidbits and trivia about the show, not to mention optional commentary, it really is hard to complain.  In my opinion, the episodes themselves make this set a value in itself.<br />I have compiled a list of all the episodes you will see in this season 2 set (in chronological order).<br />1.  THE ONE WITH ROSS' NEW GIRLFRIEND<BR>2.  THE ONE WITH THE BREAST MILK<BR>3.  THE ONE WHERE MR. HECKLES DIES<BR>4.  THE ONE WITH THE FIVE STEAKS AND AN EGGPLANT<BR>5.

Anyhow, if you enjoyed the first season DVD set, there is no doubt in my mind that you'll love this as well.  And for those of you who are unfamiliar with the older episodes (as I once was), then grab these sets and prepare to laugh.
B000063DS1|5.0|Simply the greatest concert film and soundtrack ever....improved.  The additional tracks are great, and if you're a big fan of The Band, you should get the new edition.  A landmark in music.
B000065U1N|4.0|A great film from ridley. It's not blade runner, but what is? The non-stop action is well done and the atmosphere of the film is excellent. I liked the segments that showed the war from the somali point of view although its couldnt hurt if there were a few more. If anything, this film is very one sided. We should not have been there and yes...the operation was a total waste and a complete defeat for our boys on the ground...sad of course but the truth hurts as they say.
B00004ZESV|3.0|FIve years ago I would not have complained a bit about the sound and picture quality of this show but now with the standards being so high for everything, this appears poor in comparison.<br />Yes, the sound is mono and the picture is blurred and grainy, but no more that a VHS release. It still looks good and sounds OK. The band is really swinging and having a lot of fun up there on the stage.<br />I have a VHS copy of a UK performance which was made 20 years ago and is almost as good as this DVD release, but which company will pay the money to get it cleaned up and re-released? <br />My major problem with this DVD is the lack of extras. You get a (static) menu, a photo gallery (4 pictures from the show - isn't that what pause is for?) and a discography. <br />But all that said, for a budged DVD, it'll have the joint jumpin' and is well worth adding to your collection.

6304806426|1.0|The one star is for Juliette Binoche and the cinematography, but if desert scenery is what turns you on, don't waste your time with this when you could be watching \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" - a passionately-involving movie about people you care about. In other words, the opposite of this. There are many critically-acclaimed movies that leave me indifferent, but few where I actually loathe the principals. Wartime adultery can be made sympathetic; where, for example, one spouse is presumed dead (as in \\"Casablanca\\"). Here, however, it's impossible to feel sympathy for a woman willing to betray an amazingly decent husband for the pure thrill of the moment. Lack of sympathy becomes nausea in a certain scene where the husband is mere yards away the frantic sexual activity. If there are viewers who found this \\"romantic,\\" I despair for their morals. And on top of all this, the movie is just plain dull, with the only true heart coming from the sub-plot with Juliette Binoche and her lover. The only saving grace is that the memory of even seeing this thing fades with time....
0345446798|5.0|Owning an embarrassing number of dog training/behavior books and having kept Border Collies for a long time, I feel qualified to say that if you only bought one book on canine behavior, this would be it. Dr. McConnell provides a clear and lucid explanation of why dogs behave and respond as they do -- all the while being careful to make note of the ambiguities and idiosyncratic nature of both canine and human behavior. There are no 'magic formulas' here. But there are many guidelines and explanations of why some things tend to work, while others tend not to. The strength of this book is that it provides an understanding of why dogs respond, allowing the reader to refine his/her behaviors to better communicate with dogs. This focus on human behavior and how dogs interpret it provides unusual insight into effective interaction and training. Extensive experience and academic preparation in animal behavior and communication have provided McConnell with an exceptional understanding of how much of what we do in interacting with dogs is actually counter-productive because dogs see the world quite differently than primates do. Changing some of my behaviors after reading this book, I could almost see my three Border Collies thinking, &quot;Well, about time you figured that out.&quot;
B00005YU1O|2.0|From Skepticism to Determinism...For anyone who wants to take a two hour crash course on philosophy... knock yourself out.  I will say that the visual work and music in this movie were excellent;however, the constant philosophical conversation shoved down my throat was enough to make me want to throw it back up.
B000001DTM|5.0|Everyone always talks about the amazing musical transition U2 took in making this album.  Of course that's true, but for me, the most striking development is in Bono's lyrics.  Throughout the eighties output, Bono's lyrics were sometimes inspired, sometimes sloppy and sometimes verging on the pretentious.  On this album real heart, hurt and humanity shines through in the lyrics.  One is the big song of course, but the song that follows it on the album highlights the point I'm rather poorly trying to put across.  Until the End of the World is a blistering song, and seems to be written about the betrayal of Jesus by Judas (hey, you can interpret the song anyway you want).  Bono sings cockily &quot;I took the money, I spiked your drink, You miss too much these days if you stop to think&quot; and &quot;In the garden I was playing the tart, I kissed your lips and broke your heart.  You, you were acting like it was the end of the world.&quot;  A soaring solo follows after which Bono cries out in despairing guilt: &quot;Waves of regret, waves of joy, I reached out for the one I tried to destroy.  You, you said you'd wait until the end of the world.&quot;  Such a progression so easily, and simply conveyed is unusual for most of the world's so called best lyricists such as Bob Dylan, yet Bono does it time and time again on Achtung Baby. As the world collapses at the end of The Fly, Bono gasps &quot;It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky, The universe exploding because of one man's lie.  Look I gotta go, yeah I'm running out of change.  There's a lot of things, If I could I'd rearrange.&quot;  You can just picture the little scamp running away in his wrap-around shades, leaving the telephone hanging.<BR>Elsewhere the band experiment with funk, and a rock-dance hybrid that they later developed on Pop, with Even Better Than the Real Thing (wonder where Noel Gallagher got the riff for the Hindu Times?), and Mysterious Ways.  But it's the ballads that will stay with you.  One, So Cruel (which is a painful analysis of divorce), and the losing pair - Acrobat and Love is Blindness.  The lyrics and music beautifully complement each other, in an ending probably only rivalled by Street Spirit on the Bends by Radiohead, for sheer beauty and utter desolation.  In fact Radiohead are the only band who have come close to catching the essentials of love and loss since that I have heard.  The fact that this was U2 mark 2 and a half, makes this album even more astonishing and rewarding.  It saddens, it consoles, it uplifts.  What more do you want?
1878574590|5.0|With the Force as my guide, I picked up this book.  And damn!  I'm extremely impressed!<BR>I've heard a lot of people rave about Frank Miller, and this was the first of his works I've been exposed to.  The story revolves around a guy named Marv that we can all somehow relate with.  His goal is to avenge the death of a woman, the only woman who gave a guy like him a night to remember.  This story is dark.  It's not something I expected, violent and showing the dark side of humanity, but damn if it isn't great!  If you have any doubts about Sin City, extinguish them now, and buy this book!<BR>And for the record, the black and white noir art is amazing!!!

6305531374|5.0|I am a big fan of the Halloween film series.  I thought that the series had run it's course with the Jamie Lloyd storyline and all,  but when they brought back Laurie Strode in H20, it was like a breath of fresh air.  Laure is back and fed up with hiding and running from her maniac brother.  This movie is not about blood and gore.  It has suspense and a great story line.  Michael Myers is so cool in this movie.  I really liked how they brought back the nurse Mary Wittingham.  That was a nice touch.  I also liked the homage paid to Phsyco with Janet Leigh.  The movie was solid and exciting,  I could watch it every week!  If Halloween 8 is as well put together as this one,  we are in for a great ride!
B00005RY7X|3.0|OK, \\"Party Hard\\" rocks better than anything else out there today. Very fresh, very fantastic. But... All the rest of the songs sound like pale imitations of the album's one true gem. \\"I Get Wet\\" is worth the cheap price anyway -- for the bloody artwork and the pleasure of supporting the Prince of Party --  but don't expect a disc crammed with amazing songs.

But what I really didn't swallow was that Richard Gere (IRA) can always guess &amp; predict what Bruce Willis (spy) is going to do next!<br />I mean come on, an IRA knows, predicts and does everything as if he can read Bruce's mind! This was stupid hole in the movie that I couldn't swallow or accept... so the movie gets down rated!<br />Yes, great actors names but awful movie!

6304288433|5.0|Halloween 2 is really the extension of Halloween.  I remember the first time I saw it in the theater.  It was Halloween night in 81, and the theater was packed.  There were people standing around the walls and every chair was full.  Every time something scary happened, the place would go wild.  That really added something scary to the movie.  Jamie Lee was wonderful in this one and Donald Plesance was great as usual.  Michael was scary stalking the hospital corridors.  I loved the soundtrack, and how they made the original even more scary in the opening scene by slowing down the music.  The parts they could have done without was the hot tub scene.  No nurse is gonna do something so stupid as that.  I am however so glad that Myers killed Bud.  He was such a dweeb.  My favorite part was the chase scene between Laurie and Michael.  She runs as if in a nightmare, and he walks his methodical walk.  The ending was great and I was thrilled to see him come back for more in Halloween 4,  but I liked Halloween 7  H2o much more and consider it a sequel to this trilogy.
1559409010|5.0|No Monty Python Fan is to be without Life of Brian. Arguably the funniest comedy of all time. Personally I think it beats &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; any day. There are classic moments in this film like when Brain goes to graffiti the Roman's palace and ends up receiving latin lessons. If you liked &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, you're sure to like this film... only you're guaranteed it doesn't end as abruptly! For those of you who have already seen Life of Brian, the deleted scenes are a real treat. You won't ever regret buying this DVD. &quot;He's not the Messiah, He's a very naughty boy!&quot;
0451457994|4.0|&quot;2001&quot; is a wonderful novel about an Earth that is very involved in the solar system and studies it like today's world studies the human body. The book starts off with a prologue type of part that tells how human relatives that lived in the Ice Age found a rock that had to come from extraterrestrial life. From these opening chapters you are drawn into a fascinating science fiction tale.<br /> On Earth's moon, an object that is being dubbed the TMA-I has been found and it is being concealed from the moon's public and Earth's as well. We are then taken to an odyssey, &quot;the&quot; odyssey which the title refers to, as a matter of fact, that is being led by a computer named Hal. When the book starts you don't really know what this odyssey is about, unless you are critical and pick up very apparent things that take place at the beginning of the novel. All that you know is that the ship called the &quot;Discovery&quot; is going to the planet Saturn. This is the premise for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;<br /> This book is very fast paced and this fact makes for an added plus towards your enjoyment of the novel. Arthur C. Clarke is a pretty good author that knows how to weave an intriguing science fiction tale. Clarke thankfully gets into some scientific facts and this is a bonus for readers that have an interest in science, mainly astronomy. <br /> My major qualm with this book is what took place towards the end. I got bored with the novel and couldn't care less for what was going to happen when I was bogged in Clarke's philosophical commentaries. I'm normally not bothered by an author doing this but Clarke just wrote about his feelings so much that hardly related to the plot that I was just plain bored. I'm sure that not all readers will feel the same about Clarke's commentaries as I did, but these are just my feelings. I also think that Clarke's commentaries also got me so bogged down that I couldn't really enjoy the ending, which was very interesting in itself.<br /> &quot;2001&quot; was monumental in the science fiction genre when it first came out and it is ranked as one of the genre's classics today. This is a must read for a fan of science fiction but beware that this book does get boring when Clarke gets into philosophy and what not. This book will most likely be enjoyed and will be worthy of a re-read some time around.<br />Happy Reading!
B00005A1PR|5.0|It's unfortunate that such talent as Ms. Arie's is overlooked in favor of music (and dare I say, looks) that are more mainstream.  \\"Acoustic Soul\\" is one of the best albums of the past 5 years, bar none.  Even the \\"hits\\" which may have suffered excessive airplay are still fresh sounding, and will remain so for years to come.<br />From start to finish, every song is mighty -- from the ultra-soulful \\"Brown Skin\\" (one of the best songs of all time) to the ultra-smooth Stevie tribute \\"Wonderful.\\"  Never does India allow her vocals to overpower a song, although they convey strength; instead, they always suit it perfectly.  The instruments and her voice are always in perfect balance, and the strength of her lyrics easily match Lauryn Hill's.  The production values of this album are also quite high, as you can hear every note:  a testament to the care and thought that was put into this recording.<br />So many times on Amazon you see 5 stars passed out SO often, you wonder:  \\"Can EVERYTHING be that good?\\"  Frankly, no it can't.  But trust me on this one:  Ms. Arie is as good as it gets for neo-soul that comes straight from the heart.

B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm a teenager and have a lot of friends with different music tastes, but Mayer's music seems to appeal to every one of my friends...the teenybopper, the reggae fan, and of course me the &quot;dave matthews&quot; girl. We can relate to the tracks, sing along, and play it at parties. Its fantastic. One of the songs was nominated to be our homecoming theme...its just a good mix of songs and i would reccommend it to anyone. My favorite is &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;. I only give it 4 stars because it not flawless...some tracks are a bit strange [&quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot;], but overall i'm loving this.
B00004Z400|3.0|Contrary to most of the reviews I've read, \\"White Pony,\\" in my opinion, is not the best Deftones CD.  The first Deftones CD I bought was \\"Around the Fur\\" and it simply blew me away.  It still ranks in my top 5 CDs of all time.  After buying \\"Around the Fur,\\" I knew I had to get another Deftones CD, so I picked \\"White Pony\\" because I had read reviews online claiming it to be a \\"classic\\" or \\"masterpiece.\\" To me, it sounds almost nothing like \\"Around the Fur,\\" in which practically every song Chino screams (which I like).  On \\"White Pony\\" however, most of the songs feature no screaming and are not that heavy.  And when Chino does scream on \\"Elite,\\" it sounds kind of digitalized and crappy.  I was also hoping for more of a hip hop influence on this album considering the Deftones now have a full-time DJ as a member, but there is little to be heard.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad CD, but it is not the best of the Deftones.  Standout tracks include Back to School (Mini Maggot), Korea, Street Carp, Elite, and Change (In the House of Flies).

0451205146|4.0|Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, by Mark Bowden, is an in-the-streets account of the now infamous seventh mission of Task Force Ranger and Delta Force in Mogadishu, Somalia. Militarily, the mission was a success; politically, it was a disaster.<br />Black Hawk Down was recently released as a major motion picture. I haven't (yet) seen the film, but even to those who have I strongly suggest reading this book. In addition to being made as a movie, an even earlier version of this book appeared as a series of articles in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Additionally, there is a \\"companion documentary\\" (Somalia: Good Intentions, Deadly Results), a shorter version of which has appeared on CNN. Of course, the most famous media related to this story is the news footage of the dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets by angry mobs; second to that would be the image of Black Hawk pilot Mike Durant's smashed face in the video made of him by his captors. Both of these are around; if you really need a reminder, try Google.<br />In the 1990's, the United States found itself in three separate conflicts in (at least partially) Muslim lands. The Gulf War was a conventional military venture, the UN missions in the former Yugoslavia represented a basic-albeit convoluted-peace-keeping venture. The nation-building force in Somalia after the initial famine-busting mission heavily involved special operations. The first sent ripples among the military theorists of nations across the world; the second involved the civilizationally odd American preference to support the Muslim community over that of Orthodox and Western forces; the third was seen as a victory of sorts by Third Worlders and Islamists who drew from it the lesson that America could be shocked into backing out of a conflict. Understanding each of these conflicts-militarily, politically, and culturally-is important to understanding this greater conflict we are now in. Black Hawk Down does much to shed light on the personal and tactical elements in the Somlian campaign's bloodiest battle.<br />While Mark Bowden is a journalist and is quite clear about saying he has no background or experience in combat tactics, covert operations, military strategy, etc., this book is very illuminating. Since the book's publication, Bowden has been invited to address the Military Operations Research Society, the U.S. Military Academy (West Point) the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (Ft. Leavenworth), and the Central Intelligence Agency. The book been personally recommended by the U.S. Marine Corps commandant and is part of the mandatory reading curriculum at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.<br />So how did this journalist write something that garnered so much respect among military professionals? Quite simply, he tells the soldiers' tales and he tells them straight. The political backdrop, the larger strategic military picture, the command decisions made outside of Mog-these he treats lightly and only as much as needed to provide context for the first-hand accounts of the Americans and Somalis that were actually there. This is a street-level, blow-by-blow narrative of some of the most intense combat American forces have faced since the Vietnam War, and nearly every word of it is drawn either from interviews with combatants, from transcripts of radio traffic, or from video footage shot by U.S. military personnel.<br />I read this book over Memorial Day weekend this year. It was extremely appropriate. Overall I really enjoyed this book and feel I've learned quite a bit from the experience. I had already read a shorter account of overlapping events-from the CIA perspective-written by Vernon Loeb for the Washington Post, titled \\"After Action Report\\", but this book fills in details that the other perspective lacked. (At the same time, I strongly recommend you read \\"After Action Report\\" as well.) I've heard criticisms of the film that said it was often hard to tell one character from another; I could say the same for the book. At the same time, the sense of confusion that sometimes creeps into the narrative is, in fact, a natural consequence of the fact that this is combat, as experienced by modern soldiers. By the time you complete the book, you'll have enough information to get a remarkably complete picture of the \\"Battle of the Black Sea\\"; while in the midst of it, though, you may well find yourself flipping back through the book to remind yourself which unit and which part of the city you are currently reading about.<br />All in all, this is a book well worth reading, and have added it to my Warblogger's Bookshelf. It is an insight into the terrible human experience of modern warfare, set within a significant series of events whose importance were not fully understood in their own time. If it were fiction, I'd say it was a brilliant, thrilling \\"page turner\\"; it, however, is not. It is the story of a handful of American soldiers who really lived and (some of them) died, often in stunningly heroic ways. To understand a part of what emboldened enemies such as Al Qaeda, to learn what modern unconventional combat can be like, to renew your faith in the courage and skill of the folks in America's armed forces, read this book.aracter from another; I could say the same for the book.

B0000640SA|5.0|Okay, first:  I read a review where the person asked:    \\"But if Leonard can't remember anything after the incident, why does he know his illness?\\"     Leonard can recall everything up to the accident.  One of his tatoos says, \\"Remember Sammy Jenkis.\\"  Jenkis had the same affliction and Leonard knew him before the accident.    I love this movie because it asks a valid question:    Upon what do you rely to create your reality?    Memories are faulty.      Leonard's memory problem is acute, but studies show that everyone's memory is faulty.  Of the people who are let out of jail when physical evidence turns up to clear them, most were convicted on eye witness testimony.  Eye witness testimony has been shown to be among the least reliable evidence.    The written word calls for interpretation.    Leonard writes things down and even tattoos them on his body.  But, the things he writes down are sometimes helpful, sometimes not, and sometimes call for interpretation and judgment.  After the murder, Leonard finds a note in his pocket that was intended for someone else, which leads him to a bar where strange things happen.    How many debates have raged over interpretations of the Bible?    Emotions cloud your reality.      Leonard gets angry at Tedy and decides to set him up.    We knowingly lie to ourselves.      Leonard writes down false information to get back at Tedy, knowingly lying to himself because it feels good.  Knowing that he won't recall the lie later.    Can't trust what people say.      Tedy is a suspicious character, but he gives Leonard some information that is verifiably true.  Does that mean everything he says is true?  How to tell?      We are open to suggestion.      Leonard's memories change when Tedy challenges him.  Which version is right?  Tedy's, or his own?  Does it mean anything that the power of Tedy's suggestion momentarily causes Leonard to doubt his own version of events that he does remember because they took place before the accident?    Emotions cause us to be used.      Leonard wants revenge, which sets him up to be used by Tedy.  Revenge is also unsatisfying.  The one thing Leonard should forget, he can't.  Impure motivation clouds his judgement and causes him to be a pawn in someone else's game.    Remember Sammy Jenkis.    Sammy -- and Leonard's -- \\"condition\\" is the human condition.    The fact is -- we all go through what Leonard is going through, but we can see it more clearly when confronted with a character that is going through an extreme illustration of it.    We are all groping through life using unreliable methods to create reality moment by moment.      Just an aside, but I loved the fact that the hotel clerk rents Leonard two rooms.  Usually that's the kind of detail where you walk out of the film and ask, \\"why didn't the hotel clerk try to rip him off?\\"    Great story and great attention to detail.    See this film.    Rob
0316926345|5.0|Brideshead Revisited is an eloquently written book, visiting themes such as religion, beauty and the `languor of youth'.<br />I've read it three times over and it never fails to capture my imagination about the splendours of the recent past, aristocratic life and picturesque settings. <br />Its theme is memory infused with the venomous-pleasures of love and beauty. It narrates a succession of relationships nourished by charm and an eternal search for one's being. It's a tale about illusions, despair, hope, faith, expectations and finally about the voyage in life... a voyage often dotted by encounters with beautiful people.
B00003CX5A|5.0|This is a great movie.  Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, has such a mix of emotions, which Johnny Depp plays wonderfully.  He is scared and smart and sad and even funny.  He tries to be brave and act like he knows what is going on, but he just can't.  I think this is the funniest part of the movie.  There are no actual jokes, but the way Depp acts and delivers his lines does add some comedy to the movie.  The way Tim Burton made this movie is amazing.  The colors, the atmosphere, and the set are perfect for the story.  And the music that Danny Elfman wrote compliments the images and mood perfectly.  See this movie!
B00004TBWR|5.0|By this time(1969-70), Creedence Clearwater Revival, under the leadership of John Fogerty was nigh on unbeatable in the singles charts(and their albums were pretty darn good,too). WILLY AND THE POORBOYS is an album based around the concept of a street corner band led by Willy (John Fogerty?). Tom Fogerty, Stu Cook and Doug 'Cosmo' Clifford, naturally, portray the Poor Boys. <br />DOWN ON THE CORNER - An introduction to Willy And the Poorboys. Down home funkiness by a band that strangely had never been down south.Great harmonies on the chorus.<br />IT CAME OUT OF THE SKY - A humorus rocker of a something falling out of the sky,landing on a good'ol boy's farm and the American public's knee jerk reactions to it. Love the line, \\"And Ronnie the popular said it was a Communist plot\\"! <br />COTTON FIELDS - Country rock version of the Leadbelly folk standard. This version walks all over the Beach Boys' attempt at it around the same time.<br />POORBOY SHUFFLE - Willy and crew having a washboard jam session.Makes you think it is a real band on the corner playing for pennies and dimes. <br />FEELIN' BLUE - Rock blues number with a swampy kick. Bass is low and muttering, courtesy of Stu Cook. <br />FORTUNATE SON - Raging anti war stormer about how the wealthy seemed to be contributing less to the Vietnam war effort than the poor, in men and money. You can feel the scorn and fury directed at the 'fat cats'in Fogerty's voice. Still packs a punch over thirty years later.<br />DON'T LOOK NOW - Pure country ditty basically stating, \\"If you want something done,do it yourself; 'cause no one else is gonna do it\\".<br />THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL - Another Leadbelly tune that Fogerty makes all his own. This is down south folk rock with a swamp rock twist and the harmonies are spellbinding.Good to sing along to.<br />SIDE O' THE ROAD - Blues shuffle jam session that shows the band's chops off to great effect.<br />EFFIGY - This could be about the Vietnam war and the power of the protest movement: \\"Silent majority weren't keepin' quiet anymore!\\" Whatever the case,this is a powerful way to end a powerful album. A must for your collection!
B00005N9CV|5.0|One of the great torch singers of our time has done it again with this great album. How to go one better than before? Why add the London Symphony Orchestra and Los Angeles Session Orchestra.<BR>Take a listen as the London Symphony replays the intro of 'Love Letters' at the end making it an awesome listen. My favourite is 'Cry Me A River' (thanks NK) but the whole album is a gem. Even with the Symphony orchestras, you can picture her in a lounge setting singing just to you. Oh well- Dream on.
B00005Y7LD|5.0|I love this CD!

A message to all Billy Idol fans that don't have this recording - buy it today!
B000000W6R|5.0|First of all this album holds so much pure emotion in it. The songs are amazing, really it's hard to believe they are b-sides. In my opinion its one of the best albums of all time. It's the kind of album you listen to late at night under the stars, or early in the morning when your mind is open and searching. This album grows on you at first it seems kind of bland, til you listen to the words and are in the right atmosphere to take it all in. And i have to say the version of 'landslide' on this is much better than the original, why because it has the right emotion to it, something the original lacks, it's not over sang but sang with a true feeling to it. This album is for solitude and pondering.<br />These are b-sides which in this case means that they are as good as album quality, yet more honest and straight forward. This Album has the earlier pumpkins sound to it, which depending on what you like is or isn't a good thing, but if you like siamese dream you'll like this. <br />The first song other than landslide to hit me was\\"plume\\" A slower listless song that has a great feel to it. Probalbly one of the best on the album. the chorus defines the texture of the song \\" my boredome has outshined the sun, just want to have me some little fun\\". <br />This album isn't adrenaline laced, but yet it has more of a dream like feel to it. Like the songs \\"whir\\" and \\"obscured\\" these two songs have this sort of vintage feel to them, like personal reflection on the last few years of your life. They are both softer songs in perfect example of billy corgan's song writing excellence. Then you come to james iha's \\"blew Away\\" Which is amazing, i personally think it should have been on an album. Then you have such heavier songs as \\"pissant\\" and the passive aggressive \\"hello kitty kat\\" Both great and not to heavy but still louder and nifty to listen to. They have this killer physcadelic feel. Nex t i'd like to talk about the last track \\"Spaced\\" people will say it's weird, but i personally feel that's not what billy corgan was trying to present, more so it's a very personal song, which also has a great theme. It's a very inspiring<BR>song. <br />anyways i'm not sure if this review helped anyone, but just let me say this you won't regret buying this album. It's worth every minute of your valuable time
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This is a wonderful movie from my all time favorite director.  The story is very interesting, but above all, just &quot;look&quot; at this move: every scene belongs on a picture hanging from your wall, is so beautifully and masterfully composed.  The balance, the colors, the shades, the light.  Even without a story, just for the plastic and aesthetic value of each scene, is worth viewing, savoring and admiring.

The only reason I gave both 5 stars is because \\"SPIDER-MAN\\" is good film not because it's missing things, but because there are things that could have been added to make a great film. Do you see where I'm going with this?<br />Anyways, \\"SPIDER-MAN\\" is about Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), he's pretty much the school nerd, he's also an orphan who lives with his aunt and Uncle Ben. One day, he goes on a field trip with a group of other highschool kids to a spider exibit. amongst the group of kids is the most popular and beautiful girl he has met(Kirsten Dunst). She points out that one of the super genetic spiders is missing, but no one is listening as the group progresses. It's that same time, that Peter gathers the nerve to talk to the girl(It's been a month and half, I hardly remember thier names, so bear with me).<BR>\\"For the school paper?\\" Peter asks, holding up a camera.<BR>\\"Sure,\\" she responds. As he takes the pictures, the missing spider spirals down on his hand and bites down, inserting its super genetic powers into his DNA.<BR>After a day or so Peter begins to explore these powers. He knows he could use them on criminals, but at first he chooses not to. Then suddenly, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed and Peter devotes his life to stopping crime as, Spider-Man, but he is taken the wrong way and is thought to be a criminal.<BR>Throughout the movie Peter budgets his time as himself and Spider-Man. Soon, the girl forms a relationship with BOTH Spider-Man AND Peter. Also, around the same time, Spider-Man meets his rival, Green Goblin, who really is the father of Peter's best friend. But he doesn't know.<BR>Soon it becomes a deadly game of sabotage and The Green Goblin tempts him to fight by putting his aunt in the hospital and taking hostages. Spider-Man only figures out who The Green Goblin is until the last fight.<br />So, overall, \\"SPIDER-MAN\\" is a good movie at thefullest, but not a great movie. The only other way to explain this is that \\"SPIDER-MAN\\" is a blockbuster, not an Academy Award-Winner.
B000066AXC|5.0|My high rating is based on the superior quality of acting, of course, but also on what I (a layman) view as an exceptionally effective dramatic visual presentation of schizophrenic paranoia. Characters which interact with Nash throughout the film accomplish for me what an expert's clinical (albeit patient) explanation never could. Given the number of people afflicted with this disease, especially those among them not as yet correctly diagnosed, much less properly treated, this film will serve commendable humanitarian purposes while at the same time providing superior entertainment. Ron Howard and all of his associates are to be commended for their unique and compelling cinematic achievement.
B000002KIE|5.0|Forget \\"Punk\\" or any other defining label people have slapped on Bollocks/The Pistols over the past 24 years.<br />Released in 1977, this great album was a return to real rock 'n roll as it hadn't been heard in ages. Although the Pistols were sired by The New York Dolls and Iggy's Stooges, their DNA is all Eddie Cochran, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. Third generation good old rock 'n roll, baby. <br />What gets lost in the whole \\"punk\\" label thing is much of what makes the Pistols and their songs so timeless: a great sense of humor (unlike the Clash); hooks galore (these three minute gems are the equal of any great Supremes' single); an instantly identifiable singer (love or hate his voice, Rotten's untrained sneer is what really takes this beyond pop n' roll); they have no shame .....and they make no attempt to save the world. <br />What more can you ask for from any great Rock 'n roll band...except maybe a little sex. <br />This is an album for the ages. Check it out.
B000059HAI|4.0|The 2001 blockbuster \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was more about Hollywood than history, a passionate love-triangle forming an important part of the story-line.  The 1970 flick \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" offers a rather different story of the same event, one devoid of soap opera, romance, blood and gore, but one that is far more true to history.  The account of traditional historians is followed, rather than that of revisionists who claim that President Roosevelt had prior knowledge of the attack but knowingly sacrificed his Pacific fleet as an excuse to enter the war. All the incidents and details are apparently historically documented from ship logs and other records, and the focus on a historically accurate movie is evident from the opening statement which affirms that all events and characters are true to historical fact. Certainly the movie breathes authenticity in every respect.  Remarkably, it presents both sides of the Pearl Harbor tragedy of December 7, 1941: American and Japanese.  To accomplish this, there was a collaboration of two production teams involving American and Japanese film-makers.  And the results are convincing: unlike Hollywood's 2001 \\"Pearl Harbor\\", the Japanese side is presented accurately and fairly, with even the dialogue in Japanese (with English sub-titles) - the title itself referring to a Japanese word for \\"attack!\\"  If there is any bias, it is present in minimizing Japanese aggression, but most would agree that it the movie gives a fairly accurate picture.  The end result is a documentary-like movie, with the convincing aura of historical fact.<br />The story of course revolves around the events of the Japanese attack on the US naval fleet in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which led to the United States declaring war on Japan in the Second World War.  The attack featured tactical brilliance and surprise, and was a great success.  In less than two hours, Japanese planes armed with torpedoes sunk or seriously damaged 18 warships, destroyed 188 aircraft and damaged another 159, killed 2,403 and wounded 1,178 American military personnel. Fortunately for the Americans, their aircraft carriers escaped damage only because they were not in Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack.  Japanese losses comprised only 29 planes and pilots, five midget submarines and one large sub with their crews.<br />The largest part of the movie focuses around the politics and preparation for the attack, and consists mainly of dialogue.  Numerous historical personages play a role, and viewers are given some insight into Japanese-American relations before the attack.  Of particular interest are several scenes featuring Japanese ambassadors and politicians, showing that even amongst the Japanese there were different attitudes towards US-relations.  Alongside hard-liners who advocated aggression, there were also pacifists who truly wanted to strive for a peaceful resolution.  The suspense gradually builds as the foundations are laid for a surprise attack, and as the US ignores the warning signs of impending danger.  The final part of the movie features an extensive and convincing reenactment of the attack itself.  The movie's G rating is somewhat deceiving - while there is no real blood and gore as such (although there are a few rare instances of blasphemy/profanity), viewers are treated to multitudes of spectacular explosions.  There are also some delightful scenes of a dramatic aerial dog fight.  All in all it's a breath-taking and fitting climax, and even by today's standards features pretty impressive cinematography and action.  The exaggerated emotion of Hollywood is absent, but in many ways this enhances the historical record rather than blurs it with sensationalism.<br />The fact that events are presented more clinically and coldly means of course that Tora! Tora! Tora! lacks the human element that is present in films like 2001's Pearl Harbor, and there is no real sense of what it was like from the perspective of the soldiers.  But bysparing viewers of sensationalized stories of individuals, we get a more overall picture with a real sense of what it was like from the perspective of the military leaders.  It is not so much the story of personal successes and failures, but the failure of the United States military as a whole.  In the process, numerous surprising facts are revealed for those not very familiar with the historical events of the Pearl Harbor tragedy.  Three such facts struck me: Firstly, the fact that the success of the Japanese was due in part to a comedy of errors by US intelligence in failing to properly anticipate the oncoming attack, and that the US navy was unprepared and defenseless largely through its own fault.  Secondly, the fact that the Japanese showed restraint by deciding not to launch as many waves of attack as initially planned. Thirdly, the fact that rather than revel in victory, the Japanese commander-in-chief was most displeased that the carefully planned timing went wrong (Washington received the planned ultimatum an hour after the attack rather than half an hour beforehand), because he realized that it would just infuriate the United States all the more: &quot;I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;<br />If you want be wowed by Hollywood's fancy special effects, horrified by Hollywood's blood and gore, and cry over Hollywood's romantic soap opera, go watch 2001's \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  But for those who want a tribute to history's real story, you need look no further than 1970's \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"  If there are weaknesses, it might be that the acting is not always convincing, and that this is a story that is so objective and filtered of bias that it lacks the human element.  But soap opera doesn't have to be present to make an movie enthralling - the suspense and the chronicle of real events is enthralling in itself, and the final action scenes of the air attack are remarkably real and heart-stopping.  And all the more powerful because they reflect history.  For most of us, history is to be preferred over Hollywood any day.sparing viewers of sensationalized stories of individuals, we get a more overall picture with a real sense of what it was like from the perspective of the military leaders.

2895170711|5.0|In this recording the stars shine, & you can hear a thousand bells jingling with the laughter of innocence & love. This isn't the complete text of St. Ex's masterpiece, yet it's so good that it adds to the understanding and to the joy of hearing old friends for the first time. Gere's voice is perfect. I could hear the voice of St. Ex, his imagined voice, the voice of his soul given life by his words. St. Ex's words created a wonderful story NOT for grownups but certainly not just for children, either. <br />    The little prince encounters the major vices & illogic of a grownup-structured system. These representative grownups include the power hungry King happily giving orders; the businessman who grossly consumes the heavens: But, why? To get more. What do you do with more? Use it to get more of more. The little prince would say: grownups are very mysterious. <br />    The fox is unique in knowledge about friendship. He's an outsider hunted by men. His persecution develops deep perceptions into the heart of life and relationships. This recording is a perfect stress buster for living in a world with grownups. Don the earphones, listen to the gentle, intelligent voice of St. Ex and hear what is truly essential.
0792839730|5.0|The generation that lived through the Second World War is fast disappearing, and with it the memories of events.  Based on the book by Cornelius Ryan, A Bridge Too Far is a fine movie that captures one of the assaults of the Allies on the Germans towards the end of the war.  Operation Market-Garden, the brain-child of Field-Marshall Montgomery, was a failed assault, and that was probably one of the reasons why this movie was a failure at the box office - the masses prefer stories about success.  But as a preservation of what really happened, this movie is a wonderful success.  It accurately presents the true story about the failed Allied Offensive with authenticity and realism, unencumbered by soap opera romances which dominate most contemporary war movies (Pearl Harbor comes to mind), nor overly dwelling on the blood and gore (Saving Private Ryan comes to mind).  The lengthy battle scenes are realistic, but the fighting and blood has all the hall-marks of reality, rather than the graphic horror and gratuitous gore that marks most contemporary war movies.  This is not a movie about soap opera, or horror but about reality.  Little wonder that it is generally agreed that the story-line is historically accurate without being significantly coloured by bias, and that many reviewers regard it as the best war movie ever made.<br />The dynamics of Operation Market-Garden are somewhat complex, and those who havent yet seen the movie would do well to consider doing some research about the strategy involved, because it requires complete attention to keep up with the complexity of the plot.  Unlike many modern movies, the focus is not on personal tragedy, trial or triumph - although this is not entirely absent. There are moments of personal tragedy and triumph, revolving around the interaction between generals, and between generals and their men.  Featuring a star studded cast including Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford and many more, the acting is superb and convincing.  But the focus is not on individual stories as it is on the grand picture, especially on the overall strategic plan and large-scale operations.  In short, with an Allied victory almost certain, Field-Marshall Montgomery devised a bold plan to open the way into the heart of Germany and so shorten the war with a decisive death blow to Germany.  Operation Market-Garden required a massive 30,000 British, American & Polish paratroopers to seize and hold six Dutch Rhine bridges behind enemy lines in daring daylight, while ground forces would rapidly advance up the main highway to meet them and so punch through German lines.  In its execution, however, the plan went horribly wrong: the Allies didnt take seriously Dutch intelligence which informed them that a crack German panzer division was currently in Arnhem on relief (proving that military intelligence is occasionally a true oxymoron), communications failed, one of the bridges was destroyed before it was crossed, and German resistance was often far fiercer than expected.  As a result, paratroopers in Arnhem found themselves trapped in a tiny pocket for days on end, and were slowly annihilated as the ground forces were unable to reach them.<br />Numerous epic scenes are burned clearly in my mind: the take-off of hundreds of C-47 Dakota transports and towed gliders; the sight of thousands of paratroopers being dropped over Holland; the fierce bridge assault with German tanks; the bold attempt at a night-time river crossing by boat.  But it is also the small touches that made this movie: the careful observations of a Dutch teenager acting as spy for the Dutch resistance; the drip of a soldiers blood on the toy train a child is playing with; a general fighting a lost cause being convinced by his batboy to enjoy cup of tea; a soldier in agony being told that morphine is only for those who are really hurt; the British paratrooper who sacrifices his life to retrieve a container which ironically proves to contain only useless red berets.  Although there is plenty of action, the movie is not obsessed with action but has plentiful scenes fostering contemplation and painful reflection, particularly the final poignant scene as a Dutch family abandons their home in the aftermath of battle.<br />But the shining quality of this movie is its sense of authenticity and realism.  The weaponry, vehicles, uniforms, foreign languages (with English sub-titles) and characters - all are painfully reproduced and accurate.  The movie has benefited greatly from the fact that it was shot on location (the Netherlands, with Deventer filling in for Arnhem) and not in a studio.  It must be conceded that it is impossible for a movie to include all the factors that led to the failure of Operation Market-Garden, but what is included seems to be accurate.  Thankfully, this is a war movie more about Hitler than Hollywood.  There is graphic violence and profanity/blasphemy (Im perplexed how this movie received only a PG rating, although apparently the MPAA originally gave it an R rating), but never is the violence/language merely gratuitous or entertaining: always we have the idea that this is what it was really like.  And its good to remember what it was really like.  The tension is all the more convincing, because this it is a real tension experienced in real life by real men who fought in the Second World War, particularly the desperation of men who helplessly and yet passionately fought in a losing cause in blind obedience to their military leaders.  The nine days of September 17-26 are tragic, but they deserve to be remembered as representative of the sacrifices that the Allies had to make for our freedom.  The three hours of this movie successfully accomplish the creation of such memories, making it a fine choice to watch on or before Remembrance Day.  Lest We Forget.a container which ironically proves to contain only useless red berets.

It doesn't go into detail about why the U.S. was involved, why should it? This is a film dedicated to remembering those who fought, not those who told them to...

B00005JKQZ|5.0|While \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a bibliography movie to some folks and a love one to some others, I view it as an art movie. It is a powerful story of mental struggle and spiritual triumph (or survival, or concession, depending on how you look at it). The three delusional images Nash has reflect three basic desires in one's real life --(Parcher) a grand mission toward the society and history that makes one feel self-important and competent, (Charles) a lifetime friendship that disregards the external society but comforts and encourages your innest soul, and (Marcy) a chance of giving and caring for the weaker and the<BR>younger. These desires die hard. I found it extremely touching when Dr. Rosen said to Alicia (Mr. Nash's wife), \\"imagine ... they have been your best friends, now they are not dead, they are not gone, but worse, they have never been...\\", and when Nash told Alicia, \\"sometimes I really miss talking to him [Charles]\\". The fact that Nash has a loving wife from the very beginning and an academic recognition in the end actually made his transition to the \\"real world\\" much easier, as he satisfied some of the desires in an alternative way, imagine other schizophrenia patients who have nothing to hang on to in their \\"real world\\". The first half of the movie is wisely tricky, the second is exceptionally powerful, and the music is extraordinary.
B00004RFCM|5.0|After renting these DVDs, I was instantly hooked on this show and you probably will be as well.  I now own all three seasons and SATC has become my favorite show still currently on TV.  It is just so hilariously funny, compelling, and compulsively watchable.  The first season takes a little while to get started, but once it does it's on fire and the second and third seasons are even better.  You get to know these four women as well as your best friends--each of them is so different, and yet all are lovable (the voracious, man-eating, sexaholic Samantha is definitely the funniest).  While some episodes are definitely not as good as others, when this show is at its best it's amazing.  Favorite episodes:  \\"The Drought\\" and \\"The Baby Shower.\\"
6305508550|3.0|For all of those people who keep telling you that \\"you gotta see Office Space\\", tell them to relax. Yes, this movie is an overexaggerated look at the corporate world and it does a fine job of really making you feel that the characters in the movie have it pretty bad. All of the stereotypical office people are present, from the annoying operator (\\"please hold, please hold, please hold\\") to the degrading boss. But when people are telling you that's you're going to laugh for hours upon hours, then they obviously have not seen classic comedies like \\"Caddyshack\\" or \\"Animal House\\". This movie has many funny moments, but to rank it in the top 10 of all-time comedies is a complete joke.<br />So do yourself a favor and rent it. You'll laugh intermittently, and for an hour-and-a-half, it's a nice ride. But don't go thinking you're watching the greatest movie of all time. \\"Office Space\\" is a witty, entertaining look at the corporate world, but one that's a far cry from being uproarious.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|No snake skin jackets. No Micheal J. Anderson. No Black Lodge. No Hollywood. No deformed Englishmen. No angels under the radiator. No Kyle MacLachlan. No sci-fi spectaculars. No Marilyn Manson cameos. No identity swapping. No \\"I have your disease in me now.\\" Yes, sir, this is not your typical David Lynch film. <br /> The first time I saw this, I was blown away by the almost void of idiosynchcrasies. There is the occasional \\"party\\" reference to remind you that you are still watching a film by THE David Lynch but it is mostly just there to tell a most unusual true story about brotherly love and devotion. This is Lynch's first true story film since \\"Elephant Man\\" and may be his best overall production since. Before this, people said his strongest, most put-together film was \\"Blue Velvet,\\" but now it has been replaced with this gem. It contains the final performance of Richard Farnsworth (who, I think, SHOULD have won the OSCAR that year. Sorry, Mr. Spacey). And marks the first time the wonderful Sissy Spacek (who has worked with Lynch since \\"Eraserhead\\") has acted for Lynch as Alvin Straight's most secretive daughter. Though most Lynch devotees will be bored senseless while waiting for things to get \\"wierd,\\" most viewers content with watching G-rated, Disney-distributed films will find inspiration and enjoyment at watching the old man go all of that way, even if Lynch might be discreetly mocking him at times (just look at that shot of Alvin going only abut five yards after fifteen seconds when the camera goes up and comes down on him). The Badalamenti music (see, this film isn't so unusual for Lynch, after all) is also top-notch, even if if it doesn't always mix with the final picture completely at times. Overall, a triumph for Lynch and its actors. This deserves to become a family classic!

B000065U1N|2.0|You want to know something funny? I'll tell you. While critics get themselves all in a lather poring over vapid movies like the recent Star Wars films for offensive racial subtext (The Trade Federation? Asian stereotypes! Jar Jar Binks? Stepin Fetchit redux!), movies with truly offensive racial material, like \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" get a free ride.<br />Hiding behind the fact that it is \\"based on a true story,\\" Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer's film ignores any complexities behind the conflict between US troops and Somalian forces, and renders the Africans in the movie as subhuman targets for American bullets. Even an uneven film like \\"Three Kings\\" did a better job than this.<br />Ever a technician, Scott takes normally proficient actors like Ewens McGregor and Bremner and basically turns them into REactors for the entire movie, running around ducking bullets and explosions without more than one character trait apiece. Some characters don't even have one!<br />To its credit, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" features the very frightening, extremely visceral battle sequences that filmgoers expect in post-Saving-Private-Ryan movies. Deafening bombs explode, sending soot flying. Blood pours from wounds. Nearly severed limbs hang off from tattered flesh. However, without the emotional investment that Spielberg provided in \\"Private Ryan,\\" it all becomes numbing after a while. Sure, there's suspense and tension, but we have no overwhelming reason to pull for the movie's protagonists, other than the fact that they're American. And white.<br />I have to say, when I saw it in the theater, I was able to table some of these reservations and get swept up in the battle scenes of \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" That's the only reason I give it 2 stars. But Ridley Scott's last insult pushed me out of the movie for good. After in effect disappearing from the film after the first 20 minutes, the lone African American soldier in the entire US unit reappears in the final battle sequence to mow down an armed Somalian woman with automatic weapons fire. Black-on-black crime? I don't think so.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This DVD is excellent.  This is probably one of the only movies I have ever laughed out loud.  Brad Pitt plays a character with a very funny oirish accent.  You can get many more things out of this movie than humor, such as action.  This is a good action movie, a good example would be when Brad Pitt boxes.  The first time I saw this movie was with my friend Jordan, I thought I was going to die laughing - literally. I would recommend this movie to people from the ages of 18+ for the reason that there is profanity in it.  This is a hilarious movie overall; and the accents are just hysterical.  If you want to see a good comedy/action movie this is what you want.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000508U6|5.0|I first heard of Coldplay when I saw their &quot;Yellow&quot; video on MTV's 120 minutes during my winter break.  I was intrigued by the simplicity of the video and the message of the lyrics.  For the next couple of weeks, I was simply haunted by the melody, yet was not compeled to buy the album.<br />The next time I heard of Coldplay was on my way to London.  The in-flight music had several selections and one of them was &quot;Spies&quot; by Coldplay.  I heard the song and was haunted.  All that week, as I toured London, the song was stuck in my head.  I came back home determined to buy the album.<br />The album was an even bigger surprise.  Everything in the album is memorable.  From &quot;Don't Panic&quot; to &quot;Everything's Not Lost,&quot; guitar rifts to haunting piano melodies, I was simply touched.  Chris Martin's beautiful voice and touching lyrics, filled with sorrow and tinged with hope...it was simply breathtaking.  Memorable tracks are &quot;Shiver,&quot; &quot;Spies,&quot; &quot;Yellow,&quot; &quot;Trouble,&quot; and &quot;We Never Changed.&quot;  Listen to one of these songs and it will haunt you with its melody.<br />Although the band is being compared to the likes of Radiohead, Oasis, and even Travis, Coldplay is a band in its own genre.  They are not Alternative enough, yet they're not too Folkish.  Coldplay with its sensitive lyrics and hard edge guitar playing--a happy medium that generates a sound all of their own.<br />Other albums to check out:<BR> --Nick Drake's &quot;Pink Moon&quot;<BR> --David Gray's &quot;Lost Songs 95-98&quot;

B00006690G|2.0|Eminem's last two albums were excellent not only in entertainment value, but also in artistic appeal. It was street poetry that echoed from the depths that he rose from. It was music that made you laugh hysterically but at the same time showed life through the perspective of someone who has little hope. <br />This album is a huge departure from his last two albums. The rap is entirely too metric and is a headache to listen to. He also sings on some tracks, which needless to say is abysmal. He talks about the same stuff he did his last two albums: 1) his mom 2)his daughter 3) how controversial he is. Frankly I'm sick of hearing about all three of those. His daughter's voice is actually in the chorus of one song, \\"My dad's gone crazy\\", which will probably make you gag almost as much as you will gag when you hear him sing.<br />Eminem is clearly trying to make his music more artistically expressive with this album. The music has gone from gritty, bass-thumping beats to an orchestrated, metric sound. Also the heartfelt bitterness and hatred that screamed through in the Marshal Mathers/Slim Shady LPs is sadly absent in this toned-down, less controversial album. .... In the end he fails in his attempt to create art and he fails to find something new to say. Skip this one.Em is well on his way there; after he gets through ragging on family members, he contrives enemies out of thin air, (MTV tried to shut him down? The Source doesn't respect him?) Worst of all, he's starting to indulge in vulgarity for vulgarity's sake like Too Short or 2 Live Crew with the ultra-misogynistic \\"Drip\\" and \\"Superman\\"; it's not just that these tracks are disgusting, it's that after staking his claim as the ultimate individual, such pandering like this should be beneath him. Those quibbles aside, it's another fun filled hour with MM, and he'll undoubtedly be renewed next season, even if the ratings start to shudder.
B000063JDE|4.0|Sixteen years on, it's curious to look back at the cultural firestorm sparked by David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet.\\" While this seminal work of American surrealism hasn't lost its ability to disorient and unsettle, it is nonetheless a film that wouldn't seem too out of place these days as an HBO original. Lynch oversaw a new transfer of \\"Blue Velvet\\" for this MGM special-edition DVD. Butchered by pan-and-scan in most of its video incarnations, the film is presented in dramatic anamorphic widescreen. Lynch's artistic images are markedly enhanced by their journey through the digital domain. Some of the upgrades are on display right away: the title images of blue velvet and the color-saturated opening shot of roses against a white fence. These visuals are tough to top, but overall the movie looks great and sounds OK. The lengthy \\"Mysteries of Love\\" documentary, by making-of specialist Jeffrey Schwarz, interviews the stars and key crew members. The creator of \\"Eraserhead,\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is actually a \\"boy scout,\\" they say, who uses expressions like \\"peachy keen\\" and takes meetings over shakes at Bob's Big Boy. But then there are those weekend photo projects with dead chickens. ... Those interviews are current, but Lynch isn't talking so the docu utilizes grainy 1987 footage of him talking with reporters but no new shots of the press-shy director. Lynch's low-light segments look like clips from a dated crime docu, giving the enterprise a dash of oddness that he probably appreciates. A must for fans of this peculiar film, including those who own the earlier widescreen DVD.
1573225517|3.0|With great amusement I read the Novel \\"High Fidelity\\"during my spring break. Yet while thoroughly analysing it in my twelve-grade English class, I have come to the conclusion that it offers a rather wide spread and worn view on men's behavior. If the author truly believes that man have more depth than a puddle, I would vehemently recommend to rethink the novel's ending. Did Rob really get the impact to change when getting back with Laura or weren't the last chapters not a more or less I-could-have-predicted it happy ending for all women who still naively believe in the power manipulating the opposite sex while being in a love relationship. I unfortunately have to state that Hornby's created \\"archetypes\\" in the beginning of his novel, mainly the brilliant couple Barry and Dick, were replaced by the less witty and engaging Is-it-better-sex topic, which mostly defines the protagonist Rob, making him an overly stereotyped figure. Being stuck in the rather dull discussion about the nature of men, which arouse after finishing the book, I would be more than happy to receive a letter from Mr. Hornby, revealing his clear position on this issue.<br />   J.

B000002KHH|4.0|Black Sabbath's 1970 sophomore release PARANOID became their breakout album and the album that launched their brand of dark, brooding heavy metal to the masses.  In fact, the 8 songs on PARANOID sound more like heavy metal than any of the songs on their self-titled debut (also released in 1970).  Those tracks sounded more like Cream or Zeppelin inspired blues-rock, with only the title track (\\"Black Sabbath\\") giving a hint at things to come.<br />In that aspect, PARANOID is a cohesive collection of hard rock tunes.  Why did I give this classic LP four stars?  Two simple reasons:<br />1) The production is terrible.  I forgave the poor sound quality of the first album because of the low budget, but by the time Sabbath were recording PARANOID, they had a lot more money than ever before.  So what's the problem?  Sometimes Geezer's bass is too low to hear and Tony Iommi's guitar riffs sound strained instead crunching like they should.<br />2) \\"Rat Salad\\" is not what I hoped it would be.  Although Bill Ward's drum solo is awesome, the whole song is pretty forgettable.  The flow of the album is disrupted.  It should've been a 2-minute drum solo with NO guitars or bass.<br />Despite those two mistakes, the rest of PARANOID holds up commendably well, deserving its classic status.  My personal favorite track is \\"Hand of Doom,\\" a 7-minute masterpiece that tells a disturbing and graphic tale of heroin addiction.  It's pretty amazing that a band like Sabbath, who were doing drugs AND groupies around this time, were actually denouncing the rock & roll lifestyle that bands like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin glorified.  They knew they were doing it, but they didn't like it.  The quiet and creepy bass intro, the angry gutiar solo, and the doomy drums add to the dark atmosphere of Ozzy's bleak and realistic lyrics.  A truly great song.<br />Other standouts include the anti-war epic \\"War Pigs\\" (which compares corrupt government to Satanism), the sludgy classic \\"Iron Man,\\" and theenergetic \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" which goes back to the bluesy feel of the debut. <br />This is really good, old-school metal.  Long live the 'Sabs (unless it's not Ozzy or Ronnie James Dio singing - the other singers [stunk]).
B00006690F|5.0|WHEN I FIRST GOT THIS CD, I EXPECTED A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FROM IT, AND THAT IS EXACTL WHAT I GOT.  FROM THE FIRST TRACK TO THE LAST, I WAS AMAZED AT HOW MR. MATHERS CAN RAP SO GOOD.  MY FAVORITES FROM THIS TRACK INCLUDE CLEANIN' OUT MY CLOSET, WITHOUT ME, HALLIE'S SONG AND MANY OTHERS.  NONE OF THE TRACKS ON THIS ALBUM WILL LEAVE YOU BORED. ALL OF THEM ARE VERY INTRIGING AND WORTH THE MONEY.  OVERALL, I THINK THAT THIS ALBUM WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF HIS BEST WITH HIS PREVIOUS, MARSHALL MATHERS LP.  BUY THIS CD, OTHERWISE YOU'LL BE MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF GOOD STUFF.
6302967864|4.0|Akira.  A classic masterpiece that was many a fan's first introduction to the world of anime.  The setting is Neo-Tokyo,  a city consisting of a masterful blend of glittering sci-fi technology and dark, grimy urban decay.  It's a city that has risen from the ashes of World War 3 as a shining example of progress, but hides a rotting core.  Biker gangs roam dirty streets battling for turf while corrupt politicians hatch new plots in chrome towers.  Revolutionaries fight for change while death cults pray for the end of everything. In the center of all this we find two long time friends who will ultimately decide the fate of the city, Kaneda and Tetsuo.<br />Kaneda and Tetsuo are gang members who brutally gaurd their turf.  During a battle with a rival gang, Tetsuo runs afoul of an escaped goverment test subject.  Injured badly, he is captured by the military along with the test subject.  It soon becomes apparent that the military has decided he would make an excellant test subject as well.  <br />Meanwhile Kaneda, while searching for clues to Tetsuo's whereabouts, becomes involved with a beautiful revolutionary.  With the help of the revolutionary movement, Kaneda is able to discover where Testuo is and attempt to rescue him.  Much to his dismay he discovers Tetsuo has become a dark and dangerous person who has resented Kaneda for years.<br />It is from here that the plot and action escalates to levels that shame most Hollywood blockbusters.  This movie has many stories going on at so many levels.   It's a story of a city that has risens from the ashes only to stand ont he brink of destruction again. It's a story of evolution, where mankind has been, what we are now, and where we might go. And it's the very human story of two childhood friends who care deeply for each other yet are caught up in a whirlwind of hate and resenment.<br />I highly recommend this film to all and I encourage you to attempt to aquire a subtitled version.  The subtitled version of this film tells a MUCH more accurate depiction of ths movie then the dub version, which many found to be confusing do liberaties taking with the plot during recording.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|One of the things I dislike most about soundtracks for movies is when you go to see a movies and there is very little what was in the movie and more of the new songs or new version of songs a studio is trying to push.<br />Hald of this album is like that. FIlled with the cover songs or remixes of the music that was NOT in the film or layed down as part of the original soundtrack. That is very anoying.<br />However, the second half...the FOUR songs that were actually in the film - especially &quot;The Elephant Melody&quot; are wonderful. I was so disappointed in this CD when I got it that I almost wrote the studio asking &quot;Why?&quot; If you liked the pop stuff they have been playing on the radio - you'll love this CD - if you are looking for what was actually in the movie - you'll only find FOUR true cuts - and/or cues.<br />But, guess hwat? They released another CD....now read that review I have written!
0871137380|5.0|To say the truth, the reason I decided to read this book was because a 2 time Acadmy Award winning movie was made from it. But let me tell you that after I began reading this book, I couldnt put it down. I mean, the book and movie ae so different. I say the book is much better, but thats just my opinion.  <BR>This book tells the story of our american soldiers who went in combat in Somalia in 1993. And instead o telling a story on what happened in Somalia day after day, this book focuses on the soldier's point of view. I mean, its like if the creator of this book was inside of each and every soldier as they went through these situations. It is absolutely brilliant. The graphic description and agony text is so real and imaginable! And to think that this really did happen to these men. And with the addition of the pictures, the reader can get a better idea of what these men looked like and what they went through. I mean, these men were very very young. So many died and others came out injured. This battle shouldnt be forgotten because it is a display of the passion these men have for their country. So in tribute to these men and their families, I say Thank you. And God Bless America!
B00003CXTG|2.0|This movie almost put me to sleep in the theatre. TOO, too mushc of a love story. Way too much! They could have cut an hour out of the movie and I would have enjoyed it so much more.<br />It works better on the small screen. The attack itself is done very well. The story still lacks integrity, but the visuals are good.<br />The best part about the DVD is the extra features. There is a great perspective video on PerlHarbor. Even the making of the movie documentary is much better than the movie itself overall.<br />The best thing I can say is that the extras on the DVD are better than the Movie itself.
B000063CPL|5.0|I get extremely P.O.'d whenever people badmouth Janick Gers. He is one of my favorite guitarists, and has been since the early '80's when he played in Ian Gillan's band. He is creative, and very spontaneous. Nobody (incuding him sometimes)knows what he is going to play next. His solo on \\"Hallowed\\" is, in my opinion, one of the highlights of the CD. All 3 guitarists are in top form. Although I don't think Adrian was featured enough in the setlist selection. But every time I heard a jaw-droppingly good solo, it seemed that Janick was the one playing it. He was incredible in the Philly show at the E-Centre also. <BR>   Now on to Bruce. I've never heard him sing better in a live setting. He sounds even better than he did on \\"Live After Death\\", believe it or not. I can't say enough how good he sounds. It would be a waste of time to list all of his highlights on this CD. Because he simply soars beginning to end.<BR>   I have not heard the drums so high in the mix on any previous Maiden recordings. They are very powerful, but without drowning out the rest of the band. Nicko's fills, and little 'in between' rhythms are simply outstanding. He is clearly having a lot of fun.<BR>    Again, just to emphasize my point. QUIT BADMOUTHING JANICK. He has been in the band for 12 years now. He isn't going anywhere. Get over it!!!! Don't get me wrong, I love Mr. Smith. The band is better for having him in it. His distinctive sound was definitely missing. Janick doesn't play anything like Adrian. Never did. Never will. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE ISN'T AN OUTSTANDING GUITARIST. He also has a very unique sound( as does Adrian, and Dave) that adds another dimension to this band. I truly believe that the people who don't like him, simply don't like him because he isn't Adrian Smith. Again, GET OVER IT!!! The 3 part harmony on \\"Brave New World\\" could not have been done without all 3 of them. <BR>    My one and only complaint. It is so small that I didn't even deduct any stars, is that they didn't incorporate more 3 part harmonies into some of their older material. But that is trivial. It sounds great. Get it.
B000065V1V|3.0|It is unheard of to pick up any Bowie album and not hear at least one tune that sticks in your head.  Except for Heathen.  It's as though DB wanted to write an entire album of background dinner music.  The first track hints at something greater within, but by the end you wonder how long you were asleep.  This is NOT a \\"return to traditional Bowie\\".  This has none of the passion, flair, or life of his past albums.  The young DB had a raging fire within him, but Heathen is a smoldering, grey collection of dead songs.  <br />***If you have accidentally listened to this album and have lost all hope for the future, I suggest you refresh yourself with \\"Five Years\\", \\"I'm Deranged\\", and \\"Wild is the Wind\\" in that order.
0446678430|5.0|This is a great book, possibly the best of the series. If you think all there is to life is a college degree and a J-O-B, think again.Mr. Kiwosoki has written an excellent book that is right for the times.

B00005JXY3|4.0|Karate Kid II is not as good as the first, but sequals<br />rarely are. Karate Kid II is very enjoyable. Some think<br />that part II and III should have been switched around, and<br />I agree with that. I think this would have been a better<br />end to the series, with a few minor changes maybe.<br />Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita give great performances<br />once again. Daniel and Miyagi are awesome characters. I<br />think it's cool how they were able to make a series<br />where two people so far apart in age are such great friends.<br />Anyway, in Karate Kid II, Daniel san and Miyagi go to Okinawa<br />after Miyagi gets word that his father has become very ill.<br />To make matters worse, Miyagi has a problem with Sato, his<br />former best friend. Really, Sato has a problem with Miyagi,<br />over an old girlfriend. Daniel ends up having a problem of his<br />own with Sato's nephew, Chozen. I can't recall the guy's name<br />that played Chozen, but I think he was awesome! Why didn't<br />he receive more roles?? It's a mystery to me. The last fight<br />could have been better, but it works. Great movie.
B000062TU1|5.0|The title says it all boyos. This is an amazing movie. It was so thrilling that I was shocked to discover that I didn't remember half of the dialogue. Emma Watson was such a babe. I can't believe they're replacing her, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Now I know how people felt when Sean Connery threw in the towel after he did You Only Live Twice. They should have mentioned that you had to find the Sorcerer's Stone to see the deleted scenes. All of these deleted scenes should have been kept in the movie except for the eggs scene. These scene could have made the movie more faithful. They could have had Harry and Hagrid talking about the dragon thing as they walking to the Leaky Cauldron. This movie definitely stays faithful to the book. It has some dialogue that wasn't in the book but it was worth it. In case you don't know who Warwick Davis is, he played Wicket, the Ewok, in Return of the Jedi, and Wald, one of Anakin's friends, in The Phantom Menace. In case you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm referring to two Star Wars films. Daniel Radcliffe is equally amazing. You can hardly tell he was lipsyncing in some scenes (his voice was changing). I'm almost certain that they shot the scene with the letters flying all over the place last because his voice sounds different. I am so mad that John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick) had an almost cameo role in that movie. I pray that they'll use him in the next movies and I hope that they write some dialogue for him in The Prizoner of Azkaban. I don't think that Richard Harris (Dumbledore) is going to be used for all of the movies. Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) has become quite famous here in America. She recently finished the movie, Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. I have two final complaints, one minor and one major, and the major one comes first. I can't believe that Harry Potter didn't get a nomination for Best Picture. The actors in the movie didn't get nominatedfor Best Leading Actor or Actress or Best Featured Actor or Actress. Emma Watson's performance deserved an Award for Best Actress. My final complaint is that the DVD has no audio commentary. Maybe, I'll find it. Maybe, it's an Easter Egg.
B00003CX95|5.0|EVERY MAN DIES, BUT NOT EVERY MAN REALLY LIVES... This is the central theme in Mel Gibson's Braveheart. Braveheart is an epic story of greed, revenge, and what some would say is the greatest of all Love. It is based on the story of William Wallace, a 13th century Scotsman who sought revenge for the death of his father, brother and their tiny little town. Mel Gibson's directorial debut could not have done better. The audiences thought it was amazing , the Oscars thought enough of it to name it best picture. William Wallace is an inspiration to all who have been oppressed under the tyranny of evil. He lives with his uncle until he is in his twenties and goes back to his village which is now under the rule of Edward the Longshanks. He wants to marry the women he loves. After she is taken from him, he sets out to free Scotland from oppression. <br />The sheer magnitude of this production has never been seen before. The battle scenes are filmed at great angles. The cinematography is out of this world. This movie basically has something for everyone. It has Romance, Conflict, and it definitely<BR> has enough action to satisfy anybody. This movie is one of the greatest epics of our time. It is definitely a movie to buy and view over and over again. <br />William Wallace will stop at nothing to achieve his goal and to avenge his beloved. Legend has it that when William Wallace was tortured and killed he was asked if he had any last words and he yelled out \\"Freedom\\"!!!!. His arms and legs were sent to the four corners of Britain as a sign of what would happen to those who opposed the King. <br />\\"They may take our lives, but they will never take our freedom\\"
0743442539|5.0|If the power of a book can be judged, in part, by its ability to sink hearts, than this book for me should get six stars.  I thought about it off and on all day after finishing it.<br />le Carre's characters, for me, are timeless in spite of the dated contexts of his stories.  In this treatment, we follow the self-proclaimed believer-of-nothing, washed out spy Alec Leamas on his last, greatest, most perilous mission in ostensible service of freedom and the Western way against the Red Plague of eastern communism.  The reality for Alec, though, is much more personal and shallow.  This story is fleshed out with complex sympathetic and contemptible characters (some of them are both).<br />For some people, this story is an exercize in the fruits of nihilism.  For others, it is about a man who works through his own stubbornness and finds a type of faith.  This book avoids the question \\"Does the end justify the means?\\" and simply observes that sometimes whether or not we like it that we justify what we do by whether or not \\"our side\\" benefits.  The terribly frightening thing is that for most people, \\"our side\\" is an accident of birth.  One of the great theses in this book is that often we are, truly, the same as our enemies.  The great socio-institutional weapons we build to destroy each other kill both the thistles and the gentle flowers, and sometimes we become slaves of our own creations.  What is the value of societies vs. the value of persons?  And who gets to decide?  Man has invented deadly games that he, to the exclusion of morality and even reason, pursues with only the goal of winning, despite cost.<br />This is also simply one of the saddest stories ever told, anytime.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Bryan Singer has solidified this movies place in the crime genre's storied history. The Usual Suspects is an twisting, turning thrill ride into the dark underworld of hardcore criminals. This movies characters are unparalleled. There is Keaton the mastermind of the operation. There is Fenster and Mcmanus who are longtime partners and top notch entry men. There is Todd Hockney who is the explosives expert. The most interesting and prominent character is Verbal Kint. He is the odd man out, he is a cripple so he dosen't really have a place in the crime world. <br />This story is told through Verbal's eyes as he tells the story of The Usual Suspects. These five men were not supposed to meet. They are an explosive group of hardcore criminals, who if the payoff is right will go into battle. They are the kind of men you would want on your side were you to go into battle. They would even go so far as to march into certain death. Verbal tells this dark yet enthralling story to Dave Kujan. He is investigating Keaton, and wants to find out more about him. <br />Dave Kujan recruits Verbal to talk to him about his experiences with Keaton and the story of this mans experiences draw the viewer closer and closer to the movies central question and ultimately it's unsolved mystery. <br />WHO IS KEYSER SOZE?????
0812550706|5.0|this one of the books that i have read and reread innumerable times.  a must read for all.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I have found Gosford Park be none of those I read about: VIOLENCE? - No: one knife-stick is not a violence nowadays :-),  MYSTERY? - no, since about the 30th minute you can read who's who and even anticipate who will be killed and who is the murderer, SEX? - no, a couple of scenes in the belowstairs are vague and not important. The only thing you've heard about which really happens is - THE MURDER. <BR>In spite of all that - this is one of the MOST breath taking movies you can hope for in the last years. R-Altman is a brain of our times - this is what makes thrill out of the project that made me watch until the last end titles. The air of the movie is UNBEATEN! Gosford Park is one of the art pieces - just like Shakespeare's plays - nobody would go for a Macbeth or Romeo and Julia to find out who is the murderer - you watch them to get in the mood of the play for a couple of minutes. It's not the murder and it's investigation, but the way the story is told, which made me feel that Gosford Park an outstanding piece of art.
B000065V1V|5.0|I bought this incredible album yesterday & listened to it all night long. David Bowie's \\"Heathen\\"is the next peak of his career, the highest since Low & Heroes (I'm quite sure about that!). The title track has a mysterious dark beauty, that shocks, really shocks me. I think it's one of the strongest songs of Bowie & other pieces on Heathen are nearly as good as this beautiful track 12 (believe me)!<br />I highly recommend you the DIGIPAK edition with the bonus disc, which is also perfect.
B00005T33W|5.0|Somehow these characters just grow on you. I saw this movie when it first came out, and I thought it was OK. But I kept pondering how Thora Birch's \\"Enid\\" and her friend \\"Rebecca\\" evolve through the movie, from school girls to the working world; and I saw myself in Enid with what destiny she ultimately chooses.<BR>The movie is full of little scene gems involving the strangest people one could meet on the streets of any given community in the USA. <BR>By far, this movie tops my list of favorites.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This was a miserable excuse for a romance.  Its surrealistic, naive character made it the embarassment it was.  Had the plot been more consistant and possible, and the characters not so much the shallow characatures that they were, the movie may have found success with me.  Nicole Kidman's singing was beautiful.... I am not the greatest of fans of romance films but this one was worse than any I have seen before and will most likely be quickly forgotten.  Boo-hoooo.<br />...
B000063K5W|5.0|Hedwig has something for everyone- love, betrayal, sex, symbolism and fantastic music- all wrapped up in the engrossing character of Hedwig. I found this movie to be one of the most multi-faceted movies I'd ever seen: we are all reflected in Hedwig, one way or another. The basis of the movie, while highly comedic, becomes rather poignant and touching at times, and even the most skeptical of my friends have admitted their enjoyment with this film. <br />Symbolism is something to look out for, and upon watching this movie with various friends, I found many different opinions on what exactly meant what. The religious symbolism, in the aspect of Christianity, culminates in the closing scene, hinting back at the Garden of Eden. <br />While the story in Hedwig is, to say the least, delightfully original, the music is incredible. A true musical this is, yet Hedwig is more entertaining than many I've seen. The score only benefits the terrific story line and the songs are some of the catchiest I've heard in a long time. (\\"The Origin of Love\\" song and accompanying animation are truly not to be missed). <br />Perhaps the greatest aspect of Hedwig is the open-ness to interpretation. I loved the music and the love story; others love the costumes and the sheer oddness of the film, while still others find the humor and animated bits to be the most endearing parts. <br />Superbly acted, surprisingly convincing, and deliciously entertaining, Hedwig is a divine comedy, a fantastical musical and above all, an overall great jaunt down the seemingly forgotten path of cinematic (or, in consideration of Hedwig's Broadway roots, theatrical) oddity, integrity and loyalty to the true meaning of the word: entertainment.
0316776963|4.0|Sedaris has compiled a bunch of wonderful essays. Some definitely aren't as funny as others, but I got a good laugh out of \\"Picka Pocketoni\\". By being able to laugh at himself Sedaris has made it easy for us to laugh at him. I enjoyed his style of writing very much. Although there is no real plot to the book each essay is its own interesting story. <BR> <BR>Even though I found this book very funny, it is easy to see that not every one would agree with me. I would definitely advise that you read the first chapter before you buy. The funny stories were great, but some you just read because they were there. I give this book four stars because it has good and not so good parts, and it would be easy to have a opposite opinion from me.
B00005OM5L|5.0|A live concert June 29th 1996 and what an absolutely fabulous DVD .... If there was a downer it was that it only ran 89 minutes when other concert DVD's have been hitting the 120 mark ... but ... I DO PREFER a great 89 minutes as compared to Paul Simon's ridiculous Paris concert that ran 120 minutes and was absolute poop ...... <br />Also like some of the great concert DVD's such as  Fleetwood Mack's 'Dance' and the Stones 'Voodoo Lounge' the sound thracks on this DVD are true Dolby Digital surround sound ... may only be version 3 and not 5.1 but WOW your amps will love the power ...... <br />This is a must have DVD ...... Clapton does all his hits and his band and back-up singers are flawless .....
630204135X|5.0|&quot;Persona&quot; is by far one of the most complex films ever fabricated in cinema.  Like all Ingmar Bergman films, &quot;Persona&quot; challenges the viewer's thoughts of reason and reality.  Made in 1967, this still remains to this day, the most haunting and confusing film on self-identity and the duality we have as human beings.  Some might find the overlay of the movie too cynical maybe, but only because Bergman so purposely shows us our contradictory natures.  Both character leads played by Bergman regulars Liv Ullman and Bibi Anderson give stunning performances, as usual.  It's really amazing how well both women played such difficult roles, Ullman's character doesn't speak one line throughout the film and Anderson so captures all the different moods with an almost too realistic touch.  Recommended to only serious movie-goers, Bergman fans, art house, foreign film fans, and those who can handle disturbing commentaries on self reflection.
B00005JKCF|4.0|This really is a family movie, a crowd pleaser, and the type of film that everyone should get something out of.  The type of Blockbuster that the people involved actually cared about making, and it shows.  The characters are so much fun, from the central trio of young adults--Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, young Spidey-in-the-making, James Franco as his best friend, the troubled Harry Osbourne, and Kirsten Dunst, perfect as the warm and friendly but slightly inaccessible girl-next-door, Mary-Jane Watson--to the great Willem Dafoe, hamming it up gorgeously as Harry's scientist father, a.k.a. The Green Goblin.  One of the funniest scenes is when a wounded Spidey gets a pep talk from the responsible Goblin, who sits conspiratorily beside him and taps the woozy Spidey's head to get his attention.  The screenplay is marvellously tongue-in-cheek, every frame is drenched in colour, and the whole film shows the signs of love that went into making it.  True, not everything works, some of the big special-effects scenes look a bit too animated, but bring on the sequels anyway, this one was a lot of fun.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful movie. I really love it! Luc Besson is a very good director. His visions are always so interesting and unique. I saw this DVD out so I immidiately bought it. And I really liked it too! It was perfect. Since it is the uncut international version, it had many scenes that I hadn't seen before. But, unlike most DVDs where the scenes are usually bad and they don't give you a chance to watch the movie without them, these scenes were really good! I barely even noticed that they were new. I was just wacthing the new scene where Natalie Portman gets a little tipsy on champagne, and was just laughing my head off and realized that this wasn't in the original version I had seen on TV! So over all the DVD was very well made, especially with that soundtrack isolation thing. I really like that. You can just sit back and listen to the exceptional score. And it's a wonderful movie to begin with, so where can you go wrong? A lot of people think this movie is about violence and killing, but it is really about love. Love over all things between a hit man and a little girl. Buy this DVD!
B000059XUO|5.0|It is appropriate that Brandon Lee's last film should be so magnificently memorable and meaningful. I think I know why this film is so deeply stirring. Here is the essence of the shaman hero returned from the realm of death to correct profound injustice, profound imbalance. The return from the realm of the dead, the crow as spirit guide, the mask, the music (yes, it would have been more appropriate if he was a drummer, but when does a drummer ever get any recognition....) Here is the age old tale of profound evil generating an equally profound response. Yes, there is a lot of violence in this film, yet somehow it doesn't come across as either gratuitous or self-righteous. Eric Draven has returned to show the conscienceless the true evil and pain that they cause others- right before he sends them to their true judgement.<br /> I've had people tell me that they won't watch this film because they don't like dark and negative images. I tell them that just the \\"Mother is the name for God\\" scene will change their minds.... There is a term that is used in this film, \\"awful goodness\\", that is a perfect description of the Crow- Awe-ful Goodness.<br />  I always watch this film on the night that it centers around- Oct. 30th- Devil's Night. I consider it to be a treat. Afterall, it is my birthday....
B000065U1N|5.0|As a soldier and NCO in the US Army I was a little skeptical about how realistic this movie would've been made.  This was an excellent movie that truthfully depicted what happened on that tragic day.  It even accurately points out the apathetic political strategy coming from on high at that time.  Although it was very difficult to watch fellow soldiers going down like that, it truly honors their sacrifice!
0553381687|4.0|This book was impressive in the sense that magic is sparse, the politics is complex, characters are thoroughly developed and not many pages are wasted on glorious quests.  Each chapter is told in the viewpoint of a character.  This enables the reader to not only learn about the character but also gain insight on other characters as well.  The history of the world is slowly revealed to you as you read the book and by the end of it, you know the past pretty thoroughly.<br />The best part about this book is that almost everything that happens serves to push the plot.  This, however, doesn't mean that the book is perfect.  Martin wastes a lot of text on detail and quite often repeats convictions and thoughts of various characters.  It gets a bit annoying toward the end but it's a minor issue.<br />I am interested in reading the second book so the series has gained another fan.
B00005QG9J|1.0|Long time Incubus fans (as in before they were popular) no doubt knew that this would happen after the \\"Drive\\" single from the mediocre \\"Make Yourself\\" shot Incubus to never before thought of heights.  And, what do you know?  Incubus has gone from a unique sounding band (check out \\"Fungus Amongus\\"), to one of the new wave of post grunge sensitive pop rock in the vain of Nickelback and Creed.  \\"Wish You Were Here\\"?, gimme a break, where have we heard that before?  I think they were called Pink Fl...something or other.  The \\"heavy\\" songs sound like the Backstreet Boys adding downtuned guitars, and it is a real shame because Incubus was once a great band, but as with the times, they've just gone with the trend.  Skip this.
B00006690G|5.0|Of all the hiphop i have this is far the best. Eminem show surpasses all of his old cds. DOnt even think about buying the clean versin ...! Dre also features in this CD. Tracks that rule = my dads gone crazy, white america,without me  and soldier. Every 1 should own this Eminems back and shows that no matter how long hes away he will still be number 1. If ur considering buying this do cos if u dont ull regret it!
B00005JKCF|4.0|I was never really into comic books as a kid, but as a movie, this brought the story of Spiderman to life for me. A well thought out storyline, well made technically, and a good performance from Tobey Maguire... Along similar lines of the \\"recent\\" Batman movies, with whiz-bang special effects etc., but with a better thought out plot. <br />Will be added to my DVD collection when available. Cleverly setup for a sequel, which I will most definitely see!
B000000993|5.0|This is the finest and most incredible album ever made by Tool. If you don't buy this you are missing out on a huge chunk of modern music.
B00005B36H|5.0|I´m not a heavy metal fun. So if you are looking for a review of a guy who love this kind of music you should stop reading this review now.<br />This group is, in simple words amazing. From the beggining to the end everything is precise and passional. Every note is just where it should be placed, and (even) the drums are played in a way that you just can even imagine. This drummer is innovative and, in some way, remembers me Neal Peart, in his best performances. When you first hear to \\"The Patient\\" you just realize that this group is unique and that they match hard rock with \\"intelligence\\". But when you think that yu have had an amazing experience you just begin to listen to \\"Schism\\". I have listen to this piece almost thousand of times. It is strong, full of energy, precise and...just perfect.<BR>This record should be placed in your room, very close to RUSH´s \\"Hemispheres\\", King Crimson´s \\"Discipline\\" and Joe Satriani´s \\"The Extremist\\". It is an excellent example of how a professional rock band can write down an outstanding piece of music.<BR>It doesn´t matter if it´s better or worst than Aenemia. Or if it is too progressive or not. This kind of arguments are, in my opinion, irrelevant. Just \\"listen\\" to this record. You will not be dissapointed.

B00003CXXS|2.0|After a boy gets trapped on Isla Sorna whilst on an ill-conceived sight-seeing trip with his father a rescue party led by Sam Neill, making a return as Dr Alan Grant, sets out to bring the youngster (implausibly alive on an island populated by flesh eating dinosaurs) back to safety and guess what? They succeeed (now there's an original plot twist).<br />Having seen all three parts of the Jurassic Park trilogy, it has to be said that Jurassic Park III has moved the great Tyrannosaurus Rex of a movie franchise to almost certain extinction. Admittedly Joe Johnston's direction is efficient if unremarkable, give or take the odd set-piece or another and it's not as if Jurassic Park III is awful, it's just average. Very average. It has no real story or plot to speak of and the biggest problem is that we have seen it all before, with the exception of some new previously unseen dinosaurs (wow)! From the moment Sam Neill joins up with his motley crew of would-be rescuers to travel to Isla Sorna you already know or can at least accurately guess who is going to survive and who is going to die (and in which order).<br />Not even the return of the always excellent Sam Neill as Dr Alan Grant and the addition to the cast of William H Macy can do enough to add weight and intelligence to this tired old sequel. T&eacute;a Leoni is also wasted and is only required to scream hysterically from time to time in that old-fashioned stereotypical way that women in this kind of formulaic B movie are required to do. Alessandro Nivola, a fine young actor does his best too but with such a tired and weak script, no amount of talent was ever going to lift this movie above the ordinary. In fact I'd rather search for my mobile phone in a big pile of dinosaur manure than have to watch another shameless and storyless Hollywood cash in such as this one.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is perhaps the best written novel in American History.  Author Harper Lee takes readers back to the deep south with her descriptive writing.  Jem, Dill and Scout are unforgettable characters along with Atticus providing a positive role for the three careless youths.  This book will take one back to their childhood days where everyone lived by an old spooky house such as the Radley's.  Harper Lee vividly describes the innocence of the children through Scout who is the narrator for the novel.  This book is a must read.  One that you will want to read again and again.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This is pure eye candy. The music, utterly forgettable yet well produced, is a soundtrack to a visually stunning, sexy young woman who is intent on exciting every man in the audience. The seemingly endless costume changes highlight Brit's incredible body -- from ballerina fantasy to tight jeans bump & grind -- while the cinematography and lighting enhance every angle and move to perfection. I coudn't tell you a single rhyme or memorable lyric, but this DVD was music to my eyes. I personally felt glad to be a man when I watched this DVD, and whenever I rewatch it, I'm reminded to be thankful for such expertly produced spectacular entertainment. BRAVO!
B00003CXI1|1.0|Fell asleep 15 minutes into it.  Thankfully, I didn't waste my money in the theater and only had to turn off my DVD player to end the torment.  Watch Lord of the Rings instead.
B00003CXI0|5.0|The movie fulfills almost all the possibilities and loses very little from the fantastic book...there is no way a movie could actually film EVERY scene in the book...but, it come s close.  My children could not resist...we went 3 times to the theater while waiting for the movie release...and we NEVER go to the movies!!    Since we bought this, we have watched it about 15 times, and the kids have watched it even more times without their mom...!  A reader's dream...the Quiddich game was great, very exciting...!!!Just as my imagination had it 'painted' in my head.
B000065U1N|5.0|Ridley Scott's Graphic War Film Black Hawk Down is a masterpiece on every level of film making. It intorduces its charcters well even theo we don't know much about them. We feel what they half to go through in the film. What I liked most about the film is that it shows the level of cauos that war is. When something goes wrong these charcters act like real people would they act scared,afride,and nervous. You mite not know these charcters well enough. But you no them enough to feel for them when they get hurt or killed. This movie is based on true events. A word of Warning the violence in this movie is extremely graphic and prolonged and is not for the faint at heart. In one prolonged scene a soilder is wouded and the other soilders must operate on him or he will die. The camara lingers on the wound as blood gushes out of the wound we as a movie audience must witness this for awhile it last saverel minutes and that is just one scene. this is by far one of the best war film's I have seen It is a masterpiece. But again this is not a movie for people with weak stomic's.

B00005KB9X|5.0|This is one of my top 10 favorite albums just because it's so lively (lively up yourself!).  It's got the horns in most of the songs and then the bass lines are superb.  And of course the guitar licks are great too.  I just think that this album as a whole is one great performance.

B000063V8R|4.0|The third season of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" is where things really start to come together. After an often cringe-inducing first season, and an uneven second, the third go around is simply wonderful to watch. The entertainment value is high, and the show finds new ways to grow and become deeper and more complex. The production values appear to be higher, and the chemistry between the characters becomes fully realized.<br />There is so much I love about \\"TNG\\" starting with this season: the set design, the photography, the acting, the stories, the entire look and feel of the show. Patrick Stewart is great as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and Brent Spiner as Data is another favorite. The entire cast manages to form a highly engrossing ensemble.<br />Some of my favorite stories from this season are: \\"The Defector\\", in which a high-ranking Romulan takes the high road and attempts to warn the Federation of impending attacks. The ending is heartbreaking. \\"Sarek\\", which features the venerable Mark Lenard as Spock's father, is another heartbreaking, but also profound story. \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" is simply a classic. The Enterprise C travels forward in time through a rift in space and meets Picard's Enterprise D. The plot developments, character interaction, and final outcome are some of the best underpinnings to a television episode I've ever seen. The sacrifice of both the Enterprise C and alternate-Universe Enterprise D gave me chills. And, finally, who can forget the absolutely excellent season-ender \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\"? The story is simply pounding, the acting wonderful, and even the incidental music adds a rich, tense layer to the proceedings. An all-around solid, entertaining season. A promise of more good things to come.<br />I have so far been impressed with the DVD releases of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\". The third season set should be no different. The picture is crisp and the sound is clear. The format and its content are very much worth the moneyand the attention.<br />Now it's time for seasons 4 and 5.
0897500482|5.0|Tao of Jeet Kune Do is probably the best book for people starting to learn about Bruce Lee's fighting method and philosophy.  There are pics and diagrams on how to do simple moves.  It contains alot of Lee's philosophy and quotes.  Tjis book is easy to rea ans the best part is that Bruce Lee wrote it himself!! I give a 5 star rating!!!
B000065U1N|3.0|Like Ridley Scott's last film, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down is also about the way of the warrior. Unlike the former, the bloodshed and motive for it has a much more complicated motive in Hawk. IN 1993 members of the American Rangers and Delta Force are sent into a hostile somalian neighborhood to capture the top lieutenants of a local warlord. This local warlord is holding a stranglehold on the city's food supply, funneling it to his armies. Anytime you take sides in a civil war, you're going to get bloody. The worst place to get involved in a firefight has to be in the middle of a city. There's so many places for snipers to pick you off from. Every window and corner becomes a hiding place of death.<br />They capture who they were looking for but soon after that a copter is downed by a missle laucher and the carefully laid plan to get out of the area falls to pieces. The Americans find themselves stuck in the middle of thousands of hostile Somalis.<br />This was a great movie. All the performances and special effects were right on. No one actor really stands out to me. It was more of an ensemble piece. Eric Bana, who happens to be filming The Incredible Hulk right now does a good job as a hardened veteran who seems to have a sixth sense about war. Also, William Fichtner is attention grabbing as the Delta Force leader. Josh Hartnett, the clone of Chris Klein and Keanu Reeves, is better than usual, which isn't saying a lot. Tom Sizemore does his best impression of Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now as a general who never flinches and walks through bullets as if they were rain.<br />Actually, this movie reminded me a lot of Apocalypse just in terms of showing the utter chaos of war. The big ad campaign and the slogan said over and over again in the movie is \\"Leave no Man behind\\". It's almost religious doctrine. The problem is that should you go back to get a man even though you lose even more men in the process who you in turn have to save and then more men get killed and you have to rescue them and so on.......<br />Ridley Scott through his tone and the dialogue of the characters seems to ask the question \\"What were we doing there?\\", meaning that we should not have got involved. In that way, this film seems very anti-war. Violence was glorified in Gladiator in the name of revenge but here it's not. It's kinda disturbing because we got involved over there for humanitarian reasons and I just seemed to get this suggestion from the film that it was just another Vietnam. Somalia was not about ideology. It was about saving starving people.<br />The DVD says it has \\"special features\\" but really the only bonus is a short featurette about the making of the movie. It's kinda funny that \\"animated menus\\" and \\"scene selections\\" are listed too. Something really humorous was the \\"theatrical trailers\\" which you would think would be those of Black Hawk Down. They're not. They're trailers for Jet Li's The One and Spider-Man. Also, you have the option of turning on Chinese or Thai subtitles.  The picture and sound are excellent. You only have the choice of 5.1. I have a sneaking suspicion that another deluxe version of the DVD will come out one day. This is the bare essentials DVD. Why am I complaining? In the end it's the film that matters.<br />In the end I am very proud of our armed forces. I was in college when the actual incident took place and I didn't remember a lot about it so I was glad I could really be educated and see the sacrifices that were made and the heroism those guys and girls in our armed forces have to exhibit.

B00005RYL2|3.0|Hi, these are some additional comments with respect<BR>to my last post regarding the dvd version of <BR>'Highlander':<br />I did a little more research.  It turns out that when<BR>this movie was released, there were two versions, an<BR>American version, and a European version.  The American<BR>version did not have the additional six minutes of<BR>footage where the relationship between McLeod and Rachel<BR>was explained.<br />Anyway, I watched it again, and still think the American<BR>version was superior.  In the American version, the<BR>relationship between them is not explained, but it is<BR>obvious that it is a platonic one.  So you're left with<BR>the impression that McLeod doesn't allow himself to fall<BR>in love with anyone since the death of his Heather,..<BR>until Brenda enters his life.<br />The American version, in my opinion, is better because<BR>in the European version, if he is willing to adopt Rachel <BR>as his daughter it kind of leaves a logic gap as to why he <BR>wouldn't want another romantic relationship with someone <BR>over the course of 500 years.  Single parenthood, when one<BR>is immortal, doesn't quite add up.<br />In the American version, you get the impression that<BR>Rachel is in love with McLeod, but he simply doesn't<BR>feel the same way towards her.  You're never told<BR>how come she knows he's immortal, but the fact that<BR>she does, and that they still have this platonic thing<BR>between them, makes it really cool, and makes the<BR>growing love between him and Brenda even more <br />meaningful.<br />Yeah, I know, I'm splitting hairs, but I think the <BR>American version was the more romantic one...Then again,<BR>because this movie made such an impact on me when I<BR>first saw it, maybe I'm just not comfortable with<BR>another different version of it, even if it is the<BR>'director's cut'.  Given DVD technology, you would think<BR>it would be possible to toggle between the US and<BR>European version.  <br />I really wish it was possible to order the American <BR>version of this film on dvd, even though when it first <BR>came out, it didn't do very well in theatres, stateside..<BR>Which is probably the reason the American version isn't<BR>available on dvd.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life isn't for everyone, and judging from the reviews posted here, it looks like you either love it or you hate it.  I loved everything about it, from the animation to the philisophical quotes and metaphysical nature.  How can we as a human-whole NOT wonder whether we are awake or dreaming?  What is real?  How did we get here?  <br />I will not divulge the facts of the movie, in fear of spoiling it for anyone, but I will say that it's refreshing, the animation is spectacular and very unique, the ideas presented are thought-provoking...  This is a movie that inspires you to think upon your daily life and wonder if there isn't more to life than meets the eye.<br />A great feat for Linklater.
0345442989|5.0|Well written, with lots of twisting plot. This book has it all - from characterization to plot. We gain tremendous understanding of the events leading up to the War on Naboo, insight into many of the major players in Episode I and II, and lots of historical bits about the Jedi Order. <br />The writing style Mr Luceno employs is quite a bit more advanced that many other prequel books, which are mainly targeted at intermediate readers. This is a book worthy of Tom Clancy or Le Carre.

B00003CXI1|4.0|I'm an adult fan of the books.  Saw the movie in the theatre and loved it there.  Of course, I did go away with that &quot;oh I wish they showed more detail about...&quot; feeling.  Also, we didn't bring our 3 1/2 old when the movie came out because we were concerned for the scare factor.  Since we've bought it, he (4 yrs now) has watched it 5 times and loves it.  He was a little edgy at first with some of the scary scenes, but with the second viewing he got over it.<br />Now as far as the DVD...  First let me say, I didn't realize you had to play games to find the extra footage.  I assumed that they were now included in the film (even though I couldn't find them there either).  I'm going to go investigate that some more.<br />The problem I am having with my DVD is the audio.  During the part on Hogwart's Express, Hermione's voice is very much off with the movement of her mouth.  As the cd progresses, the audio seems to match itself up a bit better, but still appears &quot;off&quot;.  I haven't seen any other complaints about this, so I'm thinking maybe I just have a defective copy???  I guess I'll go exchange it tomorrow.<br />Once last note about the DVD...  I would have liked to atleast see the DVDs packaged in a clamshell case.  The cardboard case and plastic cd tray are not at all up to the standard that you would expect them to be.
0452282152|5.0|I dont know why it took me so long to come across this book because it is fabulous.  I picked it up to read and I could not put it down until I read the last page.  I love the authors easy style of writing, I love the story and I love the characters.  I cant wait to read more from Tracy Chevalier.
6302491940|4.0|My attention was turned to this movie because of the awesome Playstation game based on it. I was impressed to see that it was G-rated, when a story like this today would be made into a PG-13 or R-rated movie. It had an interesting story, and by far the best part of the movie was the hilarious car chase at the end, with the police trying to chase down three Mini Coopers making their own route through Turin, Italy. The ending is also quite funny. Even if you're not into British humour, the car chase and ending are worth watching.

0684853523|5.0|Stephen King is one of the most popular, if not the most popular of our time. And with good reason, too -- and it's not simply because his name tops the bestseller lists every time he releases a book or a whole pile of movies have been made from his work. The reason is this: he loves what he does. Writing, for him, is a way of life (as it should be for those practicing the craft).<BR> And it is this theme of \\"writing as a way of life\\" that truly shines forth in On Writing. The book has a simple layout; the first half dedicated to Stephen's success story, the second being the book's title, the half on writing. This latter section is not a how-to guide or write-like-Stephen-King manual, but instead a mere guide to both the established and aspiring writer on how to improve your writing, Stephen showing you what worked for him and then leaving it up in there to see if it works for you. And if it doesn't, that's okay too.<BR> It's about the craft, you see. On Writing shares stories from early on in Stephen's life and all the way through into the present, past his well-talked about car accident, and to where the author is in his life today.<BR> I'm not going to sit here and exalt Mr. King and tell you all how great he is (I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate that). But I will instead tell you that those engaged in the art of writing, both casually and seriously, should give this book a thumb-through, maybe even a read. On Writing is inspiring, encouraging, funny, and insightful. I proudly give it a place in my top five favorite books of all time....
B000006MS3|5.0|This is by far the best of Kate's albums.  Kate has really created a unique musical work of art with this album.  The Dreaming in my opinion is Kate's best work that she has ever done.  The music may seem daunting at first, but you come to love it and really appreciate it.  This album has a lot of unique sounds and combinations of music that are characteristic of Kate Bush.  When listening to this album you kind of get a feeling of mixed gothic and medieval chills crawling down your back.  When you come to the beautiful track of Suspendid in Gaffa it leaves you with a feeling of being stranded in the middle of the English countryside during the eighteen hundreds.  The title track of The Dreaming has you envisioning a place of gloom and gray in a world of trolls and medieval horror.  In Leave it Open Kate cleverly utilizes synthesizers to distort her voice and the vocals.  Kate Bush's voice is at its best in the beautiful Houdini where she pays tribute to the lad.  This is an all time classic and great album by Kate Bush.  England's best import into the United States.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have seen Spider-man twice now, and it was better the second time.  Seeing it first, got the point across.  The second time left room to explore the movie in detail, and left me with little to say that is negative.  Tobey, in the past, has shown artistry in his work as an actor and I am impressed by him.  And now, he has left his boyhood behind, and turned into a phenomenal young man almost overnight.  In Spider-man, he looked like he was having fun, and not over acting.  Although, some parts were a little over dramaztized, mostly on Kristin Dunst's part, the overall acting was well done.  Kristin was convincing, and Tobey's tears were almost genuine when he cried.  I was just slightly disappointed in how they portrayed Kristin's character Mary Jane as a confused, alomost childish girl, who did not know what she wanted from life.  But that is easily gotten over.  Point aside, as a Spider-man fan growing up, I was a little bothered by some of the inconsistencies in the film... webbing coming straight out of his arm?  PUH-LEEZ.  But only a true Spidey fan would be intimidated by such effects, and even so...it is fabulous creativity on the part of the film's creators.  The movie was fun, exciting... maybe a little cheesy in one or two parts... but I will be owning it as soon at it is humanly possible.  Classic quote from this film... when Aunt May says to Peter, \\"You're not Superman you know.\\"  Not a Spidey fan??  Not to worry, Tobey's smile alone makes it worth seeing.  5 stars and 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!
B00004TH6O|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I own. I'm a big fan of Kyuss and although this doesn't come close to Kyuss' briliance, QOTSA are an awesome band in their own right.<br />1. Feel Good Hit Of The Summer - 9/10 - Great song. The chorus is very addictive especially the C-C-C-C-Cocaine. I always find myself singing that.<br />2. The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret - 10/10 - Almost sounds like something out of a 60's spy film. Unbelievable song with the best chorus in the whole disc.<br />3. Leg Of Lamb - 7/10 - One of the weaker tracks on the disc. The sound isn't bad at all, but the lyrics are lacking the punch of the rest of the tracks.<br />4. Auto Pilot - 10/10 - My favorite track on the CD. Very Travis-like in its acoustic guitar work and wonderful vocals.<br />5. Better Living Through Chemistry - 10/10 - What an intro!! And the rest of the track follows smoothly, and the whole package sounds fantastic.<br />6. Monsters In The Parasol - 8/10 - Funky song with great drumming and excellent vocals especially &quot;I seen some things I thought I'd never saw&quot;<br />7. Quick And To The Pointless - 9/10 - Great rocking tune. Addictive as hell. The &quot;WHOOOO&quot; is just superb. Only problem is it ends too soon.<br />8. In The Fade - 9/10 - I find this song very relaxing because its just so laidback. The guitarwork is top-notch as usual. <br />9. Tension Head - 10/10 - One of the heavier tracks on the CD. Wonderful riff accompanied by excellent drumming. Its just an adrenaline rush.<br />10. Lightning Song - 8/10 - Instrumental track that doesn't deviate much from the sound it starts with but very nice.<br />11. I Think I Lost My Headache - 10/10 - Great ending to a great CD. Listen to it just for the fabulous vocals and riff.<br />All in all, one of the best buys for me ever personally.
B000065V1V|4.0|i cant, of course, give this album a five star rating.  not possible after listening to his earlier works, such as ziggy stardust and diamond dogs.  But i also dont want to fall into the trap of the professional reviewers and rate this album against past work.  Heathen is a fresh taste of bowie.  FInally afer twenty years of floundering and looking for a voice, david has found it.  This album is labeled as a \\"classic\\" bowie, circa 2002.  That in itself is misleading, as bowie has changed styles and genres so much, even in the seventies, that a classic album simply would not exist.  Bowie is constantly changing and evolving.  The seventies saw his greatest work, but even those albums are too different from each other to be slogged into one category.<BR>   THis album, is a return to quality bowie though.  There are some tastes of his earlier seventies work, but with a modern flair.  The vocals are more subdued than his earlier work, and the album as a whole is dark and meloncholy, but, despite what the critics say, this is not a bad thing.  Check this album out, even if you have lost faith due to \\"...hours\\" and the rest of the 80s and 90s.  This is the redefining album for bowie.  finally he has done it right once again.  welcome back, David!!!

B00003CX5P|3.0|Defintely this movie is not one that will go down in the annals of great films, in several respects.<br />But at least it's about good guys and bad guys, and the grey, middle turf that lies in between which is what everyday life is, unlike all too many movies these days. The whole vague \\"Force\\" thing is and always has been kind of strange, but I'll forgive George Lucas' philosophical and theological shortcomings because I ate alot of popcorn when I saw it on the large screen originally and was rooting for the good guys, since they always win in the end. I mean, Obi-Wan slew the diabolical-looking Lord Maul by slicing him in two with the light-saber. . .the good guys always win.<br />Anyway, I think this movie, and the second episode which is out now, AND the yet-to-be-released third one will all make more sense when they are viewed all together with the three other movies in a large box-set that Lucasfilm or Fox or whomever will most likely release before the end of this first decade of the third millenium.<br />The extras on the DVD are interesting though!
0671027344|4.0|Stephen Chbosky's, \\"The perks of being a wallflower\\", is a touching, funny, and memorable novel.  I really enjoyed reading this novel because as a teenager in highschool I can easily relate to Charlie.  Throughout the novel he faces many issues such as sexuality, drugs, and frustrations.  I like the fact that everything is very realistic and relatable.  When you read the book it feels like its you, when Charlie's sad you're sad too.  As a teenager I can easily relate to Charlie because those are situations we are faced with in our everyday lives.<BR>Besides frustrations, Charlie also has his group of friends that he has been there for and he count's on when his best friend commits suicide.  I like that friendship is very strong in the novel but I don't like that Charlie is too dependant.  I feel he should make decisions upon himself and not upon others.  When he needs to make a decision he shouldn't think of someone else but of himself and what's best for him.<BR>The ending had a little twist to it.  To me, it was unexpected.  Charlie seems like a normal teenager but then at the end he finds out he was abused by his aunt.  Like the ending, I also liked the fact that the book isn't what it seems.  By looking at the cover and reading the title you'd think that the novel is about someone who doesn't fit in but it turned out to be the total opposite.  Charlie fits in pretty well. This shows you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover!!!
B00000DHRX|5.0|How many British singers do you know have performed duets with Aretha, Mary J., Whitney, Elton, Jody Watley, and Queen? George Michael's popularity may have waned in the America in the last decade, but he still remains a multiplatinum star in the UK and continues to land Top Ten hits. This double-disc set compiles all of George's hits, including two new songs: the smoothed-out ballad \\"One Moment With You,\\" and \\"Outside,\\" which was apparently inspired by his headline-grabbing 1998 incident with the police. Disc 1 has the ballads, and disc 2 has the uptempo dance numbers. Folks should take note that this CD contains a different mix of \\"I Want Your Sex.\\" In addition, the US version does not have the dynamite duet with Mary J. Blige \\"As,\\" which can be found on the UK version. Those gripes aside, this is a pretty good collection from one of the most talented singers of the last twenty years.
0446677450|4.0|Author Robert Kiyosaki is an investor, best-seller writer and teacher for people who are eager to make money but don¡¯t know how to do it -like us.<br />At this book, he encourages us to mind our own business instead of depending on a safe secure job that might guarantee nothing anymore. Additionally, he stresses repeatedly we have to learn how to be the master of money, not the slave of money. He doesn¡¯t simply show the direct way to the wealth, but advises the various kinds of methods of mastering money.<br />Therefore, this book is, I think, quite effective to improve each person¡¯s skilled power to make money individually. Even though we don¡¯t completely agree with his opinions, at least we can figure out our status to money-slave or master-by this book. And that will give us strong motivation to develop the sense about money. That¡¯s why I recommend this book.
B00005JKBC|5.0|i love when a movie comes out that's not all bloody...action doesn't have to be bloody....Spy Game is a wild ride!
1577311523|5.0|I ordered the tape set and although Tolle's voice may seem like the most boring monotone in the world (other reviewers mention not to drive while listening) I was able to drive and stay fully present in the moment without any difficulty..........His words are the height of truth and particularly touched me when he spoke of his own depression lifting at the age of 29 when he realized that his own thoughts created his depression: they were thoughts of the past (worrying about what had happened and could not be changed) or the future (usually a fearful state for the depressed individual) that caused the problem and when he lived in the present, the deression cleared...it's living in anything but the present that prevents us from fully functioning.......it's the clearness of mind that comes from a clear, empty mind that produces brilliance, not the cluttered mind that we feel has to always active......it's a relaxed mind that can think quickly, respond when necessary and function properly when it needs to: seeing the Now and not the might be, the could-have been's or the if-onlies...........I would recommend this book to anyone.....the lessons are easy and yet require vigelance. To one accustomed to daydreaming and living in the future this take effort, but it is well worth the effort: it can be truly life changing: it has been for me..To one who lives in the past it too will take courage to bring yourself into the now, but the rewards will be a life with a lot less regrets and greater options and being more fully alive and functioning : and isn't that what we strive for........thank you Eckhatrd Tolle
B00005JKED|4.0|First of all, I highly recommend this movie.Not because of the Academy Award,but because this is a good movie! Ethan,with work like this you WILL win a best actor Oscar one year.Denzel,You acted a fool man! With a supporting cast like Tom Berenger,Dr. Dre,Snoop Dogg,Scott Glenn & Macy Gray you couldn't go wrong.In a nutshell it's about a wet behind the ears rookie (Hawke) promoted to Narc, and \\"trained\\" for 24 hours by Washington. But there's a twist:Washington is a crooked cop.I'll leave it at that.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I have always been a fan for comedy movies of the younger generation and so I thought I would rent \\"Legally Blonde\\" and watch it. After seeing the movie, I knew I had to add this movie to my collection. This is a great movie starring Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Luke Wilson, Matthew Davis, etc. <br />Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) has a good life going for her, being President of her sorority, a Hawaiian Tropic girl, and a natural blonde. She is in love with a fraternity boy , Warner ( Matthew Davis ) whom she wants to marry, but who dumps her simply because she is \\"too blonde\\". Heartbroken but angry enough, Elle decides that she will get Warner whatever it takes, even if it means joining Harvard Law School, where Warner is studying. She joins Harvard, but has a lot of twists in store for her, and must battle through them :)<br />From my point of view, this is not just another \\"teen\\" movie, but it actually gives a good moral that you should never judge a person just because of his/her looks, race etc. whatsoever. The movie tells us this moral in a very funny and cute way, which makes Legally Blonde all the more enjoyable.<br />Apart from this, there are also the Special Features the Special Edition of this dvd contains such as, deleted scenes, 2 original featurettes, 2 audio commentaries tracks with the cast and the crew, music videos, trailers and much more! <br />This is a really good movie, which is very light hearted and funny. Reese Witherspoon has done an excellent job portraying Elle Woods! Get the dvd edition today, it's worth it!
B000065U1N|5.0|Talk about action!  This movie is non-stop action from the moment it begins to the moment it ends.  As much as I love WWII genre movies, thins movie was a good break from that period of time and brought the action to a time we, as a younger gereration, can relate to.   It is a movie that gives due credit to the men who serve in our nation's special ops groups.  Its about time they were recognized.

So, this is a must have for any friends fan, so if you havent already, preoder it now ;)
B000058983|5.0|Typical of Arthur Lee's writing - the title &quot;Forever Changes&quot; may have a darker meaning than the hippie idealism you infer on first impression.  Consider this scene:<br />&quot;But you swore you'd love me forever!&quot; she sobbed.<br />&quot;Yeah, well you know how that goes,&quot; he replied unapologetically, &quot;forever changes.&quot;<br />Check out the fabulous 1967 color photograph of Arthur Lee in the current (June 2002) issue of Mojo Magazine.  The first thing you see is his innocent almost beatific smile. You get that warm fuzzy feeling all over until your eye wanders down the frame and you notice that he's giving you the finger.<br />And that's what makes this such a classic lp.  Every song is a delicious psychedelic candy-coated poison pill.<br />Arthur Lee was released from prison earlier this year and he is now on the road with his young new LOVE and giving the performances of his lifetime.  Don't miss him!
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen is one of the great masters of the English language, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is her great masterpiece, a sharp and witty comedy of manners played out in early 19th Century English society, a world in which men held virtually all the power and women were required to negotiate mine-fields of social status, respectability, wealth, love, and sex in order to marry both to their own liking and to the advantage of their family.  And such is particularly the case of the Bennetts, a family of daughters whose father's estate is entailed to a distant relative, for upon Mr. Bennett's death they will lose home, land, income, everything.  But are the Bennett daughters up to playing a winning hand in this high-stakes matrimonial game without forfeiting their own personal integrity?<br /><br />This battle of the sexes is largely seen through the eyes of second daughter Elizabeth, who possesses a razor-sharp wit and rich sense of humor--and who finds herself hindered by her own addlepated mother, her sister Jane's hopeless love for the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and her sister Lydia's penchant for scandal... not to mention the high-born, formidable, and outrageously proud Mr. Darcy, who seems determined to trump her every card.  But the game of love proves more surprising than either Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy can imagine, and sometimes a seemingly weak hand proves a winning one when all cards are on the table.<br /><br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is simply one of the funniest novels ever written, peopled with memorable characters brought vividly to life as they both succeed and fail at the game of life according to the manners of their era.  It is a novel to which I return again and again, enjoying Austen's brillant talent. I have little respect for people who describe it as dull, slow, out of date, for as long as men and women live and fall in love it will never be out of style, always be meaningful, and always be funny.  A masterpiece of wit and style; a timeless novel for the ages.
B000001FKY|5.0|this is the album that got me into rock and roll! i have enjoyed this album since i first heard &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; on MTV back in 1988. <br />while i have loved this album, it opened up my eyes to the other albums that Def Leppard made earlier in their career, Pyromania and High N Dry, which, i learned, are far better albums. I have come to learn that Hysteria leaned much more heavily towards &quot;Pop&quot; and away from the more hard rock classics of their previous two albums. while that hasnt taken anything away from their talented music, it has taken away from the pure rock that is found in their previous two albums.
B00005R2M3|4.0|When I first heard of Shakira, I was thinking she was just another cute singing blonde Brittany Spears clone. After hearing her \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" every twenty minutes on the radio, I found that it grew on me and I was willing to give \\"Laundry Service\\" a chance. I must admit, that one song did not prepare me for what I found on this album. It's actually good. This Columbian diva has a cross of hip-hop and, at times, the sound of the band No Doubt with a great vibrato and a hint of a country twang. But, what really excites me about this album is when she turns back to her roots and sings in Spanish. I was surprised by the amount of soul in her voice, but it increases when she goes back to her native language. <br />For the most part, this is a very upbeat album, with fast rhythms and quick lyrics. Although the lyrics are weak at times, she does a great job in getting the feel right. This is especially true in the Arab sounding \\"Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)\\" where the lyrics come at you in a clipped staccato with certain lines slowed down to place extra emphasis it. If No Doubt sang in Spanish, I imagine that they would sound a little like Shakira does in \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\\", or the English version \\"Objection (Tango)\\" or \\"Ready for the Good Times\\" with the wah-effect on the guitar. This is just an example of another upbeat song. The first version of \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" is good, but when she sings verses in Spanish, \\"Suerte (Whenever, Wherever)\\" becomes a great song. My favorite songs on the album are \\"Eyes Like Yours\\", \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\" and \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\". I love Shakira's voice when she hits the chorus of \\"Te Deio Madrid\\", so full of soul and feeling. If she can repeat that kind of emotion in her future music she could be very big. <br />This is a very impressive album to have as her first English releases on it. I think that Shakira is on the verge of becoming a powerful singer, and I look forward to her new releases as she continues to mature. Without a doubt she is more comfortable singing in Spanish, but that will change with the popularity of this album. I hope she remains true to her roots and continues to sing in Spanish half the time on her future English albums.
B00000I07P|5.0|This album put Bon Jovi in the international spotlight with such classics as Wanted Dead or Alive and Livin on a Prayer. This is an excellent CD.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Okay, I admit it, I got the Harry Potter film.  No kids in the family except me, my husband and a Great Dane, but that's kids enough.  Although I was rather disappointed with the film when I saw it in the theater, I decided to purchase it anyway.  For some reason, it's a better TV sized product than it was a large screen film.  Chris Columbus has directed a number of kid type movies, including Home Alone,  Mrs. Doubtfire, and Stepmom, but I think his concept of kids and family, although wacky enough, is not quite sinister enough to put the bite into the Harry Potter stories that exists in the books.  Harry deals with some pretty heavy duty facts of life, including the death--which he later discovers was murder--of his parents, the active dislike and abuse of his caretakers, the dislocation of going away to a school where he knows no one and must discover for himself whom to trust, and so on.  Although arrayed in the majesty and mystery of an ancient and occult world, Hogwarts becomes home and family to Harry.  It is, however, not a home and family free of conflict and danger, as Harry soon discovers.  Columbus follows the book closely,  almost slavishly, but little of that sense of suspense and threat seems to exist despite a lavish set and wonderful performances by all of the cast.  One almost has a feel of \\"holding back\\" on the part of the director, as though children can't handle the grit of a truly \\"scary\\" movie.  I mean, get real.  Like who went/goes to all those monster movies that have been shown at Saturday matinees for generations!  I know a six year old whose favorite film is Jurassic Park.  There were several episodes that could have scared the socks off of us, but although they were wonderful visually, they were a great disappointment as a scary experience.  Maybe it's just that ones imagination can create scarier monsters than the screen can, but I doubt it.  There's always Alien to disprove that theory!  I had heard that Steven Spielberg had requested to make the film.  I can't help but think that someone who gave us both Jaws and ET could have given us a better, more intense and more meaningful film.  The movie as it is does better on a smaller screen, however.  Maybe it's just that we've come to expect less from a made for TV movie.  As it goes, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has such a magnificent set, costuming and special effects, that it shines on the small screen which seems to be its natural home.  Perhaps that's what was planned all along.  Marketing is a powerful force.ted to make the film.

1590710037|5.0|Reading this was a personal experience for me and I'm generally a pretty private soul and typically don't do things like review books on Amazon.  Like Pressfield's propellant desire to write it, the book sucked me in, demanded I put down one of the dozen or so other books waiting on the nightstand and doggedly plow through.<br />My diligence was rewarded with an opportunity to look at the [stuff] I put in between me and my work, writing, and relationships.  There's no process here.  No 12 steps.  No journal-ing.  No techniques to learn and recall.<br />There are a lot of ways to say what Pressfield's asserted and others have written those books, too (the Artist's Way is still in that pile on my nightstand).  I could refer to it as Self-help lite, but I'm not going down a path to pigeon-hole and denirate it.<br />On my wrist I wear a bracelet that has written on it: \\"It's never to be what you might have been.\\"  Should you read this book.  Yeah, you should.  Right now I'm going to buy it for my children and then I'm going to get back to work.

B000001DVD|5.0|This is Def Leppard's BEST album by far! <br />right from the getgo to the end this has some of the best hard rock songs ever. &quot;Another Hit and Run&quot; &quot;On Through the Night&quot; and &quot;Switch 624&quot; are some of my favorites. <br />what they did in this album that they later regressed on in Hysteria is go truly hard rock. there is a passion and intensity felt in these songs. they grab you, shake you and dont let you go until you finally have to say &quot;No NO NO NO NO NO!&quot; NO-more! :)<br />It's unfortunate that this is a forgotten album as most just stick with Pyromania and Hysteria--which are great albums in their own way, but they lag behind this one in intensity, complexity and passion.
B000002KCI|5.0|Zuma is the best Neil Young album ever. If you only buy one Neil Young album, buy this one. Listen particularly to Danger Bird, and Cortez the Killer. Turn it up real loud. You'll have an experience that you won't forget, and have to repeat over and over and over. This is as good as it gets.
B000001FP8|5.0|Bon Jovi continued their excellent 80s run at rock and roll with this great offering. It has some great songs such as Bad Medicine and Born to Be My Baby, both of which show Bon Jovi's intensity and love of singing.
630542845X|5.0|We could all learn a lesson from this movie.  It touches your heart to see the compassion and love that Powder displays in this movie.  And dispite all the cruelty he faces, he still continues to show his compassion.  This movie takes the reality of our real lives and gives you a deeper sence.  We all face prejudice, cruelty and hate each day, and this movie shows that there is good out in the world, and a little love goes a long way.
B000065U1N|5.0|After watching this movie, I must say it belongs in a class of truly great war movies that include such films as Gettysburg, Tora!Tora!Tora! and Saving Private Ryan.  The gripping realism of this movie, as well as the brilliant directing and soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) make this an outstanding movie.<br />There were some flaws to the movie of course, as in Hollywood not everything can be included.  Things that I personally would have liked to have seen are the lead up to the battle (politics, why we were there...that sort of thing) and a sense of how many Somailis (sp?) were really killed.  In the actually battle estimated range from 1,000-10,000 killed but I did not get the idea from the movie that the aforementioned numbers were actually reached.<br />Where this movie truly shines though is in showing the gritty realism and unselfish heroism of common soldiers in combat.  Any person who says that the scenes of heroism and battle were &quot;souped up&quot; by Hollywood obviously is not familiar with the military and with military comradere.  What is depicted in the movie is a true to life story of how soldiers react in those situations.<br />Finally, for all those who say this was not an excellent movie, go read the book or watch the documentary on History Channel.  Then maybe you'll learn respect and admiration for the brave men portrayed in the movie.<br />Buy the DVD, read the book.
0786867973|4.0|I was unfamiliar with Nigella Lawson but thought the recipes in this book looked extraordinarily good.  I bought the book (American version) and tried making the Blackberry Galette.  While making the crust, I thought there was way too much fat and water in proportion to the flour and cornmeal called for, and sure enough, when baked the crust dissolved into mush - really quite tasty mush, though.  Knowing that the European practice is to weigh dry ingredients rather than use volumetric measure, I got on Amazon.uk.co and ordered the British version of the book.  A week later I repeated the recipe, and sure enough, the American version had underestimated the flour and cornmeal by about fifty percent, at least the way I measure dry ingredients.  This time the recipe came out as advertised.  I'm wondering if anyone actually tested the American versions of the recipes, or if they were translated directly from the British version using standard conversions.  At this point I would give the British version 5 stars, and the American version 4 stars.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is in my opinion the best comedy series ever produced..It is smartly written by Cleese and his then wife Booth, impeccably acted, and directed. Cleese excels as the neurotic repressed hotel manager, Scales as his cold and bossy wife, Booth as the trusted maid who saves the day many times over, and of course the excellent Sachs as Manuel, the Spanish waiter..Cleese refused to do a third series, and the series was terminated at its prime, which probably what makes it such a classic today.<BR>The british have over the years made top comdey series, like Blackadder, Only Fools and Horses, Some Mothers do 'ave them and Absoluetly Fabulous, but Fawlty Towers remains at the top of the bunch.Its secret lies mainly in the very smart combination of situation comedy, very well developed characters, and some slaptsick, and of course in Cleese's performance.<BR>Whether hotels like Fawlty Towers do actually exist or not, there will only be one Mr Fawlty, who will scream, jump, curse and whimper for the enjoyment of us all for years to come.
0385501560|5.0|this book totally amazed me. I got it yesterday and I'm now finished reading it today. I literally could not put it down, it kept me interested the entire time , page after page. Not once did the pace slow down and there were several instances where I laughed out loud at what I was reading. I've also read Fight Club and Survivor and so far this one was the most enjoyable for me. Although, perhaps if I had read Fight Club before watching the movie my opinion might be different. The problem with reading Fight Club after watching the movie was that I already knew the story, although the book was different, it wasn't really anything new to me. Regardless, if you have not read Choke, then what are you waiting for? Go out and buy it now, you will not be dissapointed!
B000002H2H|3.0|This album is nothing special really, dont get me wrong, I loved metallica back then, and I used to cherish this album.  However there are alot a few flaws on the record.  Lars does excellent on the drums but the double bass is up way too loud.  Just listen to fight fire with fire, Creeping Death and Call of tulu.  Kirk's guitar is good but nothing power driving or anything.  He is a very overrated guitarist anyway, dont get me wrong he is good though, but he has to realize he is no Dave Mustaine, Mustaine could outplay Hammet with his hands tied behind his back if it came to it, and keep in mind metallica fans that doesnt mean Hammet is a bad guitarist at all. I just thought it was wrong how he stole Mustaine's music, when Mustaine specifically told them not to. Watch VH1's behind the music for Megadeth for yourself.  <br />Last, where is the bass? Nowhere to be found on this record as all metallica records. There is a 30 second killer bass line on For whom the bell tolls but once the second guitar comes in, the bass is drowned out. Cliff was a really good bassist too, too bad his work never shined like legendary bassists such as Steve Harris and Geezer Butler. <br />And yes metallica fans there is no good bass required on this album, sorry.  If there is then someone write a review and tell me where it is other then track three.  Also its too bad this band became sell outs as well, but if your a fan of thrash metal then get this album.  However these flaws are minor and may not matter to alot of people, but I think it is an overrated metallica album, the band is overrated now period anyway.  Well im sure my review will be hated and criticized but at least I shared some proof on why there were these little flaws, instead of just having to think this album is godly. Please!!! This album couldnt touch Maiden's Powerslave or Dio's Last in Line which came out the same year. Metallica cant stand a chance against maiden or dio talent wise, Lyric wise, or production wise,and thats a fact. Of course both of these bands were some of metallica's main influences anyway. Still it was a good effort, but an overrated 80's metallica album and definitely not their best.  Still worth adding to your collection.
B000002I25|5.0|While I personally prefer their second LP to this one, there is certainly no shortage of fantastic music on this 1967 release. The great thing about the Doors is that they treated regular pop songs like classical and jazz compositions, therefore expanding the parameters of modern rock. No matter how many times you hear &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, the five minute instrumental break that takes up the bulk of the song is astounding in it's complexity, the great instrumental interplay and the flawless way it circles back around to the opening organ loop that begins the song, it never fails to leave me breathless. &quot;The End&quot; is still one of the most challenging, scary and beautiful pieces the band ever produced. Over a jazzy, trance-like, dreamy musical backdrop, Jim Morrison recites his disturbing poetry in a calm, soothing voice that lulls the listener but doesn't dull the impact of his message. None of this would matter were it nor for the real stars of this group, the band. The astounding work of Ray Manzarek, John Densmore and Robby Krieger makes this album indelible and a real classic to true music lovers, they are a band without peer. &quot;The Doors&quot; still sounds fresh after 35 years.<br />It's a perennial favorite in my collection.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I truly love thought-provoking movies which tell stories in an unusual style.  Some of my favorite movies entail plots presented out of sequence and part of my pleasure comes from piecing it all together.  Having said that, after one viewing, I was extremely disappointed with this film.  Although Naomi Watts delivered a mind boggling performance, Lynch's disconnected storytelling left too many unfilled holes.  <br />There were obviously times where the film moved back and forth from reality to fantasy (duh) but what's the point.  The film started out strong and immediately pulled me into the seedy Los Angeles movieworld.  What disturbed me most were the various subplots and additional characters that never went anywhere.  Its as if Lynch shot some scenes from completely unrelated scripts and incorporated them into an otherwise interesting story.  As an avid moviegoer and lover of the medium, it annoys me when these filmmakers create products which claim to have artistic value when in reality, they themselves have no clue what they are doing.  This movie provides viewers with shock value purely for the sake of shock.  I have never felt so unsatisfied when the final credits rolled in my life.   <br />I know this movie has gotten a lot of attention and I truly hope that other filmmakers do not follow with similarly annoying and disconnected projects which may or may not have some deep underlying message.  If that is the case then I should grab my camera and shoot some random scenes together and try to get someone to distribute my film.  ... I personally think that filmmakers like Lynch like to throw things our there into the public just to see how many different ... interpretations people can come up with, when in reality he knows he is just messing with us.  I end my review by saying this:  if you want to be thoroughly annoyed and unsatisfied then you should watch this movie.  If you want to see some hot lesbian scenes then you should rent this movie ...  And finally,who knows, maybe I will feel differently after watching it three more times.  But you know what, I shouldn't have to.  A truly excellent film need only be viewed once.
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman's AMERICAN GODS is simultaneously an epic, a treatise on religion, a road trip story, a coin trick instruction manual, a murder mystery, a war novel, a tale of self actualization, and a love story.  At any given point in GODS, there are six or seven different plots occurring -- but Gaiman juggles them admirably and never lets anything drop.<br />In Gaiman's previous works, GOOD OMENS (with Terry Pratchett), STARDUST, and NEVERWHERE, the reader knew exactly in which genre the book belonged.  GOOD OMENS was an apocolyptic comedy, STARDUST was a fantasy/love story, and NEVERWHERE was a dark fantasy thriller.  AMERICAN GODS is the first of Gaiman's novels in which the cliches of the genre are meaningless -- because AMERICAN GODS transcends the genres it encompasses.  This makes for a novel of stunning scope, and Gaiman's talent makes for a story of magnificent depth.<br />Our hero is Shadow, a man of indeterminate ethnic origin.  He's big, and he can hold his own in a fight, but he'd rather not.  His favorite book is Herodotus' HISTORIES.  His life story is unfolded for us little by little, and we delight in every new revelation, because Shadow is truly our hero.<br />The novel's structure is a bit like THE GRAPES OF WRATH, in that about every other chapter is not about the hero at all, but about a different storyline altogether.  I admit that initially this structure irritated me, but then I realized that these \\"mini-plots\\" were just as fascinating as the \\"big plot.\\"<br />Although one reviewer complained of the \\"predictable\\" plot twists, in my mind there was nothing predictable about GODS.  I found myself actually cringing with fear at some points because of what was happening to the hero -- and I had never suspected it.<br />The host of supporting characters is simply awesome.  From the most ordinary human being, the chief of Lakeside Police, to the most fun god, Mr. Nancy, Gaiman describes each new person or god just enough to let us know who s/he is, then plunges onward.  The result is perhaps the largest cast of characters I can remember reading about, and yet the reader is satisfied with each and every character.<br />One warning before you pick up this book: it is not a happy book.  For those who are familiar with Gaiman's work, this revelation is no surprise.  But for those who want just another summer reading book . . . death and disappointment abound in GODS.  The murder mystery is solved (and solved well), but it leaves the reader with a bad feeling in the pit of her stomach.  Shadow learns a lot about himself, but a lot of it is bad news.  Some wonderful, seemingly good characters are (like Hunter in NEVERWHERE) actually very, very bad.  Shadow never seems to catch a break in his personal life, either.  These aren't drawbacks, mind you, but things to consider before starting the very, very *long,* addictive read.<br />I feel as though I have not done the book justice with my rambling review.  So here's my final statement: AMERICAN GODS is truly one of the finest novels I have ever read.  If you have the time to invest, I strongly urge you to purchase AMERICAN GODS.  You won't regret it.n plunges onward.

B000065U1N|5.0|I received an email from the man who happened to be &quot;Super 65&quot; the blackhawk flying in trace of Durant (&quot;Super 64&quot;) on that mission.  In a nutshell, he said the movie was &quot;right on the money&quot; in terms of actual events.  I'm guided not by the opinions of artsy-fartsy &quot;filme&quot; critics or the general public, but of those soldier who FOUGHT THE BATTLE.  THEY say it was on the money.  That's good enough for me.
078062565X|1.0|I really like classic movies from the 30's 40's etc but I personally found this movie to be incredibly bad with overacting and corny dialogue! The most over-rated B Movie ever!
B00003CXI1|1.0|This movie is definitly not worth the time of teens and above. The computer graphics aren't very good and the movie doesn't stay to the five-star book's story line. I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and by watching the movie it completely ruined the book for me. The movie seemed to try to cram too many chapters into a too short movie (even though the movie was deathly long it seemed). The actor that plays Harry Potter [is bad] at acting while the makers of the movie didn't even bother to follow the features (Black hair, green eyes) that the Harry Potter in the book had. The movie is definitly not well made and if you haven't seen either yet you should definitly only read the book if you are 12 years old or older.
006092988X|5.0|I got this book off a reading list and put it on my own for the summer.  This book is amazing.  You feel as if you are a child in New York.  Smith describes so well the life of a poor family scraping by in turn of the century Brooklyn.  How much things were changing and things needed to get by in the world, not as much as we would like to think.  <br />I so enjoyed reading about Frnacie's life, I didn't want the book to end, and that generally means a good story.
0679746048|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. This book really gets you thinking. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychology, otherwise you may be bored with it.
B00000255X|5.0|The only \\"hit\\" on this album is track #1, the famous ballad \\"Hurricane\\" about unjustly jailed boxer Rubin Carter. But there is much more to this album. \\"Isis\\" is a great spirtual love song. \\"Mozambique\\" is an ironically uplifting little ditty with catchy verses, yet it is about a nation torn with strife and unrest. \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" is one of Dylan's greatest vocal performances ever. He is right on target with his vocal bends up and down at the end of each line. The song itself is an absoutely transfixing, mythical piece of poetry. \\"Oh Sister\\" is a touching dedication. \\"Black Diamond Bay\\" breaks from the albums norm, speeding along with one-liner after another. \\"Sara\\" is certainly Dylan's most sad work. It is named for his wife, although they both know it's over between them. The song seems to be simultanoeusly asking her to stay with him (\\"Don't ever leave me, don't ever go\\" is Dylan's haunting last line) and acknowledging that their relationship is over. <br />A few tracks are less than adequate. \\"Romance in Durango\\" has a nice Latin flavor to it, but becomes quite annoying. However it is a great song, it just sounds better elswhere (Biograph, Live 1975).  \\"Joey\\" is a sympathetic look at a New York gangster (which in itself may turn some off from it) by my only complaints are the nagging chorus and the sheer length of it. At over 10 minutes, we could deal without the last oh, 3 or 4 verses. \\"Hurricane,\\" by comparison, is 8 minutes long but never grows tiresome. \\"Black Diamond Bay\\" and \\"Oh Sister\\" are decent tracks with some merit to them, but not Dylan classics by any means. <br />Still, this album has PLENTY for me to recomend it. Never have I heard any rock artist incorporate violins into their music so successfully. Combine the strings with the pitches of backup singer Emmylou Harris, and the result is at times haunting, at times touching, at times magical. In additon to the famous \\"Hurricane,\\" the lesser known tracks \\"Isis\\" \\"Mozambique\\" \\"One More Cup ofCoffee\\" and \\"Sara\\" are some of Dylan's greatest work. That should warrant a listen from all those considering this album.<br />My Rating = 4 1/2 stars<br />which translates to 5 stars on Amazon.com
B00000739S|4.0|Although it may be unexpected in light of their respective cover photos, this CD contains the remainder of the performance of Lou Reed and his backers partly captured on the classic live album Rock 'N Roll Animal.  The songs here are not as strong, but Lou delivers the soft majesty of \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" and a power-crunch glam \\"I'm Waiting for the Man,\\" which is my favorite live version.  Lou's guitar edge and fluidity are also displayed on the other Transformer entries and the two lengthy cuts from his dark Berlin album.  Like its Berlin counterpart \\"Lady Day\\" on Rock 'N Roll Animal, \\"Sad Song\\" has great atmosphere and resonance.  It is nice to hear Lou live with professional sound quality, after not having been able to experience this with the Velvet Underground live recordings.
B0000024SI|5.0|Theres not a bad track to be found here.  The opener is arguably Dylan's best song ever, the famous goodbye to a past lover \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\"  \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" is one of Dylan's most mysterious tunes.  Is it about a confused married man walking into a gay bar and...actually enjoying himself?  Listen to the lyrics and decide for yourself.  The closer is the 11 minute \\"Desolation Row.\\"  Is it desperately hopeful or hopelessly desperate?  I think only Dylan knows for sure.  But behind these mega-ballads, the real strength of this album in my opinion is the sleeper tracks you have never heard before.  Some of these are the rockin' \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" the oddly titled \\"It Takes Alot to Laugh, it Takes a Train to Cry,\\" \\"Queen Jane Approximately,\\" and my personal favorite, the melodic \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues.\\"  Dylan has never been more consistent, although he will be equally solid years later in \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" and MANY years later with \\"Love and Theft.\\"
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is an intelligent, sly, witty computer-animated film. The animation is top of the line yet still life-like. The film pokes fun at fairy tale cartoons and has a sense of humour that adults will appeal to as well as children. It isn't your typical family film but it's an excellent original one. I did not expect much when I was started to watch it, but I was pleasantly surprised. Hopefully, you will too.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I rented this DVD and couldn't get over how much there was to this movie.  Unfortunately there were several scenes that were cut from this movie that might help one understand it, but thanks to an incredible array of delicious extras all can be made clear. ...
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Leonard played by Guy Pearce is after John G., the man who killed his wife and took away his short term memory. He can't make new memories, everything just fades. He can remember everything that happened up to the \\"incident\\" and the \\"incident\\" is what consumes and motivates his life everyday. The movie starts with Leonard killing Teddy, rightfully played by Joe Pantoliano. The movie laid out in reverse to see not why Lenny killed Teddy but what led Lenny to kill him. The reversal of the chronology is effective in making viewers feel as if they also have no short term memory. The movie is strengthened by another supporting performance: Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie. In a way \\"Memento\\" is similar to \\"The Sixth Sense\\": After you've watched it the first time, you can go back the second and third time and notice things you didn't see before. Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|3.0|She writes, plays and sings her own music - and this is a very good thing.  However, please do not follow the mistaken assumption that this is counter-culture art or anything like it.  It is highly produced and marketed like much other music.  If you are interested in pushing some limits, PJ Harvey or Stereolab or LeTigre come to mind.  All that said, we like what we like and that's ok, to. Best of luck to Avril and my hopes that she can remain sincere.
B000065U1N|5.0|What others don't understand about this movie who are ripping it for not having character development is that it was based off of a book by Mark Bowden that was completely fact based.  Black Hawk Down is not another one of those Titanic or Pearl Harbor chick flicks that claims to be based on facts but uses up 1 1/2 hours of a 2 hour movie to tell a love story, it comes right out with the cold hard facts and tells it like it is.  I would clasify Black Hawk Down as more of a documentary because it stays so true to history.  That is what I love about it, it's not trying to add in love stories and cheesy humor for the People and Entertainment Weekly readers out there.  This movie is more for the historians out there and not so much for the E Entertainment Television viewers.  <br />It tells the story of a raid in 1993 to try to capture Mohamed Farrah Aided in the Bakara market place in Mogadishu, Somalia.  When this raid goes wrong US soldiers are trapped with a whole city of angry Somali's armed and ready to kill.  It is one of the most intense movies I think I've ever seen, two hours of non-stop intensity that only ends with a dozen or so soldiers having to run their way out of the city and back to a UN controlled safe point.  This is the battle that we saw the aftermath of when we woke up the next day to Somali's dragging half naked dead US soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu.  To pay respect to the men who served in this conflict and to those who paid the ultimate price I think Ridley Scott et al did the right thing by staying true to the facts and making this movie historically acurate.  For all those that want to see a war movie that does it right, that puts you in the middle of the action and doesn't stray from the facts, then Black Hawk Down is a must see.  For all those that want to see Josh Hartnett in another Pearl Harbor role, go see something else because this movie will disappoint.
B00005RY7X|5.0|this album is definitely worth buying. i bought it last week after seeing andrew in concert and the cd lives up to his live show.  its really energetic and its not that hollow...stuff like a lot of the nu metal thats been floating around lately.this stuff has real soul to it, and the piano part and andrew's voice set this record apart
B00005JKCF|1.0|Sam Raimi has made a subtly acted mainstream movie with 'The Gift', but unwisely returns to the style of 'Darkman' for this belated comic book adaption, presumably because he felt it worked a treat the first time. Arguably, it didn't, the stylised affectations failing to engage on that occasion, either. Perhaps it's too hard to translate the 'realism' of the 'Spiderman' strip to celluloid, and Raimi doesn't try. Also, it's too old a strip to successfully incorporate the anochronistic aspects within a contemporary setting. The film also suffers from the use of too much shorthand in attempting to cover ground in Mr Parker's eventful life, making us lose interest in the second half. The audience in the late show I saw frankly giggled through the cack-handed love scenes. Parker ultimately managed to juggle a private life with heroism in the strip, thus making his vow of celebacy in the feature perplexing to the viewer. The original's charm and intrigue came from it's campus setting and if not for 'Buffy', which covers similar ground, it might have worked better as a series. Certainly, the first two 'Superman' films handled this sort of material with more wit and aplomb. As it stands, the film has trouble competing against modern fare such as 'The Matrix'. Perhaps sensing this, the producers introduce some unnecessarily graphic violence into the proceedings. This is inappropriate in my view, not to mention emetic as the film so closely resembles 'Inspector Gadget' in it's childishness. A poor commercial decision too, as much of it's target audience are now excluded from viewing 'Spiderman' in the UK. The comic strip conformed to a voluntary comics code and was never that violent, if memory serves, thus adding to one's cynicism.<BR>Another aspect that disappoints is the lack of widescreen presentation. Surely, this picture was crying out for panoramic vistas of the city. I felt short changed, as I always do when confronted with this restricted aspect.<BR>I have to say this is a minority view, as the public and critics have largely embraced Raimi's approach to the material.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|Her show is stunning, but I would have liked a little more variety in the song selection.
B00000ILDE|5.0|It's a true curse to always want things to work out when watching the \\"art\\" of film...imagine the disappointments! And then they ask you to suspend reason because it's \\"entertainment\\" e.g. (slasher wipes out young jocks, bested by frail femme).  <br />So, imagine if you will, how much of a pleasure this sequel to ALIEN was..It was actually the last film I ever paid to see at the theater more than once.  It's truly that good, one of the best action films ever made.<br />The plot - everyone should know it by now, (but one more time for the cheap seats) Ripley, lost in space, after the near wipe-out on the Nostr-whatever(where the heck do these names come from) is rescued by a salvage ship...a mere 57 years later.  Bummer for her, and let's suspend the reality starting now, no alien contacts since.<br />The Company (rather BIG Brother name there) blow off her fantastic story (I suppose all of Ash's entries aren't in the recovered logs) and yank her license, off you go, to the docks.<br />And while Ripley tries to cope with life, her nightmares of impregnation drive her to agree to accompany Burke, Company man, and a squad of Colonial Marines back to -(guess where).<br />And that's where this movie kicks off.  What follows, anyway you care to view it, broke new ground in effects, writing, action scenes..you name it.  Imagine if you will, the stubborn Texicans attacking the Mexican Army at the Alamo..They may have had heart, but the Marines soon (very soon) find they are no match for the Aliens.  Down to a quickly dwindling group of survivors, the film never lets up in suspense or action. (I'll leave the character development and sub-plots to those better suited to flesh them out, but rest assured, they are superb on many levels.)<br />What makes a film classic..in whatever genre, (in my opinion) is does it still stand up as watchable today? <BR>ALIENS does..in every category.  Cameron made a masterpiece (hey, I don't know the guy) in a series that was deep-sixed in Aliens3.  Jeez, what a kiss off.  I don't know if I will ever buy the DVD series (I have the VHS tape practically memorized)<BR>but any collection SHOULD HAVE THIS MOVIE> A Classic!

Even though it was written so long ago and I expected it to be hard to read, this story really touched my heart.  If you have always wanted to read this book, you should do it!!!  I put off reading it for so long and I was so glad when I finally read it.  The themes of family and love abound and will really move you.  Read it!!!!!

B000002L68|5.0|What startles me most about Mr. Nelson is his capacity for creativity.  And at the exact same time I'm in for the long ride.  Someone said to me that Prince is another Bob Dylan, not all of his music will be consistent hits but he is creating a canvas of creation, not only commercial success.  I remmeber seeing Purple Rain as a child and being fascinated with this odd man who was so completely himself or of his own creation.  I had a friend who couldn't tell from his first albums if he were a man or a woman at first---much like Tracy Chapman.<BR>I am not a Prince fan, he specifically said that fan is short for fanatic, he instead calls those of us who buy what he puts out \\"friends\\".<BR>I have at least 20-25 Prince CDs in my collection and still another dozen or so new tracks, foreign tracks to find on Ebay and so on.  He creates such a breadth of work that Amazon.com literally is not big enough to keep all of his work.<br />Purple Rain.<br />A meditation on God.  Its all about God.<br />Warner Bros. wouldn't let him use the world Devil in Lets Go Crazy so he used \\"when the leevator brings you down\\"----I survived because of that song, the whole WTC thing.  That song kept me going.<br />I Would Die 4 U----he's talking about Jesus, folks.  he whole repitition of I would die 4 u, the simplicity and the power of it just cuts to the heart of God, sex, drama.  And no you can't have a little Prince without the element of sex.  I think his work gets lost to the projection of it.  Ok, his Moon is in Scorpio and yes, he has said some of the wildest lines I have ever heard in music.  But he's also SAYING something.<BR>There are a couple of books on him, mainly homages from what the reviews and quick glances say.  I have often wondered what I would create if I stayed up 24 hours with Prince playing on repeat and random and I just typed away for hours.  Janet Jackson's music got me to create a book and a dozen short stories that got published.<br />Is Purple Rain my fave Prince CD.<br />They are all my fave.<BR>The up years when everyone was all over him and even now when he's a corporate pariah and literally owns himself.  I hang in there, I buy each Cd faithfully as if I'll hear him every night I go to a club.  Because the really good DJ's throw him in.<br />He plays 28 instruments---by ear, no lessons, just by musical affinity/genius.  Can you imagine that many sounds in your head wanting OUT?  <br />I would die 4 u, the best hymn/erotic song, definitely in my top ten.<BR>Let's Go Crazy, another classic with deep undertones if you listen to the words.<BR>He writes stories, fables, vignettes.  Not just a beat and a hook line.  I rarely listen to \\"new\\" music, disappointed by the lack of inspiration.  Beautiful Ones?  Wow.  My lilieu is writing, it always will be and even if I work hard at a dozen other creative forms I suppose it will always be my strongest with reading its active companion.<BR>Prince is to me in music as Toni Morrison is to me in writing.  In fact they were the first subjects I ever wrote about to be published.  They are the few must haves on my shopping list and teh perennial faves to repeat (including Janet).  His later collaborations with Patti LaBelle I think produced some of her strongest work next to LaBelle and the other hits she had.  Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, Carole King, Billie Holiday, Biggie Smalls, Ice-T, there are a few really, really huge folks who embody art and power in their work.  Its almost a shame that one has to have all of this commercial drama around it to be a success.  Prince is right, music should be free.  I wonder what it would do if we paid on donation for music to the music industry, how tough or easy it would be to get to superstar status.  Say you got the CD for free and then you could drop them some money on PayPal if you liked it?<BR>That would change EVERYTHING!  Why do you think Warner bros. worked so hard to keep Prince's masters and to dissuade other companies to work withhim?  When you wonder why some really great folks best days are behind them, its the whole business end, it suffocates creativity.<BR>Luckily, Prince Rogers Nelson knows of the Curtis Mayfields, the James Browns, the Harold Melvilles that created when there wasn't a billion dollars at the end of the road.  I think Im gonna get some good drinks, finger food, 24 hours and put all my Prince in and see what his music brings out of me in wordsssssssssss.  Omni
0312243022|3.0|The Hours, by Michael Cunningham, is an interesting story written in the style of Virginia Woolf. Anyone that admires Woolf's work, especially Mrs. Dalloway, will be able to appreciate Cunningham's extensive research into her life and Mrs. Dalloway. Cunningham adroitly employs Woolf's voice in the three parallel stories that constitute the book, and he skillfully adds her symbols to his own characters' lives in ways that recall Woolf but manage to keep his own distinct personality.<BR> Each of the individual three stories is meant to reverberate in the other two: one follows Woolf's own difficulty with severe depression during the creation of Mrs. Dalloway; the second surrounds a modern day Clarissa Dalloway as she prepares a party for her homosexual poet-friend with AIDS; the last looks a Laura Brown, a homemaker in 1950's suburban California who internalizes the imagery in Mrs. Dalloway as a way to escape her dissatisfaction with her family life.<BR> Clarissa's narrative is the dominant of the three. As we trail her through New York City while she finalizes all the last-minute touches for her party, any reader who is remotely familiar with Mrs. Dalloway will be able to see the obvious references to the book. Although Cunningham has nailed the tone of Woolf's style and has a sound interpretation of Mrs. Dalloway, this part of the story ultimately feels too contrived, as if Cunningham has willingly sacrificed his own style in order to adopt Woolf's. It is also strange to apply Woolf's themes of social class and disillusionment to today's world of homosexuality, celebrity and sickness. The differences in the themes are so great that they cannot be combined in any satisfying manner. In other words, it is nearly impossible to translate Mrs. Dalloway into a present-day environment due to the nature of its ideas. Consequently, this narrative proves to be the driest of the three. <BR> The narrative involving Woolf herself is more engaging simply because it involves more creativity on Cunningham's part, as there is no model to base Woolf's inner monologue on. The fact that the narrative begins at the end of Woolf's life makes it that much more interesting to slowly piece together the events that brought her to the bank of the final river. Cunningham excels at probing his characters' minds, and Woolf proves to be a prime subject thanks to her well-known cerebral disposition.<BR>  The least explored of the three storylines is that of Laura Brown. Sadly, this is the story I would have preferred to be the most fully developed. Because Laura is solely Cunningham's invention, she retains much of his own voice and is the only truly original creation in the entire book. Laura's own idolatry of Mrs. Dalloway enhances Cunningham's subtle usage of symbolism, therefore discreetly joining his own writing to Woolf's. Cunningham's Clarissa is too much a part of Woolf to be novel to the reader; Laura provides a fresh breath as she comes to grips with her own insufficiencies as a wife and mother. By taking Woolf's themes but leaving the characters behind, Cunningham succeeds in producing something unique that still manages to take root in Woolf. Unfortunately, Laura's life is quickly and insufficiently pulled together at the end of the book and leaves some large gaps unbridged.<BR> Altogether, The Hours is a great tribute to Virginia Woolf. However, the book is not flawless, and those that aren't too knowledgeable about Mrs. Dalloway might miss some of the key structural and symbolic messages in the stories. Yet despite this, readers seeking a new approach to a classic will not be disappointed. Overall, Woolf would be proud.
B000002KKS|3.0|OK, I don't know exactly what would possess people to think otherwise, but Never Say Die (the album before Heaven & Hell) is complete crap.  Only the title track is worth listening to.  With that said, Heaven & Hell is a huge step up.  For starters, this album unleashes Ronnie James Dio on the world, who, regardless of what you may have heard, is light years ahead of Ozzy Osbourne as far as singing ability goes.  Ozzy's voice very much fit the mood of the early Black Sabbath albums, but as the later albums strayed from the darker edge, Ozzy's shortcomings as a vocalist became more and more evident.  While not a bad singer by any means, he just isn't as good as Dio, period.  But Dio can't save all of the songs on this album.  \\"Neon Nights\\" is fabulous and really showcases Tony Iommi's monstrous riffing and Dio's powerful voice, but the best song on the whole album is the title track.  It's perfect in every way, and Black Sabbath's last true classic song.  It has a catchy bass line, Dio's signature power vocals, and easily Tony Iommi's best riff since \\"Supernaut\\" (check out Vol. 4, you'll be glad you did).  \\"Children of the Sea\\" and \\"Die Young\\" are worth checking out as well, but other than that, none of the songs are really memorable.  All-in-all, Heaven & Hell is a pretty good album, but not quite in the same league as Paranoid or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, but let me tell you, the song Heaven & Hell is just unbelievable.  If nothing else, buy this album just for the title track.  You'll be glad you did.
B00005M91K|3.0|If \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" (which \\"Baraka\\" director Ron Fricke edited) had never been made, this film would deserve great attention. But Fricke re-uses so many of the memorable images from \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" and so artlessly rehashes its style that one wonders whether lawyers were ever involved. The producers, interviewed in a behind-the-scenes documentary, also seem oddly dispirited. The poor DVD transfer -- obviously from an analog source and abounding with artifacts and interlace flicker -- reinforces one's disappointment. They even missed a great opportunity to provide alternative audio tracks or captions with descriptions of what we're seeing.<br />This film deserves three stars nonetheless for stunning photography and the new wonders it does show us. One can't help thinking that even the fanciest digital artifice still can't compare to accomplished cinematogaphy of the real beauty of the world.
0385503954|5.0|Briony Tallis, 13, has written a play in honor of her idolized older brother's homecoming.  It is 1935, the hottest day of summer in a charming country property in England.  Briony has rather arbitrarily assigned parts to her young cousins who will be arriving shortly.  Briony, of course, has the lead.  Older sister Cecilia is readying the house for the party, as the mother as usual is indisposed.  Robbie, the brilliant son of the housemaid, is also returning from University, his education financed by Mr. Tallis.  The stage is set for Briony to put in motion terrible events that will change the lives of every person in this halcyon setting.<br />\\"Atonement\\" is written in four books, The Crime, The War, The Atonement, and The 1999 Reunion.  Mr. McEwen's prose is a delight: languorous, taut, whatever the situation calls for.  The dialogue is crisp and rings true for all characters.  The complete change of pace when we follow Robbie through the fall of Dunkirk is breathtaking.  It is that most excruciating military situation:  the command has broken down; all are on their own.  The Atonement itself has the hard clarity of cold winter sunlight on a city street.  The author has more to tell than the story at hand; he speaks of writing and the duties of authors to their readers, all without ever wandering away from the storyline.<br />I cannot wait to read \\"Amsterdam,\\" Mr. McEwen's earlier novel.  His writing is magical.  - And, oh yes, \\"Atonement\\" has a twist at the end that will shock and upset you for days.  Do yourself a favor, and read it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The Phantom Menace.  Was it really that bad?  Many of the people who have seen this film do not give it credit where credit is due.  In this writer's case, I thought it to be just as good as the original trilogy.  Now, before all of you disbelievers groan and stop reading, here's why.  The reasoning behind many of TPM's criticism lies in it's target demographic.  Some people thought it was just too &quot;kiddy&quot;.  Well, in a way it was.  It was made in a way to reflect the times of prosperity, and to reflect the age of Anakin.  For all of you who have seen AOTC (are there any who haven't?), you know that it much, much darker and more mature.  Why?  Because Anakin is older, and more mature.  During war, happiness is almost non-exsistent, as displayed by Episode II.  In Episode I, the Republic is prospering as it never has before.  Therefore, times are happy and enjoyed by all creating the so-called &quot;kiddiness&quot; (if that's a word).  The plot was superb, the acting was excellent, and the action scenes were some of the best of the five movies.  Out of 10, I give it a 9.9.  The only reason I took 0.1 off, was the scene where Anakin flies the starfighter.  That was rather hokey, but it makes sense since he is so strong in the force and is, don't forget, the chosen one.  If you Anti-Phantoms out there still aren't satisfied (which you &quot;people&quot; probably are not), the Phantom Menace is A TON better once you see AOTC.  It explains and fufills the things that the monsters that didn't like TPM didn't like, for example, Jar-Jar.  Ah, Jar-Jar.  Many see him as the annoying one.  He was annoying.  But he was meant to be.  It has a reason and a purpose.  It shows his intelligence is not very high.  This plays prominantly in the Star Wars Saga, as you can see in AOTC, Jar-Jar's gullibility and stupidity convince him to start a vote giving Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers, starting his gradual transformation to the emporer.  So, in a way, it is because ofJar-Jar that the galaxy has to face the tyranny of the Empire.  As I come to a close, you can send me hateful e-mails, you can look down on me, and insult my level of maturity, I won't care.  I thought The Phantome Menace had the original flair the the original trilogy had and even pushed the envelope in places the Original Trilogy hadn't yet touched.  Accept it or not, this great prequel has taken us to the next level of film making.  Keep up the good work George.
B000065U1N|3.0|I did not explore any of the DVD aside from the feature, so my review is limited to only the film itself.<br />The film was entertaining in that it kept me interested in the flow of action. It was neat to see an interpretation of modern battle strategies and the soldiers that carried them out. The film also gave me a good feeling of place: where the soldiers were fighting and the conditions they found themselves in. What keeps me from viewing the film as a great one rests in two major criticisms. First, I objected to how the filmmakers inserted \\"humanist\\" scenes into the work. These bits of conversation and exchanges between various soldiers were meant to show a personal side to the combatants, that they all had families and histories and desires, etc. Moreover, these scenes were meant to get me emotionally involved in the film. But by using these episodes in sporadic and what seemed off-handed moments, and by being very shallow interchanges then, I felt as if the filmmakers were trying to illicit a response from me that they had not sufficiently paid for. My second major criticism is that the filmmakers did not supply an adequate context for the story. I can sympathize with trying to show a story from beginning to end, a finite piece of reality, and this can and is done regularly in story-telling. But in the case of the events shown in \\"Black Hawk Down\\", anyone with even a minor sense of international politics can realize that an entire angle was absent from the film. There was some off-handed remarks about the US mission in Somalia, but the pressures that found the US there, the impossibility of their overall mission and the resultant shift in US foreign policy in the aftermath of the what happend in Mogadishu, were completly left out of the film. Given, the story is one of warfare; however and of course, war does not exist in a vacuum. If the goal of the filmmakers was to entertain, then they did a satisfactory job, but if they were trying to create a testimonialto the soldiers who fought that day, then they do them an injustice by not further explaining the political and historical context in which they fought.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It is the best movie, truly.  I have seen it five times and i am still kicking myself for not seeing it on the big screen.  There is something for everyone, even my eight yr old brother liked it.  Plus after you watch the DVD and become a fan there is really interesting background info.  The only other thing i could have hoped for was more Ewan stuff.  But you can't have EVERYTHING.
B000050FEN|5.0|One has only to look at the one-star reviews to see the impact Se7en has... the reviews don't trash the movie, rather they attempt to grapple with just how strong the psychological impact of the film (not so much a visceral horror film as only one murder is actually shown on-screen, Se7en derives much of its power from look and feel of the film... which is oppressive to say the least) had on them at the time of viewing.  Obviously, it's a film that sticks with you long after the credits have crawled across the screen.  With more decay than a David Lynch film, Se7en has a hopeless, downward spiral feel to it... much has been made of the \\"inevitable\\" ending for instance, but it's apparent from the opening credit sequence (a true stunner... and a film unto itself, complete with a twisted version of Nine Inch Nail's \\"Closer (to God)\\" played over the visuals like the chimes from Satan's ice cream truck) right to the end sequence in startling sunlight that David Fincher intended the film to be bereft of even the faintest glimmer of hope... and for that he ought to be commended, for though it may seem easy to do, it really is difficult to make an unsympathetic film viewable after more than one time (case in point: the equally disturbing, highly visceral, and nearly unwatchable \\"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer... which is actually compelling enough to ensure one sit-through, but unfriendly enough to avoid repeated viewings).  The DVD is excellent beyond measure (unless you set the bar for extras and DVD quality at the Criterion \\"Brazil\\" set... then it's only pretty damn good).  The extras are worthy enough to sit through a few times, and the look of the DVD version of the movie is excellent, as is the sound.  Although popular and pop enough to share the shelf with crap like \\"Armageddon,\\" Se7en is also at home on the same shelf as any Lynch, Gilliam or Greenaway film... it's that good -- narratively, stylistically, and aesthetically an amazing film.  Though not a happy popcorn-movie, it's an absolute must have if you love American filmmaking at its finest.
B000002AH1|5.0|A mind blower from start to finish. A must-have for Miles fans. Funky, intense, and endlessly creative. Incredible players all over this one. Extended improvisations like only Miles could orchestrate. Keith Jarrett fans, take note: If you haven't heard this recording, there's another side of KJ you know nothing about.
0385505833|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it was very comical. I loved how the characters in the book had figured that since their only daughter had left home that they would not celebrate Christmas, and go on a cruise instead. I didn't care for how annoying their neighbors were by trying to make them participate in the neighborhood decorating committee that takes place every year, but in spite of everything when their daughter decides to go home for Christmas and bring her fiance with her, then the neighbors all pitch in to help them put everything together for her return. I really enjoyed it and would recommended that everyone read this one.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone represents one of those rare occasions where a much-hyped all star cast actually puts out a spectacular film.  <br />George P. Cosmotos' vision comes across as very honest and passionate reproduction of the old west.  The camera work is expert, utilizing extreme close ups and dramatic angles...all appropriately placed.<br />The real treat here is the acting...particularly by Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer.  This is undoubtedly a prime moment for both actors.  Russel's Wyatt Earp is a brave, tough and unflinching former law man.  Kilmer's Doc Holliday is a famous con man who's heart is in the right place.  Kilmer plays Holliday as a smart-mouthed, smooth talking, chronically sweating addict.  His performance is nothing short of perfect.  Supporting players Powers Booth, Bill Paxton, and particularly Sam Elliot are right on their games as well.<br />Not only is this one of the best westerns of the 90s, but one of the best films of the 90s, shamefully overlooked by the masses.  More people need exposure to great films like Tombstone.
B000065U1N|4.0|This is suppose to be a forum for reviewing films....Not a forum for discussing political views or bashing.  Keep to the subject.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|The good thing about \\"Gone In Sixty Seconds\\" is that with all the action going on, you won't remember that the leads in this movie - Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Robert Duvall - have at least three acting Oscars between them. At some point, you might realize that these great actors have absolutely nothing to do, but - hey! - it's another car chase, some hot car, gratuitous voyeur sex, or some rockin' tune to distract you.<br />Like I said, that might be a good thing, especially when Duvall's character says a local crime lord is \\"tearing at the soft underbelly of our fair city.\\" It's a long way from Tom Hagen or Colonel Kilgore, but Duvall is such a pro that he pulls it off, as do the rest of the leads.<br />This is strictly a by-the-numbers action flick, but it's well executed, and it's first rate eye candy. In particular, the climactic car chase involving a '67 Shelby Mustang is a dandy, and Cage drives it pretty convincingly (he's a car buff in real life).<br />There's no character development to speak of, the dialogue gets pretty hammy from time to time, and some of the action (particularly a scene where Cage & Co. steal cars from the police impound lot) is laughably implausible, but \\"Gone In Sixty Seconds\\" is indeed a good time, and worth a view or two.
B00005YU1O|5.0|The DVD of this movie does justice to the film that appeared in theaters, albeit there weren't many it appeared in.  For some reason this jewel was overlooked for the animation category for the Oscars, which was as bad as many of the oversights that occurred this past year (Memento, Royal Tenenbaums, etc.)  The movie was filmed like any other, than the film was illustrated by a group of artists that vary stlistically, from almost hyper-realistic to cartoonish.  The characters and the scenery sometimes bob and weave on the screen creating a dream-like feel to the movie.  The dialogue is composed mostly of many monologues given to the main character (a wandering Wiley Wiggins-the young kid from Dazed and Confused).  Topics run the gamut, sparking philosophy, science, politics, morality nad life in general.  Envelope these mind-blowing illustrations and topics in the idea that Wiggins can't tell if he is awake or dreaming and you've got the most original movie I've seen in years.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I wrote a review of X-Men two years ago, and said that I hoped that they did not screw up the Spider-Man movie, because he is my favorite comicbook character.  Well let me say one thing.THEY DIDN'T!  This was the greatest comicbook movie ever.  Step aside Superman, Batman, and X-Men.  There is a new hero in town, and he's kickin' some major rear-end.  I've seen this six times so far, and so far it hasn't gotten boring.  They started right by getting Sam Raimi to direct.  When I heard that I knew it would be good, but then I heard DiCaprio's name being thrown out to play Peter Parker, and I was scared.  Luckily they came to their senses, and cast Tobey Maguire, who did a fabulous job.  He was Peter Parker.  Then I heard there would be no Doc Ock, instead Norman Osbourne, The Green Goblin.  At first I heard John Malkovich would play this part, which would have been interesting, but I think they picked correctly when they chose Willem Defoe.  He was creepy as Norman Osbourne.  Kirsten Dunst was great as Mary Jane, but I think Julia Stiles may have been better, I just think she's a better actress.  But Kirsten did a great job.  The story was fantastic.  There was action, comedy, sadness, and even a love story for the ladies.  So it touched all your emotions.  And a two hour movie in an age where a movie that lasts an hour and forty minutes is long, was great.More bang for your buck, and it didn't drag.  They stayed pretty true to the comic, not exactly but who cares, it was still the best big studio movie I've seen in a while.  If you haven't seen it, What the HECK are you waiting for?  The DVD?  You gotta see this one in the theater.  Get out of your house and go see it ya net-nerd. Jeez, what's wrong with you?  There's something other to do than screw around on your computer all day!  I can't wait for the DVD or the sequel.  Remember, \\"With great power, comes great responsibility\\"See ya,Spideyy
B000065U1N|4.0|This movie, like most Ridley Scott films, is awesome.  I cannot say enough about how good it is.  My only gripe is that there is no director's commentary audio track.  The transfer is beautiful, the 5.1 Dolby Digital is flawless.  Be warned: This movie is more graphic than any other war movie I have ever seen and it does not have that feel good hollywood ending.
6300270432|5.0|I have never seen this particular version of the video. I have the original one that came out and guard it jealously! What I cannot understand is why this movie has never been released on DVD!... There are so many underlying themes throughout this movie besides that of the main plot of betrayal by old Army buddies and the honor gained through the loyalty of newly formed friendship between Mitchum and Ken. I've often wondered if I would experience the same feelings Mitchum experienced coming back to Tokyo, if I went back to Saigon and saw those I knew back when I was in Nam. What a feeling to see how much things had changed and yet remained the same. There are many deep themes explored in this movie. Definitely one of Sidney Pollack's more under rated, yet finer films for nuance!... I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants more than swords and blood.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie was truly one of the best war movies I have ever seen. I guess because it is such a touchy subject you get a lot of reviews like \\"Don't see this, I didn't see it\\" or, \\"I didn't see this movie, but here's why it sucked\\". This movie was incredible. Even though you know the outcome before seeing it the suspense is just incredible. The ticking style music when the choppers are approaching the landing site just has you on the tip of your seat. I love how the music changes when showing the different forces, and the ambient Muslim singing in the background is a nice touch. <br />This movie is very graphic, and it feels like the whole situation is a giant mess. The situation starts off bad, only to get worse and worse. You totally feel for the soldiers, but at the same time the movie gives the feeling of \\"what the hell were they trying to do\\" The whole focus changes from a simple arrest to trying to get the hell out of the town. <br />This is history, and who knows, maybe it's not perfect in the movie, but to not like the movie because you didn't like the event is kind of silly. It happened, and I think the movie has a lot to learn from, especially culturally. I felt like I really could feel why the \\"West\\" cannot help the world, and why we can't fix everything or put our ideals on other cultures. The movie is like a harsh and brutal reality of how things are in some parts of the world, and how we are sometimes powerless to change them. Black Hawk Down is definitely in my top 5 favorite movies.
B00006690F|5.0|Let me start by saying that as I opened this CD and put it in my CD player for the very first time to take a listen, I was driving in a very wealthy area in my town, where joggers line the streets so tight you can hardly pass and mothers equipt with oversized sun hats push their children in strollers.  I had the volume to quite the decimal to be sure I could hear every word.  Before I descended out of this gated community, their own police stopped me because someone had called on their cell phone to report that I was playing EMINEM (Gosh, no!), with explict lyrics, too loud.  I laughed to myself and thought even these affluent high class well-to-do's know of Eminem.  Well you tell me this guy doesnt know how to make a buck!  <BR>   Being a 29 year old female, I am not phased by his words.  I do not take personal offense to his bashing.  I know what good business sense is and he has it all.  In his personal tunes, such as \\"cleaning out my closet\\" you can see his insecurity and where his brave voice came from.  In his other songs, he likes to stir up controversy, this is what keeps people coming back for more.  This is where he sells over a million copies in a matter of days.  Honestly I dont think he means any harm, but as he states in \\"Without me\\" ...\\"to do black music so selfishly, and use it to get myself wealthy..\\" Wealthy he now is!  As they say, any attention, even negitive, is still attention! Score another in the books for Eminem!
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Ritchie is easily one of the most inventive directors around today, as is evidenced by Snatch.  The 2-DVD collection has tons of great features, some of which are hidden.  For example you can see a montage of all of the characters in the movie cursing by pressing the remote directions in a certain order (if I remembered it I would include it).  Otherwise the movie itself is a funny, exciting ride.  Following the misadventures of Turkish and Tommy, two unlicensed boxing promoters, Ritchie manages to make movie not only exciting plot-wise but visually stimulating as well.  The opening sequence of the jewel heist is one of the best openings to a movie that I can think of in recent memory.  The cast is great although not packed with huge names (Brad Pitt excluded).  Regardless each actor plays a unique character that viewers will come to favor (mine is Cousin Avi).  Not only a movie to watch and laugh at once but one to watch over for a long time.
0553260111|4.0|Ludlum's spy thriller incaptivated me. The confusion involved with not knowing the actual identity of Jason Bourne until the end added to the intrigue of the book. There was not a single page where I found myself bored. Ludlum definitely has the talent to compare with the renowned authors such as J.R.R. Tolkein. Reading his novel was like reading a modern day Agatha Christie mystery.<BR>While the movie looks good, I'd reccommend that everyone read the book. Movies are just never the same.

Whoever it is, they need to hire some middle-aged gay men to make suggestions, because straight young people have no knowledge of movie history and are basically stupid when it comes to art.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Yeah the majority of the songs are love songs but they're well written. It's not all I Love You, I Love You...The music's great, his voice is cool. His sound in-general isn't terribly original but his cd is done well none-the-less. I won't say anything else about how good it is because on every interview I've seen him on he seems to know how good he is!! But he is, so...
B00000JLWW|3.0|Let's put it this way. This movie is not to be watched for the romance between Jack and Rose. This movie has to be watched \\"in spite of it.\\" Every other aspect is either good or excellent, from the movie score to the direction, the acting, and the special effects. What makes this movie good is the recreation of that particular historical atmosphere and tragedy. Unfortunately, the movie is weak in its main theme, the very relationship between the two main characters. Their story is clichd; ok, what romantic story isn't? But a clichd story has to be well developed in all of its aspects, otherwise it allows the viewers to see the framework on which it is based, and that bombs the movie. For example, here we have rich unbearable guy engaged with beautiful but poor girl, who will marry him only to please her insensitive and money-grubbing mother. But girl meets good and poor guy who opens her eyes on the beauty of life and changes her forever. He's obviously perfect, while the bad boyfriend is incapable of doing or saying anything right (which is at least strange, I mean, statistically speaking, everybody says or does something right sooner or later, especially if the movie drags for three hours). Do you see my point? This aspect of the movie is underdeveloped compared to the other ones. That makes \\"Titanic\\" a movie that I watched once and decided that it was enough. It's not a \\"twice\\" movie for me.
B00003CXS4|5.0|this movie quickly became part of my all time greats list of movies and it only consists of about five movies tops. i would have to compare it to any gangster/hitman movie plus i'd say it is three stars better than any of them. It's just that cool of a movie. Brad Pitt makes a great crazy boxer and all the other characters are right there with him with their awsome acting. Whaether it's Boris dodging dullets or bricktop feeding people to pigs you will be laughing it up because you will always know that when you back up things come from behind.
0060931671|5.0|This is normally called the most accessible of Pynchon's novels, however that should only be in the sense that its under 200 pages.  This continues Pynchon's pattern of conspiracy plots hidden just beneath the surface of the book that ultimately drives the main character and the reader towards an unforeseen conclusion.  Just as in life, the answers are not always apparent.  Involving the machinations of an underground postal system, W.A.S.T.E., the main character Oedipa Maas, searches for the links between her, the postal system, an industry mogul, among other things.  Far fewer characters than his other novels but not on a smaller scale (storyline-wise not page amount).
B00006690F|3.0|In comparison to The Marshall Mathers LP and The Slim Shady LP, The Eminem Show is<BR>garbage. The simplistic rhyme structure Eminem has taken up is very disappointing for an<BR>audience of expectant listeners. Don't get me wrong, he still has some remnents off his \\"flow<BR>almost flawless\\" - <br />Imagine from being a no one to seein' <BR>Everything blow up and you did was just grow up mcing<br />But for the most part, Slim Shady has taken the easy route, trading pinpoint lyrics for his flow.<br />Songs like \\"White America\\" have superb lyrics, but the flow is slow and elementary - <br />I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see <BR>So many ... people, who feel like me<BR>Who hare the same views and the same exact beliefs<BR>It's like a ... army marching in back of me<br />Notice the good lyrics, but poor and elementary flow. It seems Eminem thinks he could not<BR>recreate the excellent flow and political commentaries of tracks like \\"Who Knew\\" on this<BR>album. <BR> In addition, Eminem continues to explore his personal life with his mother on \\"Cleanin<BR>Out My Closet\\", a respectable song, but marred by a simplistic flow. Similarly, \\"Halie's Song\\",<BR>a representation of musical genius, is about his daughter and is spotless. If only he could recreate<BR>songs like that for all his personal thoughts.<BR> Finally, Eminem has decided that every featuring artist on this album (even Dr. Dre)<BR>should have a horrible verse and/or verses. Dr. Dre on \\"Say What You Say\\", cannot seem to<br />keep his flow straight, and D12, though on point with their lyrics, have a poor vision of music it<BR>seems when it comes to flow. <BR> Eminem has explored himself on this album, and perhaps this is what the real him is<BR>like, though I hope not. He has chosen a simple flow, for a rather good album, and may continue<BR>to do so.
B00005RHGK|5.0|THIS WAS REALLY A GOOD HORROR FLICK!<BR>It's been a long time since a good horror flick and this is it.<BR>Good acting, great effects, and a good story make this one of my favorites.<BR>Another thing I like about this flick is the &quot;cult&quot; feel it has about it. Not overdone. Just creepy...
6302610702|5.0|If i could i would have given this collection a 6 out of 5, its that good(except the 3rd one that ones ok). I would def. suggest getting this collection! I can't even began to explain how much i loved these movies!!!
B00005O5CM|3.0|If there were 1/2 ratings, I would have granted an extra half-star if only for the moxie and flair for fun acting that Reese Witherspoon displays in Legally Blonde.  An absurd storyline is carried by the actress in a script that fits Ms. Reese tighter than the designer outfits made into a running joke in the film.<br />Though ably directed and acted by a supporting cast including Luke Wilson and a chihuahua, 5 star storyline it is not.  This movie is for fun, not for keeps.  Yet, as weak as the foundation may be in Legally Blonde, I found myself smiling at the antics of Elle Woods (Reese W.), a grown up version of Alicia Silverstone's Clueless character.  The sorority depictions were frightenly parallel to the one's I recall in college, which only made the stereotype more humourous.  And Elle's college entrance video submitted to the Harvard Admission Committee makes the film almost worthwhile on its own.<br />Men, be not afraid to rent this film with your girlfriend, wife, or boyfriend.  Whatever your fancy, Legally Blonde has enough tom-foolery of the collegiate level to keep you laughing.  Women, you will only solidify your stature as the significant other who can pick out a movie even your Marine Corp. boytoy will enjoy.
B000053VAF|2.0|Don't get me wrong: Dogma is an hilarious movie that goes to the border on religious situations all the while maintaining some seriousness.  The cast is superb, bringing in stars for starring roles and cameos alike.  When I found out that Dogma was a coming out in a 2-DVD set I nearly lost it, and when I watched it I nearly lost it for the other reason.  Most of the features are incredibly boring.  The best parts of the movie were seriously in the movie and there is a big reason why those deleted scenes were left out.  The commentary by Kevin Smith et.al. is sometimes funny but mostly gets in the way of the movie.  If this comes in a single DVD I would get that so you can enjoy Dogma without having to pay, financially and mentally, for all the extra features.
0446608955|5.0|This book pulled you every which way when it came to emotions one moment your laughing but then you turn a page and your bawling. At first it seems like a boy-meets-girl,boy-likes-girl kind of book but sudenly the plot twists around and you have suprises on every page. I love this book and Ive read it multiple times. I really would sugest that you read this book!
B000063UR2|5.0|I have always been a fan of this film since I first saw it, and I still am today.  I read most of these reviews up here and I have to say, the director's cut is good, but has a more hokey feel than the original release.  The ending of it, however, is much better than the original.  Scores, as we find, can make all the difference.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is quite overbearing and unemotional compared to the original's Tangerine Dream score;  who was not just some &quot;80's rock group no one knows,&quot; but were one of the perveyors of the space rock/ambient movement of music.  That was one of Ridley Scott's bravest moves ever.  The DVD contains some cool little extras, including the video of ex-Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry's &quot;Is Your Love Strong Enough?&quot;. Ok, it's 80's, it's cheesy, but who's that on the guitar solo?  I won't spoil it for you, but if you don't recognize the face or the sound, just know he's an earthbound misfit who just wishes you were here.  A great movie that shows you may just want to keep your eyes open to those films that didn't make the dough, but definitely make a place in our imagination.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This meaningless and pointless film has been praised by many for it's fabulous film technique, it's film noir attributes, and it's complex plot, but I found this film, as I said in my title, to simply be a glorification of psychosis. Lynch reminds me of a child playing around with concepts he doesn't fully understand. He's all into how 'cool' it is, but he loses sight of the overall message he's sending.<br />The exploration of the human mind is a topic filmmakers have been treating since the earliest days of film, but the message of this movie is: life sucks, then you die an ugly death. Well, maybe that's the way life is for Lynch, but not for me!<br />If you are a film buff you will want to see this film for it's cinematic properties, and if you are one of those people who get off on watching other people go down the tubes, you should enjoy this one.<br />I just found it ridiculous. What's the point of watching a film where somebody goes nuts and dies? Don't we see enough of that crap on the TV every day?  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think Lynch's great film technique is enough to sit through a bummer movie like Mulholland Drive.<br />Naomi Watts does put in a great performance as the confused woman who goes psychotic.<br />I gave this movie 3 stars anyway for it's inventive use of the camera, but I really want to give it 0 stars for it's overall message.<br />As one of my friends said after seeing this one: \\"I want my two hours back.\\"
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down, a movie teeming with violence, carnage and adrenalin was a great movie yet failed to shed light on a few things that the book did. The book gave you a human connection with the Rangers and Delta Operators, when you read the book, you were reading about the soldiers as human beings-not godly, invulnerable warriors as depicted in the movie. I think the movie only supplements the book-YOU MUST READ THE BOOK FIRST. The movie helps you visualize what happened that October. One problem with the movie is the fact that the whole thing was focused on Staff Sargeant Eversman played by Josh Hartnett, while in the book it did not use a character as the central focus. Another great thing about the book and the movie was that they did not go in depth into the political background of the conflict- I want to know what happened in Mogadishu-not who to point fingers at (George S. Bush, Bill Clinton and Les Aspin could have all been held equally responsible, but then yet again you can even blame the United Nations). If you do not read the book first, you will not value the movie as much because you'll be too confused on what was happening.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is almost a perfect album...<BR>Pigs on the Wing... A great intro song...<BR>Pigs on the Wing part 2 ... A great outro Song...<br /> Dogs is a 17 minute tour de Force....  Pigs is amazing...<BR>I mean the whole album is musicaly and liricaly great.<br /> Thanks to master Waters... Great music.. good solos by the fat baffoon too... And a great concept...<br />  one of Pink Floyd's best!
B00003CXI1|3.0|I want to register a general complaint about the blatent profiteering that the studios are attempting on these &quot;special edition&quot; DVDs.  I have no desire to watch hours and hours of special footage or behind-the-scenes or DVD-based games.  I want to watch the movie.  Period.  Maybe I'll go thru deleted scenes.  But the rest is just fluff so the studio can charge more for the product.  In light of this, the Harry Potter DVD is so-so.  The movie itself is fine and my kids enjoy it but I don't recall enough of the theatre version to be able to tell what new scenes were added and neither do they.  It would have been nice to either put those as seperate clips or have some way to jump directly to them, especially if the marketing campaign makes such a big deal out of it.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This is Marilyn Manson at his scariest.  If you thought AntiChrist Superstar was scary, then expect more.  If you just read the lyrics, you will think them kiddy.  But LISTEN to the songs.  You will be stunned at how wickedly clever Mr. Manson and his original band were while recording this record.  Throughout every single song, there are samples of shows, people saying bizarre things, screaming, etc. etc.  Expect to be frustrated because they're hard to hear.  When you do hear them, expect to be shocked, puzzled, or both.  This record contains a lot of Christian imagery working against Christianity, which, depending on your beliefs may be a good or a bad thing.  Anyway, back to the CD.  After listening to this record, expect to be: numb, a little confused, amazed, and wondering why Marilyn Manson has not made another CD quite as good as this one.<br />  Don't get me wrong though.  AntiChrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals are great records.  To be honest they are a bit more mature.  Stay clear from Holy Wood though.  Its VERY so/so, which might be why it didn't even go gold in the US (440,000 according to SoundScan)<br />  If you yourself are a new fan of Marilyn Manson, start off with ACS.  This one is an acquired taste.  But once you are used to Marilyn Manson, get this.  You'll be in for a great experience.
B00005NI5Y|3.0|If 'Blood on the Tracks' is 5 stars (and it surely is) this is maybe a 3 1/2.  Can't figure out what all the hoopla over this album was about, but maybe it was because there just wasn't all that much really good stuff out there last year.<br />I haven't tossed it, but then the first go through didn't make me want to play it again.
0962477060|2.0|I bought this book hoping to get some more insight into soloing and solo theory, however this book is very formulaic.  The material is geared toward those who don't know music theory and don't want to learn.  It takes that approach that theory is unimportant to guitar players.  As a musician for over 10 years I can say that that is completely untrue.  <BR>I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone who wants to be a serious musician.  Learning your scales and the chords that they go with is like learning your multiplication tables, it is something that you just have to do.
0767802659|4.0|I admit the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was really stupid and a really bad adaptation of the classic Heinlein novel.  But now that I've re-watched this movie a couple times, I gotta admit that it's a pretty good flick.  Yes, it's mindless and features pretty boys/girls with perfect bodies.  But there's a lot of social commentary in there and the technology was pretty revolutionary for its time.  If you turn your brain down a bit and just enjoy, it's a pretty fun way to spend 90 minutes or so.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Fresh. Wonderful. Amazing.  Bought this disk by chance and it instantly became a favorite.  Do yourself a favor and buy this cd.  Norah Jones will be remembered come award(s) time.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Firstly, let me say that I think Tobey Maguire was a great choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He also seemed to play the typical boy next door better than Kirsten Dunst's typical girl next door. The first costume Peter comes up with for his costume is just hilarious...you'll know what I mean when you see it but the actual costume you see him in for the majority of the movie was just fantastic. Apparently they had to sew him into his costume since the seams kept on ripping - not at all surprising when you see just how agile he had to be in the role of superhero.<br />I had not followed the comics or cartoons but found the story very easy to follow. At times I actually anticipated where the story was going, like what happened with Peter's uncle and when the Green Gobulin tricks Spiderman into saving him. I also enjoyed the scene on the rooftop when Peter first tries to use his webbing on command, when he first climbs a wall and his aunt's comment \\"You're not Superman, you know\\".<br />One major downfall was the obvious use of computer animation in scenes such as where Spiderman is pursuing the criminal in the car. It's disappointing because the CGI is detectable but it would be so hard to do that kind of stunt work using real people with speed, realism and acrobatics. I remember thinking that it was looking more and more like a game or something. Most noticable on the big screen I predict that it will be less of a problem when watching at home on DVD.<br />William Dafoe seemed to play his duel role with particular relish and I think that the scenes involving the glider would have been quite fun. The scene he does in front of the mirror  was quite clever I thought.<br />It's also easy to see how they they are planning to do a sequel to the movie since the storyline was already written into the story.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This movie starts out pretty tame.  I guess I was expecting immediate disturbing filled scenes, but it isn't like that at all.  Instead..It builds.  When the last ten minutes come and the scenes are all flashing together faster and faster it started making me feel a little sick.  I assume that is what the director intended which is quite an interesting technique.  While this isn't my favorite movie of all time or anything, I did like it.  I agree with the person who said this should be shown to all high schoolers.  It would definitely open up their eyes.  I'm not sure what the \\"edited\\" version doesn't contain...but it probably is missing a certain scene with Marlon Wayans and his girl and maybe not as much graphicness towards the end.  If you can stomach it...You should definitely watch this.  You probably won't be doing any drugs anytime soon after this.
B000065V1V|4.0|This album originally seemed uninspired, nowhere near as cohesive as even *Hours*-- a pastiche. <br />But after a few days of listening to it, it's grown on me, just like every Bowie ablum since 1980's *Scary Monsters*, but quicker--I just didn't GET it.  Though Bowie will probably not attract many new fans with this album (as he did with *1: Outside*), every song contains references and allusions to a previous Bowie song: \\"A Better Future\\" echos \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" from *Lodger*, for example, and \\"*Slip Away\\" echoes both \\"Life on Mars\\" and \\"Ashes to Ashes\\"...pop, yet postmodern at its most fun.  Some poignant lyrics, too.
6301871944|4.0|Gremlins 2 brings us to New York City. Billy and Kate now work for building magnate Daniel Clamp. After Mr. Ving's death, Gizmo comes back into their lives after a daring rescue by Billy from a genetic research lab. Of course, Gizmo gets wet and havoc reigns superme in New York-gremlins-style. Everyone's favorite new gremlin is the talking Brain Gremlin, played to perfection by Odd Couple legend Tony Randall. My favorite gremlin, however, is one I call the Sex Gremlin, an all-green female who literally falls for Mr. Forrester, the company's gremlin-disbelieving floor manager, which makes the chessy but funny men's room wedding scene at the end of the film my absolute favorite. Billy's father at the end of the first movie said it best: \\"Look out all the windows, check in all the closets and cupboards, look under all the beds, cause you never can tell, there just might be a gremlin in your house!\\" Well, New York, you better start doing the same. Because the Gremlins and Gizmo are back with a vengance. Give this movie a rent and just see what I mean.
0446677450|3.0|Rich dad, Poor Dad is not exactly the Wealth of Nations nor the Millionaire next door-but it's worth reading. On one level it's an interesting book to motivate you financially. On a deeper level it makes you question some basic principals of parenting, financial habits learned from your parents, and pecuniary prudence (my fancy way of saying the philosophy of dealing with money).<br />Several of his schemes on how to make money (buying foreclosed property and turning it over for profit) are now used by so many people that it's rare to find such a great deal anymore--it's a good tip nonetheless.<br />Kiyosaki pounds home some basic (some controversial) points about assets and liabilities--he asserts that your house should be thought of as a liability not an asset like other properties because of how homeowners tend to think and spend unrealistically on their own home.<br />The title gets its name from the core philosophies of two men, one Kiyosaki's natural father (well educated poor dad) and his friend's father and (high-school educated rich dad). The book includes many examples of what his rich dad would say versus his poor dad. Poor Dad would say: The love of money is the root of all evil, I cant afford it and I'm not rich because of you kids. The Rich Dad would say: The lack of money is the root of all evil, How can I afford it? and I'm rich because of you kids.<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is great for beginning investors but also provides some great new real-estate ideas to more advanced investors.
B00006690F|1.0|I heard a friend of mine's copy of this desperate CD, and I thought it was a new Weird Al effort. The nasal whining, the weak attempts at shock value and humor, the songs that any 4 year old could write (what PATHETIC lyric writing!}, and the overall and total lack of talent. I laughed so hard at some points, and sad at others because of the tragic result of someones need for attention. Negative attention is better than none at all, I guess. Please, do not waste your time, attention, or money on this. Go buy Moby's \\"18\\" instead. I did.
B000050XEI|5.0|If you know how to use your program buttons: put in tracks #1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12. Even though the cd is unusually short, it still finds a way to transport you to Enya's world. I love it.
0375703764|5.0|I used to have nightmares about my grandparents' house having a trapdoor into a second part of their house that you couldn't see from the outside but was extremely huge. This book takes that nightmare and expands it 10-fold to disproportionate measure. The style is slightly patchwork-y but if you like texture and dimension, the typography will be welcome eye-candy, the psychology will be enjoyable mind-torture, and the secret codes and &quot;possibilities&quot; left unsaid will drive you to sit back down and read it all over again!
0060012331|5.0|While I always enjoy Mr. Pratchett's work, I can't say this is my favorite one, but it's still excellent.  It's essentially a cross of Puss in Boots and The Pied Piper, a la Discworld--where the cats and rats talk and both are in collusion with the Piper.  It's something of a mystery, and would be a good book to read aloud to kids around \\"official\\" Harry Potter age (7-11).  (Kids should be read to more, I think.)  Younger children would need help understanding it on their own; but some of the allusions and entendres will appeal to adults so no one will be bored during the reading.
0783226063|5.0|If you liked the origional star wars over the new jack crahpola this is the film you've been waiting for!  Think old star trek, think 80s, think science fiction as literature put on film with power.  Think of the scene in star wars when Vader and governor Tarkin enter the war council aboard the death star.  Forget new jack films and thier jean-claude van damme mentality.  This film tracks a problem between 3 great feudal houses, a guild of space navigators, an ancient prophecy and a religious order entrusted to guard the prophesy by manipulating blood lines in royal houses in an empire 10,000 years old.<BR>Personally on of my top 5 all time.<BR>buy it.<BR>borrow it and dont return it.<BR>If only lynch had created a sequel.<BR>The TV version is utter trash.  I laughed at it for 45 minutes and turned it off.<BR>Its the equivalent of star wars with jar jar compared to Luke Skywalker.<BR>This film wlll also appeal to readers who appreciate science fiction without the environmentalist [junk] and uppity attitudes and endless personal problems and allusions to tolerance and [stuff] like that on enterprise etc that now litter the sci fi genre.<BR>definatly not democrat scifi like next generation or x files.<BR>good hard feudalism with psionic weaponry and \\"slow-blades\\" distortion shields, and monsters.<BR>could have been a michael moorock novel or something a gary gygax game invented!<BR>AWESOME
B00005RHGK|4.0|I went to see this the first night it came out in theatres. I was hoping for better, but it was good. There are some really scary parts and some good deaths too. The Creeper was very scary and realistic too. Despite some fake computer-generated graphics (CG) and some minor plot-holes it was an overall it was a scary monster movie. Modern-Day Monster Movies should use this movie as a role-model.<br />Positives - 'Creeper' looked real, nice deaths, lots of good scares<br />Negatives - fake-looking CGs(see above for what this is), and minor plot-holes
B00002E224|4.0|first of all, the DVD get's 4 stars cuz the special feature section is poor.<br />To the main point, Jesse and Celine does get back together, for those of you that are wondering.  Just check out Director Linklater's new movie, Waking Life.  There is a scene between the two, continuing Jesse's discussion on the bus about human souls.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This movie was very, very odd.  However, when my boyfriend brought it home from the video store and I saw David Lynch on the cover I knew it would be.  I wouldn't recommend it to folks who enjoy stories with a straighforward story and rhythmic plot.  This movie can be confusing, but it sticks with you once you have seen it.  Even now I can see some of the scenes in vivid detail.  I can't remember what radio show I heard this on, but because of the somewhat graphic love scenes between the two women, the men on the radio show called it a man's wet dream movie.  I don't think they understood much of the movie but at least if you are a guy and your girl wants to watch it you have that to look forward to!
0446608955|5.0|When i receive this book for my birthday, i've never known this writer, i have read the story from beginning to the end, i 've cried but i'll never forgotten(oublier) each words of this love story the end is a beutifull act of love ! touch by touch the author descrive the most important moment of this life, when he was 17 years old, without regrets or sensiblery and tell us a hope (espoir) on the life (sorry for my english expression)
B00005JKEC|2.0|After hearing so many good things about this movie, I was greatly disappointed. Denzel gives a great performance, but I would hardly call it Oscar-worthy. Actually, it's hard to say what an Oscar worthy performance is anymore,since so many of the awards are given for political reasons and are based less and less on artistic merit. It was the same with Al Pacino and his award for the very trite &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; Ugh. The performances by Washington and Hawke are very good and very steady throughout, but the script seems to be thrown together. Basically, it's a mess. I would have liked to see more of a build-up concerning the deal with the Russians-it's almost presented as an afterthought. <BR>Yup, more clarity in the narrative would have made this film a whole lot better...Episodes of the Shield are better written than this!
0060934913|5.0|In a chapter advising chef wannabe's, Anthony Bourdain writes, \\"Lazy, sloppy and slow are bad. Enterprising, crafty and hyperactive are good.\\" Enterprising, crafty and hyperactive describe Bourdain's writing perfectly. He tells his story from a chef's perspective, but Anthony Bourdain is also a first-rate storyteller. Although the book is laid out like a meal, complete with appetizer, dessert, coffee and a cigarette, it's more like a ride on pirate ship with Bourdain as the captain. He takes you on a fast-paced adventure, and you won't want to put the book down until you've experienced the entire trip.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This movie shows Garland at her best- The movie lightens my heart every time I watch it.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is by far my favorite book.  I am reading it again for about the 10th time, and over the years, my love of it has grown and grown.  The first time I read it, back in 5th grade, it was an easy to read and easy to follow book that was a great story for a young girl on a rabbit farm.  Over the years, each time I pick it up, it becomes more to me.  I discover something I hadn't the last time I read it, or a passage &quot;speaks&quot; to me in a new way.  This books speaks to so many levels of society, of power, of life for so many species. I tell everyone I know that this is a book they should read, I don't know how you couldn't love it.<br />I love all of Richard Adams' books, I think he is a fantastic writer, but this is by far his best.
B000066C1N|5.0|Seeing previews for Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, I already knew I had to see it. I'm a 20-year-old kid, a sucker for animated movies. I couldn't wait for the movie to come out, so I grabbed the soundtrack ahead of time.<br />And am I glad I did.<br />This music is wonderful! Bryan Adams's normal rough edges are smoothed out by Hans Zimmer's smooth instrumentation without losing an ounce of the strength, vitality, and potency he's known for. One of the best songs to show this harmonious melting pot is \\"Get Off My Back,\\" a vibrant song played while a legion of men are trying to break Spirit to their will...to absolutely no avail. Other incredible fusions are \\"Here I Am\\" (a song played during Spirit's colthood in the movie), \\"You Can't Take Me\\" (A companion to \\"Get Off My Back,\\" during Spirit's capture and relocation to the human camp), and \\"Don't Let Go\\" (the film's love theme, a beautiful song with additional vocals by Sarah McLachlan).<br />The movie itself is almost silent, with only occassional snatches of dialogue and narration, but Hans Zimmer's score more than speaks for its characters. The composer for \\"The Lion King\\" and \\"The Prince of Egypt,\\" which happen to be two of my all-time favorite movies, scored another soul-searing hit with this stunning album. Heck, I'm listening to it right now as I type this!<br />Basically, I urge everyone who reads this to go see Spirit and then buy this soundtrack. You won't be sorry. 'Nuff said. :)
B00005Y228|5.0|I love this kind of music. It's fun, catchy, and doesn't take itself seriously. On top of it, Kylie has the perfect voice for the dance/disco genre. Of course, everyone is probably familiar with the huge US radio hit \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" which ruled radio the first half of this year (and raised a few eyebrows with its accompanying video.) But this by no means is the only good song on the album. I love the 1st track \\"More More More\\" with its fantastic chorus and sing-a-long vibe. There is also the awesome worldwide smash single \\"In Your Eyes.\\"<br />I hear the next single for the US is \\"Love At First Sight\\" which is yet another great track. I really hope it's as big of a hit as \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\" Radio is desperate for some good pop tunes right now. I'm sick to death of rap and people that can't sing. People need to get up and dance once in awhile and Kylie is the ticket!
B000001ELR|5.0|Creatures of the night was the right album at the wrong time.  KISS' popularity was faultering and fickle America had already gone on to Duran Duran and Devo for their musical fix.  Not that I have anything against those groups, but we're talking about KISS.  It's ironic that this is the style Album Ace Frehley wanted to make since \\"Dynasty\\", but never got to make.  By the time \\"Creatures..\\" was in development, Ace was gone and wasn't looking back which is too bad.  Imagine how different the album would have been if he had been involved.  I really don't like that Gene and Paul put Peter on Unmasked and Ace on Creatures of the night because to me it's like false advertising.  They knew damn well that Peter and Ace were gone, but capitalized on their personas to market the albums.  But I gave this 5 stars not for the album cover but for the music within the album.  First I liked the Remaster for the fact it put the original cover and song order back they way it was.  Robert Conte, the one in charge of the remasters restoration, was at the KISS convention in Burbank, which I went to too and was just another face in the crowd like me.  They had a Q&A session with KISS and he was lucky enough to get to ask them a question.  He remarked to the band about how the different reissues of the albums stray away from the original concepts of the album's initial release and wished that they would reissue the classic albums they way they were intended.  They took him on right there on the spot to be in charge of the reissues they were planning at the time.  Kisstory was made and I was there to witness it.  Peter Criss also came out to sing too, but you see all about that on Second Coming and the unplugged video.  Anyway, I hated the initial Creatures Cd release with a different cover and weird track listing.  Bruce Kulick, like Ace Frehley was misrepresented on the cover.  The back cover has someones butt on it, which brings me to the question;what the hell were they thinking?  Vinnie Vincent should have been on the cover since he played on the album, even though Vinnie Vincent is a jerk...<BR>The point is, the sound is incredible and the songs are the best KISS had recorded in years.  Like Revenge, this album got lost by the public and was only appreciated overseas.  But that's where KISS has always been appreciated the most.  This is an essential album for your Cd collection. 'Nuff Said.
6303921248|5.0|I watched this in the series form on TV and have been trying to find this version in all the video stores, libraries, etc., that I could think of, to no avail.  FINALLY, one day my computer-savvy grandson suggest I go online, and, behold, there it was, first try.  I not only ordered Pride and Prejudice, but Sense and Sensibility AND Emma, so there!<br />My tapes are on the way....I can hardly wait.  Now all I need is a rainy day with the 'phone turned off!
0140186395|4.0|The novel East of Eden, written by John Steinbeck is an incredible novel that can be easily read and understood by anyone of any age.  The simplicity of Steinbeck's writing allows readers to fully comprehend his descriptions and ideas on life's realities.  John Steinbeck's use of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel illustrates the imperfection that lies within the realities of life and how that imperfection ultimately gives Man the opportunity to dicate choose the style of life for oneself.  As many people might think East of Eden is a boring novel with no excitment, on the contrary, East of Eden is a page turning novel that takes the reader on to the edge with unexpcted twists and turns during the novel's most exciting moments.  East of Eden examines how life is never how it is planned.  Life will never follow the perfection that is envisioned, but it is through the imperfections in life that Steinbeck reveals that makes it so close to reality, a reality where everyone has flaws and no one is capable of abandoning those flaws.
B00005A1PR|3.0|Even though India claims repeatedly throughout her debut album to be following in the tradition of Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke and others, she really delivers more pop than soul or R&amp;B.  As a pop album, it's solid, but it's not soul or R&amp;B.  She relies heavily on hooks and repeats the chorus over and over and over again.  Plus, to me, her messages sound trite.  Black is beautiful.  Women shouldn't be judged solely on their appearance.  I know, and I don't know anyone who doesn't know.  Granted, I'm older.  Maybe this is an important message for school-age kids, but that only adds to the bubblegum feel of the album.<br />The editorial review has it right.  If you like Tracy Chapman and Me'Shell Ndegeocello, then you will probably enjoy this album too.  But if you're looking for soul music, you're better off pulling out your old Donny Hathaway and Sam Cooke albums.<br />Peace,<br />Oaklander.
B000001EIA|5.0|I won't get long winded on this like I did on my Revenge, Psycho Circus, or Creatures of the night reviews.  Unplugged showed how talented these musicians are.  Also it shows that these songs that are played loud ordinarily can be played acoustic and still have the same power musically.  Plus it was quite a treat to have both new and old KISS jam together.  I wish I could have been there!
B000065U1N|1.0|This movie was a very real depiction of a war-time situation.  In that, this was a well done movie.  For the viewer, however, I found the movie too intense.  There was little time for a person to recover from each sceen and absorb the information introduced.  By the end of the movie, instead of reflecting on the movie, I just wanted to give my senses a break and not think about anything for a while.
B00003CY0V|1.0|Swordfish doesn't present itself as a particularly smart movie to begin with, but unfortunately, bad-to-heinous choices in storytelling, structure, camera work and pacing conspire to make this a big visual headache, effectively negating what might have been a fun popcorn movie.<br />Hugh Jackman shows that even an actor of his charm and considerable ability can do nothing when the script amounts to zero. The characters in Swordfish are paper-thin, not the least of which is Jackman's main character, supposed superhacker Stanley. John Travolta has done this vicious-villain role many times before and better, most notably as the devil-may-care stealth pilot of Broken Arrow, a far superior action piece in every way. Halle Berry gives one of the most miserable \\"performances\\" I've seen recently from a name star. Her feeble attempts at emotional expression and teeth-clenching dialogue delivery grate on the nerves at every turn, yet we are with her so often that there's no escape. I literally cheered when her character is suspended from a wire cable and asphyxiating. Don Cheadle is the only actor who doesn't quite embarrass himself thanks to his skills, yet his character is underutilized; given more screen time, he could have saved the film and offered up a worthy adversarial force to Travolta.<br />Director Dominic Sena's music-video sensibilities are evident at every turn. There's plenty of show-offy shots and camera trickery in this film, but none of them feel natural as in The Matrix. Starting from the first scene, a pointless, boring pop-culture dissection of Dog Day Afternoon (feeble imitation of Reservoir Dogs, ten years after the fact), Sena's camera is a migraine-inducer -- hyperactively panning from character to character, obsessively racking focus, punching in and slamming out with seemingly no motivational force other than Sena's desperate attempt at forcing excitement onto a scene that carries no tension. Jackman's face reflected in a metal ball, virtuoso surround-dollies, bouncy handheld camera...it all invites a big \\"who cares\\".  And Hugh Jackman has never looked more embarrassing than in the cutesy montage in which Stanley looks for a way to crack a certain computer problem. The unconventional structure is incredibly forced as well -- there's no reason why most of this story is told in flashback, and in persisting with this structure, Sena merely disrupts the (already shaky) flow of events so that the siege of the bank becomes hackneyed.  Jackman and Cheadle's characters just blink onto the scene inexplicably and whole chunks of potential tension-building scenes are hacked out, leaving only the sense that here's a filmmaker who's desperately trying to be hip by tapping into an unconventional story structure, but just shoots himself in the foot in the vital narrative and emotional departments.<br />Looking at the two alternate endings offered in the DVD extras, I can only say that I think Sena picked the worst one possible. Down endings don't necessarily mean good ones, and in the case of Swordfish, the official ending merely makes futile every single gesture in the film. There's no sense of triumph, tragedy, or even irony, just a sense that you've watched a noisy, violent exercise in excessive pyrotechnics with no aftermath, not making a statement about anything. The final 20 minutes of the film are like a dumbed-up parody of Dog Day Afternoon without an iota of the emotional content, all the gunfire, explosions and stunts only pointing out how emotionally void this whole film is.
B00000AFDW|5.0|I say believe it or not because most will find the final KISS studio release(Most likely) a disapointment.  Not me.  This is the first KISS album to feature the original 4 since 1977's \\"Love Gun\\" (Which is also on my list of favorites).  Don't say \\"Dynasty\\" was the last because Peter Criss only played on \\"Dirty Livin'\\" and that's not enough for me to consider it the last with the original 4.  I remember hearing the title track on the radio for the first time and felt an anticipation I hadn't felt since \\"Revenge\\".  Kiss, up to this point had released Kiss my ass, Alive 3, You wanted the best you got the best, Unplugged, and Greatest Kiss in a span of a few years and I don't mind admitting that I was tired of Greatest Hits packages.  Carnival of souls was a shelved album released VERY poorly (I hate the cover!)and was like the Elder in that it was KISS trying to be somebody else.  I heard the whole album a year before it was released and Mercury just released it to cash in on us KISS maniacs who buy anything KISS.  Which brings us to \\"Psycho Circus\\", named after the KISS comic and the wrap up to a great career for KISS.  I won't go into detail about the album but I will say that if this album had been given the proper backing by the record company, it would have been a bigger seller for them.  \\"You wanted the best\\" is my dream come true;all 4 singing on the same song, which is the only time KISS did that.  It actually brings you back to the spirit of the first album, where a majority of the songs had everyone(except Ace)singing.  They got away from that as the years went on, but it's not that big of an issue.  For what it is worth, Psycho Circus belongs with Revenge and the other classic KISS albums that define the band and capture it's disposition at any given time.  There was speculation about studio musicans filling in the gaps for Ace and Peter on some songs, which I really don't care to know the truth.  It would ruin the album for me and it really doesn't matterto me.  I liked that Bruce Kulick and Bob Ezrin contributed to this album which to me makes this a mix of all the great elements of KISS in one album.  No true KISS fan should be without this album.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this cd about 5 months ago and it is still in my cd player. Very rarely can I find a band that can keep my attention for this long. They are way too hyped up but it could be worse, they could be on TRL, but even if they were I would still listen to them. I have often comtiplated buying another cd for just my car so I wouldn't have to remember to cart it around.
B00004SZWD|5.0|There really isn't a more appropriate title for this album.  I have listened to this album countless times, and it has never mattered what kind of a mood I was in, because there was always a song or two that fit.  I remember after the 9/11 attacks listening to &quot;Saturn&quot;, and never heard a more fitting song for the times.  Songs like &quot;Summer Soft&quot;, &quot;I Am Singing&quot;, &quot;Sir Duke&quot;, and &quot;As&quot; have such overwhelming positivity that I think is somewhat missing in today's pop music.  I urge you to at least listen to this album if not buy it - it is a feast for the soul...

6304698658|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is my favorite movie!  I have loved this since the day I saw it.  My family now has a Thanksgiving tradition of watching this in the evening.  I have watched the movie so many times I can recite almost all of the dialouge and I laugh before something funny even happens. It is the best Christmas movie/comedy ever made.  Fun and laughter for the whole family.
0395925037|5.0|I have read this work half a dozen times and each time I discover something new. The Hitler who wrote Mein Kampf was not the Hitler who later went on to rule the Third Reich and most of Europe. He was still developing.<br />Hitler was, naturally, a better public orator than he was an author, nevertheless this book can be compared with his \\"Table Talk\\" conversations (which were published after his death), as Mein Kampf is filled with Hitler's thoughts, opinions, ideals, and plans. He also gives an interesting, albeit brief, account of his childhood and young adulthood as well as an especially fascinating first-hand account of his experiences as a soldier in WWI.<br />One is stunned at this man's great intelligence, despite what popular opinion would have us believe.<br />It is certainly not light reading, but anyone in search of truth about Hitler and his way of thinking, not to mention his countless critics and would-be judges, must first have read this fine work.
B0000636UN|3.0|Maybe I'm too harsh or something. As always, I love the way Sheryl puts her thoughts into verbal feelings we all understand, but I kinda got the feeling that she was almost doing an Alanis Morissette-esque, stream-of-consciousness kind of writing this time around. Although that outfit suits Alanis perfectly, it doesn't seem right on Sheryl. I've always found her music to be fun and/or interesting, even when she's singing about her pain and misery, but this time it sounds so uninspired... like she had a quota she needed to fill for her label, and shucked this one out to keep them happy. I suppose the help she received from notable others does make it worth listening to more than once or twice, but I hope that maybe next time she can get back into the groove of her abilities. She is so completely talented and capable that it is hard to accept that this was the best she could do. Heck, even Soak Up The Sun hasn't been catchy for me because all I hear is someone trying to make a riff work with a couple catchy lyrics. Maybe I'm just spoiled after well-crafted songs like The Difficult Kind, A Change Will Do You Good, &amp; There Goes The Neighborhood. (Sigh....) There's always the next CD.
0671027344|4.0|Stephen Chbosky's, \\"The perks of being a wallflower\\", is a touching, funny, and memorable novel.  I really enjoyed reading this novel because as a teenager in highschool I can easily relate to Charlie.  Throughout the novel he faces many issues such as sexuality, drugs, and frustrations.  I like the fact that everything is very realistic and relatable.  When you read the book it feels like its you, when Charlie's sad you're sad too.  As a teenager I can easily relate to Charlie because those are situations we are faced with in our everyday lives.<BR>Besides frustrations, Charlie also has his group of friends that he has been there for and he count's on when his best friend commits suicide.  I like that friendship is very strong in the novel but I don't like that Charlie is too dependant.  I feel he should make decisions upon himself and not upon others.  When he needs to make a decision he shouldn't think of someone else but of himself and what's best for him.<BR>The ending had a little twist to it.  To me, it was unexpected.  Charlie seems like a normal teenager but then at the end he finds out he was abused by his aunt.  Like the ending, I also liked the fact that the book isn't what it seems.  By looking at the cover and reading the title you'd think that the novel is about someone who doesn't fit in but it turned out to be the total opposite.  Charlie fits in pretty well. This shows you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover!...
B0000640VO|5.0|If someone made a movie out of my daydreams and neuroses, I could only hope that it would be as amusing, sweet and entertaining as Amelie. When this film came out here in Iowa, everyone who saw it commanded that everyone they know see it immediately. Very subtitle-friendly--so much visual communication in the movie that non-French-speakers who don't often watch foreign language films won't be annoyed by the subtitles.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I know that a lot of people go around slapping five star ratings to every other movie, but I have to say that Donnie Darko is truly a brilliant film.  It's dark, clever, and more than anything, intriguing.  Another reviewer claimed that it did not have a satisfying twist for a conclusion but I must disagree.  I believe that this film will leave the viewer with an intense but reasonable mix of being creeped out, confused, angered, and depressed.  After a couple viewings of this film, thoughts of the main character(s) linger in your mind in a way that may actually make you want to cry.  The plot and storyline are stitched together perfectly with just enough said, just enough implied, and just enough left to be pondered.<BR>My biggest recommendation though is that you view this on the dvd version.  The special features are a must and bring a lot more to the experience.  Last but not lease, visiting the movie's site (donniedarko.com) after and only after fully digesting the film is an interesting way to add to it's sensations.
B00005QIPH|4.0|The Stokes CD was very hyped up, but this CD is just great. Some of the songs took a lot of getting used too, which is why this album didn't get five stars, but, there is a great majority of songs that when I heard, I fell in love with. I dont really agree with anyone detracting stars because of it being overhyped, the CD should be rated for the music.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I spent most of the time wondering if the movie was supposed to be an ironically hackneyed reworking of grade Z horror movie material: the \\"scary\\" truck, the wierd creepy shadowy degenerate driving it, the teens mouthing one-liner put-downs at eachother.  And then there is the \\"creature\\" when you do get a load of him.  And it looks like something out of a bad spinoff of Deep Space 9.  In fact I think maybe some guy with a bunch of crud on his face who's supposed on that account to be some kind of alien would have been much more compelling than the thing in this movie.  Also in the hackneyed teen slasher genre the movie's development depends on teens acting in ways that no person would:  the teens are run off the road twice and nearly killed by the creepy shadowy driver of the scary truck - a guy who for a homicidal maniac certainly doesn't seem too concerned with keeping a low profile and is not above random acts of pointless terrorism - and, after seeing said nutjob in his backyard piling what seem to be bodies into a sewer pipe, decide they must drive in there, take their sweet time looking around the place, and eventually crawl into the sewerpipe to further sniff around.  \\"There could be somebody down there who needs our help!\\"  Indeed.  This movie is only horrifying insofar as it is a demonstration of Darwinism being disedifyingly thwarted:  the brain-dead teens with not the slightest stirrings of an instinct of self-preservation are of course not going to be justly put to death.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is a real magical experience movie. A one of a kind experience! It is not just about dancing, but about personal growth and transformation through love. It is a love story most of all. In this high-energy movie, a young woman who looks rather homely helps the lead actor dance his own steps at the Grand Nationals. He wants to dance his own way and not follow the very tight rules of Ballroom dancing. Everyone thought he was crazy to dance his own steps, except this woman. When she approached him to offer her help at first he thought she was joking because he was a professional and she was merely a beginner. She told him he is afraid and that caught his attention. Her moto, and the moto of this film is: \\"A life lived in fear is a life half lived.\\" It is a true metaphor for life and in breaking out of the mold setup for us by society and everyone else. With risk taking and following our hearts, we find something deeper and more beautiful then we ever imagined. She shows him some Latin movies he really likes and slowly they learned to dance their own way that was truly beautiful and much different then traditional Ballroom dancing. <br />As they danced together, little by little, the woman transformed into a true beauty. Her believing in him and herself caused her to become more then what she was. There was so much pressure on this young man to succeed and follow the rules that he almost gave in, but her love changed everything. The walls came down at the Grand Nationals and they danced their way- a beautiful elegant, simple Latin dance that had the audience jumping out of their seats in awe. In the end everyone joined in and it was an amazing thing to see! I find this movie to be a very good psychological lesson of following your heart, to stop living in fear even though everyone and everything seems to be against what you know in your heart to be right for you. And by breaking the rules, amazing things can happen for not just you, but the whole society as well. Atruly amazing movie with a beautiful message. A one of a kind rare film that will always be my personal favorite.
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghosts and goblins have finally met their match: The Ghostbusters! Yes, the movie that started it all. An evil force known as Gozer wants to dominate the planet and uses two human beings as 'the dogs' to open the gates of its world. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson are the Ghostbusters and Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis are the chosen ones to help Gozer. After the team's first successful operation at a grand hotel, they damaged a banquet room and almost evaporated a maid! \\"What the hell are you doing?\\" It was classic. Talk about slimage. There's plenty of that and the flowers were still standing. The chemistry between Murray and Weaver was incredible and the showdown at the end was monumental. Stay Puft marshmellow man was the best thing ever since smores were invented. Oh yes.
B00005JKCF|2.0|I saw this with my 5 year old godchild. I am 29,not really a SM fan, but with all the hype I figured I would take my godchild to see it since he likes SM. I found it boring, and the action scenes were nothing special. It was such a ripoff of Superman that it was so predictable.I was actually rooting for The Green Goblin.  I was very dissapointed in this venture. I hope this is it and not a umpteen of SM movies after this one. Tobey if you are reading this, take acting lessons...
B00000JGHM|5.0|The biggest showdown ever? Yes! Al Pacino is a Los Angeles cop who wants to find the most sophisticated burglar in the country, Robert DeNiro. Aside from personal problems, the men are well respected by both worlds and when they meet in a diner, it's stone setting! DeNiro's character robs the biggest bank in L.A. and the shoot-out on the streets is remarkable. An extravaganza with a huge cast including Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Tom Sizemore and Jon Voight. Michael Mann's vision is crystal clear and this police-crime saga will never be forgotten.

B00003CXZ1|3.0|Lara Croft, the first woman Indiana Jones, is up against a holy revelation that requires some stern kicking. Angelina Jolie plays the video game ... kicker and is the best actress to have been picked for the part. Although there are some plot cliches, the movie does have some tense action scenes which will please most fans. Seriously, she needs to forget about her father (played by Jon Voight) and kick more ... . Get Van Damme to be in the next one and you'll have rich chocolate. Forget the robots and swinging on a big totem pole, fight a huge guy like Dolph Lundgren!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is a hard film to watch, there is no denying it. I first saw it at a matinee show on a bright sunny day in St. Louis. As I emerged from the Tivoli theatre into the daylight, it seemed impossible that the beauty of the day around me could possibly coexist in the same world as the bleak degradation that the characters in this movie descend into. Since I bought the DVD, I have been avoiding it for weeks, unsure if it was worth facing that descent.<br /><br />It was. Despite being a emotion bonecrusher, the quality of this film is undeniable. Darren Aronofsky has kept his touch for depicting the extremity of human emotion that he demonstrated in Pi. In Requiem, however he makes the characters so rich and engaging that the viewer is drawn along on their voyage of self destruction. This is a big improvement. One of the biggest flaws in Pi was that we have no reason to identify with the obsessive main character. In Requiem, each of the main characters is sympathetic and three-dimensional. It's this that makes the film so traumatizing.<br /><br />Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a lonely widow living alone in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She spends her days watching television, particularly the infomercial snake oil of Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald), a guru who sells a three step program to rebuild your life. One day she receives a phone call telling her that she has been chosen to appear on television. Filled with excitement, she tries to make herself over for her appearance on TV, which rapidly becomes her one reason for living. When she finds she can no longer fit into her best red dress, she starts dieting like crazy, with little success. When an unethical doctor prescribes her heavy stimulants, however, the weight starts coming off, although the side effects put Sara on the edge of madness. Watching this sweet and lonely old lady fall into drug addiction and obsession is very hard. As madness starts to creep in, Sara spends her days hallucinating in front of the television and huddling in mortal fear of the refrigerator.<br /><br />Harry Goldfarb(Jared Leto) is Sara's son, a heroin addict who repeatedly steals his mother's television to finance his habit. He and his partner Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) are scrambling to climb the ladder of the drug underworld from addict to affluent dealer. While at first glance they look like a couple of scum bags, as we get to know them, they become more sympathetic. Harry is a considerate guy who wants the best for his mother and regrets the pain he causes her. Tyrone's thoughts continuously drift back to his own mother in idyllic flashbacks of his youth.<br /><br />Marion Silver (Jennifer Connely) is a young girl from a rich family who wants to design clothing for a living. She and Harry are in love, and together they scheme to turn Harry's drug profits into a chance for her to open a store to sell her own designs. Marion is also entangled in an unwholesome relationship with her sleazy former therapist. Despite this and her cocaine habit, the depths of which she seems unaware of, she seems like a decent person. The scenes of her and Harry together are sweet and endearing. They make us wish the best for this young couple. The fact that they share these moments in a fog of drug-induced euphoria seems almost irrelevant, thanks to Aronofsky's skilled staging, and fine performances by the Connely and Leto.<br /><br />As the film progresses, the hopes and dreams of the four characters are slowly strangled by their dependence on drugs. As despair encroaches on their future plans, they scramble to hold it all together. By the final sequence, the characters' degradation accelerates out of control like a runaway train. Aided immensely by the feverish compositions of the Kronos Quartet, this is one of the most disturbing sequences I've ever seen on film.<br /><br />Technically, this film is very well executed. Sara's nightmarish hallucinations leave the viewer shaken. The time lapse sequences convey a very believable sense of how out of control a speed addict must feel. Aronofsky uses strange perspectives to great effect. In particular, he seemingly hangs a camera from the character's neck at times, to catch every nuance of expression at their moment of greatest shame.<br /><br />I have to recommend this movie, but I warn you, it will not make you feel good. It will probably make you feel like humans are weak and foul things. Choose well when to watch, or risk ruining a light-hearted evening...trol a speed addict must feel.

078322804X|5.0|Jake and Elwood Blues are on a mission from God. Save the orphanage which they were raised in. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are the brothers in black and try to raise money for the biggest blues concert ever. They try to get their band back together and stay out of a crazy woman's trigger range. A church enlightens them and many people do backflips! You better give Aretha Franklin some respect, buddy! The music will have you jumping on your feet and clapping. Oh yes, brother! Testify! I have seen the light! &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; is the best musical to have ever hit the big screen. The car chases are memorable and the race to the bank at the end is history. 'Hut Hut Hut Hut Hut Hut,' yes! The brothers were chased by cowboys, an ex-wife, police, S.W.A.T. teams and more! Too bad the sequel isn't as inspiring.
B00003CWOL|1.0|Kevin Smith is one of those filmakers who will always have a following.  People will see (and even say they like) his movies just because it's Kevin Smith -- sort of like George Lucas' fans.  I couldn't even finish this movie.  And as someone who was raised Catholic, I was looking forward to someone finally ripping on the church.  The acting and the dialogue made me wince.
0783229321|4.0|I remember when Bluto put some mashed potatoes in his mouth and punched his cheeks so all of the food popped out. &quot;I'm a zit, get it?&quot; That was pure immortal. The late John Belushi played the disgusting Bluto and was part of the Delta House. College life was defined in the 1960's: the toga party, the snooping around, the horse trick, and much more. Kevin Bacon is also in this for some reason. Always party hard and break any guitars that deserve to be retired. John Belushi was a comic genius and will always be remembered for this great movie and &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot;
B000023X9W|5.0|I love Neil Young's acoustic style music the best, and when I heard this CD, it warmed my heart. The songs are performed in a simple, down to earth style, and the words and music stay with you long after the album has ended.<br />I can honestly say I love every song on this CD, and I can't say that about many albums! &quot;Without Rings&quot;, &quot;Distant Camera&quot; and &quot;Red Sun&quot; are my favorites, but each song is a true gem. I highly recommend &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;!
038533558X|5.0|This is one of those books that keeps me up all night! I love Harlan Coben, the first book of his that I read was Tell No One, and I just wanted more from him and Gone For Good came out just in time! You really don't know what's going to happen, it keeps you guessing til the end!
B00005YXZH|5.0|First, let me preface my minor rant by saying I'm addicted to this album.  I can't get it out of my head or CD player.<br />I get a kick out of all those crazy kids hung up on alt. country and roots rock knocking this album cause it ain't no AM.  How many years has it been since AM, and they're still holding a grudge?  I bet they're the sames cats who complained about Summerteeth being too pop.  Well alt country is dead as it has reached the point of being derivative, alt for alts sake is just as bad as art for arts sake.  Such a shame as they're cheating themselves, and probably their loved ones too, of one of the greatest heartfelt punk albums ever (Yes, I said PUNK), wait, one of the greatest albums ever.
6305311463|4.0|I am walking a thin line here. Contrary to my previous review, \\"Armageddon\\" has been a personal favorite action movie of mine for some years. But even I admit that it has as much intelligence as a pop-up book. However, I will try to avoid being a serious critic in my review and I will also avoid patronizing. <br />The story is set in the present day (Or in Summer 1998. You decide). A giant asteroid the size of Texas has been spotted coming towards Earth. NASA, led by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) is totally unprepared for such a thing. Worse, they have only 18 days to stop it. The only hope for Earth is to send the world's best deep core oil driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and a team of his drillers to combat the threat. If you don't spend too much time laughing at the improbabilities, you might find some of the dialogue (Intentionally) hilarious. Steve Buscemi is particularly likable as \\"Rockhound\\", a horny geologist (\\"Do you think we'll hazard pay out of this\\"). However, General Kimsey (Keith David) is pretty much correct when he states \\"The fate of the planet is in the hands of a bunch of retards I wouldn't trust with a potato gun\\". <br />The problem with \\"Armageddon\\" is lack of focus. Apparently, the screenwriters think that by putting a romance story into the plot that a larger audience will be attracted to the film. So, a subplot between Stamper's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) and one of his top drillers A.J (Ben Affleck) is put into place. This only drags the film's length and, to add insult to injury, variations of Aerosmith's \\"I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\\" are played during these scenes. I also never felt much for the A.J and Grace characters, since the only signs that they ever love one another are shown by using pretty close ups. <br />I, for one, try to relax when I watch popcorn flicks like this. However, even I noticed how phony this film is. And I am not talking about the plot either. I mean, if you thought \\"2001\\" was unrealistic in it's space travel depiction, check this film out. The sets look like that; Wood and cement, rather than rock and iron. So where did that budget of $100 million or so go? Must have been the bill given to McDonald's for all that merchandising.  <br />In my previous review, I mentioned that the military is shown negatively in this film. While the depiction isn't always positive towards them (The higher ranking leaders attempt to detonate the nuclear device on the asteroid's surface and they don't put much faith in NASA's plan to use drillers), the producers had to have military cooperation in this movie. Thus, most of the scenes showing the training have expensive, high tech military gear and planes as props or in the background shots. Come on, your going to have a briefing in the same hanger that is also occupied by a B-2 stealth bomber and two SR-71 Blackbirds? These civilians (Both on and off the screen) have more opportunity to admire these advanced warplanes than do many of the same military servicemen training them. <br />But, like I said earlier, it would be moronic to take this movie seriously. Like \\"North by Northwest\\", \\"Star Wars\\" and The James Bond Series, this is one movie not to be treated in the same class as \\"The Godfather\\". It's a disaster flick, like \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" or \\"The Towering Inferno\\" and if you take it as fun, pointless and overall escapist entertainment, you will do fine and probably even get a kick out of it.  <br />Now as to whether this film deserved treatment from the Criterion Collection. No doubt, this is a great special edition set, with two audio commentary tracks, a special director's cut and various documentaries on the movie's making. I am just surprised that it is preserved by such a brand name company. But it's satisfying and worth shelling out the dough for.

B00006690F|5.0|I think this is Eminem's best CD to date and it completes Slim's presentation of his personalities.  His production skills have improved so much in this album and even surpasses Dre on some tracks.  and I honestly think that there is no bad song in this album.  It's well worth the wait.  So far, the best album of the year.<br />Good Job Slim!
6305132984|5.0|West Side Story is a very good movie. The way it portray's love between two people who really don't give a *Bleep* about what their friends or family think is just genious! Tony and Maria just give off this vibe of wanting to feel the same love they have for each other. Rita Moreno's performance of \\"Anita\\" is just superb! Her being the only real Latina in the film made it even more special for all Latin people making it today. The film just has all the elements any Musical/Romance/Action film of today that just makes you want to fall in Love all over again. I also suggest Moulin Rouge. They have very much similar points.
B0000025T6|5.0|The above line is a comment I read from a woman evaluating a favorite poem. I apply it here because that is how I feel about Springsteen's NEBRASKA, and because that woman knew what she was talking about. &quot;Intimate&quot; is a decent description of NEBRASKA, but more than anything else I am bowled over by the sheer risk the songs resonate with. And I am not writing of commercial or even artistic risk in releasing such a lo-fi production; I mean the risks implied by the content of the songs and their origins. It is for this reason NEBRASKA is so redeeming. <BR>   I have no idea just how difficult Springsteen's life was while he was composing what would become NEBRASKA but I can only suppose from the musical record that it was a harrowing, perhaps even dangerous time. But listening to it as I have I would not describe the experience of NEBRASKA as depressing or bleak. Springsteen works as hard as anyone could through these songs, and somehow he finds the raw reserves to scream loud and holler as if he's shouting into a vacant highway tunnel. The lyrics are composed, playing restrained and yet the songs are electric. Springsteen's voice summons pathos; it is as simple as what he is singing and how. Desperation finally snaps at the end of &quot;State Trooper&quot; as he pleads for empty highways and late night radio to deliver him; in &quot;Atlantic City&quot; he gambles his last cent praying that love and luck can be resurrected and a listener can tell Springsteen isn't at all sure they can be; nightmares of childhood are confronted but not comforted in &quot;My Father's House&quot;; and with just a guitar, harmonica, his words and voice, Springsteen makes his last song (and the rest of the album) another example of how people find &quot;Reason to Believe.&quot;  <BR>   The songs culminate in a hard-fought, &quot;hard-earned&quot; faith in faith itself; drive long enough and the highway will deliver you where you need to go; sing as strong as you can even when you're weak and rock n roll may deliver you; work hard to earn everyday and you will find &quot;some reason to believe&quot;. NEBRASKA is a testament to how shatteringly experience disappoints, how humble people have to be in order to find something true, and how perseverance is possible, again and again. The most amazing thing is you can sing along, too.
B00005QXDD|5.0|this has got to be the best album i have ever heard
B00003CX8J|3.0|Wa-hoo!  Who wants to be a bad-arse?  Just screw with your DNA and you'll get powers beyond human comprehension.  Melanoma has never looked so good.  Downs Syndrome, Cri-du-Chat, Fragile-X Syndrome all give you what you need to save the world (and one heck of a sexy body to boot).  Or, if you are the patient type, wait out for a loss-of-function effect as Huntington's or Parkinson's.  You'll definitely feel a change.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Yeah, that's right.  A lot of people who considering themselves \\"X-Men\\" elitists will tell you this film was horrible and was nothing like the original comic book.  Well, they're half-right.  Some of the things, like the origin of the entire X-men story were not completely the way they were made.  And customs were different, yadda yadda.  Look, I'm not an expert on them, I only read a few comics and watched the original cartoon.  Oh, and I read some of the Uncanny X-men...all very good stuff.  So, I somewhat know what went on with all the original stuff and let me get one thing straight: All the characters in this movie were perfectly cast.  I know that Rouge's character (played by the young and beautiful Anna Panquin) has been highly criticized.  But what they don't realize, is that this is Rouge when she was younger...so she had not developed her normal \\"strong\\" approach and attitude.  Some people just want to see all flash and bang and are quick to criticize.  Read the damn comic book until you die if this doesn't satisfy you.  As far as comic book movies, this one ranks right up there with the original Batman and Spider-man for greatness.  Anyway, now on to the appeal for the mass audiences...<br />The X-Men takes places while the world is changing and recognizing humans evolving (mutating) into new creatures, per say.  A lot of controversy is stirring and sides are beginning to form in the mutant world, specifically between Magneto and Professor X.  They each have their team of men they aide them in their fight.  It's the typical good vs. bad idea.  Now, Magneto, he wants a mutant called Rouge...she possesses the ability to absorb other peoples' life-forces (and powers if they are mutants).  Magento wants her so he can use her (in a way I won't reveal) to open the eyes of the human public.  Professor X, along with his team of X-men, of course plan to stop Magneto.  There are also many subplots involving Wolverine (his relationship with Rouge and his past) and Magneto and Professor X's relationship.  With intelligent and entertaining dialogue, complex characters, the actors fluidity with each other, good fight scenes, magnificent special effects and an excellent story X-men will not disappoint.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is an amazing movie. Ridley Scott did the right thing and told the actual story of what the soldiers did in the battle without the usual Hollywood exaggerations, fake morals, political correctness, and flag waving.  The action is so fast that it's hard to breathe while watching it on the screen and the realism makes it feel as if you had just run the Mogudishu Mile. Black Hawk Down will leave you feeling exhausted. And by the end, you'll understand a little secret about the soldiers serving in the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force Special Operations Forces, Hoooah.
B000065V1V|4.0|I'm a Bowie fan from way back.  I was 13 when I saw the video for &quot;Fashion&quot;.  I rushed out and bought ChangesTwo which led me to buy Changes and then I rabidly collected all the individual albums.  My interest began to fade as the 80s ended.  Bowie seemed to be going in a direction that simply didn't appeal to me.  Every now and then, I would pick up a new Bowie CD, listen to it a few times with optimism, but eventually sell it off.  Eventually, I just stopped setting myself up for disappointment.  I can honestly say that the only thing that Bowie did in the 90s that I still like to listen to is &quot;Real Cool World&quot; from the &quot;Cool World&quot; soundtrack.  Okay.  So having said all that, I bought &quot;Heathen&quot; today.  Wow.  It's the most relaxed, non-high-concept, rock project I've ever heard from David.  Instead of having to listen again and again to try to like the songs, they immediately felt warm and comfortable.  I've only listened to the entire CD twice, but I know that I'll still be listening to this one years from now.    I promise to write a more detailed review in a couple of days, but in the meantime, do yourself a favor and buy it!
B000065U1N|4.0|A realistic depiction of the chaos and destruction of war.  These brave soldiers were thrown into a situation they could not win.  I can attest to the accurate depiction of Somalia and it's inhabitants.  Having spent a few weeks there, several months before the events depicted in this movie, I am still amazed at the anarchy and disregard for human life.  It was interesting to see primitive huts build on the lawns of sprawling mansions along the beach (several are shown in the movie).  They were built with the ceiling tiles, curtains and carpets torn from the houses.  The occupants used copper kettles for cooking, which were made by melting the electrical wiring in the homes and the telephone lines.  This country was a real world &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;   Ruled by the same sort of thugs we are now fighting in Afganistan.  We went to Somalia unprepared, with no defined mission and weak political will.  The soldiers, as always, suffered the consequences.  Good movie, but it left me depressed and asking...what was the point of us being there?
B00003CXE7|5.0|I first noticed the solid work of Russell Crowe as Preacher in Sharon Stone's gunfighting flick, and with each performance since he has shown he has the makings of a superstar.  LA Confidential was hot at the time when they announced he was doing Gladiator and I thought, I believe this man is going places but a Gladiator???...P>His performance is strong, stoic and yet very moving, showing a fine range. The secondary leads are magnificent, especially Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.  The computer work more than convinces us of the 'cast of thousands' in the battle scenes and the arena.<br />It's great to see this sort of historical drama once again being made and receiving such recognition.<br />As I said, Outstanding!!!
B000002HMH|4.0|...Most of the criticisms of this album revolve around Metallica cutting their hair, being influenced by the grunge/alternative scene in order to make more money, or things like that. To that I would say that this album was not influenced by grunge or alternative at all.<br />Load is the ultimate anti-pop album.  It is quite influenced by blues, believe it or not, and older 70's rock bands such as Black Sabbath.  2 x 4 very well could have been a Sabbath song if it were Ozzy's vocals instead of Hetfield.  In an era of alternative, grungle, and old-school metal, Metallica went entirely in a new anti-pop direction. Their own direction, like they have always done.<br />This album is very experimental in everything from the riffs to the song arrangements.  It has a number of good songs such as 2 x 4, The House Jack Built, Hero of the Day, and Until It Sleeps.  And The Outlaw Torn is quite possibly the best song in the history of Metallica.  But with that said, there are a few songs that keep this from being a 5 star album like Master of Puppets and (surprise) Reload were.  Poor Twisted Me is a flat-out bad song and Wasting My Hate is a bit less than successful.  The songs do not flow together as well as other Metallica albums.<br />Overall, this is a good album that music lovers will appreciate.  Most old-school fans (I love Metallica's older music too) will probably like this album if they're willing to give it a listen.  And if you're one of those people who like to put down Metallica because its so trendy these days...actually listen to the music, you'll probably like it.
B00003CX95|5.0|I saw Gone With the Wind when I was a child, and many times since, and like true classics you will find something to love about the film each time.  Braveheart is a classic such as this.<br />Okay, there are vast inaccuracies, so I will not bother to address them all for it would take pages.  Randall Wallace did the screen play (had never heard of William until a vacation in Scotland!!) maintains you should never let historical facts get in the way of a good screenplay and he went to great length to demonstrate this!!  But what was a so so story of Wallace rising against Longshanks, is refined and fleshed out by Mel as director.  It is a long movie, and yet the pace is quick, with super battle sequences (though the Battle of Sterling Bridge is fought with the bridge here!!).<br />I do take umbrage at the very unfair treatment of Robert the Bruce, shown fighting on the English side.  At that point, he had been commanded to turn over his daughter as hostage/guarantee to Longshanks to insure he remained loyal to the British side.  He had refused to do so, which meant he would have never been with the British host at Falkirk.  There was no need to besmirch Bruce's character in order to make Wallace the super hero.  Both played pivotal roles in the fight for Scottish freedom.<br />Patrick McGoohan (Secret Agent, Prisoner) is frighteningly perfect as Longshanks.  Angus MacFadden is gorgeous as Bruce.  Sophia Marceau is radiant as the Edward II's Princess.  Ian Bannen give his usual strong character support as Bruce the elder.<br />Just forget history.  There are plenty of good books out there if you wish to get the real facts of Wallace.  What Mel delivers as director and as Wallace is a deeply moving, beautiful tale that catches the spirit of Wallace.<br />Any movie that makes William Wallaces known around the world has more than fulfilled is purpose.
B000002HRE|5.0|First of all, the disclaimer.  This is not a thrash metal album and it never tries to be.  Metallica has always played what they want to play and never listened to anyone....fan or critic alike.  Reload is an intricate combination of metal riffs, blues/jazz/country influenced guitar, and even southern rock.  Metallica shows their strong musicianship, creativity, and innovation in a way that is unparalled in an often stale world of hard rock and heavy metal.  <br />This album, despite the varying influences going in it, is very unified musically and flows very well from song to song (unlike Load and the Black Album, which are more experimental and seem  choppy at times).  It is heavy where it needs to be heavy, and soft where it needs to be soft.  Hetfield's vocals are far improved from earlier efforts before the Load era.  <br />Most songs on the album work very well.  The Unforgiven II, Where the Wild Things Are, Prince Charming, and Fixxxer stand out as the highlights while Better Than You and Fuel seem a bit weak compared to the rest of the album.  <br />To summarize, if you're a fan of good music in general, then you will probably like this genre-bending album.  If you're one who likes to go along with the crowd and criticize Metallica no matter what they do, then you might as well skip this one...you probably can't handle it.
B00005JKO3|5.0|Heston did so many 'costumers' it was easy to over look just how magnificent some were and this is one of the best.  My favourite is the quieter War Lord, but El Cid never fails to move me.  It works on many levels, the breathtaking epic, the love story between Heston and Loren, with the secondary characters, especially John Fraser and Herbert Lom, giving fine performances. The jousting sequences outstanding, the location work panoramic....a true experience.
B000003TA4|3.0|Okay, let's bring a bit of reason to the discussion.  This isn't the greatest album of all-time.  It isn't the most important rock album ever, nor is it even the best grungle album of all-time.  There is little musicianship at all to this....just a bunch of heroin-inspired poetry set to one riff songs.  <br />Now with that said, I must say that this is an overall good record.  The lyrics express true emotion and feeling, while the riffs (even if there are only one in each song) are catchy.  Cobain was a very innovative musician and quite a few people have tried to imitate his sound.  <br />For the good music, good lyrics, innovation, and the fact that this album killed off glam rock and hair bands, I give it three stars.
B000065U1N|3.0|My three star ranking is for the dvd, not the movie itself.  I LOVED this movie, so have been waiting anxiously for release of the dvd, which I bought as soon as it came out.  I was very disappointed.  There is one 20 minute on the set featurette and that's it for the special features.  It doesn't even include the theatrical trailer (it does have two trailers for different movies); no deleted scenes, nothing else.  I actually went through the menus three times because I assumed I must have been missing something.  Of course I would have bought the DVD anyway, just because I love the movie so much, but it was still a letdown.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I was looking for something special for the 100th review I'm writing for Amazon (although I can't seem to find all of the other 99).  Originally it was going to be \\"The Godfather\\", which is as special as it gets, but I just happened to finish this, and I guess one Coppola-Brando masterpiece is as good as the other.  I'll have to save Vito and the boys for number 200.  <br />I first saw the original when it came out over twenty years ago.  It was, of course, in a theatre, and while I liked it, it didn't move me in a manner that I felt it should.  A big reason was that the film was visually dark.  Since then I have learned that many theatres will dim the expensive movie bulbs to save money, and doing that to this film should have been a felony.<br />No such problem with the DVD, and I feel I'm seeing a brand-new film, which it just about is.  First, the parts in the orginal movie.  Just about everything is rich in vibrant colors that just pop my eyes out.  Even the scenes that should be dark, like the final ones where we finally see Marlon Brando, are beautifully done.  <br />The story involves a military assassin's mission to kill one of his own during the Vietnam war.  The target is an officer who has gone insane from the war.  While the mission is officially assigned, it's top secret and in another way, doesn't exist.  <br />Most of the movie consists of a trip up a river into Cambodia where Martin Sheen seeks out Marlon Brando.  The movie makes several stops where the crew encounter experiences that show them the insanity that war causes.  The most famous one is where he meets a colonel, played by Robert Duvall, who attacks a village mostly because the waves for surfing are to his liking.  We also see a sort-of USO show featuring Playboy playmates, and a battleground that seems to have nobody in charge.  The insanity builds with each encounter, and increases even more when he finally gets to his destination.  <br />The \\"redux\\" involves almost half a conventional movie more of footage.  While some of the shorter scenes help flesh out characters, two major scenes take up most of the extra time.  These involve a second encounter with the playmates, and an extended scene where they encounter a family of stubborn French colonialists.  While we do see more points of view about the war from these, I think they detract from the mission.  While it surprised me that Sheen actually gets laid twice during this adventure, and I usually welcome nudity, this time I could have done without it. <br />However, once again, the visual clarity of the film, and the fact that it's a masterpiece make the whole thing worth seeing in this format.  Sheen is lean and mean, Brando is big and mean, Duval is goofy and mean, and Lawrence Fishburn is literally a boy in this movie.  I believe Dennis Hopper got his comeback in this movie.  And does anyone connect the boat chief (Albert Hall) with the judge in the recently deceased \\"Ally McBeal\\"? <br /> See the things you learn from reading these reviews?

B000001GBJ|5.0|Songs from a Secret Garden is just a spectacular album. Being Irish and always enjoying the music, I was overjoyed when I bought this CD and finally got the chance to sit down and listen to it. It's truly magical and enchanting and one of the best instrumental/few vocal CD's I have ever heard.
0440180295|5.0|This book is not quite like anything else I've read.  I guess I could call it a fatalist's account of the firebombing of Dresden, but I don't think this does it justice.<br />I enjoyed it for the style of its writing and its recurring themes (death, sex, fatalism, and time, among others), and not so much for the plot or the characters -- which I agree aren't that interesting, except for Kilgore Trout and the Tralfamadorians.  The style of writing is humorously matter-of-fact throughout, though the issues Vonnegut brings up are serious.  As for the plot, there's not much to say, but I don't think I should give it away in this review.  In short, if you like thoughtfully-written fiction, read this book.<br />Now, in response to some other reviews I've read on this site: I'm a bit puzzled by those who characterize this as an anti-war book.  Yes, Vonnegut does seem to be implying that war is absurd, but he seems to think that almost everything about modern life is absurd.  I didn't like this book because it showed me the horrors of war (I already knew that war is horrible); I liked it because it showed the war from a perspective I had never seen before.  I enjoyed seeing things from Billy Pilgrim's reflective and supremely fatalistic point of view.<br />In fact, I got the impression that Vonnegut was parodying Billy's anti-war sentiments, such as when he pleas to the Trafalmadorians, \\"How can a planet live at peace?\\"  Or, in one of my favorite passages, when Billy watches the war movie backwards and sees factories dismantling bombs, \\"separating the dangerous contents into minerals.  Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work.  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas.  It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.  The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids.  And Hitler turned into a baby... \\"  I think that Vonnegut was smart enough to realize that he could no sooner stop wars than glaciers.<br />I also doubt that we are supposed to take the \\"philosophy\\" of the Tralfamadorians seriously.  To those of you who do: do you really think that Vonnegut wrote this book because he believed that we should all \\"ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones\\"?  C'mon, give him more credit than that!
B000065U1N|4.0|The movie Black Hawk Down is based on a true story, as narrated by author and newspaper reporter Mark Bowden in his book of the same title. It retells the events of October 4, 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, when two U.S. Army Ranger Black Hawk helicopters were shot down during what was mean to be a short and relatively one-sided special operations mission. <br />When the battle was over, nearly 100 U.S. special operations servicemen --- Rangers and Delta Force --- were dead or wounded with, according to the History Channel, anywhere between 1,000 and 10,000 Somalis dead, including women and children who had participated in the battle as heavily armed combatants. <br />The battle and the heavy U.S. losses were credited with then-President Clinton's ill-fated decision to withdraw from Somalia, a decision that may still haunt the United States today in its action in Afghanistan. (Osama Bin Laden has taken credit for funding the Somalis responsible for the shooting down of the Black Hawks.)<br />While the movie depicts a fairly one-sided \\"them vs. us\\" simplification of the action in Somalia, at the tactical level the action did probably come down to just that for the U.S. servicemen involved.  Not as heavy in character development nor in explaining why exactly our men were in harm's way as, for example in We Were Soldiers, Black Hawk Down is still an incredible story and a very compelling movie to watch, particularly if you are interested in modern-day war.  <br />Ridley Scott makes no effort to make war look pleasant and while he's clearly going more for the action genre that propelled movies like Aliens to blockbuster success, in my opinion he does a very adequate job of covering the events surrounding a terribly miscalculated mission and describes how the men caught in the maelstrom of violence do the best they can with what they are given, with one common goal:  to survive and to get out of harm's way.<br />Definitely not for the squeamish, Black Hawk Down is an attractive, compelling, well-acted, violent, and thoroughly entertaining movie that pulls no punches.  Even though it simplifies the complexities of war and America's relatively new role as the world's police force, I think very few that watch the movie will not also be moved to think about the events.   While not a political movie, nor necessarily a politically correct one, Black Hawk Down does make one realize that, no matter whether the causes have always been right or the high-level leadership decisions correct, down in the trenches, the average soldier impacted is truly a hero and does the best he or she can with what they are given, performing a very important job that few of us would want to do in their stead.
B000065V1V|5.0|After having the disc on repeat throughout this evening, every nerve ending felt the absolute power presented in the collection of compositions. A cohesive journey, from the ceremonial tinged of &quot;Sunday&quot; to the shear  beauty of &quot;The Angels Have Gone&quot;. I wonder if the darker reviews written can only feel a disposable surface and not the ability for sublime depth? Bowie's vocals sound off with strength and velocity . The collaboration between Tony Visconti and Bowie once again proves a genuine meeting of the minds! Even the songs that had sounded disjointed within the line-up hearing the Real Audio SoundBits flow with grace and conviction. The romance of &quot;I Would Be Your Slave&quot; and the longing for understanding in &quot;A Better Future&quot; provides me with a classic to be endeared for years to come.<br />I may say that I cannot link or even fathom putting this in any comparison with other musical wonderment's of Bowie career simply because  my heart is not that easy to compartmentalize , but knowing that creates a continued excitement for the future work of David Bowie.
0374172897|3.0|To do this story justice I will admit that I have never read Virginia Woolf and having said that, any reader is at a severe disadvantage if they have not read Mrs. Dalloway.  The Hours, was apparently the working title for that novel.<br />  Much of Cunningham's acclaim has stemmed from his ability to weave his story into the Mrs. Dalloway story line and create a fictional account of Virginia Woolf as she imagines the idea of Mrs. Dalloway, writes the novel and eventually commits suicide.<br />  I found the story ordinary and at times tedious as I tried to make sense of these characters and the jumping back and forth between them and time periods.  I kept reading and waiting for something to happen, for some turn of events that would tie everything together.  I was finally vindicated in the end as Cunningham spectacularly did tie all his characters and events into an amazing web that was reaveled in the last ten pages of the book.  But, is a read worth the last ten pages of a book?<br />  I found his writing style poetic and his descriptions of characters unique in his observations.  If I had been better versed in Virginia Woolf or had read Mrs. Dalloway, I may have enjoyed the story more or been able to appreciate Mr. Cunningham's clever parallel's in his story.  As it stands, I found the book mildly enjoyable with a redeeming ending.
B00003CXC6|5.0|I recently launched my quest to watch classic movies by Kurosawa by watching first, Seven Samurai, then Yojimbo and finally Rashomon. Of the three, Rashomon is my favorite with it's presentation of four contradictory accounts of a murder. The perspectives are from a bandit, the dead man's wife, the dead man himself(through a medium) and finally a humble peasant. All the stories have a grain of truth but all the stories also contradict each other. As I was watching the movie, the peasant's story seemed to tie up the loose ends except that for the fact that a notorious bandit like Tajomaru does not get that way by being a snivelling coward. He had surely killed many people before and dispatching the noble man in cold blood would not be as difficult for him as the peasant seems to suggest. Then it turns out that the peasant had a reason of his own for fabricating the story. <BR>Who is telling the truth? Personally, I believe the dead man. Watch Rashomon and make up your own mind.
B000065U1N|3.0|This is at best a single dimensional movie with very little to offer other that more obfuscation of American foreign policy.<br />Very little characterisation and not even the full facts! As action movies go, this one would surely make John Wayne proud!<br />Nice gross, pity about the movie!
B000065U1N|4.0|I initially gave this a 2-star rating because of the Regional Coding Enhancement problems I had with my DVD player.  I resolved the digital audio playback problem on my Playstation 2 optical connection and did find that the audio is much better than my first viewing of the movie.  It still would have been nice if they released a DTS version of this.  Good enough I guess.
0553579908|5.0|Good and evil, dark and light swirl to gether to be become as gray as the wolf the graces the banners of house Stark.  There are characters on all sides who I can't help rootingfore even though they are often on opposing sides.  Of course, a character might swich causes at the next twist of the plot- you just never know.  It is great!  <BR>I also really enjoy the fantastic writing.  I hope they put these books on audio *unabradged*!
B000065U1N|2.0|The reason I give this only 2 stars is that when I got the DVD home and went to play on my Panasonic(region free) DVD player it would not read the disk.  I found that some DVDs are now using this &quot;Regional Coding Enhancement&quot; or RCE and have problems on some players.  I tried the disk in my PC DVD and it worked fine.  This is the first time I have ever had a problem.  I knew the movie did not support DTS prior to purchase but when I tried it on my Playstation 2, which I have connected to my DTS surround theatre with optical cable, I discovered it would not even run on Dolby Digital.  Hmmm???  How cheesy is this?  I could not believe it. Upon closer analysis of the packaging, sure enough it reads &quot;Digitally mastered audio&quot; and English 5.1.  The cover art even advertises the fact that the movie won awards for &quot;Best Film Editing&quot; and, hello, &quot;Best Sound&quot;!!  Too bad the DVD has sub-par sound.  I liked the movie in the theatres and I am a big fan of war movies but it is too bad Columbia Pictures had to skimp on the audio support.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Sam Mendes' Dark, yet enthralling drama about life in the suburbs and the horror it sometimes brings into the life of the typical American family is a masterpiece of American film. The hustle to get the newest things, have the biggest house, be the most popular and to basically have everything you envy, is at the base of this academy award winning film. This movie makes you do exactly what the advertisements say which is to LOOK CLOSER...<br />This movie opens your eyes to the seemingly normal families living in the suburbs of America. This movie tells the story of the Burnham's, Lester(played masterfully in an academy award winning role by Kevin Spacey) the family Patriarch who is in love with his high school daughter's best friend, Carolyn Burnham(in a stellar performance that was academy award nominated, by Annette Benning), who is a real estate agent, with aspirations to be as big as the supposed \\"KING\\" of real estate. The Daughter of this couple is played very well by Thora Birch. The acting in this movie will leave you dumbfounded saying \\"how can someone act like that\\". <br />This movie is an instant classic with inventive supporting characters, Ricky the marijuana selling, videotaping neighbor. He videotapes everything he can and seemingly has explanations for all of it. The psychotic, image obsessed friend of the Burnham's Daughter(played by Mena Suvari) who says she would consider having an affair with Lester. <br />The bottom line is that this movie is probably one of the best movies in recent memory. It will leave you wanting for more and you will want to watch it again and again.  Sam Mendes in his directorial debut could not have done a better job with this film. The cinematography, writing, backgrounds and the little objects and the character's nuances are dead on. One viewing of this film will have you saying ...<br />LOOK CLOSER
B000002RJN|5.0|All of Gene Clark's albums are superb, but this one has a character and dimension that is truly a cut above.  Perhaps it was madman Thomas Jefferson Kaye's production, perhaps it was  the unlimited studio time and blockbuster budget, or perhaps simply it was the ample supply of drugs, but whatever it was it WORKED.  \\"Strength of Strings\\" has the bombast of Gimme Shelter mixed with the apocolyptic tone of All Along the Watchtower, and it is a certified classic.  \\"No Other\\" is as weird as Gene gets, and it's pretty strange to hear GC's country-folk underpinnings surrounded by Pink Floyd production techniques, but again, it WORKED.  Overall, a brilliant example of the breathtaking chances that once were taken in music, sadly no longer the case much anymore (with some exceptions).
B000003Z12|5.0|Truly a 5 star rating....  I would have never discovered Neal Schon on his own hadn't it been for the technology of listening to any CD at my local [store].   I am an avid, die-hard Journey fan but Neal has given this CD his own self.  I loved it the minute I heard it...  great music for work, home, car....even my kids of 12 and 9 like it.  Will definitely buy more Neal!
B00003CXI1|1.0|When &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot; hit the bookstores in 1997, it quickly established the kind of popularity which makes a film version all but inevitable. For four years straight, J.K. Rowling churned out books in what has become one of the most popular contemporary children's book series. Now, of course, attention has been turned to adapting them for film.<br />If they can't even get the title right, what hope does the rest of the movie have?<br />The cast is a mixed bag. Harry himself is played very well by Daniel Radcliffe, best known (before this) for his portrayal of David Copperfield for the BBC. Alan Rickman is brilliant as Prof. Snape; Dame Maggie Smith would have been better as Prof. McGonagall if she dropped the &quot;Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; accent. Richard Harris an Robbie Coltraine look their roles as Dumbledore and Hagrid respectively, but seem incapable of acting them. As for Harry's classmates, well, Rupert Grint, as Ron, gets little to do but react facially, Emma Watson is insufferable as Hermione, Tom Felton fails to exude any malice as Malfoy, and the rest are just there.<br />The filmmakers went out of their way to make the film look as good as possible, which I can greatly appreciate. Unfortunately, that care didn't extend to anything else. Screenwriter Steven Kloves seems completely ignorant of the basic rules for adapting a book to screen; he retains extraneous bits while cutting vital plot progressions. Moreover, he gives thoroughly English characters thoroughly American turns of phrase. Director Chris Columbus does a very shoddy job of pacing; he could have kept in all seven of those deleted scenes and still come out with a shorter movie if he'd just kept things moving.  The flavor and the magic of the book are just drained out of this movie.<br />And now we have the DVD. There are one or two interesting bits to it, like the deleted scenes, the trivia, and a short amalgam of behind-the-scenes interviews, but the rest is convoluted nonsense that - rather like the movie, actually - takes much longer than it needs to and is wholly unsatisfying by the end. <br />I say forget about this cinematic mediocrity and settle down for a good read.

B000068IEU|5.0|well finally, as people have often said concerning this title...this dvd promises a 94 min. cut!!!i don't have to tell those that have already seen this classic how good it is, and now i guess it gets better!!! this film is flawless in its execution of pronounced sheer terror,rivaled only by the great \\"texas chainsaw massacre (1974)\\".it really dosen't get any better than this...made in a time when sex and violence were only seen in the back alleys of big cities in porn shops..last house really delivers the shocks,even by todays standards...the part of \\"krug stillo\\" played by david hess is one of the best antagonists to grace the silver screen(along with \\"frank booth\\" dennis hopper from the film blue velvet)...\\"last house on the left\\" has already secured itself in cult horror film status....and i believe it is one of the best in the modern era of the genre...
B0000640VN|5.0|Leopold is my new hero. He's not only a gentlemen, but he's a gentleman with moral absolutes. So much in our world is gray, that it's refreshing to meet someone who knows what he stands for. As a movie, it's a great romantic comedy. Who cares if it's \\"believeable\\". It's a wonderful escape from the threat of terrorist attacks and the rising jobless rate. The only thing I didn't care for was the amount of profanity. A couple of times it just didn't fit. At one point Leopold says, \\"Where the hell am I?\\" Leopold was an English gentlemen in 1876 and would NOT have used that kind of language. I think it could have been toned down a little in that area. The PG-13 rating is probably appropriate because of the language, but there is nothing else offensive in the movie.

B000066JES|5.0|I was privilleged to see Metal Kings in concert recently so I knew one of the songs on the album which is \\"Warriors of the World\\".This album is different in a sense that Kings use classical music and ballads for 60% of the album.But it worked out great since it again proved Eric Adams to be one of the most powerful singers in metal today.Singing \\"Nessum Dorma\\" definitely takes some balls but Eric passed that test with honors.The other 40% of the album is simply awesome.The lyrics are still agressive and music is still of the highest quality.Joey, Karl and Scott do not dissapoint(did they ever?).Being an amateur bodybuilder I added this album in my music selection where it joined jewels such as \\"Hell on Wheels\\",\\"Fighting the World\\" and other Manowar albums.There's nothing better than blasting \\" I will hunt you down and tare you limb from limb\\" while squatting with 405lbs on your back.Once again HAIL!HAIL!HAIL TO THE METAL KINGS!!!
B000065V9P|5.0|Even though Peter Gabriel's work has always appeared to be intimate and personal, he really took it a step further on _Us_, probably his most underrated album as well as one of his best.  As the liner notes explain, the songs on _Us_ were inspired by and about the relationships that Peter Gabriel had with women (specifically about the break-up of his marriage a few years earlier, and his relationships with actress Rosanna Arquette).  Therefore, _Us_ is a deeply emotional album that shows the artist coming to terms with not only the relationships he had with women, but also coming to terms with himself.<br />The album starts off with the restrained bombast of &quot;Come Talk To Me&quot;, which showcases some of Gabriel's most vivid lyrics of his career: &quot;In the swirling, curling storm of desire unuttered words hold fast/With reptile tongue, the lightning lashes towers built to last.&quot;  From there, perhaps the finest song on the album, &quot;Love to be Loved&quot; displays one of the most honest songs ever about having the need to be with someone: &quot;And in this moment, I need to be needed/With this darkness all around me, I like to be liked/In this emptiness and fear, I want to be wanted/Cause I love to be loved.&quot;  Altho the instrumentation on the album is very unique - ranging from ambient keyboard textures to more straight-forward &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;-style rock (&quot;Steam&quot;) - the best moments on the album occur when Gabriel's voice is pushed to the forefront with very little music behind it.  There are moments like these in each of the first three songs - and they are truly spine-tingling and represent the true intimacy of this album.  Elsewhere, &quot;Steam&quot; and &quot;Kiss That Frog&quot; are the only 'up' songs on the album, &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; is perfectly aggressive and beautiful, and the closing song &quot;Secret World&quot; should appease fans that miss the &quot;prog&quot; days of Gabriel's career.<br />_Us_ wasconsidered the commercial follow-up to the hugely successful _So_ and therefore it often seemed to be slagged for not living up to expectations, as well as failing at duplicating the success of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; with &quot;Steam&quot; (the heavily promoted single at the time).  However, it's a different beast than _So_ and should be judged on its own terms.  It's an album that might not hit you at first, but definitely sinks in with repeated listenings - and once it does, it will be with you forever.  Highly recommended.
0375703764|4.0|I don't even know where to start. This book is like nothing I've ever read before. It's unexplainably intruiging, oddly interesting, and creativly terrifying. It's think-out-of-the-box craziness. But that's just it- it's better than all that. The insane thing about this book is that it's better than anyone knows. This book is the best book in history, only no one understands it enough to realize this, except the author.<br />Along with all those wonderful things, House of Leaves is confusing, a bit dragging, and often like wading through thick mudd in search of something you have never seen before. But underneath all that is purely incredible literature that I can't even begin to explain.<br />And heck, I haven't even finished it yet. I'm still wadding through that Mudd that I was talking about.<br />In conclusion, this book is unexplainibly good. It's a winding staircase leading to horror movie than doesn't exist except for on the staircase that somehow forgot to wind. <br />This book is pure craziness... only it's a little muddy.
B000005JA8|1.0|It blew me clear back to a re-appreciation of the finer points of Donny and Marie's simple melodic pop again. This album is so universally bad on all fronts that all the previous 5 star ratings become worthless symbols. Don't take my word for it. Listen to the samples. Does it make you hunger for more than a 30 second bite? If so, go right ahead: buy it and write a five star review of your own. But for me, I'll take Donny and Marie over this any day. At least worthless fluff has some real cheese value. Worthless noise such as Trout Mask Replica is just an annoyance and a $[money] hole in your wallet.<br />How can it be \\"tuneless, raspy and very cryptic lyric-wise\\" but also be \\"a brilliant album\\"?  Answer: it can't.  It's just some hippies that wasted a year of their lives on a failed experiment.  Don't waste even a minute of your lives on it!  Repeated listenings do not help.  Trust me.
0871137380|5.0|Cheers to author Mark Bowden.  Thanks to his incredibly dedicated research and excellent storytelling ability, he was able to  resurrect the quickly fading memory of America's military &quot;debacle&quot; in Somalia and give the troops who fought (and died) there their proper due.  For the most part, Bowden doesn't get bogged down with the details of WHY the U.N. and American troops were in Somlaia in the first place (though he does give enough of an overview to set the proper context), nor does he go in depth  into how Somalia descended into lawlessness.  Bowden's story is of the soldiers, and it is a story he tells as well as any combat chronicler has ever done.<br />Bowden focusses on the soldiers of Delta Force and of the U.S. Army Rangers who on October 3, 1993, were sent on a daylight mission ointo the section of Mogadishu controlled by Warlord Mohamed Aidid two apprehend two of Aided's top lieutenants.  Despite popular perceptions (fueled by the media) that the mission was a disaster, it was actually a tactical success.  The force captured its targets and at the same time inflicted tremendous casualties (many times their own) on Aided's forces.  Unfortunately, the political leadership in the U.S. and the American media focussed intead on the two downed Blackhawk helicopters and the deaths of 18 soldiers.  What was overlooked was the fact that the American casualties were among America's most elite fighters who had all volunteered to join the units they were in with the expectation that they would someday get tested in real combat.  Bowden drives this point home relentlessly.<br />The battle scens in the book are incredibly detailed and told from every point of view (even that of the Somalis, some of whom Bowden interviewed).  Bowden is also scrupulously fair, letting the participants speak for themselves and not censoring them when they criticize each other.  The book's most valuable portion, however, is the epiloge, where Bowden reports the soldiers' biggest disappointment was that right after the battle,  President Clinton, pushed by Congress, decided to get out of Somalia and leave Aidid in place.  In other words, they had fought the battle in vain.<br />Overall, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is one of the best military history books written in the past decade or so.disappointment was that right after the battle,  President Clinton, pushed by Congress, decided to get out of Somalia and leave Aidid in place.

B000065V1V|4.0|Bowie brought back Tony Visconti to assist in the creation of another high quality artistic endeavor.  Slick as this cd is, Bowie is one of those few artists who never fails to deliver new and exciting music possibilities whether he is reworking tracks from other songwriters or striking out on his own.   I highly recommend you take a listen to Slow Burn and Afraid.
B000066C1N|5.0|Sorry, but all of those exclamation marks were necessary to convey just how BRILLIANT this soundtrack is! At first, when i heard the songs in the theater and online, i thought that the songs were nice and cool and all, but that bryan Adams wasn't that great. That's all changed. I bought the soundtrack even though I had a few doubts about his voice, and now it's grown on me. I wouldn't have anyone else replace him. The songs are simply brilliant, with beautiful lyrics and meaning. The words do their job of making you understand the landscape and they paint a nice picture in your mind. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who loves the movie, or just anyone. Though it DOES help if you've seen the movie.....oh well. Whatever. Even if you haven't seen the movie, buy the CD anyways! NOOOOW! I command you! ha ha. Just kidding :)
0790736039|4.0|I first saw this movie on ABC in the fall of 1990. Though it was scary, it was rather tame compared to the book (which I *did* read and is more gruesome than the movie). The acting was very good from both the adult actors (huge thumbs-up for Tim Curry as Pennywise/IT) and child actors (especially Ben Heller as young Stanley). I can understand why some Stephen King fans might be upset to see his book \\"butchered\\" or altered or whatever, but it's a 1000+ page book. The producers and writers took artistic license, and did a good job.<br />This is a great movie to watch on a weekend night, or a rainy afternoon. I really recommend it.

0312954468|4.0|This fast, highly addictive novel may not be historically accurate, but it's a hell of a lot more fun than most historical fiction. I loved Taita. Ok, yeah, he was vain and could be really arrogant (Constantly reminding us of how beautiful he is), but he was so REAL. He was imperfect, he had his faults, and that is what made him real. I admit that he has altogether too many talents for a eunuch concubine in ancient Egypt (surgeon, lipreader, great kisser, architect, inventor, scholar, etc.), but I was willing to suspend disbelief on some of these points. What I don't understand is how the author could have written such a real character, then have all the supporting players flat and boring. I mean really, what did Lostris have going for her? She was sweet and gorgeous. And that's it. Tanus was the strong, sexy macho man. He just had absolutely no personality. And how about Taita's master, whose name escapes me? He was evil, vile, and a child molester, for no good reason. He had no purpose except to make threats to Taita and provide a reason for his castration. <BR>  In conclusion, I'll just say that if you like adventure and escapist fiction, this is for you. If you want an accurate history of ancient Egypt, turn and walk the other way. <BR>  P.S. I dare you to read this and NOT love Taita. You won't know why, he'll annoy the hell out of you, but you will fall in love with him anyway.
B0000640VN|4.0|I had been told that to truly enjoy this romantic comedy, I needed to suspend belief, not think about time travel as a reality, and then just sit back and be entertained.<br />I followed this good advice and really liked this movie for what it was....light, bright, and entertaining with no deep underlying message or dark side. Lots of laughs, some pratfalls, and an enjoyable couple of hours.<br />Meg Ryan played her usual light comedy role with presence and her effervescent charm. Hugh Jackman was marvelous in his depiction of a chivalrous 19th century nobleman set adrift on the unfamiliar terrain of today's New York City. A good supporting cast is in place as well. When the Ryan and Jackman characters meet, sparks fly and romance begins.
B00005JKJA|1.0|If anyone needs proof that a brilliant mind borders on insanity, he need look no further than Mulholland Drive.  Being a fan of deep, complex plot driven films that take you on a twisting and turning adventure, I looked forward to the latest installment from David Lynch.  However, this movie took me on a twisted trip that never ended.  The movie was like two separate films in one...joined by a common cast but fragmented in every other way.  Strong performances by the lead actresses did little to hide the weak plot that was thinly hidden amongst a barrage of twists and turns that aimed to keep you wondering what was going on so that you wouldn't realized that in actuality, nothing was going on.  David Lynch's brilliant mind for movies has edged further from the realm of reality and close to insanity in this film.  To make matters worse, the DVD did not feature chapter breaks, therefore making backing up to reexamine a scene a pain.
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie has actually become more enjoyable as the years have passed.  The reason for it is plain:  nostalgia.  Never has an entertainment act had such a profound impact on the world as the Beatles.  The innocence and simplicity of the movie make it a treat to watch and it's full of funny moments.  It's silly, but fun silly.  The Beatles seemed born to be in front of the camera with their wry and irreverent senses of humor.  The fact that 2 of the Beatles are now gone makes it even more of a treasure to be able to see the lads in their youthful exuberance.  Hard to believe how much they had changed just a few laters as they experimented w/ drugs, protested the war and so forth.  John Lennon, in particular, is almost unrecognizable as the same person from 1964 to 1968.  The world is very different now than it was when this film was made, watch it and reflect on a time that we will not experience again!
B00005YU1O|5.0|A stunning film, both visually and philosophically.  &quot;Waking Life&quot; takes you into a world where dreams and reality are indistinguishable, and the ideas and concepts proposed are thought-provoking.  The animation allows you to view the film in  a more abstract way; the ideas flow around you as the images flow over you.<br />Extras include behind-the-scenes footage of how the animations were produced (yay, Macintosh computers!), as well as come of the unanimated footage.<br />A brilliant film, and the extras are fantastic.
B000050XEI|5.0|Loved this woman! This CD is the best. Very melodic and hypnotic. When I saw her on this years (2002) Acadamy awards (for The Lord Of The Rings) I was hooked. I had purchased all her other CD before, but this one stands out. I had never seen her perform before. A real tret!<br />I also like the fact she is now being playe don more contemporary stations so to get more exposure to the younger crowd. New Age music could be well represented by her.<br />This CD is charming and has an underling message that is pretty obvious when you listen to all the songs and their meaning. Buy this one!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Buy this DVD.  Buy it right now.  If you have seen it, you should already own it.  If you haven't seen it, buy it so you can finally understand what the hell everyone else is talking about.<br />Outstanding performances by Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham-Carter.<br />Buy it.
B00003CXTG|3.0|It has a terribly cliched love triangle and scenes that are cut and chopped together in a pointless manner. Only when the attack on Pearl and the 30 seconds over Tokyo in the ending are we treated to an epic spectacle. Unfortunately, the remaining two hours is fairly standard and boring stuff. I like the stars but few are very good. Affleck is a good actor but I dont think anyone could have made such silly dialogue plausible. Its worth watching for the amazing battle scenes, which are to be honest hard to watch since they vividly represent a traumatic time in American history. I recommend renting it, unless you are a die hard fan of WWII films.

0671027344|5.0|From the very first words Charlie begins with, I could already tell that he was about to tell things he would never tell anyone out loud. In Stephen Chbosky's debut novel, the character he creates in Charlie is not only familiar, but real.<br /> Charlie starts his short, but amazing story of an anti-social person's view of the ultimate high school experience. But Charlie's anti-social ability definitely isn't about despising those equal peers around him, he's just the type of kid that would rather sit there and observe the moment. Sometimes, cherish the moment. Feeling infinite. That specific characteristic of his reminded myself of me.<br /> He's in ninth grade, and he doesn't have many friends his own age. Instead, he somehow gets involved with a close group of seniors. Just because they smoke, drink, and experience with sex, doesn't mean they're horrible teenagers. Though Charlie is confused by their ways at first, after spending more time with them, he slowly begins to see that it's all just a part of growing up. A way of finding who you really are. Charlie grows too close to the senior bunch, but only two in particular are his favorite people in the whole world. Sam, who he is gorgeously in love with, but can never be with, and her brother Patrick, who has a secret that he soon reveals.<br /> Charlie also mentions a lot about his Aunt Helen, who passed away long ago, and is the only one that frequently reminded him he was loved. He also mentions quite a few moments about his older brother and sister, and how they have helped him learn a thing or two.<br /> Later, I noticed that Charlie is too sweet and considerate with people that he doesn't take the time to deal with himself. As soon as he does, he finds himself lonely and depressed, trying to take back what he just did. The Perks of Being a Wallflower isn't just about one boy. It's more about the boy's beautiful, deeply emotional look on life, love, and relationships. And he describes everything with just theright amount of insight and inspiration. You'll want to hug Charlie by the end and never let go.
B0000640VN|5.0|This movie does have elements of many genres, including science fiction, romance, and comedy, and is broad enough to be appealing to viewers of both genders. In fact, I think some of the male-interaction scenes, of which there are many, are perhaps more interesting to the men than the women. If not interesting, then at least educational: men, pay attention! There are some great old-school clues in here for wowing your women. As for the women, there's Hugh Jackman, so what else do you need? :)
B00000G3PA|1.0|When I saw this movie, I wasn't expecting Oscar quality material.  It's just I'd like to see SOME quality come out of the story/script.  I like some mindless 'splosions just as much as the next guy but is it too much to ask for something more.<br />1.  The only quality performance came from Bruce Willis and it was an uphill battle to make his character 3 dimensional, handicapped with the script and some really cringingly bad (funny) speechs he had to make.  Most of the oilworkers were so stereotypical it defied belief.  \\"Let's see... we need a big biker guy, and a new age mellow guy, and a guy who loves to hang out with stripers.  That was the extent of their personalities.  I felt like I was watching card board cutouts.  I don't need to mention how awful Afleck was.<br />2. Everyone else has pointed out the scientific and story plot blunders, inaccuracies, and problems so nuff ced.<br />3. Obviously Bruckheimer/Bay et al have no concept of the phrase, \\"Less is more\\".  Does everything have to be loud?  Can you they go more than 3 seconds without an edit?  I felt like the had about 15 minutes of a movie and threw everything else in a blender until they got the 2 hours +<br />4.  The most glaring problem: The script.  I would have laughed if I wasn't in so much pain from this reallllly bad dialogue.  Professionally, I felt bad for the actors.  Of course they were well compensated financially.<br />To sum it all up,  What a waste of what could have been to good action flic.  What we got was a hack job with quality effects.
0345409671|5.0|I have read all of The Vampire Chronicles and Memnoch The Devil is by far one of my favourites.  I found it extremely interesting and highly philosophical.  Memnoch takes a very interesting spin on modern religion, and the relationship between God and The Devil is very well writen and highly imaginative.  I finished the book in two days.  For readers looking for a little more substance rather than the usual formula, Memnoch The Devil is the perfect book for you.  It was an enlightening experience to read.  Truely creative fiction.
0517122707|5.0|This may be the funniest novel ever written.  I cannot understand how people do not see the humor in this great book.  The characters are marvelously absurd; the setting in New Orleans is perfect; and the writing is superb -- every word seems to be in the right place.  It is such a tragedy to realize that the author did not live to see the success of this comic masterpiece.
B000065U1N|3.0|This movie's pretty good at showing what it was like in Somalia back during our intervention.  What the movie isn't so good at showing is any character development, or what we were doing there in the first place.  If it could do those two things, it might have been a bit better.<br /><br />Basically, Bush Sr. and his buddies thought there was a good chance that we could pacify Somalia with some food and humanitarian aid.  Once that was done and someone docile was in charge, Western oil companies would be able to roll in and drill.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Somalia wasn't suffering from a lack of food and medicine, but serious social ills and upheaval that were a lot harder to cure than an empty stomach.  Once the US committed to the country, we were stuck there.  This movie shows the battle that made Americans realize our presence there was pointless at best.<br /><br />This movie's good at showing the capabilities of the US Army, and instructional on how an underdog can fight a technically advanced adversary.  What it doesn't show is why the soldiers in this movie had to be wounded or die in a hellhole on the other side of the world.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00006690F|5.0|This is by far the best cd that Eminem has made. It has many songs that you want to play over and over again. I am very impresses by the different tunes he has used in his album and I think it is better than the Marshall Mathers LP. These songs are typically dancing songs, songs that you can actually bump and grind to too. (NO PUN INTENDED). i think Eminem has a right to say whats on his mind, so just let him...
B00003CXI1|2.0|This movie was about as empty and plastic as a Harry Potter action figure from Burger King.<br />The digital stunt doubles weren't convincing in the least, and the broomstick match looked like a scene from a PS2 game.<br /> Everything else looked nice, but the storyline was about as engaging as a stripped clutch.  I think this movie would insult the intelligence of a fetus.  They must have said the name \\"Harry Potter\\" with awe and reverence 6,000 times in this movie.  I left the theater at about the time he was putting on the invisible cloak.  It was too boring.<br />If I have to saw something good, I'd say there were some pretty places and faces, and the invisible cloak effect was good.<br />-- JJT
B0000021RD|5.0|Chicago is a classic rock band that plays soulfully and wholeheartedly. If you buy this disc you will not at all be disappointed if you love musical variety. Chicago goes from hard rockin wah wah guitar solos to beautiful classical string sections all on one album, now thats musical diversity. Buy it today.
B000002J1O|5.0|... in particular Banks' long keyboard masterpiece in &quot;Aisle of Plenty&quot;. I've listened to this piece literally hundreds of times, have picked every note out on my keyboard in fact, and love it still as much as when I first heard it. The whole album is wonderfully British. Aisle of Plenty forever!!
B000006045|4.0|...seductive, spellbinding.  There are probably many other words out there that can describe this record, but the five I've mentioned are probably the closest that will match the feeling I get from listening to it.  Imagine a dark, tranquil atmosphere with shimmering electronic music and bassline grooves and narrative, soulful vocals in the background.  &quot;Mezzanine&quot; perfectly fits this description!  Some of the highlights include &quot;Angel&quot; where the music starts soft and then builds up into a screaming frenzy.  Or how about &quot;Teardrop&quot; (w/former Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser) which features an angelic voice, an acoustic guitar, and the same shimmering electronics.  I could go on and on.  But I think it's best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself.  If I'm not mistaken, it was one of SPIN magazine's top 20 records of 1998.  Heck, I bought it just before Christmas last year and wondered what took me so long in doing so.  In any case, I'll definitely look into buying their other stuff including the DVD!  And I look forward to their new record which should be coming out sometime this fall!
B00003CX5P|1.0|i've never been a star wars fan but i've always liked sci-fi. i wasn't expecting much from this movie and in that respect i was not disappointed. this movie is nonsensical, boring, corny, and childish. that said, i still enjoyed watching it (but i couldn't understand a thing jar jar was saying, and yes jar jar really is a silly, unecessary character). the movie was so bad it was funny. the parts i liked: lightsaber dual (didn't everyone), ewan mcgregor (just because i like him)and...that's about it. the DVD had some nifty extras where we got to see everyone working so hard to make such a bad movie. if you're not a star wars fan, beware, this movie [stinks]. but if you're not going to kill yourself because a movie is really dumb, take the time to rent it (don't buy it!) and spend two hours laughing at it!

0609610570|5.0|Initiative, organization, people and forethought matter. To get the job done, all are necessary. Anemia and apathy can suck a company dry, especially one entrenched in corporate culture. The good company, authors Ram Charan and Larry Bossidy say, executes with success because they've hired people who understand, \\"Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done.\\" No, not the book, per se, but the principles in the book. The book has this principles clearly laid-out.<br />The challenge in reviewing this book is that it is packed beyond the usual business book with the meat of what differentiates the \\"could've been great leader\\" from the \\"guy who did it.\\" Doing is what matters. Without getting things done, and done right, change can never exist, and profits will eventually slide.<br />Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan have the credentials, and more importantly, the results that justify this book. He took Allied Signal to the top. Not only did he receive awards and such, but he has the numbers... the profits and stock value improvements to show he knows how to run the show. Charan's been an advisor to the major companies, and has taught at the nation's most impressive institutions.<br />While Allied Signal is huge, the little guy will benefit from this as well. Own a coffeeshop? A hobby store? Business is business and what Bossidy has to say will help you too.<br />Why let the manager make the calls to check references for the assistant manager? The assistant is a key hire, and your shop depends on him. Make those calls yourself, just as Bossidy did at his company. Be sure the right person is in place for each position. Acquring the best and brightest does not only refer to hiring a six figure CFO, but a $30K program manager, or activities director.<br />Passivity and corporate anarchy are not the foundation of a company which intends to complete its goals. Charan & Bossidy is sure to point out about being part of and influencing decisions which matter, and being prepared to make those decisions. Pie in the sky ideas, then letting the VPs figure it out doesn't cut it.<br />I fully recommend \\"Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done.\\"<br />Anthony Trendlo make those decisions.

B000066NW0|5.0|I am passionate about music.  I played professionally in my younger years and now that I'm old (over 40), I spend a lot of time searching for and listening to great music, both old and new: mostly alternative, rock and pop in that order.  I own more than 1,000 records, read reviews for and sample hundreds of albums per year, and buy at least a hundred albums per year.<br />I have rarely posted reviews but feel compelled to do so in this case.  I really enjoy female artists, particularly those with strong melodies, original and interesting song structures and truly great voices.  For example, I own everthing produced by Aimee Mann, PJ Harvey, Heather Nova, Tanya Donnelly and Beth Orton (new release in July!!).  Upon first listen on MTV and after the first time through this album, I had a rare reaction to Avril, namely: if I owned a record company (my dream one day), I would do whatever it took to sign her.  Yesterday.<br />She is that rare artist with the whole package of songwriting ability, vocal ability, instrumental ability and attitude, necessary to produce a remarkable catalog of work over a long career.  This girl (woman?) is a major talent.  I would bet serious money that she will not only be around, but making progressively better music for years to come.  The person on here who said otherwise is absolutely clueless.  If she wants to make music, she will have an audience, be it huge or niche (more likely huge).  Quality music always has an audience.<br />I believe Avril (what a weird name, huh?) is one of those special talents, who almost inexplicably, manages to produce music of amazing critical quality, while being wildly popular at the same time.  I still find it strange that someone like Alanis has achieved such popularity.  While she is a great artist (I love all three of her albums, yes even the middle one); it is bizarre that she is popular and others are not (can you say PJ Harvey, Kristin Hersh, Juliana Hatfield, Heather Nova, Veruca Salt or Sleater-Kinney).  To all you snobs out there, who put too much stock in professional reviews, DO NOT write this girl off simply because she will be VERY popular.  She is among the select few that should be BOTH critically acclaimed and hugely popular.<br />Suffice to say, this is one of the best albums, debut or otherwise, female artist or otherwise, I have heard in years.  The lyrics are suprisingly mature given her age, but folks the beauty is the musicality of the songs and the quality of her vocals.  My goodness, what a record.  Every song is so well constructed (think harder Aimee Mann from I'm With Stupid), with great melodies and performed/produced with such class, balance and maturity (she worked with good people).  And to those who quibble with her enunciation.....get a life!  I cannot remember a pop/rock singer with more talent or with more developed skills at this age.  She has such range, both high and low, and also hard and soft.  She sings with style and maturity that would be impressive for a 30 year-old, let alone a 17 year-old.  If you hadn't seen her, I defy you to tell by listening, that she is 17 years or that this is her debut.<br />She is quite simply, an awe-inspiring talent.  While there are other young talents (Michelle Branch and Spirit Room is impressive, Pinks's second album is very, very good, and Mandy Moore's current release is strong, really!), Avril is on a another level, folks.  After listening to this album ten times, I'll go out on a HUGE limb and predict it may ultimately (assuming it wears like I think it will) hold a candle to some of the strongest debuts of the 90s.  And that list includes Nirvana, Radiohead, Garbage, PJ Harvey, Tori Amos, Liz Phair, and yes, Alanis' debut, which surely was a monumental record.  Yes her lyrics can be a bit much, but get over it.  She has proven to write great music.  &quot;Let Go&quot; is not unlike &quot;Jagged Little Pill,&quot; in that, even if you completely ignore the lyrics, the music itself blows your mind.  I don't understand or relate to all of Alanis' words, or for that matter, all of the words from Nirvana, Radiohead or REM (some major, major talents): but it just doesn't matter.  The music is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Avril is like that.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Not unlike &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; &quot;Shrek&quot; engages the viewer to know beauty is what is beyond the skin.<br />The DVD is loaded with extras, but frankly, you might not bother with them. Your kid will play with them, exploring them once or twice, but the movie is the real treat. The mock interviews with the characters are intriguing, and worth watching. The re-voice studio is a hoot, and you'll dig showing it off to your friends, but it loses its novelty soon enough. Because it is a DVD, your kids can watch it into eternity without worry of it wearing out.<br />Lithgow is very Lithgow, much the same personality as he was on &quot;Third Rock from the Sun.&quot;<br />Cameron Diaz's princess character looks remarkably like her.<br />Eddie Murphy makes a great sidekick. I was skeptical that he might be too over-the-top, but found his voicings to hit the tone perfectly, with great comedic skill. In short, he's hilarious.<br />The movie is packed wirth allusions to old great movies and cartoons, mostly Disney, and adults will smile everytime they discover a new line or sequence from a movie they grew up with. Watch for &quot;The Princess Bride,&quot; &quot;Robin Hood,&quot; &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and a bevy of other homages.<br />The ending surprised me, but I'll not spoil it for you.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Shrek.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
B00005JKED|5.0|When Denzel received his oscar for the role in this fil I was disappointed.  Firstly beacause I didn't think he was the best and secondly because it was so set up that it was the year for black actors.  Denzel should have already won for his role in the Hurricane.  However, all that aside I love this movie...<BR>   The twisted dark and yellow colours in this movie remind me of Traffic ( another fabulous movie )driving along with Ethan Hawk tapped out of his head on PCP.  Its a blur of violence, realism and race one that Hawk doesn't even know he's in until its right on top of him.  <BR>   Throughout the film you recognise Washington as a bad mother, but still an anti-hero.  There is a link between the two characters Hawk and Washington and at some point along the line it breaks, leaving you tense and excited, longing for the fight that has to come. oh, and boy does it come...<BR>   This is a fantastic film that all fans should watch and respect *****.
1577311523|3.0|I do not think \\"The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment\\" is a good book. I do think Eckhart Tolle's book presents ideas which insult the thinking meditatively inclined reader.<br />As a starting point for someone who has never considered philosophical thought before, this book might be intriguing. Like Deepak Chopra, there are curious nuggets of interesting ideas, but, also like Chopra the depth stops on a dime.<br />Tolle seems more interested in stopping pain than pursuing wholeness. The absence of pain does not necessarily mean the presence of happiness, and the presence of happiness does not necessarily mean the presence of contentment.<br />Tolle believes the truth self is the deepest self, whereas believers in a diety-based religion realize the deepest truth is found outside of ourselves, in God. Many people might argue which God is the true God, of course, but Tolle shortsightedly and arrogantly implies there is not God but ourselves.<br />Any value found in Tolle's book is the challenge to stop, relax and focus through the mired confusion around us. It is diificult to discover truth with a myriad of life's event flurrying around, and Tolle is right to suggest we stop, breathe and ask what is truth. These are old concepts explained well by Tolle, but they are only the beginning.<br />For a meditative book, try \\"My Utmost for His Highest\\" by Oswald Chamber, or anything by Thomas Kempis.<br />I cautiously recommend \\"The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment\\" by Eckhart Tolle.<br />Anthony Trendl
0767802470|5.0|Don't let anyone tell you this is a \\"guy\\" movie. When my sister and I first saw this during its original release (in German with subtitles), we realized there was no way we could take it all in in just one viewing (except that you don't just \\"view\\" this movie - you feel it). So we ended up going again... and again... until it finally left town, and even then we both skipped work for that one last time. And we weren't alone. When we saw it again in revival, I looked over my shoulder at one point, and the whole audience was mouthing \\"Gute frage\\" (\\"good question\\") along with the Captain. (Those who love this movie will know exactly where I mean.) One of the rewards of seeing this so many times was getting to know all the crew. Of course, it took just seconds of Juergen Prochnow as the Captain to know this was a man you would follow anywhere, who would get you out alive if anyone could. That quiet, steady presence; those amazing, compassionate blue eyes.... But then there was the Chief, and Johann, and the Second Lieutenant (you have to hear his smart-alecky voice in German, not dubbed in English!), and Dietrich, and.... How many movies are there, let alone war movies (where so often, the men are indistinguishable), where you can remember the lesser characters' names, or even want to? But this isn't just a war movie, or even an anti-war movie (which it certainly is). It's simply among the best movies ever made. You don't for a moment see these men as actors. What is happening to them, and to you in your emotional connection with them, is completely real. No matter how many times I see it, I still react to the ending as if it might change... Oh, thank God! He's still on his feet! And then you see.... But you are absolutely there. After burning the original into my brain - every look traded between characters, every taut-knuckled gesture - the Director's Cut seemed not quite \\"my\\" \\"Das Boot\\" at first, but not for lack of quality. My only quibble (because this movie also inspired us to learn some German) is that the subtitles just aren't as good as the original release: less pithy and on-target, with a little of the earthiness and wit left out. Such a small substitution as \\"God\\" (the new version) for \\"the Good Lord\\" (the original) does matter - when you can hear the Capitain saying the latter in German - not to mention \\"all wind and piss\\" being much better than \\"know-it-alls\\"! On the other hand, to have another hour of seamless film, another hour to spend with these people (especially the Captain), and sound so perfect I found myself looking around the living room for the speaker I don't even have (I would swear, there were bolts popping in back of me), is worth any translation issues. And did I mention how gorgeous the soundtrack is, not to mention unbelievably sensual? One plea: set aside an evening to watch this with no distractions. You won't regret it.
157330087X|4.0|\\"A Tribute To Stevie Ray Vaughan\\" shows some marvelous performances of Vaughan's work by some of the great bluesman and guitarists. Clapton, Cray, Guy, Raitt, King and even Vaughan's very talented brother crank through the better known Stevie Ray tunes with incredible musical mastery.<br /><br />Interupting some great jams, unfortunately, is a bunch of interviews. They are interesting, but kill the flow of the concert. It seems like a PBS special.<br /><br />I recommend \\"A Tribute To Stevie Ray Vaughan,\\" but get one of Stevie Ray's concert CDs or DVDs instead if you are looking to hear top Vaughan blues.<br /><br />Or, get a BB King or Buddy Guy CD. If you buy this one, fast forward through the interviews.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
B000065V1V|5.0|If you were on Team Bowie from the beginning, you're going to love \\"Heathen.\\" Bowie has not become an aging grotesque parody of himself like so many others. Why??...Bowie has grown with his audience, embraced music's new technology, and is the most uniquely talented rock and roller on Spaceship Earth. The songwritting is solid, vocals passionate, and production values are uncluttered. A departure from the industrial sound that Bowie began with Tin Machine. On first listen, I beleive this to be one of the best releases of an otherwise barren year for popular music. It's a keeper and I don't think David will be doing a white jump-suit gig in Vegas anytime soon. Thanks David, for staying younger than yesterday.

B00005J79J|4.0|It astounds me how long Sarah's been performing because she looks so incredibly young! She has struggled through critiscm after critiscm but I think that she proves with this album that she's here to stay. Sarah Brightman's the BEST OF 1990-2000 shows how much her voice has progressed throughout her years of Broadway to Crossover. My only complaint is the song selection (hence the reason for the 4-star rating). I don't think that it's bad I just think that some songs that weren't on here should have been, like \\"Figlio Perduto\\" and \\"Anytime Anywhere\\". The gospel pop tune \\"Deliver Me\\" and the gregorian trip-goth of \\"Eden\\" perfectly belong here but is the dancy new-age tune \\"La Mer\\" really necessary? I like that song a lot but \\"The Second Element\\" is a much more powerful and rememberable song from her DIVE CD, which came out in '93. I also think it stupid how the operatic-dance tune \\"A Question Of Honour\\" is shortened to a radio remix, like it's not short enough to begin with! The spanish guitar strumming of \\"Tu Quieres Volver\\" and her re-make of Procul Harem's \\"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\\" are also reduced in length, which I find to be a complete waste of time. My favorite song on here, though, is definitely \\"Heaven Is Here\\" from her '96 album FLY, which is her departure into the pop-rock genre, as where EDEN (98) and LA LUNA (00) were more on the ethereal pop/easy listening side. Overall, though, this is the perfect album to introduce newcomers with for it showcases the many sides of Sarah Brightman. If you're a long-time fan, however, than don't even bother buying this because you probably already have all these songs so it's useless. You probably already have all the album covers as well so just burn all these songs unto a CD and pretend that you own it...
8420483885|4.0|I watched &quot;the Ninth Gate&quot; with some friends last summer. They were only interested in  the surface of the plot but I was more interested in the esoteric part of the movie. When I first went to school my English teacher told me that a book, &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; was based on. I imeadiatly went out to buy the book and when I read it I was glad that I did.  <BR>     There are a few different plots that are going on at the same time, and you are constantly confised so you want to read on to figure out what is going on. He does a great job explaining everything at the end of the book and you feel smart because you figured th book out. T do have to say that the confusion iss the books downfall too.<BR>      The point of view changes two ar three times a chapter along with the scene making it  hard to follow at times. After you have read the chapter a few chapters later you figure out what is going on and how it relates.<BR>     A great mystery that follows the tradition and breaks the rules.

B00003CXI1|2.0|I a big fan of the Harry Potter books, and really looked forward to seeing the first book on the big screen.  Unfortunately, as is true with most movies based on a book, it didn't live up to what I expected.  It was fun to see a few things that I had imaged in my minds eye while reading on the big screen, but I guess I just expected SOOO much more.  Maybe the next one will be better.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
0805062971|4.0|I'll admit it. I saw the movie first. It was quite brilliant. I decided to buy the book one day when I was visiting Chicago with my friends. On the way back from Chicago I couldn't stop reading it! I actually got half way through! This book is amazing. <BR>It's about an insomniac with no name who goes to support groups and uses them as a kind of sleep aid. He feels the only meaning to his life is IKEA. One day he meets a ruggedly good looking man named Tyler on a nude beach. This is what the film does not tell us, probably because it wouldn't be \\"manly\\" enough or something. Anyway, the narrator and Tyler hit it off. He's impressed  with Tyler's wit and intelligence. And his appartment gets blown up. He is obviously feeling a little down, so he goes out for drinks with Tyler. That night, for fun, they begin to beat each other up. They enjoy it, and feel like it brings some meaning to their lives. They move in together. Soon they start a fight club, and soon more and more men are finding the meaning to life..........<BR>Simply brilliant. The ending was a little dodgey, but the rest was amazing.
6305511055|5.0|Simply flawless, this movie was the best movie to come out of the 70's.  It still sends a chill to the bone.  Haunting, riveting and a must for any serious movie buff.  ...
B00003CXI1|4.0|HPSS is definitely worth seeing once for an adult and probably thirty times for a youngster.  The effects are very nice, and the story as everyone knows, is fun and intriguing.  Do not recommend a buy for adults, but if you have kids it is a must.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Because this movie was made while the book was still being widely read, it had to stay true to the original. Where the special effects were amazing, it stayed true to the original to a T and failed to add anything to the story. It lost the magic of the prose because it was too afraid to add any of the magic of movies besides special effects.
B00003CX8N|5.0|84 Charing Cross Road is a delight.  If you are a book lover, it is a dream come true, revealing our intense emotional ties to every aspect of books and reading.  Beautifully rendered performances by Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft tug at your heart every time you view this soft, sentimental and pleasant movie.  Viewing this movie will become a ritual you will want to share and cannot live without.
B00005QDW1|4.0|If you've been a long No Doubt fan, based on the other reviews ur probably not gonna like this. However, if you're like me, and never been a heavy No Doubt fan, u might. <BR>I really like the beat to this; I like the sound of the songs. I like the rock/pop and just the sound. It makes me wanna dance. This CD is good, I think. But I've never really been a No Doubt fan.
6304082428|5.0|A lot has been said about the main characters here.  I'd really like to say something about the not so important ones.  I rewatched this and the 80s version recently and was really struck by how differently Miss Bingley was portraid in respective adaptations.  In the 80s, she is all sweetness on top, but you can see that she's just simmering with jealousy and irritation underneath.  The book says that M. Bingley has a very stylish, elegant and fashionable air about her.  The 80s actress was superb at showing these trait.  I think she gave a very sublte performance.  M. Bingley of A&E in my opinion fell short in so many respects. Yes, she was haughty and proud, but she was so awkward while walking, for example.  Did anyone notice, that she had a very vulgar way of looking at others, I'd say staring with her eyes practically bulging out...  She was not elegant or graceful in the least.  I think she kind of looked as if she was on [something].  Ok, I'm exagerating, but really, was she supposed to be so vulgar?  I think she showed minimal contrast between the character's ability to change from sweet to nasty and the ability to combine the two, which the 80s actress excelled at.<BR>Another character I'd like to comment on is Miss De Bourgh.  The A&E looked like a [sick] person who is about to faint.  The make-up that was supposed to convey her sickness was too much.   She looked as if she was not in her right mind.<BR>Help!!! I'd dearly love to find a forum where P&P versions are compared/contrasted, but cannot find it and this is not quite the place that would allow for discussion.  <BR>PS:  I love both versions and the more they make the better.  Some things are better in A&E (Darcy) and some in 80s (Miss Bingley and Mary)
B00003CXI1|5.0|I purchased HARRY POTTER without even seeing the movie, many of us have a habit of doing that these days. I was so enormously charmend by the fantastic visual effects (they surpass STAR WARS EPISODE II), the screenplay and the wonderful cast. You need not be a fan nor read any of the books to understand what's happening. There are little hints and explanations (for both Children and Adults) that guide you through the film.<br />One reviewer had wrote something like \\"The Next Wizard of Oz\\", despite it's time and the technicol beauty of \\"OZ\\" there always seemed something missing from it. POTTER brings it all back. <br />There are a few scenes that maybe a little scary for the little one's and there are some crazy religious fanatics out there that have chastised the film for what they call evil, however, the film is pruely innocent. It demenstrates true friendship, understanding of other people's differences and the beauty of once being a child.<br />You really must see this film.<br />As for the DVD, it could be a little better on the second disc. The menus are quite annoying and I still can't seem to find the \\"deleted scenes\\". The talent bios could have been detailed and it's really not necessary to make supplemental material somewhat of a game.<br />The sound and transfer on the other hand is magnificant, colors are vivid and the soundtrack shines! The only reccomendation, if you do have small children that have tendency to get a little scared easily, turn the volume down.

B00005OWEG|5.0|There are some movies than one sees in their youth like 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Start the War Without Me' that seem to stay in the back of one's mind forever, and, 'Apocalypse' is certainly one of these films ..... <br />OK so Brando gets a little nutsy here and the final scenes are wierd to say the least but the aerial shots over the Vietamese countryside and the napalm scenes are well worth the price ....<br />While the story may not bring out the horrors of war the movie does leave the intended impression ....
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins' two books, Built to Last and Good to Great, provide the clearest and most profound analysis of business success. If you never read any other books about business in your life read these two. They are life transforming. I buy these books and give them away as presents. You could wish for no better gift if you are interested in business and what defines success. The new updated chapter on Built to Flip in Built to Last is priceless.

B00005RY7X|5.0|OK, This CD is amazing. It's like finally someone stands up against stupid metal bands with only a couple of good songs like Slipknot, Mudvayne, with poser teen fans who wouldn't know music if it kicked their[behind... So I highly reccomend this CD from songs like Party Hard to Don't Stop Living In The Red. I GET WET from Andrew WK is the re-evolution of rock music. Damnit I'm sick of all this screaming... with enough band members to start a marching band and the hypocritical lyrics. Why would somebody where a mask any way. KISS wore face paint but weren't afraid to show their face. You must be one ugly bastard to spend your day in a rubber mask. Andrew WK, thumbs up you crazy S.O.B.
630025075X|5.0|I Admit it: I LOVE Pink Floyd. Yes, some of the songs here sound a bit like the '80's (it WAS filmed in the '80's); HOWEVER, buyers of THIS unique video will help themselves to many, many timeless jewels, that rival even Floyd at its best. I have seen Floyd Live 3 times, and have seen 5 videos of Floyd live. LOVE EM. However, THIS IS Dave Gilmour in the prime of his life, making HIS OWN PERSONAL STATEMENT. He is blisteringly hot on this show!! THIS VIDEO IS FOR EVERYONE WHO LIKES SUBLIME ROCK AND LOVES THE GUITAR!! WAY ahead of its time. Cameras never caught Pagey at his best. Well, they recorded Dave's best work! <br />Perhaps it's the mind-boggling synth lead by Greg Dechart in RLHell (or the rest of his very good keyboard work throughout the video); maybe it's the contagious enthusiasm Chris Slade brings to percussion and drums, especially on Blue Light, hammering the beat (check out Chris's excellent work on \\"Solar Fire\\" with Manfred Mann's Earth Band); then again, it may be the extraordinary performance/duet with Dave Gilmour and rock legend Roy Harper rendering the metaphysical epic Short and Sweet (check out closely the mystical lyrics); or, it could be the phenomenal use of the unearthly theremin thru a T.C. Elec. 2290 that blows the mind in Short & Sweet; on the other hand, it could be the poignant, moving bass lead by Mickey Feat on MURDER, (one of the finest bass pieces I have EVER heard), Dave's Ode to the loss of John Lennon, or his magnum opus, the unimaginable guitar lead on it. <br />Could be the utterly professional Jody Linscott; she capably handles EVERYTHING from chimes, to a 2\\" cymbal, to tablas, tambourines, bongo's, to a 40\\" GONG, with skill and ease. Raf Ravenscroft (debut - sax on Gerry Rafferty's \\"Baker Street\\" (1978-79), does a masterful, super job with sax and additional synth keyboards; Raf's work on 'There's No Way Out of Here' is good enough to qualify his presence, by itself. In short, this is one exceptional group of musicians, withphenomenal material! Until We Sleep is one of the finest exhibitions of rock mastery, and of Dave's style, as he plays lead with chords, calmly whacks you with his perfect Roger Mayer Octavia lead, at the end, doubling the pitch, and hitting unbelievable rapid-fire licks like an Uzi, and weaving into your mind with 2 octaves of lead, like a mad scientist of sound-Incredible! This is very sublime, sophisticated stuff. For the rock'n'roller, and the elite rock crowds as well. <br />If you are a fan of guitar, rock, a musical technician, engineer, or guitar player, like me, you will be knocked out watching Dave Gilmour, and his ensemble, as they pull off one monster performance; Dave calmly punishes the guitar, as if it were childsplay, romping up and down the fretboard, calmly soothing, then blistering it, as in the middle of the 'MURDER' lead, playing at 150 mph, then belting out super harmonics, 5ths, 7ths, 12ths, and 24ths, like some stoic god; or you'll gaze as he's playing tasteful rhythm parts while Mick Ralphs (ala Bad Company and Mott the Hoople) has his turn, and turns in some fine stuff as well; check out Mick's BLISTERING additions to Blue Light, on b/u lead, as well as his tasteful double outro lead with Dave at the end of Murder. Dave NAILS a dive bomb from E down to low C on Lovers are Deranged, that has never been pulled off before. Whilst Gilmour is NOT a shredder, (shredders cannot write lyrics.. anyone else noticed this?) he certainly CAN play fast when needed, is quite the poet and lyricist, and a real master of guitar special effects.. The bittersweet self portrait of his own WWII past Dave so beautifully articulates on piano in Out of the Blue is quite rare. ANY fan of rock will have interest in this piece right out of rock legend!! The mixing could be better in places. Oh, what I would give if this tour only taped Mihalis, It's Deafinitely, Near the End, Raise My Rent.. Still, this is rock HISTORY in the making!! And, for all of you who couldn'tafford flights to the UK, and top notch seats at the Hammersmith Odeon, THIS IS YOUR FRONT ROW SEAT TO IT ALL!! <br />This shows an interesting and moving side of Dave G that doesn't get through the standard Pink Floyd formulae. Not to mention a showcase of talent for a crowd of brilliant musicians!!<br />There is much, much more. But what should appear to EVERYONE, not just Floyd fans, is, this is NOT Pink Floyd! It is a totally NEW entity, that has its OWN statement to make, in bold letters. This is amongst the finest pieces of British (or any other) rock ever documented on film; they don't make rock artists like this anymore. THIS VIDEO, my friends, is your ticket to viewing some rare piece of magic that happened just once!! This is David Gilmour at his very, very best. <br />Like some spaceship of wizards, mental giants, from the outer rim of the galaxy, this ensemble comes, blows you away, and leaves you in UTTER AND COMPLETE astonishment, whether you are or are not a fan of Dave's original band. This is one rare take on a flawless performance by a group of extremely talented players. This is your chance to view rock history being made. Outstanding hardly does this work justice. Modern British rock doesn't get any better than this! Pink Floyd does GREAT music, but at times, this group dares to go one (or two) steps further! You will be greatly rewarded to take a chance on this SUPERB video.
B00003CXI1|3.0|About the Movie: <BR>Of course, this is the story anticipated by millions.  My kids have enjoyed re-watching it several times, but interest seems to be fading, as we await Book 5 and Movie 2.  <BR>Chris Columbus has managed to include in the movie all the important story lines from Book 1, and many parts are downright fun, such as SEEING a Quidditch game like the many we've imagined for several years.<BR>The biggest problem in the movie is that every story line gets its little part of the movie, making the movie non-stop, whilst, incongruously, somewhat boring, as the pace stays relentlessly the same for 2-1/2 hours.  Never terrifyingly break-neck, and never a breather.  Remember the garbage compactor scene in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;?  A great breather -- just long enough to make the upcoming terrors stop your heart.<BR>But, you can't skip Movie 1 in this set of 7!<br />The DVD-ROM:<BR>Hugely disappointing.  Buy this for the movie, not for its PC companion.  Ditto for the special DVD features played on a TV.<br />It was hard to install, eventually failed, and delivered mostly just links to the HP web sites we've already enjoyed.<br />Owl mail is just a way to get HP-related advertising.<BR>Mixed potions, but couldn't figure out how or why you'd guess particular combinations, except through random trial &amp; error.<BR>Had a wand choose me, but it wasn't really me -- it doesn't know anything about *me*.  Ditto the Sorting Hat.<BR>Casting a spell over a scene in 8 languages is interesting.  Once.  Well, maybe a few are - 8 gets a bit much.  It's really just watching the standard DVD capability to play in different languages.<br />Never found many other features, probably due to failures with installing the viewer software, even after trying the latest patches from the web.  (Learn Quidditch, Meet the Ghosts, Sneak past Fluffy, Collect Wizard Trading Cards, etc.)<br />Worst of all, never found the 7 Deleted Scenes.  (We all wanted *more* HP...)<br />In summary, the DVD-ROM was thin, weak, disappointing contents, and technically flawed.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I'd heard someone raving about how wonderful John Mayer is and decided to pick up the cd. I have absolutely loved it! I listen to every single song on the album. There is not one that I don't like. &quot;No Such Thing&quot; is one of my favorites along with the amazingly sincere and fresh &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland,&quot; the moving ballad &quot;Why Georgia,&quot; and &quot;Great Indoors.&quot; The rest of the songs are great as well. I really enjoy the music on this cd and the lyrics which I find to be uniquely written and genuine. You should definately buy this cd!
0790738139|3.0|This was a very good movie, but it could have been so much more. <br />The story starts as a cross-section of the LAPD in the early '50s - when the city is poised to become \\"the city of the future\\". Fallout from a stationhouse race-brawl on Christmas Eve elevates lowly (but ambitious) patrolman Ed Exley (Guy Pierce) to the detectives squad. Incredibly honest and the son of a slain officer, Exley triumphs as the lone holdout when drunken cops brutalize perps unlucky enough to have been arrested on a holiday eve. Bud White (Russel Crowe) is lucky enough to keep his shield even as his best friend, a corrupt and inept detective named Stansfeld is forced to leave LAPD in disgrace. Meanwhile, Jack Vincennes, a detective who's also the consultant for a \\"reality\\" cop show (circa 1950) manages to barely survive the fallout himself. Above them all presides James Cromwell, the Captain of the LAPD of the future, whose smiling veneer masks an appreciation for cruelty and a quick resort to violence. Embittered with Exley at the start, White's grudge with Exley seems magnified when Stensfeld turns up as a victim in a horrific multiple homicide at an LA Diner. Worse, the two embody polar opposites - with Exley as the thinker and schemer and White as the muscle - each looking down on the other. The script works up an obvious idea - forcing them to team up despite what each thinks of the other when their respective and apparently distinct cases soon prove linked. The story tosses in David Strathairn who provides hookers surgically altered to look like Hollywood starlets, Danny Devito as a columnist who gives LA's seedy side the Winchell treatment, various seemingly unconnected murders and hints at a fortune (in 1953) in missing heroin.<br />So why don't it work? It does, but the story works up these great characters, and keeps cutting away just when they start to look good. Exley's ambition never reveals itself in full - in the end he looks square enough to actually believe the \\"serve and protect\\" oath that nobody else in the flick accepts. Spacey starts to get good, but the film wastes him in the end. Kim Basinger won best supporting actress - she's good but not great here, and the flick tosses in an unbelievable triangle, putting her between Exley and White when her love for White is so obvious. It's obvious that, whether by accident or design, this is Crowe's character's movie. He starts out as a violent thug, but one with a sense of justice. It takes Basinger's character to find the real human underneath his muscle and coiled anger. The end is a total dissappointment, but not bad enough to hide the pleasures of the rest of the film.
0066620996|5.0|The ideas are not necessary new, but the research lends credibility.  For me persoanlly, many of the tactics are ones we have utilized successfully for years and we firmly beleive work. The book was reinforcemnt to continue.  For the tactics that are new to us, we are planning to adopt.  We find ourselves asking the questions posed in the book such as &quot;do you really want them on the bus?&quot;  <BR>The book is easy to read and understand.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Okay, first of all, the movie is excellent!  It combines the classic Disney character personalities with amazing pixar animation!  The plotline of the movie is very catchy, and even though it looks as different as Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and The Nightmare Before Christmas, you still feel as if you are watching a Disney Clasic...  Which you are, because it is is an instant classic!  And secondly, the short film \\"For The Birds\\" is the absolute funniest thing I have ever seen in my life...  I was laughing so hard I was crying and choking on my popcorn...  If you didn't like the movie, (although, who couldn't!) the DVD is worth buying just for the short three minute film...  Trust me...  I can bet anyone $100 dollars that they couldn't find a funnier film...  Anyways, yeah...  Just though I should spread the knowledge!
B00005B36H|5.0|As a classically trained musician, I have taken a long, slow, but steady journey toward an appreciation of hard rock and metal. I never would have guessed that one of my favorite albums of all time would be a metal album! But Lateralus truly transcends genres. It has the depth, density, and complexity of the best classical music. This is not just a collection of songs -- it is more like a symphony or oratorio. Each track flows seamlessly into the next, and the thematic development is amazing. The rhythmic complexity makes me think of Stravinsky. It's an altogether satisfying musical -- even spiritual -- experience.<br />And mother of everything sacred, those drums!!!

6304798482|4.0|This may be a very personal thing, but my cousin once saw Mira Sorvino in a karaoke bar in Kyoto five years ago.  I still regret that she (my cousin) didn't have my phone number to invite me.  <br />Anyway, Mira Sorvino was here in Japan for the promotion of this creep film \\"Mimic.\\"  It was a bit surprise she took the role of entomologist Dr. Tyler, because it was soon after she got an Oscar for that Woody Allen film.  But she judged right for this film turned out successful, being directed by Guillermo Del Toro, later to direct \\"Blade 2.\\"<br />The story is, in my opinion, another clever look on urban legend.  In New York, a deadly disease carried by roaches burst out, and many children suffer from that, most cases leading to death.  Entomologist Susan Tyler (Sorvino), asked by CDC specialst Peter (Jeremy Northan, of \\"Emma\\" and \\"The Net\\"), embarks on a plan based on releasing a genetically enhanced new spieces.  It worked; the disease soon is gone, but that's only the beginning of another plague that is more deadly.<br />And that is THE Thing, that acts like humans, but in fact, lethal enemy to us.  They inhabit in a disused subway constructions where unlucky characters have to be trapped.  Though the story seems derailed in the final chapter of the film, the film, as a whole, maintains its creepy atomosphere throughout, and those weird feelings that some people might get when they watch insects -- something akin to awe and fear -- are tactfully expressed in the darkly images of the underground world.  <br />The cast is also superb; besides intelligent Sorvino, you see Charles S. Dutton (\\"Alien 3\\"), Josh Brolin (\\"NIghtwatch\\"), F. Murray Abraham (\\"Amadeus\\") and Giancorlo Giannini (\\"Hannibal\\").  And some may be amuzed by the stylish opening title sequence by Kyle Cooper, who did his job in \\"Se7en.\\" and many others.  <br />Basically, love or hate film, \\"Mimic\\" will engage the heart of the people who love the kind of film like David Cronenberg.  The story's defect is obvious (and the film at several points resembles that of underrated John Sayles film \\"The Alligator\\"), but if you go in for an eerie feelings of his films, it is worth a look.
B0000024W3|4.0|This album has taken a lot of heat, been acused of being \\"half-baked\\" and a gathering of cast-offs. It reminds me of the Royal Albert Hall Concert where all the devoted folkies felt ripped off because \\"their\\" Dylan wasn't playing \\"their way.\\" Let's try looking at this gathering of songs in another way. An artist might take a polaroid, stand in front of a mirror, and snap himself. Dylan plays with that kind of image making in Don't Look Back. But another artist might walk around his familiar surroundings and pick up things that mean something to him, that shape him, that help him feel like he really feels about himself.<BR>So he takes those things and makes a montage and calls it \\"Self-Portrait.\\" It's been done countless times in art history.<br />Well, I kind of feel that's what Dylan did here. Ever heard Doc Watson sing \\"Alberta\\"? Or Willy Nelson sing \\"Take Me Like I Am (or Let Me Go)? Or the Everly's singing \\"Take a Message to Mary\\"? These must be treasures that helped Dylan pick his path. And is it not possible that he wanted to tip his hat to some contemporaries who keep the pressure on him like Lightfoot and Simon? This album is filled with tributes and dreams and pieces of the moment. Maybe, just maybe, this album is a precursor to Rick Nelson's observation that \\". . . you can't please everybody; you've got to please yourself. <br />Dylan's voice is in the Nashville Skyline mode for most of this album. Maybe he was just sitting on his porch singing to the moon. Whatever he's doing; to me it's like having a friend share something peaceful and private about himself.
B00004STDN|1.0|Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.<br />It's a Sylvestor Stallone movie.  That should be your first and only necessary clue.  If, like me, you have a fascination with this whole climbing boom and get sucked into watching this, you'll quickly discover what a dog this movie is.  Bad acting, bad plot (loosely based on real-life events but not enough so to save it), bad, bad, bad.<br />Only climbing movie that's worse than this is \\"Into Thin Air.\\"  That's one of the greatest books ever, but as a movie it's a train wreck.
0345440900|2.0|I had heard that this was a good book to find out how to get your baby to sleep through the night, but it really isn't about sleep at all - just a few pages. As a mother of three, much of the rest was common sense, although sometimes too much so: very much the author's opinions (not always meshing with mine). I don't like that she presents herself as against breastfeeding, having choice is good but discounting science (which she does repeatedly) to justify choice is not. If you are looking for a book on SLEEP though, try The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night
6304082428|4.0|This excellent BBC film is a wonderful example of love in 19th century England. Colin Firth is spectacular-I wonder how he can frown that long! Jennifer Ehle shines as the outgoing Elizabeth. I would reccomend you read the novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; before seeing the movie, as you might get a little confused on who is who. Altogether, this performance is spectacular.
020530902X|5.0|Strunk &amp; White is not manual on grammar, but a guidebook for clear, concise, and more effective writing.  It doesn't harp on meaningless, useless grammatical quibbles such as split-infinitives, placement of prepositions, and such.  Instead, it points out a few simple guidelines for improving writing *style*, such as the use of active voice, brevity, consistency, and clarity.  Some knowledge of grammar may be necessary, but much of it is explained in the handy glossary.<br />Adding to this advice from William Strunk, E. B. White includes some other general guidelines: &quot;Write in a way that comes naturally,&quot; &quot;Use orthodox spelling,&quot; and &quot;Don't explain too much.&quot;<br />All of these little gems of advice aren't hard-and-fast rules set in stone, but rather small bits of general advice collected into a compact book.  They can be broken, but for the most part, they are sensible and very useful in making writing more vivid, lively, and effective.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to launch a career in writing.  Read it, use it, absorb it.  It can only help.
B000066NW0|5.0|I haven't bought a CD that I liked this much in a long time! From hearing the single &quot;Complicated&quot; I thought the songs would be aimed towards the younger-mid aged teenagers, but I am 20 and all of the songs instantly appealed to me. &quot;Complicated&quot; is probably the &quot;lightest&quot; song on the CD; many of the others have more guitar and a more intense, exciting feel. The lyrics and melodies are very original. &quot;I'm With You&quot; is beautiful, and &quot;Mobile&quot; is catchy and potent. Every song is fully interesting and perfect for listening to while driving.<br />In other words, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the music. Highly reccomended!
0783235607|5.0|For those who have been living on another planet, Psycho is the granddaddy of all slasher/psychological thrillers, and still the best. Janet Leigh plays Marion, a small-time thief who checks into the wrong motel for the night. It is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), an odd young man who really loves his mother. It seems Mother doesn't like Marion, and Janet's character is dispatched in the first reel. More mayhem follows until we discover the secret of the old Bates house.<br /><br />Much of the film takes place in the very scary house, with its dark, empty rooms, long starcase, and creepy cellar. The movie is spine-tingling and shocking. Those who saw it in the theatres on its first run were overwhelmed by the violence, and many still can't take a shower without locking the bathroom door.  The soundtrack was completely original at the time, and was the prototype of terrifying mood music. If you want thrills, Psycho is the movie for you. The acting and script are outstanding. The movie is in black and white, but I think that makes it even better.
B000065VB9|5.0|I just got this CD and WHOA! This CD is a very creepy, alienated sounding record with very distorted melodies, paranoid yet powerful lyrics. Plus Peter even gets socially conscious with the 7 and a half minute Biko.<br />INTRUDER: By far one of my favorites. Intruder is the most frightening songs PG has ever done with lyrics that express a feeling of paranoia, fright and darkness. The metallic drums and the discordant keyboards are something to write home about. Intruder is one of my favorites. I also love the bending metal sound effects too. Caution: Young kids might get scared by this song.<br />NO-SELF CONTROL: NSC is less creepy although while lighter the feel to me is almost as chaotic. The song starts off as a lighter one with plucky instruments and then morphs into a hard rocking number.<br />START: Probably doesn't quite fit with the rest. While most of this album is dark and alienated in sound Start is a jazzy instrumental with a saxophone. While it might be a bit nicer I still find it to share it's own feel of creepiness but brighter than the rest of the album.<br />I DON'T REMEMBER: After the interlude jazz track Start we then return to the edgier sound and I Don't Remember is a mix of Rock, Funk, New Wave, and Prog Rock. The lyrics I can relate because sometimes I seamingly don't remember what I did the day before writing this review yet I will forever this song.<br />FAMILY SNAPSHOT: This track starts off as a humble calm track before it morphs into a jazz,rock number with lyrics that are powerful and thoughful. I like the rumbling drums in the background. The song then quiets back down into a mellow piano track.<br />AND THROUGH THE WIRE: ATTW is an upbeat song about how so much can happen with a little effort and that sometimes one position could make you very powerful.<br />GAMES WITHOUT FRONTIERS: Games is a very odd perky new wavish number with female guest vocalists singing in French and a dark eerie sound. This song from what I can guess is about how people play games for pleasure at the expense of others freedom. The Line \\"If Looks Could Kill, They Probably Will\\" is lyrical brilliance.<br />NOT ONE OF US: This is another upbeat but dark eerie new wavish number. The lyrics are a bit hard to understand though. Great song nonetheless.<br />LEAD A NORMAL LIFE: This track to me is like a combination of Start and No Self Control basically in sound. This song though is quiet yet very creepy. Sometimes it's the quieter song that are more eerie.<br />BIKO: The final closing track. Biko starts off with a demonstrating crowd chanting and then the track morphs into a very odd and bizarre rock song with a very eerie feel. This song is a tribute to the late South African activist Steven Biko who was assassinated by police in 1977. A great song. The song fades back into the crowd chanting and then a drum hit ends the song and the record.<br />PG3 to me is an incredible work of art and is by far one of Gabriels masterpieces. This CD is similar to the Security album and is very different from SO or US. It seems strange that the frightening darkness of Intruder and the mournful Don't Give Up are from the same artist. Peter Gabriel is a genius when it comes to music.<br />There is one thing I want to complain about though. It's not about the album itself but the fact that the remastered editions don't include bonus material. The liner notes though are not too bad though and thank goodness they did not change the track order like they did with SO by putting In Your Eyes at the ending.<br />A great album that could have been better re-issued on the market. If you already had this album on CD before they remastered it, no need to spend your hard earned cash.<br />In spite of the poorly handled re-issuing of PGs catalog the Melt album as I call this one is a must have for Peter Gabriel fans like myself. I plan on getting all of his albums soon but I am keeping the older edition of SO.<br />And when is the new album UP coming.is about how people play games for pleasure at the expense of others freedom.

Everything is fine until they have a baby.  Then, they take a trip, and  mean old, cat-loving, dog-hating Aunt Marge moves in.  Tramp, a wise-cracking mongrel from the wrong side of the tracks, helps  Lady and rescues the baby from a rat.  This is simply a magical movie.  Spend a bella notte watching it with someone you love.
B00000099Y|5.0|Wow i bought this cd three years ago and i am still listening to it like its new today. This is one of the most interesting, original rock recordings ever made. This band has changed what i look for in music and what i buy. Everything about this cd is an experience and even the most picky fan could find something they like about it. I would recomend this to anyone.
B00005KARJ|5.0|A mother's love for her darling child forms the heart of this classic animated feature.  Mrs. Jumbo, a circus elephant, has been hoping for a baby to love for a long time; finally, the stork arrives with the little bundle of joy - who is adorable, but has very big ears.  He becomes the laughing stock of all the other elephants, but his mother sees only her beautiful baby.  The time comes when she must protect Dumbo, is misjudged, and put in the jail-wagon.  As she reaches her trunk through the window bars to console and rock her sobbing infant, and sings a heartwrenching lullaby, you'll undersand why Disney was such a great movie maker (bring your hankie!)  Little Dumbo overcomes all odds and shows he can actually fly! This is a funny, sentimental, and whimsical movie; a must-see for all Disney fans.

B00004R99M|5.0|Julie Andrews plays Mary Poppins, a most unusual nanny who just happens to appear when she is needed most.  She takes her charges, Jane and Michael, on exciting adventures in and around London, and even melts the heart of their fuddy-duddy father.<br /><br />The movie has a great soundtrack;  the songs are all beautiful and easy to sing-along with.  This classic film can be appreciated by both parents and children.  Julie Andrews is the perfect magical nanny, and Dick Van Dyke is endearing as the multi-talented Chimney Sweep, Burt.  This is a very classy movie with singing, dancing, some animation, and family values.  5 Stars!
0066620694|1.0|This could hardly make enough material for a 2-pager. I can't believe people rate this as excellent. I want what the rest of them are smoking.
6303314015|5.0|This movie is similar to Bambi: The hero is born, loses a parent, grows up to be brave and good, and has a child of his own.  The drawing is beautiful, the songs are very singable, and the story is touching.  The modern, wise-acre dialog of Timon and Pumba at times detracts from the film, but other than that, the tale of little Simba growing up to be king is terrific.  Adults will love it as much as the kids, and you'll want to see it again and again.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is great! John Mayer is a beautiful singer. But, I wish that they would of put a song called Break Away that he sang, on the album. Just listen to it yourself, download Break Away, it is so comforting and easy listening, you'll like it. Other than that, this album gets 5! stars!
B000066NW0|5.0|I first heard this new artist through AOL and was enchanted by the sound and the lyrics.  It's not rock - it's not new age - it's something you have to hear.<br />I rate this one at the top and can't wait for her next album.  I remember when YES first came out with the album Fragile.  They didn't fit in just one category either.  I played that one until it was worn out and then replaced it - this one is that good.<br />Melodious - climbing rock beats - songs that flow too.  She won't be an unknown for long.
B000001E7T|5.0|Although I owned Polly Jean's 1993 release, \\"Rid of Me\\" (an awesome implosion of raw sound/emotion and punkfolkrockandrolltherapyblues), it was this album, released two years later, that made me the P.J. Harvey fan that I am today.<br />\\"To Bring You My Love\\" is a rocker and a roller, a cerebral steamroller, a peregrination after dark through bad neighborhoods of the mind, a revelation of the soul as a force of nature manifested through and somehow recorded by Polly Jean Harvey.<br />The album is a gestalt even as it moves from bass heavy psych outs such as \\"Working for the Man\\" to heartbreaking ballads of unrequited love like \\"C'mon Billy\\". Still, it is the songs of love and loss and redemption that give this album the weight of a classic for me. When Polly wails in the title track that she was \\"cast out of heaven\\" and has \\"cursed God above\\" to bring her love to me the listener, I can hardly refuse. When she pleads, in \\"Teclo\\", \\"Let me ride on His grace for a while. . .\\", you are right there with her beseeching the universe on her behalf for just a touch of grace to quicken her heart and yours.<br />There is powerful music here. Creeping bass lines and swelling strings, crunching post-industrial sludge thunder, trembling gospel organ, deft and urgent guitar voodoo. Above it all is Polly Jean, her voice roaming the ranges of emotion and producing goose bump raising intensity more than once.<br />Polly Jean Harvey is a vital and powerful artist. \\"To Bring You My Love\\" is a blossom of flame. Buy it today and set your heart on fire.
B00003W8NM|5.0|in my personal humble opnion, this movie has a plethora of things to be learned about on many many different subjects - the most important (to me) being ourselves.  a rollercoaster of mentally intriguing situations, conversations, ideas, forshadowings.  the flow of this movie is superb but the fast pacedness of it begs that you watch it again to see the things you undoubtedly missed the first time through.  i really got my money's worth with this dvd because it really is one that you can watch and watch again.
6304578482|5.0|This is one of the most cheerfulest movies to watch with an old friend! It's also one of my favorite comedies. This movie has one of the best soundtracks, though the song \\"Time After Time\\" by Cyndi Lauper is not included. It's so cute how they thought they were cool back in high school (doesn't everybody think that?) and when they really look back, they find out that they weren't and there lives now are not really that impressive as they thought.  They go all out to reinvent themselves in 2 weeks before the reunion: get a nice car, find cute boyfriends, lose weight...and of course, look like executives (LOL)! This movie is great! Their wacky but great taste in fashion make you laugh, their brief friendship problems will make you cry, and their courage so immense will make you stand up and clap. Truly one of the best!<br />P.S. The dance is to die for!!!!! (At the end)
B000065U1N|5.0|I used to reserve that title for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, but by looking at this movie I have to say that &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is the best war movie ever made. Let's stress that it's the most REALISTIC war movie ever made. No pauses for drama, no &quot;symbolism&quot;, no &quot;hidden messages&quot;. This movie is about how an American force of about 100 men found themselves under attack by thousands of the enemy. And this enemy was not simply an army, but an entire city where women and children were more than willing to pick up a gun. The politics of why we were there are simple: we were there to stop a famine. Anyone who says this movie does an injustice to the Somalis is a misinformed liberal who should realize that, hey, SOMETIMES AMERICA IS RIGHT! The men who fought at the Battle of Mogadishu deserve the highest honor for their heroic stand. Everyone who saw our men being dragged through the streets should realize with that image which side was right and which side was wrong. This is not an easy movie to watch, and it can get confusing. But guess what? That's what war is. Confusing, scary, and you don't have time to think about what you're doing. You just try to survive, and try to keep the man next to you alive. That's why this movie is the best war movie ever made. It shows it like it is, no candy coating and no glossing over.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I was never really that interested in Enrique Iglesias (though my aunt loves Julio, Enrique's father) until I bought it for less than a nickel (a music store was going out of business)! After about 3 weeks of not touching it, I finally decided to give it a try while cleaning up my room. I fell in love with the CD afterwards.  Enrique is very talented and writes all his songs!! And I say this is the best CD because it's not like my other favorites where there are a lot of songs I like on the CD and then there are those that I don't. On this CD I don't have to skip tracks 'cause I love them all!!<br />1. Escape - 5/5 Extremely catchy! Very good song! Great song to start off with<br />2. Don't Turn Off the Lights - 4/5 Not as good as the first track<br />3. Love To See You Cry - 3.5/5 Lyrics sound creepy. OK<br />4. Hero - 5/5 Great song, very heartwarming. Hit single.<br />5. I Will Survive - 3/5 At first I thought it was Gloria Gaynor's song, but it's not. OK<br />6. Love 4 Fun - 4/5 Upbeat. Very good song to make up your dance grooves to<br />7. Maybe - 10/5 The BEST song on the album! When I first listened to this song, I felt like I knew all the words!! I was singing along with him and didn't care that I was making up the lyrics! Very very catchy!!<br />8. One Night Stand - 4.5/5 Great. This is the name of his tour<br />9. She Be The One - 3/5 Not the best on the album. Bearable<br />10. If the World Crashes - 7/5 Second best on album (can ya tell?) It's really easy to fall into his mood and sing along. Great song<br />11. Escape (Spanish) - 4/5 I don't understand what he's saying but it still sounds sexy!!!<br />12. Don't Turn Off the Lights (Spanish) - see above<br />13. Hero (Spanish) - see above<br />***As always, I suggest you listen to the track samples before buying CD's and then being disappointed.  Though you won't be with this one! :)
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King writes, as he admits, pretty much trash reading--and does so very well.  This book is enjoyable, and is certainly worth reading when one has the time, and wishes to just forget anything real.<BR>The book is set in the little town of Derry, Main.  The characters are actually fairly belivable, and well drawn.  The story starts when they're young children--one stutterer, one rather weak-willed asthmatic, one black in a very white community, one girl from the wrong side of the tracks, and one really fat kid--outcast.  Thing is, despite the fact they're nearly stock characters, they have enough vitality and variety that they come across as 3D characters--they're not totally over the top or anything like that.   The kids are friends going into the book, and one of their brothers is killed. A series of events, some cliched, some not, lead to them doing battle with the villian--which is a UFO born evil-older-than-time thing.  It's kinda bizzare--a shapeshifter which assumes the shape of one's fears that must be killed by laughter (all right, maybe some serious albiet trite commentary is to be found in this book).<BR>Despite the length, it's not all that hard of a read, and does't take too long. Overall, it's enjoyable--it was written before he hit the slump (Dreamcatcher anyone?), and avoids too much self importance/seriousness.  Still, it benefits from his strenghts--decent characters and a good writing style, and well, plain oddness.  Again, the length means you'll spend some time, but it's well written recreational reading, and on par with his best works.
0385503954|5.0|Beautifully written and skilfully structured, Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" surpasses his previous Booker Prize winner - \\"Amsterdam\\" - by a country mile and raises the question as to why on earth it failed to win last year's competition. Sure, the storyline contains a couple of superficially serious flaws... but these criticisms of its logic completely miss the point. What McEwan is in fact exploring is: firstly, the character of the novel's central character (Briony), her view of the truth and, how she, and we, can, if we wish, distort \\"the truth\\" to suit or own requirements; and, secondly, the power of the writer to make you believe that figments of their own imagination are \\"real\\". The clever and, in the end, wholly convincing trick McEwan uses to explore such a complex subject is to make Briony a successful author in her own right: i.e. someone with the literary skills and therefore the persuasive power to convince others of her version of \\"reality\\". <br />McEwan's own superb writing skills (transposed onto those of Briony) make the story's supporting characters and the predicaments they face so convincing that you become deeply sympathetic to their fates and, as such, really do want them to \\"exist\\" as told. So much so that the book's first twist - Briony's serious distortion of \\"the truth\\" in her \\"published\\" version of the story - comes as both a shock and a disconcertingly effective insight into its first underlying theme: what is reality?  And... having sowed the seeds of doubt in Briony's own veracity, its ultimate question - \\"can I believe any of this?\\" - is, in turn, a quite brilliant insight into the nature of \\"the novel\\" and the reader's own expectations of it when, by definition, nothing in any novel is \\"true\\": it's all fiction made up by the writer!<br />Similar in its impact to Bryan Singer's equally brilliant film \\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"Atonement\\" will leave those wanting a comfortable \\"A to Z\\" progression of a believable story to a believable conclusionconfused & disappointed. But... for those wanting a multi-layered, thought provoking and, ultimately, deeply reflective exploration of both the impact of human frailty on the lives of others and, the power of the written word to convince it's an absolute treat.
B00000DQSS|4.0|Kate has done it again.  She has brought another unique collection of rare and elegant music.  This is one singer that I truly admire.  She is such a talented and brilliant musican and vocalist.  Typical of Kate's style this album contains unique instrumentation with mature lyrical content and unique vocals.<BR>Tracks that stand out are Violin, Breathing, and the clasy All We Ever Look For.  Never for Ever is an album that will be with you forever.
B000053VAF|5.0|\\"Dogma\\" is the first Kevin Smith film I ever saw.  I knew nothing about Clerks, had never heard of Jay and Silent Bob and would have been very confused if you asked me about Mallrats.  \\"Rats in the mall?  Gross!\\"  At any rate, I loved this film.  Funny but meaningful, controversial and thought provoking, well worth watching over and over again.  The chemistry between Affleck and Damon is nicely reminesent of \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and the rest of the cast is fabulous to watch.  Affleck especially delivers what I believe is the best performance of his career.  The only worm in the apple is Fiorintino, who can't act to save her life but luckily there are enough other people to sort of drown her out, or at least distract from the flat and extrodinarily annoying quality of her voice.
B00003CX5P|4.0|All I can say is that I've seen this movie about 7 or 8 times on screen and DVD and it just keeps getting better with each viewing especially if you have the original Special Edition Trilogy with which to compare. Liam Neeson is *outstanding* as a rebel Jedi. Period. Great casting choice. Ewan McGregor gives us a pretty good look at an apprentice Obi-Wan. But the story is what drives this series and George Lucas certainly has a great story. I reduce it to 4 stars but not because of Jar-Jar Binks - who actually gave more life to this film than he gets credit. You're *supposed* to be slightly annoyed with him the same way C3PO tends to drive you crazy. That's the point. He has some really funny lines and the comic relief does it's job. <br />I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the incomplete information about the Jedi universe and their history. Not until Attack of the Clones do we really see enough of this. The Jedi Council was repeated all too often with not enough forward movement. There's no hint of \\"Count Dooku\\" or whatever his Jedi name is which seems to be a huge plot point in Clones. Oh well, they still set up Obi-Wan and Anakin very well and the Sith is explained appropriately. Mitichlorions (sp?) are pretty well explained as the basis of the Force.<br />The politics are OK which is, after all, the entire reason for the conflict along with the religious implications of Good v. Evil.<br />I'm amazed with Ian McDiarmid the actor being able to reprise his prequel role as Senator Palpatine with the full expectation of where his character is going.<br />The score is superb as usual because Star Wars is as much John Williams (to a point) as George Lucas. <br />I've only seen Clones twice and I don't understand why people are trashing Phantom Menace so much. It has *MUCH* better acting than Clones and thousand times better dialogue. If you are objective, you can't honestly say that Clones is a better story, either. Of course, any movie with Christopher Lee as a villain is OK in my book but, please, did they have to duplicate the scene between Saruman and Gandalf almost verbatim?? It's a good continuation of Phantom Menace but much stiffer and with a totally corny romance to boot. Where's a young Harrison Ford when you need him? <br />This is supposed to be about Phantom Menace but you can't help to mingle the other films when reviewing.<br />My final criticism: George Lucas is a great story conceiver but  he needs to hand over directing and partial screen-writing to someone else for Episode III like he did with V and VI.<br />DVD bonus material: very good - definitely worth the price. All a Star Wars junkie could want.
B00003CXSP|1.0|But it would probably give him indigestion.  The film is just like every other serial killer slasher pic with no innovation and absolutely none of the chilling resonance the first film had.  The fact that they changed the ending from the book was just poor judgement.  I was not entertained . . .
0812550706|3.0|There, I said it - overrated. Yes it's a good book, imaginative, original ideas, thought provoking - but also more than a little boring.  The premise of the book is that the child Ender is the ultimate weapon in a savage war with the mysterious Buggers.  Unfortunately the story never really delves into the Buggers or combat with them except in a really abstract manner.  I don't want to spoil the story so I won't go into more detail about that aspect of the story.<br />What you get with this interesting book is lots and lots of psychology, lots of soul searching, lots of dialogue and a minimum of any real conflict.  The majority of the plot deals with Ender's training in a military school. There are some interesting wargames that take place and a few shocking incidents that show just how high stakes the games these children play really are.<br />I found the best thing this book did was make me feel very sad for the boy Ender. There are some moving parts that deal with his isolation and the difficulty of being different from the other kids. There are some emotional parts in the book that helped bring it above the level of run-of-the-mill SF, along with some compelling concepts, but overall I have reservations about this book. It's a good story, certainly better than many, but not as great as a lot of the reviews here would lead you to believe.
6305265666|4.0|This movie is pure cotton candy, and I adore it.  Could I be more in love with Dougray Scott?  A great story, a bit of adventure and a happy ending!  What more do you need?  The only thing missing from the DVD is more extras, but at least the trailer is there; I love the music they play on it.
0783114893|4.0|Well, this movie, in my opinion, was OK. C. Thomas Howell does an excellent acting job in this movie; he made it all very believable. I have to say, also, that Rutger Hauer makes a very good freak. And Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good job of acting scared. But, the movie itself, aside from the acting, is all right. The plot itself is kind of mundane, and though Rutger Hauer is very scary, the movie itself wasn't scary. It's all right.
B00003CXI1|2.0|This particular movie was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year,along with Wet Hot American Summer, and The Princess Diaries. Now, im not the biggest Harry Potter fan, though I have read all of J.K.'s books (but only half of the fourth, snore!), but I still expected better. It just wasn't that great, neither was the acting. People are writing these five star reviews not out of opinon, but rather out of deniel.Im not saying it was the worst movie ever, I just wouldint go out buying it, or claming it was one of the years \\"best films\\"...I dont know if I would have liked it more or less if I hadnt read the book first, because the fact that they cut out scenes really didnt bother me as much as it did with others. It's more like a \\"Thumbs Up\\" film rather than a \\"Two Thumbs Up\\" one...
038533558X|5.0|This book was easy to get into with lots of twists and turns. Just when you think it's predictable and you've figured it all out, you learn that nothing (or no one) is as it seems.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I think it's just totaly awesome. It couldn't be any better.
B00005JL3A|5.0|When I first heard about the movie, I was sceard. Why because of past game movies... I wont say any names but I think you can guess.<br /> I am a Resident Evil fan and when the movie hit theaters I was't sure what it would be like. Well after seeing it and knowing what it was based upon, I was very impressed... It had some conection with the game, but was different all in the same.
B0000640VN|4.0|Check your logic at the door with this film because it's all about having fun. Meg Ryan makes a return to her specialty in this cute romantic comedy. The film is reminiscient of other time travel romances but it manages to make the film interesting without stuffing the 'science' down your throat. A truly charming Hugh Jackman stars as Duke Leopold, living in the 1800's and about to choose a bride. He follows a mysterious man (Liev Schriber) through a portal of time, and finds out this man, Stewart, is his great-great-great grandson. Through circumstances a little too complicated to go through now, Leopold comes to stay with Kate (Ryan) who is Stewart's ex girlfriend. At first the two are at odds and their banter is actually funny. Leopold is polite and charming, and helps Kate in distress. He even manages to teach Kate's younger brother (Breckin Meyer) how to get the ladies. What's not to love? A romance eventually develops between the two which leads to a conflict since Leopold obviously can't stay in the future. I won't tell you what happens but I will tell you it ends with a happily ever after. The reason the film works well is the charisma and the chemistry the two leads share. While it's nice to see Meg Ryan back in her forte, it's even nicer to see Hugh Jackman playing his role with depth and believability. I had liked him before but now I like him a lot and have sought out his other films. The bottom line is, if you're looking for a film with romance, wit and acting well done, 'Kate and Leopold' will definately leave you satisfied.
0446677450|4.0|There are some good things in this book. People will have to rethink whether thier house is a Asset and the way they approach thier life and job.<br />Except for this book please donot buy any of his other books because it is just a repeat of this one.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This movie is just one of kind, great fun, very bloody. Not necessarilly really gory, I always look at gore to be maybe alot of decapitation and showing guts, however this movie had some of that but not enough to think of this as the goriest movie ever. But it is one of the bloodiest and wildest. Story of course involves some college students going up to a somewhat abandon cabin and the evil starts from there and how they unleash it, you must see for yourself. <br />The acting was well ok, however Bruce Campbell himself did awesome, I think he is a great highly underrated actor. This movie is very scary, or exciting if you will as it is also very funny sometimes, like when the possessed women say funny statements like (kill her if you can loverboy, and Were gonna get you not another peep, its just so corny yet funny.) Gets you back to enjoying the movie instead of wanting to get grossed out or terrified. <br />The work on the demons or zombies, though they didnt seem like major flesh eaters, just demons in human form are quite excellent, the rough sketching and so on. Anyone that doesnt like this film, in my opinion, you just shouldnt like horror in general because this is a damn straight horror classic and will stay that way. If you like entertaining, keep you guessing type of horror movies then see evil dead. I love the whole series, but the first one is more of a major horror movie then the others, however they are all outstanding. Dont be fooled by the ending, there is more of that too come. Also I think I figured out why Evil dead 2's storyline was so similar to this one, find out my theory on my Evil dead 2 review. Well enjoy this completely great horror movie, its one of the best.
B00005JKJA|1.0|The first half of this movie is really arousing. I kept thinking how Lynch will wrap everything up in a logical way. I found nothing except for a mess of events. It was really a waste of time. I think all those guys that say this movie is great or whatever must take a look at themselves. They must be some unlogical, non-mathematical folks, trying to give gredit to the movie just because so many people say so or ... 'forced' to say so - just a kind of groupthink.<br />On the philosophical basis, this film is even worse. Letting characters to play other character through the film is pointless. Even pure idealists always make very clear distinction between different selves, let alone materialists. Otherwise, why do we all have to distinguish between good and bad all our life? Pointless, maybe this is a dream of some maniac.<br />This film cannot be compared to Vanilla Sky on any side. I give 1 star credit for the atmosphere of the film on all audience.
6305841861|5.0|Well what can I say for this outlandish crazy movie, alot of damn fun thats for sure. Plenty of excitement and action to spare as well as alot of laughs. Not really that scary, I guess it had its moments but like I said it is exciting and loaded with tons of surprises,and this is when Bruce starts coming up with his famous quotes. <br />Well as far as my theory goes for this being so similar to the first one, its like after Bruce stopped the curse on the first one, the demon knocked him like well back in time if you will. Like a bad dream and made his memory forget everything. Like it showed a glimpse of the demon doing that in this one.That or it was just made to make no sense whatsoever kind of sequel. Anyway the special effects well some of them are really good, yet others are really dumb but I guess back when this movie came out the effects were pretty damn good. But now if you see it, dont think its a bad movie because of the not so great special effects, its quite funny how they are done like when the woman is dancing around with no head and when the possessed guy floats in the air having major slow motion and when the grandma demon's head turned into some weird type of ostrich. Its all just meant to be crazy fun and has major hilarious moments. <br />Poor Ash, you see the hellish times hes been having. Add this to your collection you can like it more then the first or less as well as just as much which I do. As for Army of Darkness well thats on its own. Get this great horror, comedy movie, and you wont be dissapointed, however it isn't quite as violent as the first yet still often has major bloody parts. And for the final yes the once like invicible demon is now exposed, wow now you see why it was so strong. Enjoy!!!
B000068OSK|5.0|Just to clear this up once and for all ...  White Stripes is not a  brother/sister duo. They were married, then divorced. They invented their past, in the same way Dylan did in his early days. Oh, yeah ... buy the CD. It's great.

B0000640VN|5.0|I love the way that the directors cut was included on this DVD.I think that some of these scenes were needed to make you want to see this film again and again . Also this is the only non childrens film I felt like I could watch with my mother this year so far.
B0000640SA|5.0|This review is mainly about the Limited Edition of Memento. What an excellent package! it is truly something anyone who thought anything good of this movie to get. this movie makes you think and the DVD packaging does the same. Great work Mr. Nolan!
B000065U1N|4.0|Wonderful movie only gave it 4 stars because I have seen saving private Ryan and it was done slightly better.<br />This is a very realistic view of war. Should we help people just because they need help, or should we just let them wipe themselves out? Would it do any good to kill the persons responsible for starting the war if most of the population had rather fight the war than grow crops to feed themselves, even going so far as to not let people have food given to them because an outsider was delivering it.Maybe in the next war we can just go and get the sane people out of the country and let the people who are left finish their war.  :,(
B00003CXI1|2.0|I finally bought the movie. I can't believe what a shallow story line it had. This was a slow movie. I suggest that whatever few haven't seen it yet; to wait for it to play on TV, or just keep a close eye at garage sales, ..., for this.<BR>I was really disappointed by the degree of hype associated to this movie. I wished I would have read 'my' review before buying it....   :(
B000002ADT|5.0|definitely one of the best Jazz albums ever recorded.  This disc is worth every cent you'll pay for it. (and more...that sounds corny doesn't it?  still....its true).
B000002J6F|5.0|After releasing the average (average by his standards) Stephen Stills 2.  The former member of CSN&amp;Y hooked up with former Byrd/Flying Burrito Brother Chris Hillman to put together a huge band known as Manassas.  Along with Stills and Hillman were Dallas Taylor, Paul Harris, Paul &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Samuels, Al Perkins and Joe Lala.  Although Manassas was just considered a back up band for Stills it is obvious that this band was destined to record a wonderful album.  And they did.  On April 12th 1972 Manassas' debut record was released.<br />The album itself is brilliant as almost every style of music is covered here.  You'll find a collection of rock, country rock, folk rock, jazz rock or blues rock tunes that only a musician with the talents of Stephen Stills would be able to dream up.  The album was divided into four different sections of musical genres that define popular music at the time.<br />THE RAVEN is the first section it features some rock 'n roll, jazz and blues. SONG OF LOVE opens the album with a bang followed by ROCK 'N ROLL CRAZIES and the latin jazz CUBAN BLUEGRASS.  JET SET (SIGH) is a great blues rock tune.  ANYWAY falls into the latin jazz rock style similar to Santana. BOTH OF US (BOUND TO LOSE) is a fine jazzy love ballad.  <br />THE WILDERNESS is obviously the country rock section of the album, opening up with the bluegrass like FALLEN EAGLE which I find a tad goofy but JESUS GAVE LOVE AWAY FOR FREE makes up for it as it is a wonderful country ballad.  COLORADO is another great country love song.  SO BEGINS THE TASK may be the best song on the album.  HIDE IT SO DEEP has a nice easy going feel to it.  DON'T LOOK AT MY SHADOW is a very fun tune to listen to which closes THE WILDERNESS section.<br />CONSIDER has often been consider the best part of the album.  It contiains more folk and rock 'n roll music.  IT DOESN'T MATTER is a wonderful rock 'n roll song with fantastic lyrics.  JOHNNY'S GARDEN is a nice acoustic piece that finds Stills paying tribute to Lennon.  BOUND TO FALL is a quirky folk tune.  HOW FAR is anpther great rock tune that delivers a nice message.  MOVE AROUND is an echoing trippy tune.  LOVE GANGSTER feature some great funky guitar grooves by Stills that closes the CONSIDER section.<br />This opens ROCK 'N ROLL IS HERE TO STAY whcih basically wraps up all loose ends.  WHAT TO DO is a laid back feeling rocker.  RIGHT NOW is another great fast paced rocker.  THE TREASURE (TAKE ONE) is a classic.<BR>BLUES MAN is a nice acoustic blues that closes this musical monument.<br />Overall MANASSAS is an awesome album. One of the finest albums ever recorded perhaps.  Thank the lord for Stephen Stills musical genius because this recording would have never existed had he not been around.  This album along with his solo debut define his musical brilliance.  Thank you Stephen for this wonderful music.  This album is essential for all serious music fans.  Highly recommended!
0440219078|4.0|This book, The Giver, is a pretty ok book I guess. In some parts you get confused because Lois Lowry didnt really explain it that well. In some chapters it made me want to think ahead of what was going to happen next. In the beginning the book was pretty boring. However it was ok later on. <BR>   This book makes you think of your own pictures in your head. Some things in the book shocked  me like Jonas recieved  memories and the punishment Babies and the Old's got.<BR>   This book has very good vocabulary words, that some of them you have to look up while your reading ( unless you know the word) i recomened this book for kids starting from the age 12. Even so in that age, you will get confused a little. Lowry says something doesnt exist like war and the weapons, but later on it says that Asher and other friends were playing with imaginary \\"WEAPONS\\". Overall this book is very interesting...
B000002I6T|5.0|Considering that David Crosby did not release another solo album for another 17 years after this.  'If I Could Only Remember My Name' ranks as his finest effort outside Crosby Stills Nash & Young and his later work with Graham Nash as a duo.  'If I Could Only Remember My Name' is a real piece of hippy culture.  It is very dreamy, druggy, and spaced out yet it has a very comfurting beauty the sooths the soul.  To say the album is wildly uneven would be a most accurate definition of it however 'If I Could Only Remember My Name' has a musical dominance that few recordings ever achieve.<br />The album has to awesome musical qualities (1) Great guitar playing (2) Wonderful vocals by Crosby he truly does have a beautiful album.  MUSIC IS LOVE is a hippy jam song with wonderful vocals and guitars by Crosby and Neil Young.  COWBOY MOVIE is an eight minute long rocker that remains as a classic David Crosby tune.  TAMALPAIS HIGH (AT ABOUT 3) has wonderful harmonic humming by Crosby.  LAUGHING is a beautiful tune.  WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES is a dominant rocker that asks, \\"Is peace so much to ask for?\\"<BR>TRACTION IN THE RAIN is another beautiful tune with some nice dreamy guitar playing.  SONGS WITH NO WORDS does nothave any words just Crosby doing his famous harmonic humming.  The final tracks end the album rather unevenly but are excellent examples of Crosby's vocal range.  ORLEANS has beautiful harmony as well as nice acoustics and I'D SWEAR THERE WAS SOMEBODY HERE has a Gregorian-like chant that closes this album unevenly yet beautifully. <br />Overall Crosby's solo album is an interesting yet uneven outing on record.  However it may be one of the most beautiful sounding albums ever.  There's no denying that under the stoned dreamy feel of this record lies true harmonic beauty that merely asks for peace.  With the events that happend on September 11th 2001 all of a sudden this is the type of album the world needs to listen to.<BR>Highly recommended!

B000002J6H|5.0|Stephen Stills was (and still is) my favourite member of Crosby Stills Nash & Young.  So like most of the other reviewers here I am shocked by the statements by the Amazon.com reviewer.  Stills the least accomplished of CSN&Y?  Thats not true, if it weren't for Stills there would be no CSN&Y.  He wrote the majority of their best songs and was truly a talented musician on his own as he proved here.<br />Stephen Stills self titled debut is arguably his best album of his solo years (only Manassas can be considered better).  Most music fans should already know the opening track LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH which was one of Stills biggest hits.  It featured the vocal talents of David Crosby, Graham Nash, Rita Coolidge, Priscilla Jones and John Sebastian.  DO FOR THE OTHERS is a wonderful acoustic song with some philosphical lyrics.  CHURCH (PART OF SOMEONE) is somewhat of an anthem.  OLD TIMES GOOD TIMES is an awesome rocker with Jimi Hendrix on the guitar and Stills playing impressively on the Hammond organ.  GO BACK HOME is a wonderful blues rock tune with Stills and Eric Clapton trading awesome guitar riffs.  SIT YOURSELF DOWN is another lesser known hit that featured the backing vocals of Rita Coolidge, Priscilla Jones, Claudia Lanier, John Sebastian, Cass Elliot, and David Crosby.  TO A FLAME is a beautiful love ballad with a touch of jazz influence.  BLACK QUEEN once again displays Stills amazing acoustic guitar talents.  CHEROKEE is a riveting jazzy rocker with some amazing guitar, saxophone and organ.  The closing track WE ARE NOT HELPLESS is a nice powerful closer featuring the backing vocal guests once again.  The song starts off as a simple acoustic piece by Stills but turns into a powerful rocking anthem. <br />This album truly shows the musical variety and diversity Stills put into his work.  Whether it was rock 'n roll, folk and country rock, jazz, or blues rock Stills would play it wonderfully.  It is also a real treat to have many guest musicians here too such as Clapton, Hendrix, the other members of CSN&Y among others.  However Stills proved on this album that he could easily work on his own without the help of others for he wrote all of these amazing songs as well as played the majority of instruments.<br />Overall Stephen Stills' self titled debut is a wonderful album that could very well equal the brilliance of CSN&Y's Deja Vu.<BR>It is an album of musical diversity and seems to have aged quite well.  This is one of my personal favourites from him.  Highly recommended!
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem. One of the greatest of all time. The new album is on point no lie. But what can you expect from, in my opinion, one of the greatest of all time.I honestly believe he needs to be put on a pedestal along with Tupac and Biggie. I believed that Tupac THE greatest and realest rappers of all time, until Eminem came along. He is one that hold nothing back and lets everyone know the real no matter what the consequences may be. And that's how it should be. All i got to say is do the damn thang Em.
B00002E23E|5.0|You know a band is good when they can go on stage and come out with better versions of songs than the studio versions.  That's exactly what Zeppelin does in The Song Remains the Same, and if you have any question of their talent, I urge you to watch the introduction of Since I've Been Loving You, in which they zoom in on Page's fingers during an incredible solo.  Incredible.  Then watch the 1/2 hour version of Dazed and Confused, including Page's bow trick which makes the most unbelievable sound come out of the guitar.  Just watch the whole thing.  You wont be sorry.
B00005O3VC|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie I have ever watched.  Granted, some parts are funny, but this movie just goes over the edge.  One of my favorite movies is Spaceballs.  It knows where to draw the line; The Holy Grail does not.  If I had to sit through that much stupidity ever again in my life I would probably kill myself ten minutes into the movie.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If the title of this review sounds like an oxymoron, then you get some idea of the dichotomies in the film.  This is a weirdly wonderful, artistic film which delights the eye and the ear, and plays on the viewer's emotions.  The plot concerns a young writer (Ewan McGregor) who is mistaken for a duke by a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman).  She falls in love with the writer, while playing up to the duke so that he will bankroll the play which the young man is writing for her.  The play parallels their real lives in this cat-and-mouse game where the young couple try to hide their affair from the duke.  Finally the duke catches on and threatens to kill the writer if the courtesan doesn't leave him.  McGregor and Kidman display great emotional intensity and beautiful singing voices in their starring roles, and the supporting parts are also well played.  Throw away your old preconceptions of what a musical is like and enjoy the beauty and poetry of this film.
B000002NFM|5.0|I love this album.  Before I heard the songs on here, I thought you couldn't appreciate electronica without glowsticks and ecstasy.  Hearing Howlett's work, however, opened me up to the entire genre.<br />I love everything about this album, from the menacing guitars (and even more menacing vocals) to the sheer chutzpah the band has for starting an album with \\"Smack My B**** Up\\" and ending it by covering \\"Fuel My Fire\\" by L7, one of the best feminist rock groups ever.  <br />If you are a rock fan with an interest in electronic music, get this album.  Now.
B0000636UN|4.0|I was honestly surprised with how much I have enjoyed this album.  The Liz Phair cameo was nice, if brief.  A solid release that deserves more attention than past efforts.
1572702125|5.0|David Suchet does a superb job with the narration and the various voices and accents. Even though I'm quite familiar with this story, listening to the Audio CD added a new dimension to the mystery.
B000001Y5J|5.0|See title for the summation of this:<br />Broken is one of the most visceral, independent, persistant, sinewy, incredible and playable EP's of all time, hands down.<br />And some of us have the version with the mini-disc and horde it like the Maltese Falcon.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I imagine everybody knows what &quot;Memento&quot; is about by now, so I will be brief: Leonard, who can't make new memories due to a brain trauma, is on the trail of his wife's killer. The movie is told in a series of two tales: One, working backward, is the &quot;current&quot; storyline, filmed in color, told in 10-minute increments that jump backward. The second, filmed in b/w, which takes place well before the &quot;current&quot; storyline, is interspersed between each &quot;current&quot; segment, and it runs forward. At the end, both storylines meet.<br />It's brilliant. The characters are fascinating, with constant surprises (who CAN you trust, the movie asks). There's a delicious sense of disorientation caused by the backward movement, because we don't know any more than Leonard does how he got into each new situation. We, the audience, also see that Leonard trusts his intuition and his skills more than he should (he thinks he's a great read of character, but he makes several very key misjudgments; he thinks he's terribly organized, but he doesn't have photos of nearly everybody he should, and he doesn't even carry a pen in one crisis situation to write something down before it's lost), things that are revealed slowly through the backward takes.<br />In the end, the movie is an expose of how unreliable memory is. Leonard's own memories of his pre-trauma days are not reliable, but his belief in them is crucial to his well-being. Even when told a very plausible story of what *really* happened, at the end, the audience realizes, with a pang of loss, that this is the beginning of the &quot;current&quot; storyline and that Leonard will go the rest of the storyline not remembering what he has gone to so much trouble to discover.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I recently discovered John Mayer and this guy is talented! For anyone that just likes a great smooth sound you'll love this cd.  Forget the other reviewer's overanalysis and comparisons to other artists....John's sound is unique....buy this cd and you won't be sorry.
0441003257|5.0|I love this book! I re-read it every year or so. I've never seen such a giddy-paced or tight comedy. Every so often, just to show you they can, the authors throw in a zinger (as in their discussion of how old the Earth is, a dry essay which ends with &quot;This also proves that the Earth is a Libra&quot;). The writing is for the most part easy to follow with careful reading, with an interesting assortment of characters. The book is a fast read, which isn't so great because at the end, I wanted WAY more.<br />The religious theories espoused here won't deeply offend anybody, I don't think (they're pretty absurd, on the whole), but they *will* make one think. I was Pentecostal when I first found &quot;Good Omens&quot;, and while I cannot claim it is wholly responsible for my unconversion, it gave me quite a bit of food for thought. I really couldn't find any holes in their logic. They start with a fairly tight premise and roll on from there. There are neat little touches that make perfect sense (like demons having the same wings angels have, &quot;except better groomed&quot;).<br />I do hope these authors collaborate again, if not on &quot;Good Omens&quot; related works then somewhere. They're clearly a force to be reckoned with.
B000002HPV|5.0|In my opinion, this albulm is one of the most brilliant albulms ever (the others are mostly by Bjork, hehe). It's stunning and one feels as if they are having an out-of-body expieriance while listening to it.<br />It ranges in beauty and style from song to song, each one amazing in its own way. It starts out with Hunter, a techno-symphony, slow and quiet yet extremely powerful, exemplified by the qwirky beats, agressive cellos, and Bjork's sultry voice.<br />The next song is Joga (pronounced Yoga I think) which I think is my personal favorite on the albulm. It begins with Bjork singing beautifuly backed up by wonderous orchestral scales and hamonies and then bursts with beuty as another electronic beat backs the whole song up. Like the music video, and the lyrics it reminds the listener of &quot;emotional landscapes&quot; and pushes them to a &quot;state of emergency&quot; because of it's immense beauty. It reminds me Iceland! (Bjork, was that the point of the video?)<br />Unravel is hard to explain. I think it the nicest love song I've ever heard. With odd beats, and a beautiful simple horn Bjork sings about her heart unraveling when her lover is away, like a beautiful lulybuy (however that's spelled), it soothes the listener.<br />The other popular single off this albulm, Bachelorette, is like a fully orchestrated, techno-ized tango-ballad. That's how I'd describe it. And it is beautiful. Somewhat reminiscent of the mood of Isobel, from her prior albulm Post, I think this is one of my other favorites (ack! they all are!!)<br />This one, All Neon Like, I can't describe. It sounds like icsicles dancing I think, and then they start to glow. Thats the best description. It's stunning, and magical, and I'm running out of sinonymms for beautiful!!<br />5 Years, is a gorgeous-aggresive song, with great electronic beats, and a lovely melody. This mood is remaniscent of Army of Me, from Post, with a little more sadness.<br />Immature, is a light scratchy song, and kind of the same mood as the song before it, but somewhat without a melody, and a mixture of emotions and sadness.<br />Ah, we're on to Alarm Call, yea! I love this one, it gets me jumping. The lyrics are great, and i love the images it puts in my mind. She keeps repeating &quot;Didn't scare me at all&quot; in all the perfect places. It's a happy song thats gets you happy, and has a great mixture of samplings of Bjork singing different things all over the place, that just fit together.<br />Pluto kind of reminds me of a Garbage song, the angriest song on the albulm I think, A static-y Bjork voice pierces through agressive beats, and escalates with some signiture &quot;oooohh-ahhhhs&quot; and an ocassional raspy belt.<br />All is full of Love is a sweet, calming breathy song, with echoed sounds, somewhat harpsachordy like, and long echoed distant notes. It's kind of like being underwater with the coral, and sand, lulled to sleep by Bjork's gorgeous voice, coming from all directions.<br />It's such a great albulm, and now I can't type anymore because I think I'm running out of room, but this is a spectacular albulm and although not one to start out with if you are a newcomer to Bjork (I think Post should be first, then Debut, then this one), it's simply marvelous and a work of art.
B000060P79|5.0|I'm not usually a rock music person. I saw these guys on the shelf at a music store. so when i got home i downloaded one of the songs. I fell in love. I had to buy it. and so, of course, I did. The vocals on this album are amazing. His voice is so smooth! Well, you HAVE to buy this cd. I am telling you now, you wont be disappointed. My favorites are &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;One Day&quot;, but i love them all too. So what are you waiting for!? click the BUY button, get ur credit card and.. and yah, from there do whatever u want..
B000005ZGZ|5.0|My favorite Fugazi album, 'End Hits' has all the noisy punk-ness I would want but with immense creativity and musical exploration, which raise this fine collection of songs way, way above mere guitar clatter and vocal protestations, achieving dizzying new heights for indie music. It would have been easy for a band to simply lose themselves in their experimentation and forget that there are listeners out there longing to be entertained, but not Fugazi - they created these great songs such that they can be enjoyed on many levels. More accessible than Red Medicine (which is one of my other Fugazi faves) but more sonically complex than 13 Songs or Repeater (or for that matter, anything that came before RM I suppose), I consider this CD to be their most satisfying effort.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This movie is really great!  It required thought, which is rare in film.  I thought all of the performances were excellent and would recommend it to anyone who likes to be entertained by suspense movies or movies w/ somewhat unexpected endings.  Also, The Importance of Being Earnest is really good too, if you enjoy British films.
B00005JL0U|5.0|This is a great \\"Shot Film\\" which stars the one and only, Michael Jackson! Please don't believe all this junk about him. He is the same amazing superstar that he was back in the 80s that everyone, including you, yes you, adored and loved. Checkout this movie ...
0030565812|4.0|For many of us here in the United States, we heard of Nelson Mandela just before he was released from prison in South Africa.  We cheered as he became the president, for we knew this was a step towards racial equality in South Africa.  But, most of us do not know why he was imprisoned, how he became a leader, and what the conditions were like in his country before he was elected.  This book goes through all this.<br />Mandela grew up in the village of Qunu in the Transkei region of South Africa where he enjoyed a rural life without many of the amenities we take for granted today.  We follow Mandela has he attends school and college while he begins to understand more about the world around him and the plight of Africans in South Africa.  This provides a contrast to his living in presidential quarters which helps illustrate how long the proverbial walk was.<br />The bulk of the book deals with his time in the ANC and in prison (where he was a political prisoner being punished for his beliefs in freedom).  Mandela seems to downplay his individual role in all of this, but illustrates that he was one part of something much larger.  He mentions names of many colleagues and organizations which had a part in fighting apartheid.<br />At times, I struggled with the names because I am not familiar with the pronunciation.  With time, these will not slow you down, and you will appreciate how great this struggle for freedom was.  I recommend reading this book.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch is his own genre.  The only way to explain this movie is to watch it yourself, then discussion upon discussion will take place.  That is why I recommend owning this DVD.  You need to watch it more than once, twice, or even three times to catch every last puzzle piece to put the mystery together.  It's beautifully directed, the props and sets are constructed in a way that every article in each scene has its own place and importance, as well as great performances by the two leads.  Lynch's storytelling goes beyond the conventional Hollywood structure, and in Mulholland Drive he's in top form.  If you like challenging films that cause you to think, MD is for you.  Don't get this DVD for the special features - there are none.  Get it, because it's a film you'll want to watch over and over.  Highly recommend.
B000002B7S|5.0|To be honest, I got this album because of the cover.  Ozzy as a werewolf is pretty spooky looking.  After listening to this and wearing out the tape, I had to replace this with a CD; I would be listening to this many times.<br />Some of these are signature pieces, such as \\"Bark at the Moon\\" and  \\"Rock' N' Roll Rebel.\\" Even though not the signature pieces, others maintain the feel of a great Ozzy song and of the album cover.  \\"Centre of Eternity,\\" \\"Waiting for Darkness,\\" and \\"Now You See It (Now You Don't)\\" all instill the drive and kick of classic 80s metal.  There is no flash to these songs.  <br />On the album is also the ballad \\"So Tired,\\" which should never be overlooked.<br />I would highly recommend listening to this again and again.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is as authentic as early American delta blues can get. Muddy leaves his stamp on the genre with this fantastic album. I picked this album up, confusing it with &quot;The Real Folk Blues&quot;, which is another amazing album, but I have never had to regret having this one.<br />Muddy, Buddy, and Dixon together in a room, playing their hearts out! What a treat. Slide, picking, harp, and horns keep the songs sharp and soulful, while Muddy's voice is so rich you could swear he was in the next room. <br />I really can't find a fault with this album. Flawless.
B000005DQR|5.0|There's no need to write any long reviews about this album. Quite simply it's one of the most essential c.d.'s that came out in the 90's. If you ever wondered where some of the sounds of current musical trends originated from then look no further then this c.d. Using vast quantities of samples from what must be one of the biggest vinyl collections in the world-Josh Davis managed to create a monster of a c.d. that maybe long yet it seems to drift through from start to finish in no time. You'd imagine that a c.d. borrowing from so many types of music may sound a bit disjointed-be it hip-hop,furious breakbeats to chill out sounds,ambient,electronica (there isn't many better examples of good electronica than Stem/Long Stem) to funky music and the even funkier and often hilarious spoken word interludes(I love the stroy about &quot;the girl with eyes as big as Jolly Ranchers&quot;). The real sign that Davis is a genre breaking genius is the way he manages to knit the whole c.d. into one coherent piece of music. The classic intro of how (He?-I'm not sure whose voice the first track is) got into music sets the tome and it continues for one mind blowing hour. I'd have to say I became complacent about how good this c.d. is.I really began to understand it's quality once again when I purchased his latest c.d. &quot;Private Press&quot;-which while being good in parts,simply fails to live up to this c.d. When you consider that the work he did with James Lavelle on the UNKLE c.d. isn't quite as good either,you begin to think that maybe Davis set the standard to high with this debut. I just don't know how he can ever match the standards set on this c.d. never mind surpass them!
B00004Y6TQ|1.0|Don't know if this album just goes to prove that Bjork's prior great moments were flukes, or not. Whatever, this album is desperately in need of some decent songcraft. Frankly, tracks like I've Seen It All are ridiculous to the point of being hysterically funny.
B000065U1N|5.0|This one different war movie I have seen in my lifetime. I am a movie buff and people may say I am doing nothing but but just making comment or writing a review. Believe me this is not the case.  The movie has a different taste and please dont go by the critics words.  The movie has all the excitement, drama and spices of a true war movie. Since this one is made of a true story in Somalia you can capture the real emotions.  What else can I tell ya, go grab one and see it ur'self..........
0345448898|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read, it is better than Harry Potter and anyone who compares the two is mad, Pullman creates an exiting new world and shows it through the eyes of caracters so amazing you will fall in love with them, Lyra, Will, Iorek, and the rest of the gang will blow your mind, it was funny, exiting, and even heartbreaking, i do recomend that this book be considerd for teens mostly because at some point it may be confusing, but it has nothing to do with the opinion of others who say it is '' questioning gods existence'' , that is not true after all its only fiction, i recomend this book to anyone it is a great pice of literature.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I owned this film a few years ago on laser disc and sold it when it became apparent that the medium was gasping it's last breaths.  To my disappointment, this was one of a large number of films that I was unable to replace with DVD.  While \\"The Fog\\" has been available on VHS for many years, the few of us who have had the privelege to view it in wide screen format can attest for the fact that you have missed half of the story if you've only seen the full screen version.<BR>I'm also happy to see so many positive reviews for this film, which I've long considered to be a grossly underrated horror classic.  John Carpenter (who's films tend to be hit-or-miss at best) is right on the mark with this film: his cinematography is at times serene and lovely, at times tense and frightning.  His standard electronic score is as unnerving here as it was in \\"Halloween\\" and \\"The Thing.\\"  And the cast...!  Adrienne Barbeau finds a career defining role in Stevie Wayne, the lighthouse-keeper DJ who watches over the residents of Antonio Bay from her lookout on Spivey Point.  The mother-daughter pairing of Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh is noteworthy, although the two share little screen time together.  John Houseman and Hal Holbrook deliver interesting cameos, as does John Carpenter himself as Bennett, the janitor at Holbrook's church.  My favorite character, however, is Sandy Fadel, the painfully bored assistant to Leigh's councilwoman, played with plenty of dry wit by Nancy Kyes (also a reteaming with Curtis - Kyes played Annie in \\"Halloween\\").<BR>This films arrival on DVD is long overdue... if you haven't already seen it, you're in for a treat!
B00004RYZT|5.0|I just recently started listening to Rammstein because of the <BR>cover to Depeche Mode's \\"Stripped\\" (Sensucht Cd).  The music is very much harder than other bands I frequent (Project Pitchfork) but I enjoy there image and music.  Live Aus Berlin DVD is AWESOME!!!!
0971830509|4.0|The King In Yellow is not what I expected;  the horror more subtle, the portraits of old Paris more sensitive, and neither set of stories particularly worn for their age.      It is clear to see the connection between the first and the contributions of Lovecraft and King, but I wonder particularly about the inspiration behind one of the latter, \\"The Prophets' Paradise\\", and who may have picked up _that_ thread of literature in the intervening years.
B000065V1V|4.0|I've now listened to \\"Heathen\\" three times all the way through since I bought it last night. I am a lifetime fan of David Bowie, but no starry eyed \\"oooooh everything you do is perfect...\\" kind of fan. I have at times been a very harsh critic. Always I've known, deep down in my heart, that one day he would finally FINALLY put out \\"The One\\". This is it. GOD I LOVE THIS ALBUM. He's stopped trying to \\"keep up with the kids\\" and has instead gone to pick up where he left off round about 1980. Perfect. I LOVE the SOUND of this CD. It's so wonderfully familiar, like we never left the seventies... but it has the present and future in there too. Bringing back Tony Visconti is apparently a stroke of genius. A refreshingly cohesive collection that veers between cosmic cabaret and fabulous glam-outs. Great choice of covers (Pixies \\"Cactus\\" and Legendary Stardust Cowboy's \\"I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spaceship\\" in particular) and an overall sense of gorgeous ennui...mixed with a palpable EXCITEMENT. Do yourself a favor. HEADPHONES. LOUD. Tiny little bits of interesting stuff everywhere. The closing track \\"Heathen (The Rays)\\" is an absolute stunner that could fit perfectly anywhere on any of the Berlin-era albums. Yay. I might even raise this to five stars if the feeling doesn't wear off - I don't think it will. JUST WHEN I THOUGHT ROCK WAS TRULY DEAD.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Great movie! If you have home theater so much the better. I saw the movie in the theater and this is just as good. The first half of the movie looks at the battle for Little Roundtop from the North's perspective. Th second half looks at Pickets Charge from the South's Perspective. This is where the stereo sound comes in. The cannonade before Pickets Charge is spectacular. It also has bonus of the Making of Getttysburg which gives an insight on how the movie was made. GREAT MOVIE One of my favorites
B0000639FE|5.0|The American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Passions list of America's greatest love stories must be pretty good when it starts with Cameron Crowe's 1996 film, \\"Jerry Maquire.\\"  Hopefully you saw this movie fore the first time before the Oscars they actually showed the \\"you had me at hello\\" scene from the film's climax.  Not since \\"Chinatown\\" did the Oscars ruin a film by screening a spoiler clip like this one (the one where Jack gets Faye to spill the beans about her \\"daughter\\").<br />Jerry Maquire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who has a moral ephihany and ends up getting fired.  Down to one client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an angry wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, Jerry also snared single-mother Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellwegger) with his vision.  Gooding got the Oscar but the performance of the film really belongs to Cruise.  Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's older and wiser sister is, as always, a joy, and it is her look at Jerry during his climatic speech that assures the audience his character has indeed earned redemption.  If you look at the body of work he has produced to date, then Cameron Crowe may already be the acknowledged master of the modern romantic drama.  So explain to me how \\"Say Anything,\\" with one of the great romantic shots of all time, is not on AFI's list?  See?  #100 and already I am complaining.<br />Most romantic line(s): TIE (a) \\"I love you. You... complete me.\\" and (b) \\"Shut up. Just shut up. You had me at 'hello'.\\"<br />Two Tear-Jerking Scenes: (1) Jerry and Rod hug after the game; (2) Jerry goes back for Dorothy.<br />If you like \\"Jerry Maguire,\\" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #76 \\"The Quiet Man.\\"  Why? Because they both have true love coming out after the marriage ceremony.
B00005OAIE|1.0|I can't believe people buy this tripe! In fact, I'd rather consume pounds of tripe rather than listen to John Mayer, if in fact that is his real name. <br />I didn't think there could be anyone duller than Dave Matthews, but WE HAVE A WINNER! His name is John Mayer!
B00003CXXS|1.0|What an insult to my intelligence this film was. As a fan of Spielberg's work--and the biggest film critic in Milwaukee--I wasn't surprised that he wasn't at the helm for this picture. 'Jurassic Park III' shows the signs of every B movie I've ever seen, but dumbs even that down to a point where I could not help but laugh. <br />For starters, the plot for 'Jurassic Park III' was thin to the point where you forget fifteen minutes into the film what it was even about. Instead, you stare as our heroic characters run through the trees in fret, fleeing the approaching dinosaur...again. <br />'Jurassic Park' ranks as one of my favorite movies of all time, easily cracking my Top 25, which is an extremely difficult task. However disappointed I was with 'The Lost World' disappeared after viewing this sequel. Yeah, 'JP2' had its problems and was not as fresh as the original, but this film is simply a disaster. How much of this are we supposed to believe, anyway? I mean, if dinosaurs could exist again, I strongly doubt that a 12-year-old boy could survive for two months alone when in the original and 'JP2', dino experts with guns were no match for the beasts. <br />Also, the entire segment with the satellite phone was just jaw-dropping. Are we really supposed to believe that a phone will be audible when it's in the stomach of a dinosaur? I mean, chances are that it would have been destroyed when originally eaten, right? Yes, the entire movie follows this pattern.<br />This review doesn't even take into account the apparent lack of beginning, middle, climax and end to this film. In fact, at an hour and a half, that was probably the best part...it was forty minutes shorter than the first two, making my time of sitting around waiting for it to end greatly reduced. <br />And finally, the scariest thing about this film is the following: Spielberg wants to make more. I'm sorry, Mr. Spielberg, but Mr. Johnston ruined all credibility this series had...stick to NOT making sequels like you once did.
B00003CXXP|1.0|How many directors does it take to ruin an amazing story? Apparently, two are enough if they're exceptionally talented. To anyone who read Brian Aldiss' original story it is painfully clear this film is an attempt to explain the riddles and complex philosophical questions raised in the original story rather than to simply tell a story. The transition between Kubrick's film/vision and Spielberg's film/vision is entirely obvious. It's almost as though there are two films in one. The second part of the film, after the mechanical boy is abandoned in the woods by his \\"mother\\", attempts to explain the first part by paralleling the story with the mythical story of Pinocchio. This attempt, in my opinion, is the fundamental flaw of this movie. It somehow transformed a film with depth into a 2-dimensional circus of sights and sounds, a road movie that ends up at the bottom of the ocean, a conglomeration of Spielberg's usual schtick. This movie subverted itself with it's own imagery. If you don't believe me, read Brian Aldiss' original short story. It is deeper than any ocean this film has to offer.
B00005JKED|5.0|This is a great movie, especially in context of the Rampart Scandal faced by LAPD. There is very little to complain about in watching this movie, it's powerful, it reflects real life, and the good guy wins. The soundtrack is fantastic, the ending is not expected. Worth it.
6305327041|4.0|four rooms isn't as bad as people will tell you it is.  i found it best that i knew alot abot it before i saw i.  it's worth watching just for tim roth's hilarious perfrmance as ted the bellboy.  of course...anything written, let alone directed, even if it's just 1/4 of a movie, by quentin tarantino i'll give a chance and probably like.  four rooms is worth a watch, and its like tarantino said himself: &quot;if the audience likes our story, great.  if they don't...too bad.&quot;  words of wisdom for all you negative people right there
B00005OAIE|1.0|&quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; is quite possibly the worst song title I have ever heard of.  Your body may be a wonderland, but John Mayer's body of work is a snoozeland. The album blends wonderfully together because it's all one big long song called &quot;What America Wants To Hear For Some Unknown Reason.&quot; Please people, if you're going to listen to this stuff, get some headphones.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|After watching the movie, I fall in love with the song &quot;Your Song,&quot; in which Ewan McGregor is singing to Nicole Kidman at her bedroom. Thus, I bought this soundtrack. At first I was only listening to track 6 (&quot;Your Song&quot;) when I first purchased this album. Later, when I started to listen to other titles, I discovered that they are all marvellous. Too bad that most songs are 'non-original,' or else they should have won the best song title in the Academy Awards earlier this year. ;)<br />I'm truly surprised, like others, to find that both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman can sing well. Now I'm wondering if Ewan would release a solo album soon, so that I can play it all day long in my stereo. :D<br />This is a must-have album if you like Moulin Rouge.
0792163710|5.0|A short review of in my opinion THE GREATEST WESTERN, taking note of some other reviews:<br />* 1stly, the representation of violence has a distinctive verisimilitude, so criticisms about the depictions of conflict are somewhat unfair. For eg, Elisha Cook Jr being thrown back in his gunfight with Jack Palance may not be ballistically correct -but the sense of impact and untold damage to the human body is ideally conveyed. <br />* 2ndly, the DVD itself has an outstanding commentary, contrary to some opinions, especially important as it is done by the best remaining participants on the film. If the filmmaker were alive, we would expect a commentary from him - but this is as close as we can get, and one must appreciate the content, although not always scene specific. For instance, referral to archival notes from the director.<BR>(The problem with commentaries is a studio marketing one, in that DVDs should have scene specific commentary or general commentary noted on the packaging).<br />SO IF YOU LIKE THE FILM, YOU WILL LIKE THE DVD.....
B000003S0B|4.0|or at least, that's how I see it.  This is an amazing record--and while it is a follow up to a masterpiece, I think it is a masterpiece in it's own right.  Granted &quot;Pictures of a City&quot; bares a passing resemblence to &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, but in my view it is far better.  The drumming alone is amazing.  Given the personnel  problems that were occuring in the group at the time, it surprises me that the Crims were able to pull off an album as good as this.
0812550706|5.0|I can honestly say that Ender's Game is one of the best books I have ever read. It was an assignment in my Honors Literature class and once I started, I couldn't put it down.<br />The Buggers are coming again. Ender Wiggin is only six years old when he is taken from his family and sent to Battle School. It is on his shoulders that rests the fate of the entire human world. His sharp mind is well-suited for developing military tactics and he rises to meet all his challenges and obstacles. It is hard to remember that he is still only a little boy.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that has an open mind and is willing to grasp the concepts Card includes in this compelling novel. And so the saga begins...
B00005JKJA|5.0|Just know what you're getting into when you purchase ANY David Lynch film on DVD... the man himself is kinda spiteful toward the format for one very interesting reason: he feels that his films (or any film for that matter) should be seen from beginning to end in one continuous viewing without breaks and without the chance to jump from scene to scene.  When you view a Lynch film you're in his world, like it or not (and if not, then why did you bother in the first place?  Go rent or buy some Jerry Bruckheimer garbage and get your cinematic kicks that way).<BR>Lynch is not into commentaries, so you won't find any (however, The new &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; special edition disc is as loaded as any Lynch DVD gets, but he still won't sit for a commentary track, so don't hold your breath that there will be one for the &quot;Eraserhead&quot; DVD).  Other than that, suffice to say, Lynch's film as deeply disturbing as most of his work (save for &quot;The Straight Story&quot; which is a wonderful film from a different side of the Lynch spectrum) and very tragic (in my opinion, one of the most tragic &quot;love stories&quot; I've ever seen).  The DVD is of excellent quality both visually and aurally, and aside from anticipated extras that never materialize on any of his DVD's (again, except for the new Blue Velvet disc), this is totally worth owning, especially if you're a David Lynch fan.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I missed Moulin Rouge when it was screening in the theatre. I first thought it was just another musical drama. Then, I got the movie on the 2-disc DVD release. After watching it, the movie, as well as the DVD, turn out to become one of my favorite titles for all time!<br />The cinematography is spectacular. Colour is vivid. Scenes are stunning. And songs are wonderful too. I particularly like the part where Ewan McGregor is singing &quot;Your Song&quot; at Nicole Kidman's bedroom. It's simply awesome! Because of this song, I also bought its soundtrack (this song is located at Track 6), which is a must-have if you like the movie like me. :)<br />This DVD title is feature-packed. I've spent over 2 hours and yet I still haven't finished watching all the bonus materials. It really worths a place in your DVD shelf.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I watched this movie because I am a very large fan of artsy, ambient, and ultraviolent cinema. While this film is not to say \\"violent\\" it is definitely not one for the feint of heart. I have heard of other people vomiting during the watching of this movie, while me personally, I can't honestly say that after watching this I was shaken as most other people who have watched this claim to have been. But you MUST watch this film, a truly eye opening movie into the world of drug addiction. The film focuses on Harry (Jared Leto),a surprisingly well-acted Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), Marion (jennifer connely) harry's gorgeous junkie girlfriend, and in easily the best performance of the movie is Ellen Burstyn as Sarah Goldfarb, harry's mother who get's hooked on diet pills. The imagery, directing, and editing in this movie are some of the best that I've ever seen, as Aronofsky does not make any attempt to surgarcoat or water down the horrors of drug addiction. The scenes where they're shooting up will blow your mind because of the quick cuts. Also the music is just amazing. All originally written for the film by Clint Mansell and performed by him and the Kronos Quartet, the music pushses the film to an all new level as it works so well with the action on screen you feel compelled throughout the movie. All in all this movie is definitely worth a watch, definitely if you're wondering about how drugs will mess up your life.
0141301155|4.0|Although this is one of the few books I can think of that isn't as good as the movie version (Dahl wrote the screenplay), still, it's very very good and I would recommend it to anyone, movie fan or not. I like the way Charlie's father is fleshed out in the book, screwing on toothpaste caps. I also like the length and detail in the story. Great book!
B0000640VO|4.0|This was a cute and interesting little film. Very original in the method of the telling of the story. It has been  mentioned that this film is an updated version of the Hally Mills film Pollyanna. In that the heroine goes about making other people happy but neglects herself.  I found it very interesting how Amelie is interested in living other peoples lives but is too afraid of living her own life and accepting love. Mostly because of the rejection from her Parents. The entire story is told in a funny quirky way. I also liked the scenery and the cinematography everything was set in an almost glowing gold. Which reflected Amelie's (fantasy) view of the world as being happy and shinning<br />However, and this is the reason for the 4 stars, Some elements of the film where a major turn off. Such as the endless sex jokes and the scenes of people performing coitus. That was just unecessary and overdone--when I want to see that kind of stuff I'll rent a porno. Not that there is anything wrong with sex in movies. Just as long as it is called for. But not in this instance,  I felt that it was just thrown in for titilation purposes. And it really marred the film.<br />Other than that Amelie was an ejoyable film and one of the bright spots in the lackluster 2001 film year.
B000065V1V|5.0|David Bowie has long been a powder keg of musical ideas. Perhaps it's just because of his age then, that critics and fans alike have been so eager to rail against recent work like Outside and Earthling. Those two albums today seem like perfect 1990's analogues to seminal works Diamond Dogs and Young Americans, in that order. Alas, Bowie may have fallen behind the innovation curve a bit lately, but not much. Heathen is undoubtedly the most assured album the man has delivered since 1980's Scary Monsters, and the quality of his songwriting hasn't been this consistently satisfying at least since '77's Heroes. Bowie is at his best when he's elegant, theatrical, and apocalyptic. Heathen mixes each of these ingredients in equal measure. The stuttering electronics that accompany Bowie's croon in Sunday are perfectly executed; interesting without alienating. The Hunky Dory-like dancehall vibe of Slip Away may seem like a throwback, but his lyrical approach is far more mature than it was three decades ago (Kudos to anyone who can decipher the Uncle Floyd Show reference). The first single Slow Burn is worthy of highest praise; subtly subverting pop song structure without drawing attention from the propulsive bassline. There's nary a misstep on the album (although the Neil Young cover admittedly feels a just a bit out of place). There's rarely been more for a listener to absorb on a Bowie record, and despite the undeniable themes of loss and despair that permeate the songs, it's impossible to deny that Bowie and producer Visconti are relishing their craft. Is it coincidence that the song that deals most directly with a loved one's death, Everyone Says Hi, is also one of the most uplifting and infectious melodies Bowie has EVER penned? Heathen is the first piece of work Bowie (and Visconti) has made in 22 years that can be called anything but simply an admirable experiment or even a total flop. It's true, the Duke is indeed back, and he's finally inviting the rest of us in. Lordonly knows what kind of masterpiece we'd have on our hands if Brian Eno had thrown in two cents.
0571202284|5.0|The first book (I've even seen) to talk in specifics regarding classic (WB) animation techniques. Numerous images assist the apprentice (and learned) to understand and implement basic (and complex) character movements.
B00005NP04|5.0|I had no idea that I liked Martina as much as I do. I have the bad habit of flipping off a country station or skipping past cuts on a CD. Every one of the songs on this album is Flip proof and skip proof. What a great collection of really wonderful girl power music.
0812550706|4.0|Card tells an introspective yet fast-paced tale of manipulation- both genetic and mental.  Ender is a character that's always being pushed to his breaking point and always finding a way to overcome.  He is both frightened and exhilirated by the lengths he's willing to go to.  This is an excellent story of the sort of internal struggle that many people can identify with.<br />I particulary enjoyed Card's depictions of the military simulations Ender and his fellow gifted peers engage in.  Some of the tale was a bit hard on my suspension of disbelief in that it was hard to envision the characters thinking and acting the way they do at such young ages.  But that flaw, if you can even call it that, was easily remedied by the sheer depth of Card's character development.  This book kept me reading, and the double surprise ending didn't disappoint.  In fact, it made getting the rest of the Ender series an easy decision.
0790729393|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, despite the fact that its story is shocking and some viewers will not like it. I recommend it, but bear in mind that it is not for everyone.
B000065V1V|5.0|it seems with every new release, some one's bound to say, \\"he's back\\"! OUTSIDE & EARTHLING each had things to commend them but overall don't live up to his classic years. Both were certainly better than the lackluster \\"hours...\\" But now I can say it. He's back. HEATHEN is his best album in 22 years.<br /><br />\\"Sunday\\" starts things off with Bowie doing his very best Scott Walker on a gloomy day. \\"Slip Away\\" keeps the mood going, with our man in Pink Floyd mode, a fact he seems to acknowlege with the line, \\"Twinkle, twinkle Uncle Floyd\\".<br /><br />Pete Townshend out does himself on \\"Slow Burn\\" which for my money is the best cut on the album. Die hard fans will recall his last outing with Bowie off of 1980's SCARY MONSTERS. But \\"Slow Burn\\" is far more deserving of classic status than \\"Because You're Young\\". Lyrically, musically, vocally everything is on fire.<br /><br />As for the 3 covers on here, originals would be more welcome but I think he does a great job with each of them. Pixies purists might roll their eyes at Bowie tackling \\"Cactus\\" but even after the first listen, I was won over. Where Black Francis sounded possessed, Bowie sounds obssessed.<br /><br />I have to confess I cringed at the idea of a Neil Young cover, but \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" is as sweepingly melodramatic as anything off of STATION TO STATION. It's all search lights and helicopters, with Dave Grohl's guitar driving it all home.<br /><br />The most obscure cover is \\"Gemini Spaceship\\" and though I've never heard The Legendary Stardust Cowboy's original, it's as much Bowie's own as the moniker he swiped. The lyrics sound like an outtake from ZIGGY STARDUST but musically, it's a compendium of everything he's dabbled in since OUTSIDE.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album, \\"Afraid\\" features some pretty hypnotic guitars and it's nice to know that unlike the late John Lennon, Bowie still \\"Believes in Beatles\\". \\"I Would Be Your Slave\\" , \\"5:15...\\" and \\"Better Future\\" are less likely to grab you at first, but at the risk of making a pun, I'd say they're \\"slow burners\\", revealing themselves after repeated listens.<br /><br />Along with \\"Slow Burn\\", the other major standout here is \\"Everybody Says 'Hi'\\", easily one of the catchiest numbers Bowie's written since, \\"Modern Love\\".

B000065U1N|5.0|Where were you October 3, 1993?  If you're like me, you definitely weren't paying attention to our military involvement in Somalia.  After seeing &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; I wonder how I could have been so oblivious to the whole situation.  The most violent and intense war movie I've ever seen, it's also one of the best.  Benefiting from a strong ensemble cast (Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard) and taut direction by Ridley Scott (&quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;), this film tells a powerful story in a powerful way.  The action and effects are amazing; you'll feel you're actually in the middle of a Mogadishu street with bullets whizzing by your head.  Hans Zimmer's score is effective and contributes to the heightened emotion.  This is one Hollywood film that Hollywood got right.  Not for the weak-stomached, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is, nonetheless, a film you should see.

Mom's been difficult since the divorce and Trisha's older brother Pete hasn't been much better. Trying to escape their constant arguing, Trisha allows herself to fall a little behind, but wanders off the path, takes a wrong turn and falls deeper into the woods, finding herself completely lost.<br />Trisha's Boston Red Sox hero, number 36, relief pitcher Tom Gordon, helps comfort her as she catches a couple games on her Walkman and through her own vivid imagination. A story of a child's terror, her faith and her love of the \\"game.\\"<br />A pretty good story that really held my interest. Growing up just south of Boston, I really enjoyed all the Red Sox talk.
B000062TU1|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" was definitely one of the best films of the year and one of the best fantasy films of all time. I was not disappointed at all, unlike some fans of Harry Potter. I thought Chris Columbus did a great adaptation of the book and I couldn't have asked for better. The film was very faithful, only leaving out some small scenes because you honestly could never fit the entire book into the movie...I mean, just look at \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\"! Some people claim that a movie can never live up to the book it is based on, but in some cases that is not always true. Sometimes, the movie is actually BETTER than the book--so give the movie a chance! And also, I hate it when people say that, if a movie is apart of a series, since the first movie was bad then they do not want to see the other movies. Well, if you've read all four Harry Potter books then you know the better, more interesting stuff comes later...so just stick around and see the other movies before you judge even if you thought \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" was boring and/or disappointing.<br />I thought the casting was absolutely perfect! Daniel Radcliffe doesn't just PLAY the role of Harry Potter...he IS Harry Potter! Rupert Grint is funny and witty as Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson is smart and charming as Harry's other best friend, Hermione Granger. Tom Felton is really great as Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch rival at Hogwarts, Alan Rickman is creepy as Professor Snape. Richard Harris is mezmorising as Professor Dumbledore. Robbie Coltrane is hilarious and wonderful as Hagrid, the half friendly giant. And Maggie Smith is superb as Professor McGonagall. The rest of the cast are really good, too. In another review down below, I read that they are going to replace Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint (probably along with the rest of the child actors) for the \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" film and the rest of the Harry Potter films. I really hope they do not do that...these child actors are perfect! I thought they were going to do a film each year because each year these child actors will be a year older, like they are in the books. So they really do not need to replace them. So please do not replace any of these actors, because that will only ruin the movies!!<br />Did I mention the special effects? Because the special effects are truly amazing!! I especially loved the big chess board scene and the Quidditch match, though in the book, they have two Quidditch matches. Hogwarts castle is truly spectacular! John Williams' score is haunting and breathtaking. The dialouge is OK, but it's really a children's fantasy film...it's not supposed to be another \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". For those who say \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is better, get over it! They are two totally different movies! I really wish people would stop trying to compare movies like \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", and \\"Star Wars\\" because they are all different. Why do we have to choose between them? Can't we like them all?!<br />The DVD includes the following special features:<BR>*Never-before-seen footage<BR>*Deleted Scenes<BR>*Self-guided tour of Hogwarts<BR>*A game where you can mix potions, perform transfigurations, explore Diagon Alley, catch a snitch, explore the library, and \\"attend\\" classes (you actually have to play this game in order to get to the bonus footage and deleted scenes...I didn't know this until after I bought the DVD and it's kind of tricky)<BR>*Theatrical trailers<BR>*DVD-ROM PC Extras<BR>*Selected Scenes<BR>*Languages & Subtitles in English and Spanish<BR>*Top picture quality<BR>*Top audio quality<BR>*Two discs--first disc plays full-length film; second disc plays special features<br />\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a wonderful film! It's rated 'PG' for some scary scenes and mild language. As for all this religious stuff against Harry Potter, I'd say that the story of Harry Potter doesn't teach your children to learn black magic...if anything, it teaches them good friendship and what good verses evil means.<br />Film Grade: A+<BR>DVD Grade: A-
0226264017|5.0|Nobel laureate Milton Friedman is quite possibly the most brilliant economist in the world today and a man on the cutting edge of libertarian (classical liberal) thought. And in &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; he lays out a basic political philosophy in the classical liberal tradition in the first two chapters of the book and alternately defends and expands upon that premise for the remainder of the work. In much the same way that F. A. Hayek - an ideological predecessor - spelled out his basic thesis in one concise book and then fleshed it out in another, Friedman provides the basics here and fleshes them out in the larger (and somewhat better written) &quot;Free to Choose&quot;. In addition, while not wishing to rehash some of the detailed support for his assertions, he does - through footnotes - provide the reader with opportunity to delve deeper.<br />Given the nature of the subject matter and the expertise of the author, the writing can be dry and may appear difficult to approach, particularly in the initial chapters, but the reader who sticks with it will be well rewarded. Subsequent chapters, largely adapted from lectures by the author, are easier reads. And Friedman avoids, for the most part, the economic jargon that can make works such as this hopelessly confusing to the layman.<br />Friedman is often tagged with the &quot;monetarist&quot; or &quot;supply-side&quot; labels (if you don't believe me, read some of the other reviews), largely because he believes that these methods of economic manipulation are infinitely preferable to the fiscal manipulation that has been the norm in this country. Those who actually READ this book will find that he advocates intervention by neither means, preferring instead stable monetary growth removed from the hands of either fiscal or monetary interventionists.<br />He provides one of the most succinct explanations of the monetary actions (of the Fed) that created and worsened the Great Depression that I have ever come across, though mentioning only briefly the fiscal policies that subsequently lengthened it considerably: the New Deal and, to a much lesser extent, Smoot-Hawley. This alone makes the work valuable.<br />He goes on to examine a number of things that are now taken for granted in this country (the Welfare State, Social Security, public education, licensing requirements) and asks the question, &quot;Have these government actions made things better or worse?&quot; The record is less than stellar (especially in the subsequent 40 years since this was written). And he proposes some alternatives such as the negative income tax and other alternative roles for government that are, arguably, less intrusive on the liberty of the citizenry.<br />And he uses examples that are easy to follow and understand including one about men stranded on desert isles that is NOT as presented in another review.<br />As an economist, I would say that this work has aged remarkably well. The analysis has clearly not become dated as have those of Galbraith and, to a certain extent Keynes. [Keynes WAS a genius, providing the mathematical and econometric bases for much of current economic thought, but, contrary to the assertion by another reviewer, much of what he proposed should be done by the state has been discredited.] Friedman, for example, was one of the first to advocate a school voucher system, which is only now receiving serious attention.<br />It is noteworthy that a number of economists from the left have criticized Friedman in general and this work in particular. But those attacks (by Krugman, Herman and Diesing, among others) have proven to be, for the most part, without merit.<br />If you accept the basic premise that freedom is vitally important and that the actions of the state should be viewed from that point of view, you will find this work to be invaluable. If not, you will certainly not be pleased. And if you believe the utter nonsense that capitalism is in any way &quot;oppressive&quot;, well, if you can't see reality...
B00005JL3A|4.0|I used to play the game before&when i knew that it was already a movie ive watch it several times coz as other people who play &watch the movie i want to see the diffrence between the game we play and the film we watch,Well for me the film was good,very entertaining,a lot of surprises and shocking scene,,the casting is balance and they play the role which we expect most,to others viewers you cant compare all the scene in the games to the movies you just have to wait for another part of the movie which we want to have,(how about part2 til part3 of this movie?)so that they can put all the angles,the scenes&some elaboration ,we play this game for how many hours and the movie is not that long,so guys out there think of that huh\\".I congratulate Milla Jovovich,shes a very very good actress in all the film she make,also Michelle Rodriguez you're great huh!to all the cast,they are all greattt!!!To others maybe this film is not the best but for us who have watch the movie,its better than best,know why?its full of exeitement,very entertaining,full of action,,and most of all its not boring,the story is fast the way it goes,okey,,,hoping for the part2&3 with the same cast,,,,,more Power!!!
0345442989|4.0|The book in itself is more than good. It brings light to many events that are by-sided mentioned on Episode I such as the taxation of trade routes, Palpatine's popularity or Valorum's corruption suspicions.<BR>The cons are that the pace of reading gets so slow that you sometimes feel like quitting.<BR>Worth a try only of you want to expand a bit more TPM and have an itch about some aspects of Episode I which are unclear...
B000002OX7|5.0|Oh, this album is the peak of &quot;The Who&quot; and the songs keep getting played on the radio over and over again after all these years.  The reason is obvious.  It is the first FULL album that takes all new risks succeeds on every note.<br />You know all the tracks.  The best part is that they have all been beautifully remastered to sound so crisp and clear, it's unsettling!  The horns are tight and the keyboards are breathtaking.  To make things better, it includes seven additonal cuts, including the original version (demo) of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;.  It just makes one appreciate this album that much more.<br />Grab it now.  It's a classic!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Well, it's simple: if you're a Jazz Expert and everyone else digs the CD, the only way for you to weigh in on the subject is to pan the album.  Maybe the artist.   <br />Except we didn't agree that it always has to be about jazz.  Get past labels and enjoy or move on.  She won't score high on your Jazz Score Card but Norah Jones is a welcome alternative to the latest Grammy flashes-in-the-pan, on their way to oblivion. (Fortunately.)  <br />For anyone who hasn't heard her yet: she has a sweet, raspy, breathy sound that's unique.  She's a pianist, although I believe not necessarily a \\"hyphenate\\" (ie; singer-pianist). If similar arrangements are a big concern to you, I think you will be pleased with CAWM.  She offers up a variety of styles from country to standards and, my favorite: music that hasn't been assigned to a category.  The last song heard stays in your head all day.<br />So, Amazon, preorder Ms. Jones' next release for me.
0440211727|5.0|Along with The runaway Jury, this is JGs best book by far.<BR>I've read it more than 4 times and I'm still gripped to the story.<BR>Small southern town gets shocked with the rape of a 10 year old afroamerican girl by two white fellas. Some days later it gets even more shocked as her father slaughters them both at the courthouse.<BR>It then goes a thrilling story about this poor man's lawyer struggle for saving him from the capital punishment and all the implications that may imply for him...<BR>Although this was his first book, I still believe it's unparalled...
B0000399WC|5.0|This is an all time classic. It is a great action adventure movie that holds up even today. It is the story of Papillon, played magnificently by Steve McQueen. He is sent to prison for life for murdering a pimp. He struggles for his life and for freedom. He is the embodiment of sheer will. He refuses to be tamed and he never gives up though put through incredible cruelty and impossible odds. Dustin Hoffman is also great. Watching these two great actors from different generations and different methods is a great joust. The story is based on the life of Henri Charriere who was sent to Devils Island and finally escaped to freedom. The movie is set in Jamaica and Spain. The settings seemed so real that a visiting Charriere said that he \\"feared for his freedom.\\" This was a huge box office smash and one of the tops at the box office in 1974.
0440234743|3.0|The Testament is not John Grisham's best for sure.<BR>The story goes all about a wealthy old man, full of vultured siblings, who leaves a mysterious will benefiting an illegitimate child.<BR>The problem is nobody knows exactly where she is and how to find her. The strongest rumour locates her in a mission with the natives deep in the Pantanal (swampy land in Brazil).<BR>A lawyer (who else?) is appointed to find her and bring her back to claim his millions. <BR>The story gets a little heavy (especially during the journal of the trip to Brazil) and a bit discouraging.<BR>I'm a big fan of JG, and this book somehow disappointed me...
0142000655|5.0|I was at first reluctant to read such a long novel. I did not want to read it but my fellow students encouraged me so. However, they gave me no certain reason as to why I should. Naturally, I was driven by the sheer curiosity to read it.<BR>Now, having read the novel, I must encourage others to read it. The story unwinds in the Salinas Valley with the Hamiltons living peacefully. The gazing mountains and river valleys depict the scene. On the other hand, there is the Trask family led by Cyrus. Therefore, this novel is an interplay between two separate plots. Samuel Hamilton, an immigrant, leads a busy and honest life. However, Cyrus resorts to dishonesty and earns a gracious amount of money. The main plot revolves around the Trask Family for even the title, East of Eden reflects the generations of the Trasks.<BR>Cyrus Trask has two sons by the name of Charles and Adam. It is as if Charles is inherently evil and Adam, good. They draw comparisons to the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Furthermore, Adam bores and names two twin sons in Caleb and Aron with the knowledge of the story of Cain and Abel. Therefore, Caleb suffers as he is forced to be inherently bad. However, Caleb's life changes when Lee, the family mentor, discovers the true meaning of Timshel- `Thou mayest.' This Hebrew meaning breaks the misconceptions of the past in that people are predetermined to triumph over evil or not. The bitter irony in this is that Caleb actually is blessed by Adam even after a rueful past and chooses to start anew, a new life.<BR>I strongly suggest you reading this novel even if you were intimidated by the length of it!
044022165X|4.0|I really liked this book though it seemed to me like \\"too way idealistic\\" for my style.<BR>The story goes about a young attorney-to-be who gets contacted by a woman whose Insurance company refuses to cover the medical treatment for his dying son.<BR>Poking through the contract he grasps the concept of a great injustice being commited and the woman being entitled to full medical coverage. <BR>He then starts a desperate fight on his own against a multi-million dollar corporation... and wins... (this is the heroical part that didnt fit in very well, making the company look dumb and clumsy)<BR>Nice to read and entertaining at the same time, it's a good choice if you like the \\"lawyer type\\" books John Grisham writes.
B000005RMY|5.0|This is 100% essential for any Sisters fan, period. Forget the import price, buy it. If you have even half a passing interest in this band, this is still worth the price. Intrigued by goth? Alice, Adrenochrome, Body Electric, Temple of Love, Valentine--these are the highlights that will stay with you. Most of them instantly likable and memorable.<br />The EP tracks are in order, but the order of the EPs is off. (In other words, The Damage Done and Home of the Hitmen, the first record, are together as a and b-sides, but they don't appear until later in the disc.) Perhaps all the better that this disc starts with Alice, an instantly catchy and driving goth classic. Midway through we get perhaps the best achievement of this album--Temple of Love Extended Version. Amazing--driving, dancy, deep, broad vocals from Eldritch. This is preceded by the Reptile House EP: 5 songs that are deep, dark, dark, and dark.  Keep the knives away from yourself.  Great songs.  All in all the collection is very balances.<br />This was basically put together so that fans didn't have to hunt down the original singles or buy shoddy bootlegs. A great idea. They cover Gimme Shelter and 1969, though it's strange that they didn't record studio versions of some of the other tunes they constantly covered (making them part of every set) like Emma, Sister Ray, Ghostrider, etc. They would have sounded great in the more raw studio form of the time. (Emma would appear as a b-side non-lp track in 1988.)<br />Sure, the sound quality on all of the tracks is not up to Floodland, of course, but there's a lot to appreciate here. Marvel at Eldritch's drumming on The Damage Done. He described himself as the worst drummer in Leeds, and...he's right.<br />Not to fear--you get to hear the evolution of Dr. Avalanche from drum machine to the rig he is now.<br />Buy this album. Buy it now. Worth the extra import dollars; it's essential Sisters.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Resident Evil has provided what is possibly the best video game-movie in a long time. The only one that I feel can compete with it is Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, which was critically applauded but shunned due to poor advertising.<br />Anyway, onto the movie. Although I've seen it called a gorefest, it is anything but. There's only one scene in the movie with a lot of blood, and it's pretty tame compared to some other stuff I've seen in movies (not to mention the games that actually inspired the movie). There is plenty of suspense and it is truly action-packed. The acting, while not amazing, gets the job done without being too bumpy. The plot is mildly empty (group of commandos gets trapped in a lab and must escape, pretty much), although fans of the game series will yum it up.<br />Overall, this is a much better movie than I initially believed it to be. I went into the theater expecting it to be bad, but it turned out surprisingly well. I also found the editorial review to be mildly harsh; I was also offended by his/her generalizations involving video gamers (PlayStation \\"junkies\\").
0394720288|5.0|As always, Wodehouse's hilariously likable characters and biting turns of phrase make this little tale a pleasure. I pick up old Bertie and Jeeves whenever I want something funny and fast, and &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; is among his best.
B000065U1N|5.0|The best movie of the year.  It shows our military endurance on what they most go through in combat.  The way the movie was written and played showed the realistic emotions that makes you so shocked.
B00004Z459|5.0|this is a great cd. Simply put they are the most talented rock band around now that RATM broke up. This isnt some slipknotish metal album, so if thats what you want look elsewhere.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's song &quot;Complicated&quot; is the best song I have ever heard in my life. There was something about it that has made me become a huge Avril fan and I will be the rest of my life. I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO BUY THIS CD!!
B00005K3OT|5.0|OK--So I thought this'd be a &quot;chick flick.&quot;  I wound up enjoying it a lot.  A nice movie with a good look.  I especially enjoy watching the color in the film change as the story progresses.
630280082X|4.0|I am not a big Karate Kid fan, but I love this movie. It speaks to me in that corner of my cynical self that wants to believe in Santa Claus and superheros. It is a Disney coming of age plot with a few \\"R\\" twists (The evening news deserves an \\"R\\" rating more than this movie does)<BR>    While not my favorite movie it has my favorite cinematic moment of all time...the guitar duel. It still gives me shivers even after at least a hundred viewings.<BR>    I WANT THIS ON DVD!!!!!!I have worn out 4 VHS copies of this movie. C'MON GIVE IT A DVD TREATMENT....SOMEBODY...PLEASE!!!!!!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird takes place in Maycomb Country. It is a small town where everyone knows each other and is fairly close. The book is told in first person from Scout Finch's point of view. Her, her brother Jem and her father Atticus Finch live in a house in Maycomb with their black servant Calpurina. Atticus, who is a lawyer, is hired to defend a black man in court who was accused for raping a white women. Although Atticus is uneasy about defending the man, he knows it is the right thing to do, although the whole town talks about him behind is back for years to come, calling him a n**** lover. The<BR>family finds out what it is like, to stand up for what you believe in. This is somewhat hard for Scout and Jem because of their short tempers however they try their best to be the<BR>better person and look away when people call their father names. The book also shows Jem and Scout and how they grow up over the years with exciting tales, adventures and<BR>journeys. Their memories and tales are irreplaceable.  Most of this excitement is over the summer with their friend Dill, who comes to Maycomb every summer to stay with his<BR>aunt. The three children go about the years, wondering about the mysteries of Boo Radley the Finch's neighbor, who hasn't been seen to anyone in the town in many years, rumor<BR>has it he is dead. Together they encounter childhood adventures, which don't seem so dramatic when they grow up, however at the time were very important. The main focus in the book is on the loss of innocence and also bravery.<BR> This book is extremely well written, and has many strengths. One technique used in Harper Lee's writing that is extremely effective is symbolism. In fact, it is such a big<BR>part of Lee's writing that even the title of her book is the united symbol throughout the novel. To Kill a Mockingbird is a very meaningful phrase in the book. For example when<BR>they explain why you should never kill a mockingbird in the middle of the book,\\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't next in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" The mockingbird represents innocence throughout the novel. Since the basic theme is the loss of innocence, the characters are<BR>saying that you should never loose the innocence, kill an innocent bird. In the book so many things end up to be not as innocent, so different then they are thought to be in the<BR>beginning. For example the town of Maycomb was such a sweet little innocent town. Everyone was friendly, it was the perfect life. However in the ending we realize that truly<BR>Maycomb and the people who did live there were not so innocent, but in fact extremely racist. This entire part of the book that makes you wonder about what the title and the theme really do mean, is a great strength in the book.<BR> Another strength in To Kill a Mockingbird  is the ending. So many different events occur in the book and the ending ties everything together. The ending is not happy,<BR>however it gives you a reassurance that everything is going to be all right and there are almost no unanswered questions. Even Scout who is still but a child has many of her<BR>questions about life almost figured out, and has been throughout many experiences people her age might never be in. \\"As I made my way home I thought, Jem and I would get grown but there wasn't much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.\\" <BR> This book did not have many weaknesses at all. The beginning is a little slow moving however. For example some things are explained in detail that have no meaning to<BR>the plot or story line. For example some of the scenes at school , and some of the scenes over their first summers with Dill. Other than that there are no weaknesses.<BR> Over all, I think this was one of the best novels I have ever read. Not only does it have a wonderful and in depth plot, but the characters in it seem like you could be there<BR>friends. They are described with so much detail, that when you are done reading, you want to read more about what happens to them. For example does Scout ever become ladylike, and do more people in the town except Atticus for defending the Negro, Tom Robinson in court. After reading this novel you feel like you can do anything you put your heart to, and you can stand up for what you believed. This is so because every character does this<BR>sometime in the book.
B000065U1N|2.0|Hopefully Blockbuster will let me return this DVD with receipt and get a credit on the special edition when it comes out. The movie is a must see, but rent it until a better DVD comes out. I've soaked up about as much information as I could regarding this historical event. The DVD offers nothing more than a short behind the scenes featurette. <br />Buy the book, see the movie, and don't ever forget this story. It is possibly the most important event in modern American history, and guys like Randy Shugart, Gary Gordon, Mike Durant and the thousands of other guys like them should never be forgotten.<br />It's single minded purpose is its greatest strength. Steven Spielberg should take note of Ridley Scott's historic achievement in film making, and so should you.<br />God bless our Armed Forces.
B00003CXA4|5.0|&quot;Gandhi&quot; is one of my all-time favorite movies! The DVD is great with features! The movie is about the life story of Mahatma Gandhi, an Indian political leader who managed to free his country from the British rule using peaceful means and thus giving hope and inspiration for generations to come. The movie is based on a true story. &quot;Gandhi&quot; is a movie that won 9 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor Ben Kingsley, and Best Director Richard Attenborough. Excellent!
B00003CXXP|1.0|this movie was mostly boring except for a few moments in the middle where more AI's were included in the carnival scene. The AI child's 'pet' being left alone at the long drawn out ending is what made my 12 year old sad.  She didn't care for the movie at all except for the kids teddy.
0446310786|1.0|As a teenager, I am enthralled by a book I can relate to, wether it be through characters, situations, themes or attitudes. This is a book which I have found is very difficult to relate to as a 15 year old. The content, while being captivating, has no relevance to me, as the characters are either under the age of 12, or over 50. I believe that most would disagree with this opinion, but any teenager wanting to read a book about injustice should read either Bryce Courtenay's JESSICA or Adeline Yen Mah's FALLING LEAVES. I believe these are truly inspirational books.
0446677450|3.0|This book was very interesting and did give me a different perspective on finances. However, it did drag at moments and took a while to get to the point. Overall, it was a good book with some interesting words of wisdom. Kiyosaki is a wise man and he did not give a specific &quot;thing&quot; to do in order to get rich, instead he tells how te rich people became wealthy and how the rich think. This book is good but a challenge to read.
B00005JLEX|5.0|There are few comedies in the world that truely deserve to be on DVD. This show is one of them.  It is the Nineties sitcom gold standard.  The only other shows to compete are: The Simpsons, The Kids In The Hall, and Strangers With Candy.  Please make mine and many other peoples dream come true and release this great and historic show on DVD.
B000065U1N|1.0|Too bad this DVD release is such of such low quality - the film itself deserved better than this.  This DVD 'features':<br />- poor image quality ('edge sharpening' artifacts all over the place - someone obviously screwed up the high definition mastering process)<br />- a funky widescreen transfer (text that appears at the edge of the image is cut off)<br />- and bizarre, blocky subtitling (i.e., when the Somalis speak) that appears to have been generated by a $50 home-video editing kit(the text appears in giant, ugly yellow letters)<br />All of which serve to ruin what should be an immersive, intense war film.  Hopefully Criterion or Superbit will license the rights to publish and do it right.<br />Sony Pictures' shockingly bad release is lacking in all respects; even the theatrical trailers are missing (the ones on the disc are for Spiderman and The One).  The 'On The Set' Featurette (commercial) is short and annoying.  <br />Where was the QA?  Did no one bother to look at this thing before they sent it out for mastering?  Save your $20 and wait for the release from Criterion or Superbit.
6305546789|5.0|Michael Myers is all grown up and he has his sister on his mind. After murdering his older sister more than twenty-years ago, he has escaped the mental institution with a motive. Laurie Strode is an honor student in high school and has to babysit a young boy on Halloween night. Haddonfield, Illinois will never be the same again. Michael Myers sports a white, William Shatner mask and carries a large butcher knife. He stalks his victims with an evil stare. One-by-one, Michael Myers takes out innocent people to get to Laurie, his younger sister. But, luckily for the young lady, a psychiatrist named Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is on the lookout for the masked killer. This is the most terrifying slasher film ever made and I got nightmares everytime I watched it. The music is the creepiest thing since crickets started making noises in the dark. Speaking of dark, I don't ever want to walk out at night again. Period. You never know that some maniac will jump out and scare the living daylights out of you. Every time Halloween comes around, I lock myself in my room and put a blanket over my head to protect me from the demons of the night. Michael Myers was \\"The Sandman\\" and the two couldn't stop him. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Laurie Strode and she's perfect. That one guy plays Michael Myers, yes! This movie will definitely produce lemonade and brownies. Guarantee!
B00004TL2N|4.0|Boulez brings us a version of Bruckner's Eighth that sounds more like the neat web of complex rhythms and melodies of late Richard Strauss than Wagner (of whom Bruckner is mistakenly labeled as a knock-off). The big climactic moments are downplayed and the tiny chamber-like phrases are emphasized, with all their detail brought out for the first time here on this recording. <br />However, there is a lack of all things grotesque. This version tends to smooth out the VU meters. Instead of going from silent to bombastic and back again, we get a lot more consistency of sound. One can't imagine Anton approving of the style and execution here... However, he is long gone and the rest of us have to decide what to do with the score.<br />Along side his Mahler, Boulez seeks to take a fresh approach in this interpretation of another great Viennese symphonist who, like Mahler, also wrote to nine. He succeeds in taking yet again a fresh approach. Gone are the organ-like orgiastic highs on horns. Gone are the long silences and the nail biting buildups to nirvana. Gone is the brass hair-raising that makes the windows rattle. Besides, you won't find anything sinister lurking behind one of these buildups. Instead, this is Bruckner for those who don't really care for Bruckner. Its as if Haydn himself got hold of the score and rewrote it for the occasion of this recording, adding little insights here, comedy there. Has anyone ever heard Bruckner like this in the concert hall?<br />The Sound: The timpani are boomy and muddy by contrast and the brass is strangely constrained. The interplay of the timpani in the Scherzo with the strings is highly irregular. In some cases it's as though the timpani and brass are off stage as in Holst's final movement of The Planets. In addition, someone at the mixing desk left for lunch without turning up the strings to where we can hear them when they mixed this recording down to master. I hope he had a good bottle of wine, because we missed him. <br />Inthe entire 76'14, the strings are always reaching for more airtime to break away from the other instruments, so we strain to hear them. Their absence reduces the tension of the piece in a significant way. After all, the Finale sounds like it belongs in a Batman movie, not a Bruckner symphony recording from DG.<br />One of the clear advantages of this recording is fitting on to a single disk. Grab it, take it in your car, and shove it in the player and you're done. Lots to be said for simplicity.<br />However, when you compare the 8ths on hand in your cupboard, it is to the 1st von Karajan recording or the EMI Celibidache you will return for ultimate satisfaction without a doubt.<br />So where are we left with the current recording courtesy of Boulez? The usual place when a conductor comes along and challenges our notion of what a piece is all about. We have to give it some time, consider the approach and render a final decision. In this case, that may take a while...

B000066F6H|4.0|Actally 3.5 stars as this cd is very entertaining and they are right on for a post punk band.Musically stronger than vocally but there are moments where they shine. Worth buying? Absolutely.Comparing them to the Strokes is perhaps is unfair as I don't think you are comparing apples to apples as these lads are more punk than garage rock. Both bands are a refreshing change to the garbage we have been having to swallow by bands touting to be alternative.
0790729725|5.0|Who knew that this movie could be so good. Ray Liotta gives a performance so good, it makes you want to be a mobster yourself! Robert De Niro also has a good performance as Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot;, but not as good as Joe Pesci(my favorite on-screen gangster). This is what it's all about. So step aside Godfather, the Goodfellas are here!
B00000IQBL|3.0|The movie is basically two stories, the first half covering boot camp and the second half being just another war movie. 5 stars for part one, 2 stars for part two. That said I never thought I'd live to see Marine Corp recruit training portrayed in a movie as dead on realistic (in the 60's at least) as this was. You had to have gone through it to really appreciate it though. The opening scene got it exactly right. Part one made the movie for me. Semper Fi  R. Lee Ermey!
6303187064|5.0|Brandon Lee was assigned the job to take the lead role in this movie as Eric Draven (Lee), a dead rock star of a band called Hangman's Joks. He and his girlfriend Shelly were murdered on Halloween and comes back from the dead 1 year later so he can seek revenge against the gang of killers that murdered him. He comes back and dresses in white and black make-up to diguise himself. Great action, adventure, and excellent classic. Buy this movie if you like action-packed thrillers.
B000031WD9|3.0|I saw the censored version of American Pie and it's really gross.<BR>I knew it would not exactly be a *Disney* type of movie, but I did not even expect it to be soooooo gross.  There's this time when one of the guys tries to kinda make love to a pie.  I mean, they have thought of some of the weirdest and grossest things.  Some parts are cool and it is quite natural, I suppose, for guys to wanna make love and maybe the theme of the movie wasn't so bad, but they didn't portray it very well.  It's about these guys who really wanna make love, but they don't get the right girls or the right opportunities.  But when one of the geekiest kids in school claims to have made love to a hot girl, they decide they've had enough.  They make a pact that they'd have lost their viginities by the time they graduate.  It's about how they find the right girls and how they do it.  It's a good movie, but REALLY gross in parts.
B00004YRQA|4.0|You need at least one of these if you are going to own a PS2. Don't buy the non-Sony brand cards, they can have problems. <br />There is nothing wrong with buying them used, the old information can be erased. <br />And you won't need two of them unless you eith own a lot of games (like more then 7) or if you like to rent a lot of different games to try them out first.
B00005KARK|4.0|Dumbo<br />                 running time 60 minutes<br />                reviewed by Sera Elisabeth<br />     Dumbo is Walt Disney's third film.  This sweet and sugary tale of a baby elephant with awfully big ears who could fly was a sensational hit.  It was also the very first animated feature to have the background painted in watercolor.  So, sweet this movie is, it drifts off into a childish whimsy the young can truly enjoy. There is not much plot, but adults will shed a tear when Dumbo's caged mother takes out her trunk through the window, to rock her sweet baby. A very tender moment in Disney history that has been and will be appreciated in years to come.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Most people know what this movie is about - even before they saw it they knew what was going to happen. So with that said let's talk about the DVD of Cast Away. <br />The DVD gives you just the right extra's to make watching the movie again well worth it. The Documentary about survival techniques and how the director of the movie went throught the survival program was awesome and really showed why the movie was made the way it was. <br />The Featurette on Wilson is funny and surprizingly informative. And the casting of the island was interesting, but not really needed in my opinion. <br />But the best extra was watching the interview with Tom Hanks. He really presents himself in a way that makes you want to watch any other Tom Hanks movie again. <br />And although I really liked the movie and enjoyed watching it without the Director's Commentary Track, having the Commentary Track was great for this movie. It was well organized to fit the what part you were watching and with so much quiet time during the movie it helps to understand what they were thinking when they made it. <br />Overall this movie is a great buy on DVD format and well worth a rental or a used price in owning it.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is the very first Animated Feature Film ever created from pure fantasy with help from the Brothers Grimm and the talented Walt Disney.  When it came to childish fantasy and whimsy, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was born unto the  mind of a very gifted man .  Children and adults alike toyed with the idea, year after year, out of every masterpiece Walt ever made which feature would be better than the next.  In 1937 his first achievement grew beyond the distant horizon and started a phenomenon to this day that is irresistable ! <br />Voiced my Adriana Caselotti, 14 year old Snow White was the the heroine of this fantasic tale.  The seven little men were drawn and voiced excellently by 1937's finest animators, comedians and actors including Pinto Colvig also known as the voice of Goofy.  Now known  as the 9 Old Men, these animators were put into school and taught on a regular basis at night, and working the on feature film Snow White, during the day all around the clock for the finest quality Walt Disney could ever ask for.  <br />Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs jump started the Feature Animation department for what is widely known now as the Walt Disney Studios. It also gave a basis for 1939's inspired Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.  Contributing now to all these factors and  many, many insightful more I give this movie. <br />5 STARS !
B0000640VO|5.0|As I was getting ready to go see \\"Amelie\\" in an independent movie theatre in Albany, a friend of mine, who had a chance to see it before I did, said: \\"You will like it. This movie will make you happy!\\".....and oh, how right he was. I left the movie theatre later that evening deeply fascinated by Amelie's spirit and utterly happy at the same time. Reminded of the beauty of small things in life, I keep reviving scenes from \\"Amelie\\" in my mind ever since then. Without wanting to reveal essential details, I simply want to ask you to go ahead and see this wonderful movie for yourself. And I also say: \\"You will like it. This movie will make you happy!\\"
B00001QEE9|5.0|Pinocchio <br />Reviewed by Sera Elisabeth<br />Walt Disney's second installment in feature animation was a beautiful tale of a wooden boy whose father wanted him to become real. Set on an adventure with his conscience Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio soon realizes that the road less traveled becomes the road that leads him home, human and into the arms of his father.<br />Sweeping fantasy and good morals take this movie in a startling adventure into Pleasure Island, and down the sea below with Monstro the Whale. Again, this movie has everything to offer the young and young at heart. I give this movie <br />*****  5 STARS  !
B000002P5R|5.0|It is my personal belief that before and since there has been no one who has the same creative genius as Jimi. Considering he was on the scene for little more than four years the volume of his work was immense and not only that all of it brilliant and innovative. This, the last of his albums is no exception to the rule showing his true incredible range on diversity. He mixes up the musical styles including soul and funk but never deviating far from the core values of the blues which he takes to a new plateau never touched by anyone since. Even some of the incomplete demo versions of songs on this are great which saddens you to think how great the complete article would have been. Highlights of this album include everything but my faves are drifting, Dolly Dagger, Freedom and Hey Baby (Rays of new Rising Sun)
B00005UQ9F|5.0|I rented this thinking it would probably be some sort of Blair Witch-like tale, so I didn't have high hopes. I was completely blown away by the entire film. It is one of the best non-teen horror/drama films I've seen in years. I thought I saw the end coming, but then it went and turned everything upside down with an ending no one can predict. This isn't for the ADD generation. It's slow moving and focuses a lot on setting an eerie mood more than just displaying gore. I actually purchased the DVD immediately after renting it. This is everything Blair Witch 1 and 2 should have been.
B000026258|5.0|This CD can either send you into a deep trance or a screaming fit, depending on your tolerance for repetative minimalist music. Music for 18 Musicians is Reich's great transition work from the small ensemble pieces of the 70's to his large scale work of the 80's and 90's. It's densely layered repeating patterns gradually shift in and out of phase with each other, creating a kalideoscope of timbres, and endlessly varied crossrhythms. To listen to this piece with an open mind is to enter an entrancing world of color light and imagination. Reich proves why he is the most imitated and inimitable of all of the minimalists. <br />The performance is definitive. These musicians were all members of Reich's performing groups of the 70's. And ECM engineers have a genius for atmospheric sound that is perfect for this music. This is a delightful CD.
2226109501|4.0|A very very funny book, where this girl tells us about her experience in a company in Asia ... <BR>Very good sense of humor, using which she describes how she went from an intern to the person who cleans the toilets, just because she didnt understand the 'confusianism' of Asian people<BR>really good book, if you can read it in french ...<BR>Enjoy your reading !!
B0000640VN|3.0|I have always enjoyed time travel stories just to see how the writer works out the twists and irregularities. Unfortunately time travel is just a device to get the two leads together. From that point we know they will fall in love and they will get together at the end of the film. <br />But the cast is first rate. Meg Ryan does what she does best and Hugh Jackman seems destined to become the next superstar. The two supporting actors are very good. Great cast makes a poor story worth watching.<br />The tale starts out with the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in the late 1800s and moves forward to our time with Prince Leopold - in New York at the insistence of his uncle to look for a wife with money to shore up his family's faltering fortune - following a traveler from our time. He lands on Meg Ryans doorstep and eventually in her heart. There is a nice rooftop scene reminisent of The Goodbye Girl and several scenes that could be moved about however you like as they do nothing to advance the plot. If you pay attention at the beginning of the film you will see the end. Appropriate for a time travel tale, don't you think?<br />Remember Somewhere In Time? You liked that, you will like this.
0060925000|5.0|Though it s a big book, and is very hard to start.. once you are involved with the Mehras and their relatives, you cannot live without them ...When you finish the novel, you still want to go on and know about what s happening with them ...<BR>This novel features all the aspects of India ... history, religion, family, rituals, education, politics .. it s a complete guide to India in a very unformal way ...<BR>Must read it !!<BR>Enjoy your reading !!
B000060P79|5.0|Man do I love this CD.  The songs are well written, they are original, and Pierre is an awesome lead singer.  Seriously, what's in the water in Canada?  Yet another amazing band from Canada.  The songs are true and at times downright funny.  The &quot;standout tracks&quot; for me are...&quot;Meet You There&quot;, &quot;One Day&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot;, and &quot;Addicted&quot;.  &quot;Perfect&quot; is a beautiful song about (i think) Pierre's battered relationship with his father.  This is obvious when he states &quot;I'm sorry I can't be perfect.&quot;  Not that the other songs aren't good also.  I just had to choose a few to tell you guys.  Oh yeah, and also Mark Hoppus (Blink 182) accompanies them on vocals and as a bassist.  And Joel Madden (the awesome band Good Charlotte) sings back-up on &quot;You Don't Mean Anything.&quot;  All in all, it is one of the BEST CD's I have ever bought.  ROCK ON SIMPLE PLAN!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Simply the best album of 2002 bar none. Folks like Randy (who gave this album a one star rating) belong in the gutter with the record executives who ignored Wilco based on this material. Tweedy and gang will get the last laugh here, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot will live on long past the garbage ruling the charts today.
6304259093|5.0|I loved this movie.  The most talented actress of all time is in it.  Meet Ms. Beverley Mitchell.  She is a beautiful and talented actress who plays Grace.  She has also been in Sinatra and Killing Obsession.  I think that this showed her at her best work!  Keep up the good work, Beverley!!
0393312836|5.0|Many reviews before mine have already summed up this book's merits. I will only add that the slang utilized is necessary to emerge oneself fully in the brutal, eery, eye-opening world which Burgess creates. Read this book with an open mind and prepare yourself to be utterly shocked and enlightened.
078401213X|4.0|The aim of this movie maybe is not to get all the messages offered by it after watching just once, but instead to take the parts you are someway related to, and there are many to take from: from human relations to number theory and from business to religion.<br />If you have a scientific background, you'll identify Fibonacci sequence, pi, chaos, computer algorithms, scientific challenges, and so on.<br />If you know about business, you'd see what targets are to pursue about research, and that there are things that some times speak more effectively than money.<br />If you are interested in religious matters, you'd think about a confrontment between arguments that could be from the same source, but that just are used by two people in different positions.<br />And finally, you have to tolerate some scenes not nice to watch, to find the last question given by the movie. And there would be no absolute answer. It depends on you, your background, and the way you judge the story you have just watched.
6305078181|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this movie. I kept hearing that this version of Dracula was the best. I think that it could have been a lot better. I think it definitely is one for the library if you are a hardcore Dracula film buff, but I don't think the average Joe would enjoy it too much.
6300214435|2.0|Indiana Jones 1 and 3 are the ones you need to pay attention to, not this pieace of garbage.  The story line is weak and both of the supporting charcters are annoying.  I wish I could say something kinder but I cannot.
0792839730|5.0|The others reviewers have done a fine job in providing facts about Operation Marketgarden and how they pertain to this film so I'll keep my review short and sweet. For the few dollars this DVD will cost you; it's entertainment value is very high, it has a great cast, a great story, it's based on true events, and it's just a great film. I say order a pizza, gather the kids around the family room and prepare to enjoy a great flick!!
B00003CXAR|5.0|Ok lets make this simple. JAWS is my # 1 Favorite movie of all time for an easy reason, it is just a great movie! the acting is good, the action is thrilling, and the story is intense! Based on a best selling noval by Peter Benchley this movie was the first movie to ever surpass the 1 hundred million dollar mark at the box office heading it's way to 260 million total domestic gross. and it started what we know as the summer blockbuster event season! it was the all time box office champion until STAR WARS took the tital in 1977. It Stars Roy Scheider,Richard Dryfus, and Robert Shaw and Directed by future 2x Oscar winner Steven Spielberg. The comunity of Amity Island is terfied by a huge great white shark who finds that Amity Spells lunch! and it is up to 3 men (Scheider,Dryfus, and Shaw) to save the day in this very thrilling tale.
B000002R4R|5.0|I almost forgot about this album - to be honest - and bought the remastered version today. It is simply amazing! Although Elton Dean left the band after &quot;Fifth&quot;, Karl Jenkins is a worthy replacement, adding a new sound to the band playing the oboe (among other instruments). <br />The rhythm section with Hugh Hopper on bass and John Marshall on drums is so awesome I can't find words to describe it. Mike Ratledge flourishes on the keyboards and it seems like elements from previous albums blend together in a perfect mix: tapeloops, experimental pieces, jazz, jazzrock, rock.<br />The first part, recorded live, is reason alone to buy this album.<br />The Soft Machine went on to become Jenkins' band and I stopped listening after &quot;Softs&quot; which was IMHO the end of the real Soft Machine.
0142000655|4.0|The Story written by John Steinback reaches into new depths of exploring a persona of identity.  Resembling the tale of Cain & Abel, the conflicting forces of good and evil wage war with the dream of Eden.  The power of goodness prevails, the mystic background of those who can or cannot be trusted, are all included in this all-out deep thinking novel.  This novel stresses the such points on frienship, bitterness, dealing with decit, persistence to achieve, and a twisted romance leading to disaster.<BR>For those who will enjoy reading a fast pace, deep thinking, adventure, romance, this book is worth the reading and worth the time.  The con of this novel, is the amount of page reading to do, not unless you like long page books, or the difficulty or understanding level.  Overall though, this book is a classic that cannot be ignored and a book for almost everyone.
0140441409|4.0|that morals come from reason. Experience has taught Marcus that the surface of things falsify the truth about those things, and that an even temper and a humble mind are the best companions in the quest for that which brings lasting satisfaction. Marcus thinks his way out of conundrums; we must admire someone so full of such consideration, yet belongs to early history. Interesting blend of polytheism, deism, Stoicism,atomism, and a bit of Cynicism. Eminently readable-Marcus assembles his thoughts into short paragraphs with no particular unifying theme that might determine the order, so you can start anywhere, and leave anywhere and get a compact bit o'wisdom from this troubled, dying Roman emperor. Broad enough to appeal to any thinker, it's a series of mental snapshots of all worthwhile philosophical thoughts up to 180 AD.
B00003CXA2|3.0|This movie was good, but not as good as other movies that I've seen that serve as &quot;quasi-baby-boomer scrap book.&quot; Plus, I still think the edgie &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; deserved to take home the award for best picture that year.
0446310786|3.0|Harper Lee has written a book that shows us the cruelty of the human being towards the black man and those who support him very clearly through the eyes of a child. Lee makes the book easy to relate to for a middle-school student, but then drones on with long, hard to comprehend speeches that bore the reader. However, Lee then fills the book with small bits of suspense that leave you on the edge of your seat. The details are vivid, and paint a good picture of what she is talking about. Lee uses strong characterization so you feel as if you know the characters, but then kills many of them off very quickly. Lee however teaches good life lessons with themes you can relate to, but uses poor transitions between them. In the end I feel this is a fairly good book for a middle-school student and give it three-and-a-half stars.
B000066C1N|5.0|At first I listened to the soundtrack and was enthralled by Zimmer's excellent music score.  He was the main reason I had bought it, after all.  Bryan Adams just didn't strike a chord with me.<br />Hans Zimmer has four great tracks on this CD that are absolutely gorgeous.  It wasn't until I saw the movie, however, that Bryan Adams' music really appealed to me.  Now I love almost every song on it.  Bryan Adams has a laid-back style that really appeals to me for some reason.<br />The CD is well worth the money spent.  Ignore the critics--they don't know what they're talking about.  This CD is one of the best movie soundtracks I've heard in a while.
1891252089|4.0|As a recent Astanga devotee, I really needed a book that would clearly demonstrate each asana plus appropriate modifications. Swensen's book accomplishes this task admirablly and provides invaluable hints and 'subtle points'. It really is designed with the yogi or yogini in mind, Thanks David!
B00005JKMQ|1.0|In short and I know I'm not going to make many friends out there for this review but Muhammad Ali doesn't deserve a movie about his Draft dodging racist life.  He was just an egotistical nightmare of what athletes should not be like, if you want a boxing story make one about George Forman or Rocky Marciano (the undefeated champion 49-0).  In short Will Smith did alright but the basis of this movie and story are morally degrading.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam did seem to take alot of backlash from the alternative community at the time of ten, but really when you listen to the music it becomes extremely clear that this is a vital album to rock history. It starts off with \\"once\\" an angry rant from someone who just can no longer deal with life, this song will take some time to grow on you but it's one of pearl jam's best heavy songs. Then you step into \\"even Flow\\" With mike mccrady sounding reminiscent of stevie ray vaughan, this song is an awesome guitar song. Carrying heavy themes of homelessness. Then one of the best songs of all time \\"Alive\\" the best song on the album. It has the chorus this chorus that just won't get out of your head, and the jimi hendrix style guitar solo is definitly my favorite guitar solo of all time. Then \\"Why Go\\" which is yet another angry song, a great one at that! It also takes time to grow but the lyrics are very true. Then the heartsick \\" BlaCk\\" an Ode to lost love, this song showcases eddie vedders singing talent. Then the song that was the first single \\"jeremy\\" Controversial, being that it's true, it's based on jeremy wade delle, which from the music video you get the idea. This song does still help one from a personal interpretation stand point get through tough times. <br />Then we reach the second half of the album, with \\"oceans\\" a song with an awesome vocal effect to it. Followed by \\"Porch\\" Which if you are having problems letting go of a loved one this song describes the anguish of that perfectly. The next song is \\"garden\\" Which is the weakest song on the album, which means nothing because it's still a great song. Then \\"deep\\" the song that grew on me the most, it's such a deep song that you have to really see the words to truly appreciate. Just picture a man debating wether to jump off the building, then he does and someone becomes a witness to this and the result is an endless redundant tragedy. It's a heavier song that will make you think. <br />Now we come To the most beautiful song which is \\"release\\" another very deep song. The Vocals are amazing, the guitar although simple is amazing, it has a very reflective feel to it. <BR>This album helped to shape the 90's give it a listen!
B0000639FE|5.0|Jerry Maguire is a sports agent who wakes up one day and finds out the treadmill of the 80s and 90s \\"greed is good\\" work ethic is giving him a few sleepless nights.  He writes a mission statement for his company that gets him fired, and sends him on a long journey of self-realization.  Sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you even get what you deserve -  just not always WHEN you expect it.<br />This is one of the best feel good films I have ever seen.  Cameron Crowe's recipe for the perfect romance include a knock out script, unbelievable chemistry in the cast, and just the right quantities of drama, humor, and social commentary to satisfy everybody.  If that doesn't get you to buy this, consider this - Jonathan Lipnicki - the cute kid in the Little Vampire and Stuart Little - is even younger and cuter and superbly directed.  Key to the plot, he and Tom Cruise put down some of the best moments in the film, possibly on celluloid anywhere.  Those magic moments are one of Crowe's specialties.  You know those intimate little moments that really aren't in the script - like the way Kate Hudson looks at Patrick Fugit after she's just gotten bad intel on her current fling...they capture really deep truths about the character and make you bond with the characters in the film, almost like they were real people you'd like to know.<br />Then Cuba Gooding just steals the film in more than a couple places.  Extremely funny, but much more than a caricature.  Easy to understand why he got the Oscar for this one.<br />Renee Zellweger makes you want to watch the movie over and over again.  She captures the essence of what it feels like to trust someone who is your inspiration, to be vulnerable, to be strong - but not to be pathetic for a moment.  Again - part acting and part writing and directing.  Crowe followed this movie up with the best American film in a generation - Almost Famous.  His movies have enough pop culture in them to be entertaining - almost like a good musicalhook - but enough soul truth to keep you coming back for a visit when the newness wears off.  He is skilled beyond belief, but weaves his magic so well - you never give it a thought.<br />My only criticism in the DVD package itself.  It is hard to navigate and lacks any meaningful special features.  However, I still gave it five stars because I know I'll watch this as many times as I have seen Star Wars and the Sound of Music.  Crowe makes me wonder if Atticus Finch isn't real, alive, and switched his profession to directing movies.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Pistols WERE the punk movement (even though there is some dispute as to whether the punk movement started in NYC or the UK).  Doesn't matter -- what does matter is that it churned out some of the best, most interesting and most missunderstood music ever.  I love this album.  I keep it in the car at all times and crank it loud when I'm [upset] about something (which in L.A., means pretty much every time I drive since everyone here drives like an idiot).  In short, if you don't have this, GET IT.
015626224X|5.0|In his semi-autobiographical work \\"Down &amp; Out in Paris and London\\", Orwell first takes us to Paris in the late 1930's where the narrator (who bears a striking resemblance to Orwell) is living in squalid hotels and desperately trying to get by.  Unable to find work as a writer, he gets jobs in hotels and restaurants, working long hours as a plongeur/dishwasher.  His accounts of what occurs in the kitchens and back rooms of fine dining establishments make one think twice about dining out.  The narrator shares accounts of others he meets living a similar life and how they survive by continually pawning their belongings to buy scraps of food.  In the second part of the book, the narrator, sick of life in Paris and longing for the familiarity of Britain, moves back to London to begin a job.  The job does not begin immediately so he spends time as a tramp moving from shelter to shelter.  The system and policies of these shelters was very enlightening.<br />I personally enjoyed the Paris part of the book more than the London part. The writing in \\"Down &amp; Out in Paris and London\\" is simple yet wonderful and sharp.  It is a relatively easy read and highly informative. As you read the book you begin to understand what it must be like to live a life of poverty.
0066620694|3.0|The book is well researched and written to effectively educate on that information.  Some chapters go into excruciating detail.  You may realize after reading 1/3 of the book that the rest is innocuous.  This would make (and perhaps did make) a fine HBR article.  It is excessive as a book.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavinge is amazing she is soo not pop so popfans invest in somthing like swedish poptarts play or star wannabes Jump5 I hate both of those groups. I love rock and Avril is superb with wonderful tracks....
0736041850|5.0|The book has a few errors, e.g., a certain muscle will be shown in bold when the text states that a different muscle is being worked.  Also, it should have a special section devoted specifically to rotator cuff exercises, a severely neglected part of strength training.  But, in spite of these minor criticisms the book is a masterpiece and a must-have.  I hope that the author reads this and contacts me for specfics about the errors that I've found.
B000002KHH|5.0|In 1969, Black Sabbath single-handedly created Heavy Metal with their self-titled debut album. And the people rejoiced and saw that it was good. \\"Let there be a follow-up\\", boomed the band members, and wangled a bank loan to take them back into the recording studio. And so, 'Paranoid' saw the light of day and remains to this day, one of the greatest Heavy Metal album of all time. It has everything. The guitar...well...look up 'Power' in the encyclopaedia and you'll find a picture of Tony Iommi playing his Gibson SG, There are lyrics depicting scenes of unparalleled misery and carnage ('War Pigs'), insanity ('Paranoid'), gothic terror ('Iron Man') and drug-induced hallucinations ('Fairies Wear Boots'). Importantly, there's a sense of humour that can sometimes be lacking in some metal acts (notably northern European ones). And how can you resist an album with songtitles like 'Rat Salad' and 'Hand of Doom' (this was 1970, remember). For my money, 'War Pigs' is the best metal song ever: long, slow, heavy, epic, beautiful. Ozzy is in fine form, heralding the imminence of our destruction with authority and panache. Sabbath made a whole string of top-flight albums in the 70s but Paranoid is the crispest. And has the best cover.
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is a movie that realistically portraits the Rangers and Delta soldiers in Somalia. It's an ensemble cast (something like 35 speaking roles) that acts well and feels genuine. Ridley Scott does a great job making this movie. The man has made some of the greatest movies (Blade Runner, Alien) and Black Hawk Down lives up to his previous works. There is also a haunting score from Hans Zimmer. The set design is so realistic that I can't believe it didn't win an award for its production design. It's a great movie, and it is no surprise to find Jerry Bruckheimer as one of the producers. <br />It does fall a little short as a dvd. There is no commentary, and really no special features outside a short documentary on the film. But even without fully realizing the capabilities of dvd, the movie itself makes it worth buying.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Do yourself a favor.  Do **NOT** start watching this film in the middle of it - you will spoil one of the most entertaining things about it:  trying to figure it out.  If you enjoy the film, you'll probably want to watch it again, and you'll be irked that you didn't have an opportunity to put all the pieces together yourself before knowing the ending.<br />So if you come across the middle of an airing of it on cable some night, and you want to catch a few minutes since you've heard so much about it (like I did), don't!  It would be better to just switch to another channel and rent the movie (or buy it) at another time, so you can sit down and start from the beginning.<br />Also, the film is doubly entertaining in that it's like one of those jackets that you can turn inside-out and wear either way.  You sit down and watch it and get hit with its raw impact - then you sit down again, and all the scenes have a totally different meaning the second time, which makes it - basically - two movies for the price of one.<br />If you like noir films and films that are a maze or a puzzle, you should only watch The Usual Suspects straight from the start.  Otherwise, you'll be robbing yourself of some good fun ... even though it would only be small-time robbery.

I definately recommend that you get this cd!

0385503954|5.0|The comparison with Nabokov captures this novel best. Not only because MacEwan's prose does rise very near to the level of the Master's, but also because the structure is so similar to that of Lolita. (The comparison to Hartley's The Go-Between is also dead on, and I second the recommendation). In Atonement, as in Lolita, the real clue as to what's going on is knowing who is telling us this story, and why, and when. The novel itself is the final draft of a story one of the characters has been writing and rewriting since page one. Only when you know the ending do many details of the earlier sections take on their full significance. Fans of twentieth-century British fiction will catch other intertextual jokes. Cyril Conolly makes a guest appearance, as does Elizabeth Bowen, who offers qualified praise of an early, highly Bowen-esque, version of the story. (As for the probability of the central events of the story -- it's questionable, but then so is Humbert's version of what went on at the Enchanted Hunters. But in the end that's not the point. Long live the unreliable narrator!!)This is ultimately a novel about novel-writing, fiction that celebrates the making of fiction. Shelve it with Nabokov, Calvino, and Garcia Marquez.
B000065V1V|5.0|A very enjoyable release. It's been over 20 years--since Scary Monsters--since David has had more than a couple songs that were great. On Heathen, it's about the whole cd! The production work is outstanding, great job by Tony Visconti. David has finally has stripped down the sound. You can hear the instruments and the beat is loud and clear. I thought beginning with Outside, Earthling and the subpar Hours that Bowie was making much too much sound. Here he lets the songcraft stand on its own merits, letting the songs breathe on their own. The songs are fantastic, my favorites are Cactus, Slip Away, Slow Burn (great guitar Petey), Afraid (what's with David, is he afraid of everything), I Would Be Your Slave...good slow number. The highlight for me was David Bowie's cover of Neil Young's I've Been Waiting For You. Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) covered Like A Hurricane to good use; his new release \\"Frantic\\" is excellent also. I've Been Waiting For You is a great guitar number with Dave Grohl and the last song...Heathen (the rays). Bowie's vocals are excellent throughout Heathen. Great pacing of song selection. Everything is here, the rockers, the ballads, and a few laughs thrown in. This Summer it's the thin white duke, and stardust trails for me. Rock on. Great job. David Torn's guitar is top notch. Still, my favorite Bowie remains Diamond Dogs and Aladdin Sane. However, Heathen rises towards those heights. It might not get there, but I have to say Bowie has did his homework on this release. Thanks much...cacci
B00005YW4H|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every track, and having only heard the Amazon \\"brief tracks\\" found the CD far better than I had anticipated.
0790731940|5.0|It's a &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; one. I love foster. Gibson also fits in for the charactor perfectly well. The script is great. The plot is fun, unpredictable, and surprising which added more fun to the story. What great for the whole family is that there is no bloody scene and   nobody actually died in this movie.
0316921173|3.0|This was a pretty good book.  An interesting question is what it is, really.  Find out what that question is in just about every review you read about it, but the only way you can answer it is if you read this book.  Wallace will give you some interesting perspectives on the nature of happiness.  Try it out if you like a different approach on prose and are up for reading something different.
B00005RY7X|5.0|'I Get Wet' is a musical revelation to me. Before discovering Andrew WK, I thought that legendary bands like AC/DC, Motörhead and KISS were the ultimate in unadulterated, full throttle, visceral, bottom line ROCK 'N' ROLL. <br />But, in the space of 12 sky shattering tracks, Andrew WK has just raised the bar, completely trashing the contemporary rock scene (now overrun with retro grunge plagiarists like Staind, Creed and Nickelback), and even surpassing the bands who have spent decades doing what they do better than anyone else.<br />Andrew WK is more exciting than AC/DC. More in-your-face than Motörhead. More anthemic than KISS. He has taken rock, at its most fundamental level, into a new and higher place of ecstatic, take-on-the-world celebration.<br />What makes 'I Get Wet' a masterpiece? Three things.<br />ONE.<br />The riffs. Damn right, too...every true rock fan (and every true rock band) knows that great riffs are at the heart of all great rock 'n' roll music. AC/DC built their entire, three decade career almost entirely on great riffs, and great riffs alone. When the 90's came along, and Nirvana killed Mötley Crüe, the simple joy of a great riff became unfashionable. Rock stopped going up, into ecstasy, and started back down, into melancholy...and great riffs are much happier being happy than they are being sad. So it has been ever since...there was no happy riffing during the grunge movement, or during the rap-metal movement that followed (which is not to say that those musical trends didn't have important sounds to be heard). In the present, where grunge is now shamelessly repeating itself, fantastic riffs STILL haven't gone back into fashion. So Andrew WK isn't fashionable.<br />But so what? If you care whether the artists you listen to are fashionable or not, then you're a SELL-OUT. What REALLY matters is the music, and, through his riffs, A.W.K. HAS the music. <br />You know the kind of riffs I'm talking about: the kind that insist you play air guitar. The kind that are just complex enough to be fresh and inventive, yet simple enough to jump into your head and stay there, permanently. The kind that you recognise instantly. The kind that make your life worth living. 'Party Hard', 'I Get Wet', 'Ready To Die', 'Got To Do It'...EVERY SINGLE SONG on this album has a great riff. One or two don't stand as strongly as the others ('She Is Beautiful' and 'I Love NYC' bring the simplicity a little too close to formula)...but overrall the quality is so high, and so constant, that the riffage just can't be denied. None of these songs hang around, either...most of them clock in around the three minute mark. These songs love you and leave you, and leave you hungry for more. This only makes you appreciate the guitar work even more. <br />Also, crucially, every riff sounds new. Yes, Andrew WK is about rock 'n' roll on it's simplest level, but he is no plagiarist. While The Strokes or The Hives play riffs that sound like a hundred other riffs you've heard, 'I Get Wet' is stuffed with new meat...and it's delicious.<br />TWO.<br />The production. Garage rock may be fashionable again, but Andrew WK has not used this as an excuse to make an album that...well, sounds like it was made in a garage. The sound of 'I Get Wet' is crisp, crystal clear, and absolutely ENORMOUS. Without a doubt, this is the BIGGEST rock album I have ever heard. Your bedroom is a stadium. The pavement outside the newsagents is a stadium. Never has an album insisted so strongly that I turn my walkman up to maximum volume. It just BEGS to be played really, really loudly, because it sounds loud even if you play it quietly.<br />The guitars layer on top of one another, seemingly in their hundreds, to create a gigantic wall of sound. Between these layers, piano and synthesisers are added, like the creamy coating between blocks of sponge in a gorgeous cake. These gentler sounds have the beautiful effect of adding even more depth to the guitars...the result is so epic, it really has to be heard (on headphones) to be believed. And while, described in words, this formula does sound entirely typical of most 80's rock, with Andrew WK in the studio, it is not the same. Yes, it is retro...but nothing and no one has ever sounded quite like this. No album's production has ever sounded as staggeringly epic as 'I Get Wet'. <br />Andrew WK has entered the old school, tied up and gagged all the teachers, blared his album from all the speakers, and incited a total riot in every damn classroom.<br />THREE.<br />What makes this album so different, if so much of it is about what has been done before? Answer? Three letters: A.W.K.<br />Andrew WK is the X factor, the fuel, the soul, the life that breathes into every fantastic component of this album, and unites them all into a whole that far, far execedes the sum of what is, essentially, a lot of loud guitars.<br />Simply put, Andrew WK has a sense of self-belief that, frankly, I have never experienced in any other artist. I say I have direct experience of this because it is entirely evident, just from listening to the album. <br />THE MAN MEANS IT. <br />When I started reading his interviews, and visiting his website, and hearing anecdotes from people who had met him in person, it only confirmed what was already obvious. <br />Andrew WK loves music like he loves life itself. And he loves life itself A LOT. And he wants to let the whole world know it.<br />And with the warm friendship he has with his fans, he does.<br />And with his total committment to being the best he can be, he does.<br />And on this album, he does.<br />Andrew W.K. is FOR REAL. He is unfashionable. He has nothing new to say. He is old school. His white t-shirt (I assume he only possesses one!) is very, very dirty.<br />He has made what may well be the greatest rock 'n' roll album in music history.<br />WOW.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is the one movie, I have seen in theaters more than once. From the opening scenes of the movie, until the ending, I was in awe of everything going on. From the vibrant colors used every where, to the outstanding performances of the actors themselves, this movie is one that can be enjoyed by anyone. I've seen it 3 times in the theaters, and a male friend of mine has seen it 5 times. It is just an incredible film that will leave you wanting more.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Moulin Rouge is something out of the ordinary, many films do not have these wonderful ways of making a musical/movie.<br />The Soundtrack to Moulin Rouge is outstanding the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman make this CD worth listening to. The singles &quot;Come What May&quot; and &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; show the chemistry between Nicole and Ewan. This soundtrack is one of the best. Although, I was disappointed that &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; sung by Jim Broadbent was not accompained on this soundtrack. I still found mostly all the songs to be spectacular. <br />If you have seen Moulin Rouge, you'll have to go out and get the soundtrack. Its great, unique and they arent many out there like that. And aren't many people in the mood for something new? If you are check out the movie Moulin Rouge and of course its Soundtrack.
B000002JOF|5.0|I have been a CR fan for quite a few years. However, I found that many of his earlier works seemed to lack continuity. Even the so called 'BEST OF' compilations did not do much for me. This, however, could easily be described as a true best of CD. Every song is tight, and the songs all seem to flow into each other. I have played this CD over and over, since receiving it. 'Road To Hell' will be in my rotation for a long, long time to come. Attaboy Chris!!!
B00005Y23E|2.0|I am in love with bob marley music, but the reason i rated it so bad is because the same songs are on both disc, why is this so?   Actually, there are eight duplicate songs, yes two of them are extened versions, but big deal.  <br />Thank you

B000002AGN|3.0|At the risk of branding myself a heretic, I am actually going to write a critical review of this wonderful, but overrated piece of music.  I first heard Time Out as a teenager in the 80's, and it was my introduction to Jazz.  At the time, I thought it was an excellent recording with several great songs, including the immortal Blue Rondo and Take Five.  These songs are truly classics, albeit dated classics.  This recording was a milestone when it was released because of it's use of odd-meter time signatures and it's huge popularity.  Granted, there is much here for both the seasoned listener and the jazz newcomer.<br />My problem with this CD lies mainly in it's lackluster performance.  Some of the songs are very repetitive in nature, and some of the performances seem uninspired to me.  To break this down further, I have to look at the individual performers:<br />Dave Brubeck is no slouch of a piano player...but to be honest, after becoming in touch with players like Oscar Peterson, Art Tatum, and Chick Corea, Brubeck fails.  He sounds like a \\"second-tier\\" musician in comparison.  And as tasteful as Paul Desmond is with his sax, he too cannot compare with the greats.  Drummer Joe Morello is (at least within the other Amazon reviews here) very overrated.  For example the solo in Time Out, while good, is far from being \\"amazing\\"...especially after hearing the great Buddy Rich work within odd-meter.  Even certain rock drummers, a'la Neil Peart, Bill Bruford, or Phil Collins leave old Joe in the dust.  I recently heard an interview with Mr. Morello, where he said that he \\"needed\\" the rhythm piano to continue playing during \\"Take Five's\\" solo section so he not would lose track of where he was at in the song.  So be it.  Lastly, bassist Eugene Wright is unfortunately buried in the mix through the majority of the recording.<br />As for the songs, most people know that the album displayed ground breaking uses for odd-meter.  As far as that goes, the songs are tremendous achievements...but it's also it's failing.  For example the song \\"Three To Get Ready\\" has a very weak piano solo in it.  The reason: it sounds like Brubeck is concentrating more on staying in time with the odd-meter than on note selection.  In a word, uninspired.<br />These criticisms aside, there is no reason why I would not recommend this CD...especially to someone new to jazz.  There is much here to learn from for the newbee, and I'm sure most seasoned jazz listeners already have this in their collections.  I would not give mine up because it is a great \\"rainy afternnon listen\\"...smooth and mellow.  However, it is not a desert island jazz disc.<br />My breakdown - <BR>  5 stars - if you are new to jazz, want an early introduction to odd-time signatures, or are a Brubeck fan.<BR>  4 stars - if you are familiar with jazz, are a sax player (or like sax), or really like mellow jazz.<BR>  3 stars - if you have heard other greats in the jazz realm, but are looking to listen to other artists.<BR>  2 stars - if you are a fusion fan, like amazing musicianship, or like to listen to Metallica.<BR>  1 star - no one should give this recording one star.<br />Overall opinion - recommended, but not essential.
B00005MHXR|5.0|I have a friend whose music taste and mind run about the same but on this one she thought I might not like it. I am so glad I did not just trust her and not listen for myself. India Arie is so so wonderful! I knew I liked \\"Video\\" but as I heard more I realized she didn't miss with one song. Her voice is so soothing and her style is smooth as silk. My grandaughter even sings along with almost all of the songs and my daughter fell in love with it right away. I wish Miss Arie could have shared in some of the glory given to other artist this past year. She and Angie Stone are the two best I have heard. I hope they keep on doin' it their way!!!
B00005QK3B|5.0|There is a huge problem with progressive music fans...they are far too critical!  If a Marillion album bares the slightest resemblence to a Genesis record, it's bashed.  Would these same people bash an ELP recording if it sounded like Gentle Giant?  The carriers of the progressive torch are bound to show their influences on their sleeve to a degree, but is that any reason to degrade a masterpiece such as this?  Yeah, Marillion sounds like Genesis...and Porcupine Tree sounds like Pink Floyd, and Spock's Beard sounds at times like Gentle Giant, etc.  With that being said...<br />Misplaced Childhood is a masterwork on par with Dark Side Of The Moon, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, and Close To The Edge.  And while the musical elements of this are characteristic of early period Genesis, to me it blows away most anything they did with Peter Gabriel.  And to the reviewer who stated that vocalist-genius Fish sounds like a Gabriel clone: you didn't listen closely!  For one, Fish is a far superior lyricist to Gabriel...rivaling (IMHO) Dylan, Lennon, and Waters.  He is far and away closer in depth of meaning and vocal styling to Peter Hamill of Van Der Graff Generator fame, albeit with much better tone.<br />It has been noted that this recording was a \\"turning point\\" or \\"deeply meaningful\\" to people that hear it.  I feel the same.  If fully appreciated, this can be a deeply moving piece of music, touching the misplaced child in many of us.  Anyone who has had a relationship gone bad can appreciate the depth of emotions expressed here.<br />Extraordinary musicianship, haunting emotion, and undeniably brave for it's time (coming out in the age of Duran Duran and Culture Club), this is the definition of a desert island disk.<br />Although Marillion had other brilliant recordings (Fugazi, Brave, Script...)none would achieve this level of perfection.  Despite your interpretation of progressive music, Misplaced Childhood must stand among the Top-5 best progressive releases by the second wave of this genre, post-1980.  Call it neo-prog, call it Genesis Jr., it's damn near perfection!<br />My breakdown:<BR>  5 stars - if you like intelligent, emotional, well-played music, or if you are new to Marillion or the progressive genre.<BR>  4 stars - if you like prog music, but don't like neo-prog or Genesis.<BR>  3 stars - if you think all prog released after 1980 was bad.<BR>  2 stars - if you are glad that bands like The Clash and Sex Pistols killed the progressive genre.<BR>  1 star - no one with any musical sense should give this 1 star.<br />Overall:  An absolutely essential disk from the progressive genre, and if it the last piece of music I hear before I keel over I will die with a smile on my face.

B000059Z8J|4.0|This movie is truely a classic amongst the super hero films. Good story, good acting, Good effects.  There is just one problem.  At times the movie seems, horrifically hokey.  For example Gene Hackmens Lex Luthor is a great character to watch, but is almost to cartoony for his own good.  NOw Christopher Reeve does a magnificent job as Clark Kent/Superman.  He really does the part well.  In fact anyone else probably would have killd the part.<br />OVerall this is a recomended see, and is probably one of the best Super hero films around. A definite must see.

B00005JL3A|2.0|For those of you who have not played the Resident Evil game, I suggest that you not purchase the DVD. The story line is unique but badly portrayed with corny scenes that makes you think \\"oh no, they're doing that matrix bit again\\". The zombies can be related to an 80's style dracula-like movie; the only real feeling you get is from the fast pumped and creepy music from Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Static X, etc.<br />All summed up, Aliens would of been a better purchase if you wanted to see a chick kick some [bottom].
B00004Z459|5.0|\\"A double-platinum rap-rock band...*yawn*...guess I'll take a listen to it...\\"<br />Wow.<br />Beyond the hype is an actual good album, with EXCELLENT lyrics (not typical of the genre) and great production.  The DJ fits in well here, as does the guitarist Delson...the way this album is produced reminds me of early Def Leppard albums.  This album is hard to hate, and after a few listenings actually gets better, due to a little bit of originality.  Expect a lot of second-rate copycat \\"We have a rapper/singer duo\\" in the near future, but years from now, Hybrid Theory will be remembered as a great album, with great songs.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD has to be - bar none- one of the best CD's I've heard in a long, long time. John Mayer has a deep, smokey, soulful voice that reminds me of Dave Matthews ( without that annoying whine), and his music is truly fabulous. The more you listen to this disc, the better it sounds. It is as suitable for your workday  as it is for your weekend relaxation.  Every song is one that -at one time or another in the course of your day, will find it's way into your head. . . and never leave you alone! The music and lyrics mix and mesh perfectly, and when you put that with that sleepy, sexy 'bedroom voice' - you can't help but come up with a winner. I look forward to hearing a great deal from him in the future, and hope that Mr. Mayer has some concert dates set for summer'02. I'd bet he's awesome live on stage. Get this CD. You won't be sorry!
B00005NWM3|5.0|Alright people, there isn't anything wrong with mainstream grunge or hard rock, as long as it's done right, as Nickelback have done.  The energy of the band is captured in the album, and therefore should be listened to REALLY LOUD!!!  Anybody who've seen Nickelback live know the amount of energy they pump out each show, and to have that captured in Silver Side Up is a gem.  <br />Yes, the songs are catchy.  Yes, \\"How You Remind Me\\" has charted in the Adult Top 40, among almost a billion other charts.  (Also the amount of times that song's been played on the radio).  It's done right for a band without any pre-hype, and an album with longevity sells itself based on word of mouth.  The album was released the same day Jay-Z's new one was, on that fateful day (Sept. 11, 2001) and Jay's, with the hype hit number 1, while Nickelback was 2.  Almost a year later, Nickelback in the top 30 while Jay is nowhere to be found.
B000003TA4|4.0|This sure doesn't beat In Utero, but it is still damn good.  This album is HUGELY overrated and praised as the best album with the best guitar work ever - Kurt Cobain was definately NEVER a good guitarist. This album was way too polished by the record industry and made to look good - it didn't have the raw sound of In Utero that made In Utero great. However, Kurt was one of the best song writers ever, and not many can beat Kurt Cobain at that. Despite the bad guitar work, this is much better than some of the Nu-Metal you see out there these days and Blink 182 garbage - Kurt could spin circles at guitar compared to those guys. Some of the best songs are here are definately not the singles (Smells Like Teen Spirit is highly overrated and not their best) but the \\"filler\\" material such as Lounge Act. On A Plain, Territorial Pissings, and most of the songs at the end of the cd are good. Something in The Way is a very good exit track due to its calm and depressing manner. This album is a must if you're just looking for a good album thats highly accessible but if you want Kurt Cobain's best, get In Utero. It's his most artistic work, but it's less accessible than Nevermind.
B000007T1M|4.0|System of a Down's debut may - WILL - sound offbeat to people who find Tool normal...but after a few listens, System's sound grows on you.  From the slow ballad &quot;Spiders&quot; to the faster &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;War?&quot;, the entire album is an experience in music anyone looking for something new should try.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for straight-forward metal, though.
B00005Y228|4.0|Well, Kylie's got the good, the bad and the ugly on her first American release in a decade, FEVER. The ugly is: Love at First Sight, a boring track, and Burning Up (Down to the disco...hey summer madness) a song too reminiscent of the early 70's flavor that we should forget. It's just a stupid song, to be blunt about it. Replace it with foreign tracks Rondezvous at Sunset and Never Spoken for best results. The bad? Fragile, worth skipping, and Love Affair, which is nothing special. <br />But most importantly is the good, the best, and the tracks hanging by their nails. More, More, More just narrowly avoided the &quot;bad&quot; list. It's pretty catchy, and breathy vocals are sometimes cool, but &quot;My oh my, this love divine?&quot; Stop it right there Kylie. &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; is pretty much easy to explain. It's catchy, infectious, and irresistible. But it's getting to be one of the most overplayed pop songs this year, so let's move on.<br />The best track on this CD is without a doubt &quot;Your Love.&quot;<BR>It's got better lyrics than it's predecessors, and it's the prettiest, most unforgettable song on the album. Buy it for this if for nothing else. <br />OTHER TRACKS WORTH SOMETHING: Dancefloor, Fever<BR>GRADE: B<BR>BOTTOM LINE: Catch The Fever
B00005NW02|5.0|This may be the most original major-label album of 2001...One just needs to listen to the title track, &quot;Bounce&quot;, &quot;Aerials&quot; and &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and THEN try to define the genre...people shouldn't even try.  Actually, I'd be hard-pressed to define the first song, &quot;Prison Song&quot;, let alone any others.  Toxicity is a more ambitious album than their debut, and System pulls it off without changing for the mainstream, letting the mainstream adapt around them instead.  Can't even say they sound like anyone else.
B0000640SA|5.0|Just watching the innovative style of the film, being played backwards, is enough to behold.  Though it's seems unnatural at first, the way director Christopher Nolan pieces the film together flows really well.  If the unique style wasn't enough, the plot and message of this indie film are both superb.  Here Nolan takes the mystery genre to a fresh level that has yet to be discovered.  A man who's condition cripples him of gaining new memories tries to learn who killed his wife.  This movie also tackles many thought-provoking themes-purpose in life, the selfishness in mankind, trust, and memory.  <br />I really gained a great respect for Christopher Nolan, this being his sophmore film.  I also recommend watching his first feature &quot;The Following.&quot;  The performances by Guy Pierce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano are all noteworthy.  All three are very believable and do a remarkable job.  This two-disc dvd package is satisfactory, but nothing great.  They make it somewhat of a hassle to find things and none of the extras are spectacular.  Either way, this dvd is definately worth the buy and definately worth repeat viewing.
6304211740|2.0|That simple remark of mine was all I had to say when my friend Norma wanted to know why I didn't like this version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, which she was preparing to see herself. &quot;What kind of comment is that?&quot; she had to ask. But once she had seen it, she understood. <br />Ever read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;? Jane is a small insignificant-looking person who conceals a tumult of emotion smoldering within. She used to be a real wildcat when her aunt was raising her, but when Jane got shipped off to Lowood, an awful boarding school, she met up with two individuals who tamed her. One was a fellow student Helen, and the other was a favorite teacher, Miss Temple. So Jane adopted a quiet mien, but inside was still the tumultuous nature. She lets it out again only once, when her new employer Mr. Rochester plays with her emotions, pretending to be engaged to the wealthy Blanche Ingram when all along it's Jane he is going to propose to. She rages and storms about how she has a heart as great as his, even if she is only a little governess. Since he's a  raging and storming guy himself, this is language he understands.<br />Well anyway, this Jane is usually hard to convey in a movie. The latest A&amp;E version is just awful; that Jane just thought she was all that. She didn't even act like she had an employer, which is very untrue to the book. Joan Fontaine did a convincing job of acting like she was a working girl having to answer to higher-ups, but lacked passion. However, she did convey littleness and insignificance. Now THIS Jane, at a height close to Mr. Hurt's, couldn't convey anything except monumentality. She was just much too tall! How could such a tall woman ever feel insecure? She didn't convey those feelings, and she must on some level. Actually, they had a good candidate for Jane in the movie, and let her slip by them; the actress Amanda Root (of &quot;Persuasion&quot; fame) plays Miss Temple. She really would've been marvelous. I suppose they felt her tooold already for the part, but I would've forgiven her that for everything else I know she'd have brought to the role.     <br />Other things I found wanting concerned the lighting. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a great Gothic romance, and Gothic romances are usually in dark places. This version had far too much light and lots of pretty garden strolls; not authentic in feeling. William Hurt is too amiable and blond for the brooding, dark, antisocial Rochester. And what about Joan Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax? Did she have a large percentage or something? I ask because every time I looked, there was some sort of slave camera shooting her reaction to whatever was going on. You'd have thought she was the protagonist, and not the governess. One thing she learned from her late husband Laurence Olivier was how to ham up a scene if necessary.<br />So, another disappointing &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for the records. Perhaps one day, the perfect Jane will dawn on the horizon, but until then, make do with Joan Fontaine.
B000002GVZ|4.0|Carly Simon has a VOICE.  So many singers rely on noise from the instruments to cover up the fact that they sing pretty much like you and I do in the shower, except some how they've conned us to pay them to do it.  Carly Simon, on the other hand, has one of the greatest voices to ever sing a pop-rock song.  She could sing these songs without the backup instruments and carry it off.  How many singers have that ability?<br />This CD contains a few cuts that show off that wonderful voice, though regretfully not all of her \\"greatest\\" songs, notably \\"Nobody Does it Better\\" is missing, and as other reviewers have noted, several other hits that came out after this album.  You have to wonder why this album was released as a CD given that a longer revised version was possible and should have been done that covered all of her hits, not just those from the early 70s.  There is an import titled \\"The Very Best of Carly Simon:  Nobody Does It Better\\" that includes the missing hits and covers her career to 1989.  If you are looking for a more \\"true\\" greatest hits, you would be better served to buy that CD than this one.<br />This CD gets 4 stars instead of 5 for two major flaws.  First, it is not truly Carly's greatest hits.  Second, given that she had so many more hits available, and given that CD's will hold nearly 80 minutes of music, an updated \\"Greatest Hits\\" could be way longer.<br />Having pointed out the flaws in this CD, it's only fair to point out that this CD has several of her greatest.  I know that many people equate Carly Simon with \\"You're So Vain\\", which is great pop-rock, but my personal favorite is \\"That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\\", a song about a woman giving up her needs and wants to marry.  Her awesome voice is an amazing instrument that forces you to focus on her voice and what she is saying.<br />\\"Anticipation\\", the classic tv commercial song, is also on this CD.  Overplayed yes, but still a truly great song, and once again it's Carly's voice that helps to make the song what it is.<br />I think \\"(We Have) No Secrets\\" is another wonderful song.  I guess I'm a sucker for songs about relationships that are sung with such feeling.  Carly has a way of putting emotion into her music with her voice that is rarely equaled in pop or rock music.<br />There are a host of other songs of varying stature on this CD.  \\"The Right Thing to Do\\", \\"Mockingbird\\", \\"Legend in Your Own Time\\" and \\"Haven't Got Time for the Pain\\" all received air play to varying degrees, and thus are truly hits.  I'm not a super fan of \\"Mockingbird\\" because it just doesn't seem to fit with the theme and tone of her other songs.<br />\\"Night Owl\\" and \\"Attitude Dancing\\" are fair songs that don't seem to reach quite to the level of the other songs on this CD.<br />If you are a big fan of Carly's and you already have all or much of her early music, pass this one by.  If you have the money to afford the greatest hits import you may want to get it for its greater coverage of her music.  If you are looking for a sampler and can afford to pass by her later music for now, which includes the awesome song \\"Nobody Does It Better\\", then buy this one.hat helps to make the song what it is.<br />I think \\"(We Have) No Secrets\\" is another wonderful song.

0671027344|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is young adult masterpiece. Stephen Chbosky knew exactly waht he was doing when he wrote this. The simple, yet corrupted life of Charlie and the world around him creates everlasting scenarios that fuel this book. If its one thing that I like more than anything about this book, its the way you are dealt the story, the way he presents it to the reader. Very clever, thats all I have to say about it because if you really edging to read this book you need to just read it! This book deserves a grand 5 stars, (*****) for its sheer brilliance.

B000031WD9|3.0|Sure, we've all seen the teen gross-out comedies before this, but one measure up to its charm.  What could be funnier than a bunch of high schoolers trying to lose their virginity?  Oh, wait, we've seen this plot a million times.<br />That's not to say the movie is bad, just played out.  By the middle of the movie you'll begin to predict what will happen to the five friends next.  <br />Alot of scenes will make you laugh though.  That's what makes it stand out above some of the others, such as \\"Porky's.\\"  The intro is worth seeing.  The main character, Jim, played by Jason biggs, is caught watching scrambled porn by his mother.  He convinced her it was just a nature documentary.  \\"Jim's Dad\\" was made famous by this movie as he continued to involve himself in his son's sex live...<br />It's rated R for strong language, nudity, strong sexual content, and alcohol use.  Not exactly a family film.  It's worth renting, but be prepared to see the same old shenanigan's you've seen before.

While Me against the world might have been his most introspective album, and The seven day theory the most intense this is Pac in his Death Row phase at its best. So if you are a fan of Pac period go cop this album, it is great, and espically if you like his Death Row songs the best.

0802136834|5.0|This is perhaps one of the finest biographies of the women who shared their lives with one of the most powerful and fascinating monarchs to have ruled England.  Weir devotes the utmost care to each of the six wives of Henry VIII, telling their stories with compassion and giving each an individual voice.  Most of the energy of this book is clearly directed on Henry's first two marriages, first to Katherine of Aragon and the divorce that helped to create the Church of England, and his stormy second union with Anne Boleyn, mother of the Great Elizabeth, chronicling her astronomical rise in power and her spectacular fall from grace.  Powerful and masterfully written, Weir recreates the fantastical Tudor court and sweeps the reader into this realm effortlessly.  Immensely readable and absorbing, this is Alison Weir at her very best.  Extremely well researched, I would recommend this book to anyone who is the least bit curious about 16th century society as viewed through the eyes of 6 of the most important women of their time.
B000062Y98|4.0|Truly a CD for those who are fans of Blind Guardian and of heavy metal. The disc begins with a classic piece, and does not stop. Blind Guardian's relentless pounding is absolutley amazing. The disc climaxes with \\"Age of False Innocence\\", yet doesn't fall till the last chord of \\"Mies Del Dolor\\" ends. A must-buy.
B00004U8H4|5.0|In American Psycho, novelist Bret Easton Ellis starts brilliantly satirizing life duing the 1980's, focusing on the culturally bankrupt lifestyle of Wall Street investment bankers and their bretheren.  Ellis depicts a shallow world populated by yuppies obsessed with status symbols: clothing, the right job, getting in the right restaurants, etc. Ellis is clearly in-tune with the cultural \\"ins\\" and \\"outs\\" of the era, providing an accurate time capsule for readers.  Within this world, these yuppies fail to notice that one of their own, Patrick Bateman, is consummed by an ever-growing compulsion to kill, especially those people that disturb his worldview.<br />Writer/director Mary Harron tackled the difficult task of adapting the book for the silver screen.  Appropriately, her movie adaptation focuses in on the satirical elements.  Actor  Christian Bale (also appears in Shaft in a somewhat similar role) deserves much of the credit for bringing the movie to life with his outstanding performance as Patrick Bateman.  Through his performance, you can easily understand Bateman's deep underlying psychosis and the on-going conflict in his mind as he tries to control that bloodlust.  All this is done with a pitch-black sense of humor.  Fortunately, the movie skips the book's more disturbing and disappointing elements.  Ellis' novel rapidly disintegrates from its promising beginnings rooted in satire.  I found that Ellis' novel increasingly focused on the violence, increasingly elaborate and disturbing.  Although I think the graphic violence is highly effective in conveying Bateman's ever-slipping grasp on reality, it makes the book unreadable for most and is the source of much of the negative criticism.  Credit Harron for keeping the violence off-screen, and the absurdity of the violence renders it almost cartoon-like.  That being said some viewers still will not be able to stomach it.<br />The movie's ending is essentially true to the book and very fitting. <br />As for the DVD itself, it is disappointing in its failure to take advantage of the medium.  A commentary for a controversial movie like this would have been extremely interesting.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|America has needed a Latin English diva for a long time. Many certainly thought we had one with Selena until she was sadly and unfortunately taken away. Jennifer Lopez kinda fills in the void. This disc is mainly R&amp;B and Latin with a very small amount of Pop. The opening track which many know is IF YOU HAD MY LOVE which is a strong R&amp;B track as well as radio single. WAITING FOR TONIGHT is like the only pop, dance song on the disc and is a recognizable hit. FEELIN SO GOOD is a very nice song that should brighten anyone's day. The ballads on the disc are not strong at all and the other songs except for a few like LET'S GET LOUD sound like filler. But this is a solid debut from a pretty talented singer.
B000066F6H|4.0|It matters little where these guys hail from or where their influences lie -- The Hives are a raucous rock band that aren't manufactured. The band blasts out quick songs, one after the other, with an old-school punk sound that shames many of the bands they're compared to -- past and present. This band is part of a thankfully budding movement of high-quality rock bands bursting onto the scene.<br /><br />I discovered The Hives about a year ago on MTV2, a channel that used to genuinely promote good music (not the case anymore). Watching that Hives video for the first time, I could tell this band was something special, and wanted to know more about it. Overall, \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" moves fast and hard -- it's pretty good stuff. Part of The Hives' charm comes from Pelle Almqvist, the lively lead singer with the perfectly pitched, somewhat scratchy vocals that equal the depth of the raging guitars around him. Almqvist's nickname of \\"Howlin\\" fits him perfectly. The guy doesn't have an \\"off\\" switch to his style; he's kind of like a young Mick Jagger.<br /><br />Pumped up and full of life, these guys are full of themselves, like any good punk band should be. Only the loungelike \\"Find Another Girl\\" slows down the frantic pace. \\"Statecontrol\\" rapidly picks the tempo back up, though, where it remains. This sound is familiar to millions, yet fresh every single time. It's one of those unique albums that has consistently good stuff from top to bottom. Definitely a band worth discovering.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  With not much dialogue, and an... action sequence that will blow you away.  Black Hawk Down is the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan.
0345448898|5.0|Before I talk about the collection, I would like to say this: These books are works of fiction; FANTASIES. People who have read His Dark Materials and claim that it is an attack on God need to get a grip. It is NOT an attack on God or the Christian faith, but is about growing up and the loss of innocence. The trilogy is labeled as a work of fantasy, and its positions on issues such as religion are not to be taken seriously. That being said, on to the books!<br />I'm not going to say what the books are about, you can read the other reviews for that. Instead I'm going to say what a great piece of work this trilogy is. The characters are very well developed; you feel a personal connection to each of them. There are many biblical references throughout the books, and most of them are indeed contrary to what Christians believe in. I personally find it refreshing that Philip Pullman can so openly write about this touchy subject. The scope of the trilogy is amazing, and you will instantly find yourself drawn into the worlds that Pullman has created. I simply could not put these books down, and there were many occasions where I found myself reading hundreds of pages at a time, and I loved every minute of it. However, I would not suggest these books to children under 14 or 15...some of the concepts are rather complicated, and some younger children might not be able to appreciate the absolute extent of the books. Also, if you are a close-minded Christian I would not suggest these books, as they do question certain aspects of the Christian faith. Other than that, I highly recommend this trilogy to any fantasy fan, or anyone that would like to get into the genre. Hope this review helped! Have fun!!
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a great film, paper by me gave it  *1/2 but not sure why at all. It's moving, tense, very graphic, the performances are strong and it has some of the best war action ever put on film. Speaking of the strong performances, I'm not sure why none of the actors were at least nominated for best supporting actor. There's so many that should of been considered, like Eric Bana (The Hulk), who's gonna be a huge actor. His little speech at the end is fantastic. Also Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepard give osacr worthy performances as well. Sizemore should probably be in every war movie as he's great in all of them, was in Born on the 4th of July, Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor. At his best in this though, probably his best performance yet. Has all his soldiers being shot up right in front of him yet he always has a solid \\"lets move on\\" attitude, he's just great.<br />  Ridley Scott (Gladiator), is one of the best directors out there, liked G.I. Jane  but always knew he had a better war movie in him and this is it of course. Nothing more I can really say, except that this film deserved more awards than Gladiator got. Should of won best picture for this instead, don't think it was even nominated for best picture though, certainly deserved it more than a Beautiful Mind which was good but not Best Picture bound at all. Well anyway, if you're looking for a good war movie this is it, the best since Saving Private Ryan.

B000059MEK|5.0|This was one of the only two albums I've ever bought and the other one was &quot;Homework&quot;. Wow. I am such a huge fan.<BR>After a serious case of nostalgia, I remembered my fave song from '99-2000, but I couldn't remember what it was called. Then my step-dad bought me the Now 50 album and it all came back. &quot;Digital Love&quot; sounded so much like my mystery tune (which was &quot;One More Time&quot; in case you're wondering) that I decided to find out more. I was instantly hooked. I now have both &quot;Homework&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot; though I prefer the second. I don't like discos or disco music but I am willing to make an exception in this case.<BR>It's NOT tuneless, it's NOT repetitive, it's NOT (too) mushy and it's certainly nothing like all the other (insert swear words here) pop bands floating around on the top like the scum that they are. Those are the four main points needed to be anywhere near my musical taste, and Daft Punk's &quot;Discovery&quot; fits beautifully into my CD collection.<br />All three of them.<BR>Boy, I need more stuff like this....<br />P.S. If you get the chance, watch the videos. They ROCK! I'm gonna sign off before my typing goes...
B000007UZ8|5.0|I bought this version because I had some extra cash, and I have to say that it was well worth the money. The album is truly a gem on its own. From \\"You\\" all the way to \\"Blow Out\\" you can enjoy this album all the way through. The 2 live versions aren't really different than the regular album tracks, but \\"Pop is Dead\\", \\"Million Dollar Question\\", and especially \\"Inside My Head\\" are definately worth the money. This version is essential listening for die-hard Radiohead fans.
B000050IE6|4.0|I bought this CD, few days ago, and started listening it.<BR>When I started my goal was to determine was it ok to buy more Opeth CDs and was it even good music.<BR>Well I listened to it for four days, and now I'm here... <BR>...and I am quite pleased with this CD.<BR>First of all I haven't ever before heard about this kind of acoustic and \\"gain\\" riff combining. It is still hard to belive that this kind of music does exist.<BR>The skill of instrument players is somewhat good, not as good as the boys of Liquid Tension Experiment have, but still excellent.<BR>To view some of my pure own opinions:<BR>The best track in this CD is definetly Godhead's Lament,<BR>because in this track they have the best combination of clean and brutal vocals and guitars, and if you listen carefully, even the bass lives it's own life and plays actually quite intresting riffs behind the guitar wall.<BR>Listen to it for your self carefully, and you will understand.<BR>This CD has really returned my and many other peoples faith in Death-Metal genre, we were quite worried when thrash like Cannibal Corpse started to pop-up like mushrooms on rain.<BR>After this CD I will go and buy all records made by Opeth, and start to wait their new album...whenever it may come out, I will be the one who will for sure buy it.
B000003N7G|3.0|I have tried and tried to listen to this release. I appreciate a lot of Jazz artists, especially trumpeters, there's just something about a sax's tone that just puts me to sleep.  And the Trane puts me out every time.  Not because it's peaceful or dreamy. Because I find Coltrane BORING... okay I've said it!  I'm guilty of a heinous lack of cool.  Committed hearsay, blasphemy even!<br /><br />That said, Ornett Coleman IS inspirational, but the 'Trane - can keep on rolling right on outta' here, and it wouldn't bother me a bit.  No offence intended, but that's my opinion.
B000006O7C|5.0|I became a Jeff Buckley fan on first hearing \\"Grace\\" - an album that inspired me, changed my life, and made me complete. I had also bought \\"Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk\\" at the same time as \\"Grace\\", but his debut album just held me so much so that I didn't really give \\"Sketches...\\" a *real* listen until I had been truly filed by \\"Grace\\".<BR>When making this album Jeff did not want to make a \\"second Grace\\": He had to develop, and this album shows just what a talent this man really was. Every single song on this album is on the same level as \\"Grace\\", if not higher. The songs are mature, rock-y, passionate, brave - they are songs of *emotion*. Disk One shows the songs which Jeff had made good quality recordings of, hinting that these would have made the final cut had he lived to see it. \\"Vancouver\\", \\"The Sky is a Landfill\\", \\"Morning Theft\\", \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\", and \\"Nightmares by the Sea\\" are all among my top favourite songs of all time, but to be honest, there is no one *superior* song in this collection - they are all the most beautiful, poetic and astounding pieces, I feel that have been written in at least the last twenty years. Each song helps you with different emotions - you feel and think differently during each song - they are a snippet of genius.<BR>Disk Two is the more \\"sketchier\\" area of the CD, but this does, in no way lessen the value of the songs. \\"Back in NYC\\" really hit home to me when watching a Jeff documentary when drummer Parker Kindred says \\"on a bad day, the city can take your soul\\": this song shows Jeff knew how that felt. \\"Jewel Box\\" is perhaps the prettiest song I have ever heard in my life - and shows how poetical and sensitive Jeff could be - in stark contrast to the humourous and hot \\"Your Flesh is So Nice\\"<BR>Truth be told, I could go over each and every one of these songs and say why it is amazing, beautiful and the work of the most gifted singer/songwriter/performer of our time, but words can't describe what you get from \\"Sketches..\\". It's that feeling of raw emotion - sadness to know he'll never be here again; the emotion of lost love, of dreaming, and any other human feeling that ahs ever existed. \\"Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk\\" is a mature album, and shows Jeff Buckley in his best light - the songs have changed my world forever, and if you buy this album, they will change you, too.<BR>Jeff Buckley, is, in my opinion the most gifted songwriter/performer/singer of *all time*. If you don't believe me, listen to this album!
B0000027I6|4.0|While I like this album very much and think it is Roger Waters' best solo studio album, I have to take exception with the reviewer who wrote that RW is the best rock lyricist. Waters' contempt for modern life and media are understandable, but his lyrics tend to be less than subtle and occasionally simplistic. For my hard-earned money, Bob Dylan writes with an earnest frankness which avoids some of the traps Roger falls into. Also, Van Morrison is another \\"grumpy old man\\" whose ability to scorn the system is expressed more delicately than RW. That having been said, Amused to Death is still one of my favorite albums, and \\"What God Wants\\" could be the national anthem as far as I am concerned.
B00005QG9J|2.0|what happened??? Fungus Amongus, SCIENCE, make yourself all of which are incredible CDs. They are hard, they are innovative and they all have something to say. Morning View is just easy listening crap. With the success of Drive, and all of the fans that just hopped on the incubus fanbase because they heard that song without even hearing their older work, i beleive incubus has changed. Morning View is an example of that. If you listen to SCIENCE and than hear this CD, you would think its a different band. I just hope the next CD they plan to do goes back to the sound that their earlier CD's were representing. All in all if you are an early incubus fan... dont waste your money, but if you hopped on the bandwagon this will be your number 1 CD.
B0000636UN|3.0|First album in 4 years....and this is it? Crow has had many problems over the past few years, and it shows... it's time to pick up the pieces and move on. Music is a tough industry where you're in one year and out the next. She belongs in the music industry and I know she will survive past 2002. As for the CD:  As usual, her songs tell great stories and bring vivid pictures to mind. Crow's first tune to hit the radio is \\"Soak Up The Sun\\"... a danceable drum-machined fluff track that will be destined for the dentist office or elevator later this month. I know she can do better than this (and she has). Crow's 1993 debut was strong, even if leaning to the \\"pop\\" side of music. Her sophmore self-titled release was inspired, deep and dark (and her best). Her 3rd continued along the lines of her 2nd with a great hit \\"My Favorite Mistake\\". As far as solo female rockers go, I hold Sheryl Crow on a very high pedestal. She is wonderful song writer, musician and producer... and this \\"C'mon C'mon\\" just isn't up to those high standards. Like so many big name bands with contracts to fulfill (Aerosmith comes to mind), I can't help but feel this release was somehow rushed... even if it did take almost 4 years in the making. Amidst my displeasure, there are a few exceptional tunes here... \\"Over You\\", \\"Hole In My Pocket\\" and that familiar Rolling Stones wanna-be guitar lick of \\"You're An Original\\". Crow is at her best when she is down in the dumps, totally depressed, having her bandmates quit on her, drunk from breakfast, and singing the blues. Some of the tunes here are just too damn happy for me. Crow boasts plenty of guest stars (Lenny Kravitz, Liz Phair, Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, etc...) and it leaves me wondering if this is her CD or something of a cha-ching ($$$) fundraiser. This is average Crow.
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the greatest albums of the 1990's (and beyond),  Radiohead incorporates a vision of dislocation, angst, fear and melody into one of the most focused and comprehensive theme albums of our time.  An essential album for anyone with a flare for inventive and explorative musical tastes.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Boasting a low-fi raw 70's punk rock sound, the Strokes are quite cool, if not a bit retro. There's nothing cool about doing something that's already been done before - unless you make it uniquely yours. The Strokes make it theirs. <br />There's something to be said about a band from the 21st century playing music rooted in the 70's, because remarkably it still sounds new and fresh, even as it isn't wholly original. The distorted vocals, the tempered but raw guitars, the solid drumming, it's an all or nothing equation for these guys. Without the quality vocals, the excellent guitar playing, the steady drumming, tracks like \\"The Modern Age\\", \\"Last Nite\\", \\"Barely Legal\\", \\"Hard to Explain\\", (hell, all of them!) wouldn't be what they are: great rock and roll.  <br />As it is, the Strokes aren't the most (take your pick of attributes) heavy, melodic, energetic, even polished band, and that lack of polish resonates on the record with a sense of freedom and possibility. These guys are young (in their 20's), and unlike most their peers, refreshingly astute and optimistic. They might be the ultimate one-hit wonder, and this raw garage rock trend might fizzle out soon. The Strokes, sticking true to their roots, don't seem to care. It's not really punk, it's not pop, it's definitely not nu-metal; their sound isn't really anything but uniquely theirs. Whatever you call it, Is This It? is easily one of the best and most original mainstream records out in quite some time.
B000065U1N|4.0|I just watched this movie last night, and I thought it was exceptional. The cast and crew did an amazing job. Ridley Scott is fanstantic as ever. Out of all the war movies that I've seen, this one made me real depressed. The events were horrific, but those soldiers were so courageous. God Bless them.
B000002LRX|5.0|Clocking in at 58:43, Faith No More's \\"Angel Dust\\" is nearly an hour of some of the most daring, adventurous, and altogether schizophrenic music ever recorded. There's rarely a dull moment. Though a hard rock band, FNM often dabbled in other genres including jazz, lounge, pop, and funk, making their music utterly unpredictable. And, unpredictable it is, as Angel Dust is not merely a rock record, it's an experience. It swings from genre to genre without feeling incoherent or uncohesive. At times it rumbles with a frightening intensity (\\"Caffeine\\", \\"Smaller and Smaller\\", \\"Malpractice\\", \\"Jizzlobber\\") others with an ear for sincerity and pop sensibility (\\"Land of Sunshine\\", \\"Everything's Ruined\\", \\"Kindergarten\\"), and sometimes it falls somewhere in between (\\"Land of Sunshine\\", \\"Midlife Crisis\\", \\"A Small Victory\\"). It's easily one of the most ambitious albums of its genre (one far overshadowed by the grunge movement that swept through Seattle) and an album that pioneered a sound that would later influence countless modern hard rock bands. Though not pristine or radio-friendly, Faith No More's intelligent, varied \\"Angel Dust\\" is essential listening.
B003UESJJC|5.0|The Movie(s)    Apocalypse Now is not a war film.  Platoon is a war film.  Paths of Glory is a war film.  The Thin Red Line is a war film.  No Apocalypse Now is a dreamscape.  It was a disastrous filming chore for all involved and little of the final product is cohesive - which is precisely why this big budget experimental film has endured.  Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece not because of anything specific.  There is nothing specific in the film to speak of.  The power of the film endures because it is so visceral and unlike anything else we expect.  The best part is, the end result came largely by accident and even a bit of insanity.  You can't ask for better ingredients when creating something profound.    Redux, on the other hand is borderline garbage.  Coppola went the George Lucas route and rejiggered the editing to make a more accurate reflection of the original script.  And that is the problem.  The original was memorable because it defies natural dramatic conventions. So much so, which is where the dreamlike quality comes from.  Where Redux tries very hard to be dreamlike with all the odd asides with the French and surfing, it comes off as a joke told too obviously.  There are some nice scenes with the Playboy bunnies, which are funny on their own, but seem really out of place and out of tone with the more nebulous theatrical cut.  The film is still beautiful looking, but I'm not a fan.     To each their own.      Theatrical version     A  Redux     C-      The Blu-Ray    Bar none, Italian Vittorio Storaro is the greatest cinematographer of all-time.  He is a master of light and every scene seethes with baroque quality light and tone.  He is a modern day Caravaggio and Apocalypse Now is his magnum visual opus.  I don't get in the war of words of his unified crop ratio most of his films has undergone lately, I really could care less .  The Blu-Ray does great justice to his perfection in most areas.  70s era wide angle lens distortions are easily visible.  Contrast and colors are powerful, if occasionally unnaturally crushed.  Detail is one area that seems to suffer.  To my eye, there has been some slight digital doctoring done with the grain patterns.  There is the occasional natural emulsion texture visible in landscapes and dark areas of the frame in tighter coverage, but unless I blame Storaro's lenses, details seem smoothed over and artificially smooth - not objectionably so, but it is every so slightly noticeable.  It isn't a fatal knockout to the Blu-Ray, but I must say I a tad disappointed.  I would need to go between the last \\"Dossier\\" DVD release to see if this encoding has come from the same master.  There are also the sporadic spots and nicks on the print, but nothing worth yelling about.  Bottom line, this is a nice release, and appropriate for a 70s era film, but not a stunner.    On the sound side, the mix is crisp and fluid.  Huey rotors pulse with authority through my subwoofer and dialog sounds natural and audible.  This is a good one to crank up as it makes efficient use of surround speakers.      Sound     A  Picture    B+
B000002LND|5.0|Say what you want about Madonna, she's not exactly an artist or personality that is easy to classify. But, few can deny the gift she has for writing great pop songs. The Immaculate Collection captures her essence as well as the fantastic pop music she brought us in such a short time span.

B000002BYD|5.0|OK, dear reader and avid consumer of all things musical, just to let you know where I'm coming from it's near impossible for me to be critical towards a band as talented as Pearl Jam.  Yield finds them at the top of their game, with drummer Jack Irons (formerly of the Red Hot Chilis) bringing out some experimental sounds to match enticing rhythms.<br />The one critique for PJ I have though is that their penchant for musical experimentation sometimes leaves the entirety of their albums somewhat incoherent with a couple of songs that just beg to be skipped over to get to the good stuff.  Those detractors are limited here in Yield, more so than any other PJ album besides the phenomenal &quot;No Code.&quot;<br />The crunchy furious, &quot;Brain of J&quot; starts off the album with a straight ahead scorcher.  &quot;Faithfull&quot; and &quot;No Way&quot; are two of PJ's best.  It makes me wonder why &quot;No Way&quot; isn't played more often in concert.  Its muted funky rhythm guitar with McCreary's hushed wailing lead is pretty near perfect.  It's PJ doing what it does best.  &quot;Given to Fly&quot; never quite reached me until I heard it live on all of PJ's Binaural Live albums.  It's passionate and a testament to the unfailing hopefulness of the human spirit.  The song just lacks a definitive chorus.  The detractor songs that push and pulls &quot;Yield&quot; from the top of the PJ stack are the clunky, annoying and repetitive chorus of &quot;Pilate.&quot;  The drummers aberrational experiment of &quot;-&quot; red dot song, which proves that you just shouldn't let drummers lead anything musical by themselves.  Let them fill in the punch in a supporting role, but don't let Irons go off by himself and just come up with something.  &quot;Push me, Pull me&quot; is pretty difficult to get through as well.  But the beautiful thing about this band is that they are willing to try new things.  Sometimes those new things are interesting, sometimes sublime, but sometimes not all together a good listen.  We close off with a Beatle-esque &quot;All Those Yesterdays&quot; with some tuba-like sounds from Ament's bass...how does he do that?  I almost forget the hidden track...a Middle Eastern jam session that belies the connection Vedder had going with Pakistani Nusrat Ali Fateh Khan at the time.  It's an experiment that works and shows that PJ is making music on their own terms, willing to try new things, and not just recording to sell records.<br />Phenomenal recording from rock's greatest band currently playing.  This is one of their CD's that would appeal to a broader audience and not just PJ fanatics, like myself.  It yields some good tunes.l together a good listen.

B00004YA66|2.0|I saw this movie when on vacation in Utah. I could not believe a talent like Dennis Quaid was wasted in a go-nowhere movie like this.<br />I have seen Dennis Quaid in several films, and I have to say the only thing watchable about this film is his performance in it. His co-star is wooden, and unbelievable. The plot was not written well enough to hold my interest, even as an action movie.<br />Go rent this before you spend the money on it.

B000002UDD|4.0|While it may not be as essential as the previously released \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\", or the later released \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", \\"So Far, So Good...So What!\\" is as important Megadeth album as the previously mentioned.  \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" may be one of the best songs that Megadeth has ever done, and it became a hit single and one of Megadeth;s most well known songs.  The cover of the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" is well done, with Dave Mustaine adding a more disdain filled growl to the song that Johnny Rotten ever could, and \\"Mary Jane\\", \\"Set the World Afire\\", and \\"Hook in Mouth\\" are very well done as well.  All in all, this is classic thrash at its' near best.
0800141660|5.0|This is a great film.  Outstanding acting, lots of suspense, and lots of humor.  The scenes of parties in England are wonderful just to watch.  The dialog is engaging, the filming is almost perfect, and the story line keeps the viewers interest from start to finish.  Well worth the money.
0743216385|4.0|Band of Brothers is much different than the other Ambrose that I have read in that it focuses mainly on one company as it jumps, fights, and drinks its way across the Western Front during WWII.  By using the numerous personal interviews that he completed for this book, Ambrose gives a pretty detailed account of E company's soldiers, NCOs, and officers.  All in all, the company is full of a highly motivated group of men who are willing to go the distance in order to achieve victory.  Personally, I enjoy books that give this kind of detailed accounts of battles and events as they happen to the common soldier, or in this case uncommon soldiers- paratrooopers.<br />Having said that, some may not enjoy this book as much if you do not have a good understading of the ETO during WWII. Ambrose assumes that the reader is familiar with most battles, so he does not go into great detail when describing the events as they happen to the men of E Company.  Instead he gives an interesting glimpse into the mind, hearts, and souls of these brave men who represented one of the finest military units that the Army put in the field during WWII.<br />Simply put, E company represents the kind men who make you proud to be an American.  They make the best of almost every bad situation, and do a tremendous job of defeating the Nazis, in spite of every obstacle (D-Day jump), every situation (Operation Market Garden), and every circumstance (Battle of the Bulge) that they face.  The training they endure is intense, and pays big dividends when they find themselves in combat all over Western Europe.  If anything, this book really reinforces the notion that hard, realistic training is vital to survival.  It teaches soldiers to deal with anything they encounter, and builds a bond in the unit that enables them to overcome all odds, and attain ultimate victory.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about WWII soldiers (especially paratroopers).  If you are not very familiar with WWII, it may help to read something else first, in order to gain maximum enjoyment from the inspirational tale of E Company, and how they helped defeat Hitler's Nazi Regime.amiliar with WWII, it may help to read something else first, in order to gain maximum enjoyment from the inspirational tale of E Company, and how they helped defeat Hitler's Nazi Regime.
B000002H33|5.0|I was first introduced to Metallica with the Black album, which is great, but this;this;this;this is the \\"Matrix\\" of heavy metal. Good go, man;how can they possibnly play this fast? Thos is pure genius from top to bottom, and even though Kirk Hammett is superb, Cliff Buton is THE MAN on this whole album,he owns at least SIX of the best guitar solos of all time! I can't decide if this or Guns N Roses Appetite For Destruction is the best rock album of the 80's but get both; NOW!!!
B000000WG4|5.0|Most people get the chills from listening to the opening tune to Tubular Bells, which was, of course, used for The Exorcist.<br />However, Part 2 is mastefully done, in which you start from light and descend into dark. The intensity increases, and becomes quite unnerving. When I first listened to Part 2 on my tape cassette, when Tattoo started singing (the name given by Oldfield to the gruff, demonic, nonsense-spewing rock star), I literally hid under the covers.<br />I hadn't realized how tense I'd gotten, or, rather, how intense the music had gotten til Oldfield finished with the startlingly incongruent Sailor's Hornpipe. I laughed, but sort of that laugh you get when you'd been through an abbatior and were subjected to a Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon.<br />It'll probably never reach that pitch for me ever again, having heard it several times, but it was quite the experience - just as unnerving and as frightening as The Exorcist was.
B00001NFCY|4.0|This is a very complex album, especially when I first heard it; first off, I'm a black man who has been into hip hop all his life, but the music is lacking the passion and fire that seperated it from all other music; now every wants to talk about how much money they have, what &quot;ice&quot; and girls they have, etc; I still love it, but rap music and pop music aren't too different these days; then I discovered THESE GUYS.I was going through a difficult time in my life, when I saw the &quot;Higher&quot; video and listened to the lyrics; they made sense and cheered me up, so I went and bought the album and was pleasently suprised, there is some great stuff on the CD,especially indiciative songs like &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;,&quot;Faceless Man&quot;,&quot;Are You Ready&quot;, and&quot; Inside Us ALL&quot; which to me is the 2nd best song next to higher. My church group sung Higher at a competition recently and we won first prize! Everyone thought I wrote the song, and I let the keep believing it1 Anyway, My Own Prison is the best Creed CD, but this is most diversely topical. Go get it!
6302787300|5.0|This film has recieved way to much undo criticism by lot's of people. I can't see why? Other than maybe, Depardieu's thick french accent in English sounding awful here &amp; there, an occasional slow moving scene, what is wrong with this movie? Nothing. The acting is top notch, the visuals are amazing, the soundtrack (lot's of people always praise just the soundtrack) is awesome, and Ridley Scott shows glimpses of his brilliance that would one day be put to use in films like, Gladiator, &amp; Black Hawk Down. The script is fantastic with structure. While Depardieu has recieved tons of heat for him being French, and his English sounding bad, he really elevates this movie with his great passionate performance (sometimes way to passionate for my tastes). Nothing is wrong with this picture, it's quite clear, and it looks good. Columbus is brought to life. What more could you ask for?
B00005JKED|5.0|The movie itself has a somehow perdictable story but the acting which is superb, lifts the story above its 'standard' plot.<br />Alonzo's intentions about Jake's 'Training Day' are not what Jake (and us) think they are at the beginning of the movie. Alonzo's original intentions seemed to be to shock him and corrupt him - he perceives Jake as innocent, and wants to have some 'fun' with him. A good example of that is what he says after the squad kills Roger - he's been plannig Jake's day for a week. That's obvious on a second watching: he made sure he'd have PCP laced weed pretty early in the day, and knows how to push Jake into smoking it - just to make sure he has something he can control Jake with if he needs to... But he hardly has to use it against Jake throughout the day: he's in total control, and knows the turf, and the 'street rules' - unlike Jake, who's new and too idealistic to unerstand them - at least at first. The 'Training Day' isn't meant to train Jake to join Alonzo's unit, but after it's over Jake has received some valuable training: how he can survive in the streets. Some of what he learns comes from Alonzo, but he manages to combine it with his own common sense - by taking the girl's wallet, he eventually manages to save his own life, even though Alonzo discourages him - after all, Alonzo's 'Street Justice' has been done. This goes against another one of Alonzo's lessons: don't show your sensitivities to the world. But by showing it in case of the girl - again, he manages to not only save his life, but to establish a connection with Smiley, which might help him later on.<br />As the day (and the movie) progresses, we see that Alonzo's attitude towards ake changes - he starts taking him seriously, until he realizes how much Jake doesn't fit in when they raid Roger's house. But he still doesn't take him seriously enough - when Jake comes by his house after survivng the poker game, Alonzo still tries to pretend that it was all a test, and having survived the experience made him get into the squad. But Alonzo hadn't realized that he'd taken it too far, just as he doesn't realize it about other events in his life - he thinks that the neighborhood's fear of him is respect, for instance. Or his son -the little boy trusts Jake after only one meeting more than Alonzo could ever hope for. And this time - Alonzo isn't able to use his charm or force as a policeman to get out of this situation...
B00003CXI1|4.0|I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan. When I first saw the movie in theaters I was very excited. The special effects were great. the actors were magnificent but movie is not that faithful to the first book. If you have not read Harry Potter you will probably give this 5 stars. It did twist some of the scenes to make the movie shorter but as a fan when I saw it I thought &quot;that's not how it happened...&quot; The music by John Williams is definitely the best. The special features on the second disc are not worth it though. If you are a Potter fan this DVD is a must have and the soundtrack too!
B000001ESP|5.0|This is Rush's best album by far.  Has many unforgettable songs such as Tom Sawyer and Limelight, as well as some of my personal favorites, such as Red Barchetta and YYZ.  This album combines what their albums before did seperately in stages.  Their first few albums were very classic rock sounding (by todays standards) and then they released some progressive rock sounding records.  This album combines those two elements to create an awesome album!
B00005JKL8|2.0|This movie was ludicrous.  There was little if no character development and the plot was just plain bad.  Wilson was acting as if he was still in Zoolander (i.e.: playing an air-headed model) and Gene Hackman did not do himself justice taking on a role in such a poor movie.  The idea behind the movie is good but the story is simply unbelievable.  The scene where Wilson runs through a minefield tripping 20 mines (\\"Bouncin'Bettys) and emerges without a scratch is the icing on the cake.  The only redeeming quality of the movie are the special effects and the musical score (hence the two stars).  Having spent 14 months in Bosnia, I was hoping for an intelligent movie or at least a semi-believable one.  I guess I will have to wait to see \\"No Man's Land\\".  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE.  If you are still intent on seeing it I will send you my DVD for free.  I don't want to taint my movie collection with this one.

This is George Lucas's First directorial job since A New Hope That's a 20 some year difference of course he's going to be a little rusty<BR>2.The dialouge isn't that great but it's not fantastic in any of the Star Wars films <BR>3.It's a get to know the charecters film.  Plus Lucas is trying to draw in a whole new generation.<BR>4.  Yes Jar-Jar does get annoying but for those of you that have seen Episode II you now know why he was created.<BR>That's it.  I'll get off my soap box, but please stop maligning Star Wars

B000007T1M|5.0|I can't stop listening to this.  The music is addictive.  They should make it illegal (Not!).
B000066C1N|5.0|I went to see this movie for one reason. Bryan Adams. Without him I don't think this movie would be near as good. The music in Spirit is some of the best I have ever heard from any movie. There's no doubt that he deserves the Oscar. However my favorite song is not &quot;Here I Am.&quot; My favorite is &quot;Brothers Under The Sun.&quot; That song is so pure and magical. Bryan has an amazing talent that I think is overlooked too often. He should have won the Academy Award a long time ago for his other movie songs. I don't see how Oscar could pass him up this time.

It clearly was ahead of it's time. The plant puppet looks better than most CGI effects in movies. I'll never be able to figure out how they made such a huge puppet's lips move so lifelike. Not only that, but this movie is filled with wonderful songs that fit the movie perfectly. I watched the movie two times in a row just to hear the songs again. All the actors are wonderful and the set is spectacular. I loved it.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is a quick and easy read. It took me a couple weeks to read, which is faster than usual for me. The Earth has been threatened twice in the recent past by \\"buggers\\", aliens from many light years away, and is preparing for a final decisive war where losing means extermination of the human species. Ever since the bugger threat materialized decades before, the I.F. (Earth's space military) has been identifying bright kids at an early age and selecting some for enrollment in an orbiting training center known as Battle School, in order to become commanders of I.F. forces. But now, with the war expected in only a few years, the I.F. is desperate to find a commander who can take the entire fleet and ensure victory with it.<br />They've found potential in Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, a genius six-year old kid who seems to have a knack at winning. Ender goes to Battle School and quickly rises to the top. In the simulator games, he and his army can overcome ridiculous odds. But is he good enough to pull the human race through to victory against the buggers?<br />The cast of characters is largely juvenile. Card does well at reminding us that children don't think of themselves as \\"kids\\". They're sentient beings just like adults, in complete control of their thoughts and actions. I dimly remember that as a youngster my priorities were different and that I was ignorant of many things, but I wasn't aware of these facts and resented being controlled by adults, including my parents (heh, some things never change). In the novel, only one or two of the kids we meet truly understand that the purpose of Battle School is to prepare for the bugger threat. To the rest, the games are only a matter of pride and they practice only to improve their team's rank. This is very much how kids think.<br />For science fiction fans a couple interesting ideas are introduced in this book, such as faster-than-light communication and a weapon of extreme destructive power that can be fired from a small ship. At the end we get a glimpse of the conflict from the buggers' viewpoint that makes you wonder if the final war was justified at all and leaves room for the sequel \\"Speaker for the Dead\\".<br />Highly recommended for all readers, but especially teens!
B00003CXI1|4.0|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (bizarrely the Philosopher has transfigured himself into a Sorcerer in the USA) is a children's movie with a difference. Thanks to the creative genius of J. K. Rowling, the judicious use of some excellent British actors, and an enormous budget, this is a film that treats its young viewers with respect. Instead of the usual schmaltzy children's fare, Harry Potter (notwithstanding a few minor aberrations) thankfully doesn't descend into the saccharine. On the contrary, it is a highly original and very entertaining trip into the hitherto infrequently visited realm of magic. <br />To the many readers of the Harry Potter series of novels, the storyline will come as no surprise and the movie is very faithful to the book. Despite prior knowledge of the plot nullifying the film's suspense somewhat, the mise-en-scene created is a veritable visual feast. The extensive use of computer animation is largely superb - the first trip across the lake to Hogwarts is awe-inspiring, Quidditch is excitingly brought to life, and the three-headed dog is certainly as scary as Rowling could have wished - although there are occasional clunky effects, such as the entrance to Diagon Alley. The makeup too is outstanding, as evidenced by the alarmingly real goblin bankers at Gringotts.<br />Despite the movie's 2 ½ hour length, it is relatively pacy as it follows Harry's discovery of the magician within himself, and his deadly duel with the greatest dark wizard of all time. Together with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione he battles mountain trolls, bewitched broomsticks, and a brutal but visually stunning game of wizard's chess. After all this excitement, the final showdown with the evil Voldemort is almost anti-climactic. Nevertheless, overall this is a spellbinding movie - in more ways than one.
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is about Lester Berman who is ignored by his wife, despised by his daughter, and is deeply unsatisfied with his job.  Here is a man, so brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Spacey, who so desperately wants to bond and fails at every turn.  His wife, done to the hilt by Annette Benning, is a perky, go-get-em real estate broker who, despite her overachieving personality, is apparently unfulfilled with her marriage and her career.  The only difference between she and Lester is that Lester doesn't hide his feelings and often offends his wife during their regular spats.  Their teenage daughter doesn't seem to care much for either parent, and gets involved with a creepy next-door-neighbor (Wes Bentley) who's being raised by his near comatose mother and tough-as-nails Marine dad.<br />Saying more would spoil it for you, but the movie is an original piece of work that snubs the conventions of modern filmmaking.  Its commentaries on dysfunctional relationships, homophobia, isolation, and stereotypes are so dead-on.  Sam Mendes directs the film with style and craft, and the screenplay is so wittily written.  The DVD is also a solid package.  There's a commentary by the director and screenwriter, as well as a brief documentary, and trailers.  Of course, they could have put more effort into adding extra features in this DVD, but the film alone is worth the price.
0805062971|2.0|Fight Club, by Chuck Palahniuk, disappoints.  Readers rarely enjoy movie adaptations over their literary counterparts, but I would be shocked to meet someone who enjoys the book more than the movie.  Fight Club is not a book.  It is a screenplay.  Palahniuk over uses commas.  The commas prohibit the reader from ever establishing a coherent flow to enjoy the book.  Nothing annoys me more than fragments and poor grammar.  <br />I had such high hopes for this book.  Fight Club, the movie ranks as one of my all time favorites.  The book disappoints on every level except on a few insightful observations of the society we live in.  However, don't expect these insights to be eye-opening revelations.  Chuck manhandles them in such a crude and shallow manner that it undermines any brutish charm it may have had.
B00005JLEX|5.0|The complete Seinfeld series on DVD would undoubtedly be the biggest selling DVD set ever. 98% of all DVD owners would buy it. Plus, countless others without a DVD player would buy one just so they could get this DVD collection. So why the wait!?!?!
B000002HH2|4.0|This, the second effort of Bjrk's solo career, finds her in what most people consider top form. The album starts off very well with the mechanic and demanding \\"Army Of Me\\", which leads to one of the best and most emotional cuts, \\"Hyper-ballad\\", which tells the tale of a woman hiding her negative feelings from her lover and, in the process, becoming violent and nearly suicidal. \\"The Modern Things\\" is a very electronic song using funny lyrics. The much hyped-about \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" is a fun song in its own right, but not a big favorite of mine. \\"Enjoy\\" is next, the highlight of which is the percussion and the brass. Following is the quiet and strange \\"You've Been Flirting Again\\". While reassuring to the subject of the song who is apparently feeling very bad about a relationship, it just has a mysterious aire about it. Another standout track is \\"Isobel\\", a fairy-tale told in a very creative and atmospheric manner. Very well done. \\"Possibly Maybe\\" is the most depressing song on the album, to be sure, detailing the different stages of a relationship and its downfall. Then we find ourselves at \\"I Miss You\\", a very beat-oriented and extremely enjoyable track concerned with fantasizing about a future soul mate. I think it's a very good combination with the previous song because it gives hope. The second-from-last \\"Cover Me\\" is short but sweet, and very experimental. Bjrk practically whispers the lyrics, as if they're a secret. At the end of it all, we can just put on our \\"Headphones\\" and enjoy the wonderfully quiet albeit sexy closer on the album, with its multi-vocals, whispers, and even shouts at the end (which don't end up very loud - the song was recorded at a lower volume than the others). While this CD certainly is the most varied Bjrk we've heard yet, everyone's got different tastes and preferences and I just enjoy some of her other work more than this. I'm one of those \\"cohesive junkies\\", I guess. In any case, this is a good display of what an extremely talentedsinger and composer can do, and probably a good introduction into her work.
B00000K19E|3.0|I liked this movie only for the idea of the matrix itself.  I don't think anything else in it is likely to ever happen.  I mean, if we created machines that could think for themselves and did not serve us, and even if they did take over humanity, don't you think they could find a better energy source than human bodies?  In the movie, the humans are in comas and they have tubes coming out of them which supposedly extract the energy that the AI machines need.  Even if they did do this, why would they need to put the humans in the matrix?  If they're in comas, what difference does it make to them whether the humans have no consciousness at all, or they believe the matrix to be real life?   Also, I think if the machines were this advanced, that they'd be able to totally eliminate any chance of resistance.  <br />But like I said, I found the concept of a matrix interesting.  The matrix is already real in the sense of the internet-- it is certainly a \\"place\\" where things happen, people \\"go\\" and communicate, etc, yet it does not physically exist anywhere.  It's all theoretical, but theoretically, an infinite amount of matrices could be created.  Each person could be on his own matrix, interacting with people that do not exist.  In the movie, the matrix was a copy of what the world used to be like, whereas meanwhile it has been utterly destroyed by the machines.    In a matrix, anything can happen.  A matrix could be used to punish criminals beyond imagination.  If you liked this movie, read \\"1984\\" and merge the two.  Scary thought, eh?  With the matrix, a dictator could gain unlimited power.  Since in a matrix, anything can literally happen, that means a dictatorship could do anything they wanted if they controlled a matrix world.  On the other hand, a utopia could just as easily be created.  The only problem is each person has their own idea of utopia but that is no problem either.  A different matrix could be made for each person, or groups of people, etc.  Also, peoplemay get into a medical condition where they can be kept alive by having machines breathe for them and pump their heart, but not fully revive them.  In this situation there are many people who would rather live in a matrix than either die or live indefinitely in a coma.  The concept of a matrix brings philosophical questions.  Is a matrix real?  If you define \\"real\\" as something you can verify with the five senses, then yes, the matrix is just as real as the \\"real world.\\"  Yet, it just doesn't seem real even though I can't think of a better definition for \\"real.\\"  It also makes striving for a better world seem pointless because this world could be essentially erased like it was in the movie, and moreover, a million matrices could be created.  So think of how insignificant you are in this world, and multiply that by a million.   The only people with any real power at all (and they would have a LOT) would be the ones who design and operate the matrices.  Although not stressed in the movie, it also calls into question free will.  Surely in a matrix our free will could be totally taken away and our every movement and thought controlled by a computer, unknown to us.  That is, if we even have free will.  A scarier thought-- what if we're in a matrix now?  How would we know?  It reminds me of \\"The Truman Show,\\" where Truman is filmed unknowingly and all his friends and neighbors are all actors in the show.  But in the matrix, control over the subjects can become absolute.  Truman eventually discovered what was going on and broke free from the set and into the real world. <br />After watching \\"Artificial Intelligence,\\" \\"Bicentenial Man\\", and \\"The Matrix,\\" I have one question for Hollywood:  \\"When will you make a movie that shows technology HELPING mankind, which is the whole point of it?\\"
1587990717|3.0|There is no question that Taleb is a brilliant man. That is clear from just reading a few pages from the book. If you don't know what concepts like &quot;stationarity,&quot; &quot;data mining,&quot; &quot;the black swan problem&quot; are, then you should read this book--they are very relevent to your investing life, and not usually discussed in the context of finance.<br />Unfortunately, Taleb's brilliance does not extend to the quality of his presentation. This book contains, simply put, the most horrendous presentation of sound ideas I have ever seen. Taleb barely introduces one topic when he jumps to the next, with no real order. Dozens of personal anecdotes seem to be entirely pointless and irrelevent to the topic at hand. If they have any relevence, at least, Taleb leaves it for the reader to find out. Worst of all, almost all of his points are simply asserted; he provides no argument for them at all. Rather, he seems to be of the opinion that they are simply self-evident, and are not in need of any supporting argument, which is simply not the case. <br />Several times in the book, Taleb comments upon how unconventional his ideas are, which is true, and which is why you should read the book, despite all I have said. (His ideas really are intriguing.) Unfortunately, he seems to be of the opinion that if you have unconventional ideas, you should also present them in an unconventional fashion. I believe the opposite is true: the more unconventional your ideas are, the more conventional your presentation of them should be, lest readers dismiss you right off the bat, as I'm sure many did, understandably. <br />This book seems to have lacked an editor. If it was editied, whoever edited it should find a different profession, because no editor worth her salt would let such a disorganized manuscript pass through her office without doing some serious foundation work on it.
B00005UW7V|3.0|In the movie, \\"Artificial Intelligence,\\" the future of technology in the world is depicted, namely with man creating a thinking being.  <br />A woman's son died in childhood, so she had his body suspended in the cryonics lab, with the hope of reviving him to life when the technology was feasible.  Meanwhile, scientists had been creating \\"mechas\\"-- robots that look and act like humans and are designed for some specific, sole reason-- some purpose to serve.  David is the first of a kind of mechas, however.  He looks exactly like a human, with real skin and hair and all outward appearances of a person.  The main advance of David is that he has the capacity to love.  He was programmed to love his mother, and the reason David was created was for him to love her, to kind of replace her lost son.  Inside, David is mechanical and robotic.  He has no internal organs, he does not eat, breathe, or sleep.  But through the movie, ask yourself whether David really is human.  <br />The moral dillema is that although David will love his mother, will she, and other humans, love him?  The humans in this society are violently opposed to the Mechas.  They even hold a \\"Flesh Fest-- A Celebration of Life\\" where they violently demolish mechas.  When David's turn comes, the crowd breaks out into riot to prevent him from being destroyed since he seems like a human to them.  People think that it is not morally wrong to neglect or harm any robot or computer, no matter how sophisticated, because it cannot feel pain.  While David can feel pain, even the earlier mechas could clearly feel emotional pain, such as rejection, although not physical pain.   <br />2000 years later, the oceans had been frozen over and all humans have vanished.  Some aliens explore the earth, amazed at finding and reviving David, simply because he once knew real humans.  Neither the aliens themselves, nor David, they say, are living beings.  It was living beings, they conclude, who are the greatest thing to exist in theuniverse.  The aliens therefore seek to allow David happiness and through a hair sample, somewhat recreate David's \\"mom\\" which he so desperately had been seeking.  They also created the illusion of the \\"blue fairy\\" which David had been seeking.  He believed that this fairy could turn a mecha into a human, a \\"real boy.\\"  When he found a statue of the blue fairy under water, he got trapped there in his vessel for 2000 years and eventually frozen into place.  After the aliens revived him, he embraced the statue, only for it to symbolically crumble.  The statue stands for a greater power that people have a need to believe in, like God.  <br />Throughout the movie, David was teased and even hated by the humans for not being \\"real.\\"  He wanted so badly to be a real life human.  But David is real.  I think the humans envied him.  The main differences between him and humans are that he doesn't need to eat, breathe, or sleep to \\"live\\" and he can never die in the way humans do.  If I had the option of not needing to eat, breathe, or sleep, and being able to live indefinitely without suffering any aging, I would take it!  Sure, David has been programmed, but haven't we all?  We all are programmed by our genes, environment, upbringing, etc.  <br />I give this movie a mediocre rating because I think it is a simplistic portrayal of the future as affected by technology.  If you want to delve deeper into the ideas that this movie attempted to explore, research the topic of Transhumanism, namely transhumanism.org.  This movie is only about one aspect of transhumanism: the creation of AI.    There's a lot more to it than that.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is simply one of the best Rush albums ever.Every release before it was  warming up to produce it, at the peak of their career, and every release since has been progressively disappointing. Moving Pictures is a very melodic, complex and powerful album. You will be amazed by its power, and the virtuosity of the excellent musicians, especially Neil Peart, playing drums that will blow you away! Every track is special and unique.  From Rush theme Tom Sawyer, to the virtuosity of the instrumental YYZ, the epic Vital signs, and the haunting Witchhunt. However I dont see Rush as many do, as a progressive band, save from Hemispheres, their most progressive release, nonetheless, they are powerful talented band, who produce complex melodic songs, and Moving Pictures is a prime example of that.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie was a little fast paced but definately worth watching over and over! The chemistry between Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman was awesome. The love story is completely believable and enjoyable to watch. If you're looking for something new to watch try this; the choreography, music, setting, and artistic effects were what made the story come alive. I highly reccomend Moulin Rouge--see it today!
B00005JL3A|4.0|Being a hard core Resident evil fan, I was dissappointed hearing about how the story was going to end up, but it was still a good movie. People who are not familiar with the game should love this movie even more, game fans like me though some will, and some wont. And there are only 3 monsters in the film, and the hunters are not. There are Zombies, Cereberus(the zombie dogs) and a licker (was in the 2nd RE game) which is supposed to be the major killing machine filling in for the tyrant, which is pretty lame really if your a fan of the RE game as well as the novel. I thought the special effects done on the licker where a little too computer fetched too, and it didnt even kill the victims right. According to the game the lickers had a certain way they killed their victims, which was by twisting the victims heads off with its tongue. Coulve been better gore effects as well, if anyone thinks this is the best zombie movie ever made, then you have only seen the original night of the living dead, or no other zombie movie. <br />The acting is good, as well as the excitement. I really cant believe Anderson didnt just read the novel, because it went by the game so well, and was made up as a story. But if he did do it that way, the film wouldve had to at least be 3 hrs. long, but it wouldve been worth it. The actors were perfect though if they still had the same characters: Milla Jovovich couldve played jill. Michelle Rodriegiez couldve played Rebecca Chambers. Eric Mabius(guy who played in the great independent film black circle boys and the crow:salvation) couldve played chris redfield, and they couldve just found other people to play Barry and Wesker. <br />They shouldve gone exaclty by the original story. Some fans of the re game say they wouldnt want to see the same thing over again, but that is something that would be great to see. The game Resident evil had a great story, while the movie was though original. If anyone reads the Resident Evil novel, I think they will bevery angry when viewing the movie of how it turned out. But I gave it 4 stars for the entertainment, the acting, and the monsters effects. However the story couldve gone by the original and the soundtrack couldve been better. Static X and slipknot do not fit this kind of film, it isnt even real music, if you disagree then learn how to play a guitar properly. Anyway the movie is worth viewing. It was good, but could've been amazing. Hey its a really good movie, and I plan on buying it, but I say this,\\"Everyone play the first Resident Evil video game from beginning to end, then read the novel.  If your not a fan of video games, then just read the book, and to people who dont like to read either, read it anyway, youll love it\\".

B00005YU1O|4.0|This is without any reservation what so ever, the most thought provoking film I have ever seen.  This rotoscoped anamated story is about a young moving through a dream and learning much along the way.  It is not (as a generalization), a film that a strictly action fan might enjoy, but because of the captivating animation and insightful dialogue.  If you liked &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; or thought that the best thing about Tarantino's movies were the dialogue, then you might really get a kick out of &quot;Waking Life.&quot;
B000005IU1|3.0|Not that proficient musically, particularly at this stage -- their debut album -- The Stooges dish out a rock-hard rock sound, call it punk, heavy metal, or whatever.  Two- to four-chord rhythm guitar overlays are complemented by Ron Asheton's leads, heavily utilizing distortion, fuzz, and wah-wah. The group's basic negative message emphasizing alienation, raw desires, and frustration is introduced in the first two tracks, \\"1969\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\\" which over time became signature tunes.  My favorites are \\"Real Cool Time,\\" in which Ron's wah-wah and distortion guitar is at its most masterful, and \\"Ann,\\" an effective love song of Iggy Stooge, who sings with raw and crude emotion within a lugubrious, perversely pretty musical backdrop.  However, one-quarter of the CD is wrecked by the awful mournful eastern dirge chant on \\"We Will Fall.\\"  Did anyone ever think of making this about two minutes long instead of more than ten?
0060254920|5.0|This was one of my favorites as a child.  Now my nieces and nephew request it regularly.  Sendak is an unbelievable illustrator.  Just to look at the drawings would be enough, but there is actually a story too.  Amazing!
B000005IU2|4.0|Fun House is more raw energy from The Stooges, and represents an advance over the first album because the sound is a bit more tight, the guitars working well together, and the group seems somewhat more proficient musically.  \\"Loose\\" is the best track, showing what The Stooges can do with all circuits fully charged, and \\"Dirt\\" is, I guess, the atmospheric number.  How about that sax in \\"Fun House\\"!  It was a good decision to make the cacophony of \\"L.A. Blues\\" the finale, in contrast to the situation with \\"We Will Fall\\" in the first album, but this is not to say the interesting distortion on \\"L.A. Blues\\" can be uttered in the same breath as that dirge debacle of the debut.
B00005ATQE|5.0|In the pantheon of great movie directors, Stanley Kubrick has always been one of my personal favorites.  Whether in political satire (DR. STRANGELOVE), epic science fiction (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), or horror (THE SHINING), Kubrick has always been his own man.  FULL METAL JACKET, his own personal take on the Vietnam conflict, like so many of his movies, must certainly rank as one of the most hotly debated movies of all times.  It is scathing and very cold-blooded, and it is for those very reasons that it is a masterpiece.<br />The film begins at the Marine Recruiting Headquarters at Parris Island, South Carolina, where young marines undergo thirteen weeks of ultra-rigorous training under the tutelage (if you can call it that) of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played by Lee Ermey in a chillingly real and extraordinarily foul-mouthed way that is nearly impossible to forget (Ermey was a Marine DI in real life).  It is Ermey's job to tear these young boys down and build them back up into the killing machines the Marines want for battle in Vietnam.  Two of the recruits, Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and Joker (Matthew Modine) show promise.  But Ermey takes special pleasure in humiliating the overweight recruit Private Pyle, played by Vincent D'Onofrio.  D'Onofrio very soon becomes the best rifleman in Ermey's platoon but the sadistic treatment he has gotten has awoken a latent madness in him, leading to Ermey's murder inside a latrine.<br />The scene shifts to Vietnam on the eve of the Tet Offensive, as Modine's Private Joker yearns to get out into the field to see the horrors of war far from the military's propoganda machine.  That machine soon breaks down when the Tet Offensive hits, when everyone realizes that, in the words of Modine's commander, \\"even Cronkite's gonna say the war is now unwinnable.\\"  Reuniting with Howard, he goes with Howard's platoon into the burned-out city of Hue, where they find themselves ambushed at the hands of a VC sniper, leading to a grim and very disturbing coda.<br />It has been argued ever since FULL METAL JACKET came out that this is in reality two films, the forty minutes at Parris Island and the seventy-six minutes in Vietnam, with the Parris Island sequence being the best.  I don't think that is quite the case.  Kubrick cagily sets us up for his view of Vietnam in the Parris Island sequence with Ermey's big talk about how the free world \\"will conquer Communism with the help of God and a few Marines\\", and how men can become dehumanized into killing machines.  Then, with the sequences involving the platoon and the sniper in Hue, we see that the stuff that our soldiers were taught about the glory of war and how it makes boys into \\"real\\" men is nothing but lies.  Kubrick explored this brilliantly in his 1957 World War I classic PATHS OF GLORY; and he has done likewise with Vietnam here in FULL METAL JACKET.<br />Aside from Kubrick, only Oliver Stone (PLATOON; BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY), Sam Peckinpah (CROSS OF IRON), and Steven Spielberg (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) have ever been able to deliver with this kind of force the harsh reality that war is Hell.  FULL METAL JACKET stands as one of the most powerful and devastating indictments against war, and can be rightly regarded as yet another great work from a great director.
B00004Y7SF|3.0|Christina has a beautiful voice and an impressive range. She has more staying power than Britney, who has a voice lacking so many things. The only problem is that Christina overdoes it by hitting high notes too many times, unnecessarily, in a single song. She just needs to tone it down and realize less is more.
B000002ACR|5.0|When you think \\"Byrds\\", you may think folk-rock Dylan covers (1965) or pedal-steel country-rock (1968), and great as those \\"Byrds\\" were, this, in 1967, was their creative peak, melodically, harmonically and lyrically. Roger McGuinn (their mainstay and creative center of gravity) is less prominent as songwriter and singer than on other albums, but his lead guitar sparkles. The songwriting skills of Chris Hillman and David Crosby flower brilliantly, and Crosby's songs form a musical preface to his work two years later on the first Crosby Stills and Nash album. <br />\\"Younger than Yesterday\\" opens with their greatest rock song ever, \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n Roll Star\\", by McGuinn and Hillman. It's a heart-pumper, with great lead and bass, and Hugh Masekela's enchanting trumpet. Hillman's \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\", \\"Time Between\\" and \\"Girl with No Name\\" are superb, the latter two setting the stage for the band's subsequent trend-setting country-rock. In many respects, though, this is Crosby's album (his last with the Byrds). \\"Renaissance Fair\\" has exceptional harmonies, and a spine-tingling intro in which one guitar follows another, then bass, then drums. \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" is another gorgeous Crosby song, and you can hear clearly that he was working towards the transcendent perfection of \\"Guinivere\\" that he would achieve on CSN. Other standout tracks include \\"Why\\", \\"It Happens Each Day\\" and \\"Lady Friend\\" all written or co-written by Crosby.  \\"Mind Gardens\\", also by Crosby, is experimental and \\"trippy\\".  Listen to it once, give him an A for effort, and then like me you may prefer to skip over it from then on.<br />This is the best album by a truly great and innovative band.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|When I first started listening to ATDI, what really caught my ear was \\"One Armed Scissor.\\" Since then I've heard the rest of the album. Some things I've noticed are: At the Drive-In's lyrics don't make any sense. Call it \\"stream of consciousness\\" if you'd like. The bottom line is that they're incoherent. However, this isn't a bad thing. Most rock bands today don't really say anything, at least ATDI doesn't try to. Instead they focus on having vocals as an instrument, rather than as a conveyance for a message. I've also noticed that ATDI has a knack for turning a hum-drum song into a good one with a killer chorus and its accompanying guitar work. <br />Here are my thoughts song by song:<BR>Arcarsenal - 9/10 - an excellent song<BR>Pattern Against User - 9/10<BR>One Armed Scissor - 8/10 - so-so made good for an excellent chorus. <BR>Sleepwalk Capsules - 9/10<BR>Invalid Litter Dept. - 3/10 - the only song I actually disliked.<BR>Mannequin Republic - 9/10 - aggressive, great chorus.<BR>Enfilade - 9/10 - starts bad, but the second half is great.<BR>Rolodex Propoganda - 5/10 - filler.<BR>Quarantined - 5/10 - more filler.<BR>Cosmonaut - 8/10 - good, but lacking that special something.<BR>Non-Zero Possibility - 7/10 - OK, but it drags on.<br />Overall, this is a good album, with its ups and downs. Much better than most new rock you'll hear on the radio, in my opinion. I'd recommend you listen to a few songs before you buy it, or you might be thinking \\"What the [heck] is this?\\", not out of dislike, but out of confusion. If you liked Rage against the Machine, and/or Sublime (as I do) then I think you'll like At The Drive In too.
B00005CDNK|5.0|I think this is ABBA's greatest album, even though it may appeal to non-ABBA fans more than it does traditional ABBA fans.  Gone are the pop tunes in place are more maturity and darkness.  Still present are the catchy rythms and the multiple and well engineered layers of music.  In some ways, it holds up incredibly well through the decades without having to associate it with the camp of their previous work. <br />This is a great album.  But don't get it expecting &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;.   It came out when there was a backlash going on against disco.  If ABBA had produced the album under a pseudonym, I believe they could have found an entirely new fan base!
B0000640VN|3.0|There is a lot to like about Kate and Leopold. It's not a great romantic comedy, but there's enough to it to provide a decent enough evening's entertainment. So light and airy that it feels almost translucent, it's a movie you probably won't remember much about a couple of years from now. <br />For the umpteenth time, Meg Ryan plays a character called Kate. This time she is Kate McKay, a brash, thirtysomething New Yorker who's an ad executive. She's recently broken up with her boyfriend, Stuart [Liv Schreiber], who lives in the apartment above her. He's some sort of renegade scientist who has discovered a time portal through which he travels back to the New York of the 1870s. While he is there snooping around, he is caught by Lord Leopold Montbatten [Hugh Jackman]. As Stuart races back to the Brooklyn Bridge, where the portal is located, Leopold pursues him, and both wind up back in present day Manhattan. <br />Leo, a scientific type himself, is utterly fascinated by the modern world. He has no reason to lie about where he is from. After all, who would believe him anyway? Kate certainly doesn't. She assumes he is just another of Stuart's fruitcake friends. At first she can't stand his old-fashioned and chivalrous ways, but gradually she begins to think that being treated like a lady has its rewards, especially when the gentleman is as attractive, witty and intelligent as Leo is. <br />High Jackman proves he is decidedly leading man material. I can think of few actors who could pull this role off as well as he does. It requires dignity and a lot of comic timing to play someone like Leopold, who the kind of character which can come off as idiotic, but Jackman avoids the pitfalls with graceful ease. Watching him, I was reminded of the young Cary Grant, who was able to act the fool and still command an audience's respect <br />Ms. Ryan's brash, no nonsense style - so charming in movies like Sleepless in Seattle and When Harry Met Sally - doesn't work here. It's as though the actress wasn't that enthusiastic about a return to romantic comedy. The character is supposed to represent the distrust and isolation that many women feel in today's fast-paced society, but this doesn't explain why Ryan plays Kate as abrasive and frequently rude. Her performance makes it hard to believe that Leo could fall in love so hard and so fast.<br />Time travel is not what Kate and Leopold is about. It's about opposites attracting. Still, it might say something about the modern world when a girl has to go back to the 19th Century to find a guy. But, then, Leo had to come to our century to find someone. So, does that mean there was something wrong with the girls back then? Will we ever get it right?
B00005JKJA|5.0|My first impression when watching the film:  I started asking myself \\"What the heck?\\" one hour into the film, and there's still no conflict, no action, no sex, nothing?  What's going on?  Then when the movie ended, I screamed \\"Huh???\\"  \\"What???\\"<br />The next phase of my epiphany came when I realized I wasn't the only one who \\"didn't get it\\".  So I went to therapy.  Just kidding.  But I did find some help.<br />I really enjoyed this movie only after reading countless reviews online, and watching the last half hour of the movie again.  It makes perfect sense to me now.  The important things to keep in mind are the main components of the story and to understand the time line.  The whole movie movie can be categorized into: the fantasy (first 2 hours), the \\"real time\\" and \\"real life\\" story,  and flashbacks in real life (interspersed scenes in the last half hour).  The \\"real time\\" story of Diane Selwyn's life is only five minutes long.  This \\"real time\\" story comprises the scenes: when she is woken up by her neighbor's knocking, lets her grab her stuff and sees the blue key (whereupon she realizes she had done something really bad), to her being haunted by the old man and woman and the fateful ending.  Once these puzzles made sense to me, I realized how wonderfully made this movie really is.  It's clever and brilliant.<br />I must admit that the movie is pretty convoluted.  Diane takes elements from her real life and constructs this incredible fantasy in her mind where she comes out on top; where she makes it in hollywood and even gets the girl ;) (<hint hint wink wink>).  Some characters in her fantasy I could find no purpose to except to further interest/entice/enrage certain characters within the fantasy.  The DVD version of the movie I watched contains a Clue Sheet with clues that'll help you unravel the mystery.  It's not very helpful unless you understand what I explained in the previous paragraph.  But once you \\"get it\\", the clues cause you to say \\"Wow!\\"<br />Ona different note, I enjoyed a song in the movie by Rebekah Del Rio called Lloranda (which means \\"crying\\" in Spanish).  The viewer will also notice that there is no scene selection on the DVD's menu.  This is intentional, along with the blurring of certain scenes and lack of other special features.  It's David Lynch's way of telling us that \\"This is my film, I can do what I want with it.  Respect that.\\"  To me, the movie IS the special feature.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 4.5 (lots of hidden references and funny remarks to us the audience)<BR>E (Erotica) - 5 (i've never given such a high rating for a movie shown in theaters, so that tells you something)<BR>A (Action) - 1 (the hitman scene in the fantasy is hilarious)<BR>P (Plot) - 5 (confusing when unexplained, but very clever when understood)<br />p.s. E-mail me if you would like to discuss more about this movie.  :)
B00005TO7C|5.0|I think it's a shame that the BT-produced tracks on this album were not included in the US release. It's definently worth the extra money to have these tracks - they are among the best of Britney's work and I think even people who don't normally like her music would enjoy these songs. BT adds a mature, techno feeling to the tracks he was involved in, and I think those songs exhibit the best of what Britney's music can be.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Plain and simple- one of the best things I've heard in a long time. Straight forward rock that is long overdue. Absolutely incredible! Buy it for your self-buy it for your Mom...it's that good. Party Hard people!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the most breathtaking movies I've ever seen. The cinematography and the actors' performances were superb (especially Jake Gyllenhaal, who ought to be nominated for an Oscar). The score was spellbinding. The intricately-woven themes resonated deeply for me -- a lost and confused youth, seeking meaning and spirituality in a world where the sane are called crazy, and ultimately discovering for himself that the force called God manifests itself in unexpected ways.<br />The special features on the DVD are a MUST - watch every deleted scene both with and without commentary. They will give you a fuller, more textured vision of the film's purpose. They also show the greater level at which Drew Barrymore's character should have interacted with Donnie; I think it's really sad that so much of the real meat of their relationship was cut out. Watch for the restaurant scene with Donnie's parents - it's short, but hysterical.<br />Go online and check out the movie's website, too: it's phenomenal. Oh, and buy the soundtrack, if for no other reason than to hear the beautiful rendition of &quot;Mad World.&quot; I guarantee you won't be able to stop humming it for days.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|Three guitars,.....reminds one of a silly band called Lynyrd Skynyrd...I hope I spelt that right. Well, they were a southern rock band...they could sound flabby, and downright redneck-y..but hey, this is Iron Maiden, we are talking about. Whatever happened to the big big muscled drum parts from Nicko, and those brain numbing basslines from Harris???? Foremost, one can hardly feel the effect of two guitars, let alone three. The song list is not to be blamed, but the production is. It's hard to imagine that this is Maiden's largest selling CD ever. The songs are good nonetheless...Out of the silent planet, and The Wicker Man are gems in their own rights, but could have put on some more muscle. A message to Kevin Shirley...Nicko plays drums...not tin cans. Don't make his drums sound like cans!!!! If the beast wants to chug along, they better get their old producer, Birch. A good come back nevertheless, could have been better
6304341849|4.0|British author E.M. Forster wrote \\"Maurice\\" in 1914. It deals with his feelings about his own homosexuality and about the oppressive and repressive society he was a part of. Not surprisingly, the novel was not published until 1971. It may not be his greatest work, but it is his most personal. <br />Merchant Ivory Productions' 1987 film version is a handsome, faithful adaptation. As is usually the case with their period movies, as well as with Forster's novels, the real focus is on the English class system. True, being gay was especially difficult in England a hundred years ago, but the class system made everything rougher for most people. Clive Durham [Ugh Grant] is the one who initiates the love affair between himself and Maurice Hall [James Wilbey], but it is Clive's aristocratic background that eventually leads him the break it off, lest his estate, his fortune and his peerage be threatened. This leaves the much more honest Maurice to deal with his loss alone, for there is absolutely no one to turn to in his sorrow. Clive, meanwhile, has dutifully married a woman he has no passion for. Not that he had much passion for Maurice either. Clive doesn't seem to like getting his hair messed up by either sex. Ironically, it is at Clive's country estate where Maurice meets the sexy, passionate gamekeeper, Alec Scudder [Rupert Graves]. But here again the class system presents a problem. Maurice may not be royalty, but he is solidly middle-class. Alec is definitely lower-class. <BR> <BR>The cast is uniformly excellent. Wilby is utterly convincing as Maurice. This may the movie in which Grant played his first true cad. Graves isn't required to do much more than be pretty and seductive, and he does both of these very well. The supporting cast is quite strong and includes Ben Kingsley, Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow and Billie Whitelaw.<br />The movie's ending befits a romantic drama. It's lovely and hopeful, but it also contradicts the class struggle theme. On the other hand,most of Forster's novels have a main character whose view of the world is shattered by someone beneath his or her station in life.<br />Many viewers, including a lot of gays, will find the movie tame and a bit dull. Our view of homosexuality has changed so dramatically in a few short decades that \\"Maurice\\" will seem unfathomable to some. Others will see it for what it is - an elegant and quietly passionate love story from a time when such love was verboten.
B000065U1N|5.0|I first saw this movie in a little town with my buddies. We had no idea what it was about and what was going to happen in it.<BR>We had a big suprise. We all came out of that movie theatre stunned and completely water eyed. My friend turned to me and asked did that really happen. I said yes. Everyone of us could not sleep that night at all. I could not believe how horrible that was for our own men to survive such a horrid place with horrible people. But I have to say that it was done very well and it was a real good war crime movie that everyone has to see to know whathappened that day our men were alone.
B000000W5H|4.0|This album deserves three and a half stars (I rounded up generously) when considered within the context of all Rolling Stones albums.  \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" for example would be five stars.  Even with a mediocre score this album is definitely a valuable underdog in the Stones catalogue since it starts off so well.  The first four songs are all excellent: \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" is a characteristic Stones song with Wyman and Richard building a nice little riff.  \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\" is a motown cover but Jagger pulls it off well- this song reminds me very much of the feeling of `Exile...' Many Stones fans dismiss \\"It's Only Rock n Roll\\" because it is so heavily played on Classic Rock stations but it really is a great song.  It has that funky groove that only the Stones can construct with guitars which rock but are also subtle.  \\"Till the Next Goodbye\\" is a great acoustic song on par with songs like \\"Winter\\" from \\"Goat's Head Soup,\\" yet is more accessible than say, \\"Wild Horses.\\" It isn't quite as dramatic and has its place.  Many reviewers here tend to love \\"Time Waits For No One\\" but I find it kind of boring, the lyrics are a bit cliched.  \\"Luxury\\" is somewhat reggae, has an interesting groove at times but is not all that interesting.  Again the lyrics are not passionate, the emotion is lacking- the song is about nothing really.  \\"Dance Little Sister\\" is pure and straightforward rock n roll but is highly repetitive.  \\"If You Really Want to Be My Friend\\" is bland and silly and after the decent song before it, sort of closes the door the album.  \\"Shorts and Curlies\\" is a fun song and quite funky.  Rounding out the album is more facetiousness with \\"Fingerprint File\\" with a hint of disco/ reggae influences, it ends stupidly.  The album starts fast with the first four tracks and then meanders and crashes.  Too much humor can kill I think, but, based on the strength of a number of select songs \\"It's Only Rock n Roll\\" is a desirable Stones album.
B00006690F|3.0|Marshall Mathers showed up unexpected in 1999 with his first taste of success, the annoying single \\"My Name Is\\". The white rapper made toes cringe, mouths drop & tempers flair as he sold millions after millions of copies. Openly bashing gays, lesbians, and numerous different races and cultural groups Eminem took the entire world by storm, selling a staggering 20 million copies in just 4 short years. He has captivated the entire music industry and countless depressed young american teens that were feeling what he was saying and looking for a way out.<br />I can honestly admitt, I hated Eminem. Though I'm not gay, jewish or a lesbian, I felt bad for these groups of people because he was making them feel terrible about their lifestyles. His lyrical content was terrible, it was all comical & fictional and he never really discussed the problems that surronded him everyday. But Eminem surprised millions, when he dropped -=The Eminem Show=- an emotionally deep and surprising release which dealt with his insecurities, family problems, life in the lime light and the demons that constantly surrond him, which makes out for his best material.<br />The Nate Dogg laced \\"Till I Colapse\\" is easily the albums best track. With Eminem dropping his clever trademark lyrics over a \\"get-up-and-dance beat\\", the song is guarrenteed to be a smash. His wordplay on \\"Without Me\\" is welcomed as well, and is another party track that easily out does his previous singles, which lacked substance and direction. But these songs are ones that you would expect on an Eminem album, its the \\"out of place\\" tracks that really allow Marshall to shine.<br />\\"Hallies Song\\" a track where Eminem flexes his singing talents is absolutely amazing. The track is so personal and Eminem really surprises me with this lyrics which are hand written beautifully. Another surprise track was \\"Cleaning out my Closet\\" where he finally confronts the issues with his mother and explains why he has reacted the way he did. He also talks about Kim without going down is imaginative psychotic path and just sticking to the facts.<br />With Britney & Christina bashing aside, Marshall Mathers has been able to step outside his role as america's most hated white bred, and speak out about the issues that have plagued his career since he first grabbed the microphone on his first album. (Considering \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" the first because the underground albums weren't nationally released.) I am proud of Eminem for doing this album, and can say that he really shut me up. The album's a surprisingly progressive step for someone from whom so little was expected.lks about Kim without going down is imaginative psychotic path and just sticking to the facts.<br />With Britney & Christina bashing aside, Marshall Mathers has been able to step outside his role as america's most hated white bred, and speak out about the issues that have plagued his career since he first grabbed the microphone on his first album.

B000065U1N|3.0|I have some questions about \\"Black Hawk Down\\", Ridley Scott's technical brilliant but oddly soulless movie. Would it have received as many glowing reviews if it had been released prior to the events of September 11 and our subsequent invasion of Afghanistan? Was the movie re-edited after these events in order to put the mission it depicts into a more favorable light? Does a war movie that skips over most of an event's historical context really teach us anything or have anything meaningful to say? <br />In 1993, US troops were sent to the African nation of Somalia on a UN peacekeeping mission. The country was torn by civil war. The UN was also engaged in a massive food distribution mission, which was being disrupted by Somalia warlords. It was decided to arrest some of them. Intelligence sources pinpointed the targets in the city of Mogadishu. Leaders of our forces concluded that we could easily to send in Black Hawk helicopters with a few dozen troops aboard, grab the wanted men, and bring them back to our base at the local airport. The mission was expected to take about and hour. Many soldiers even left behind basic supplies like canteens and night vision goggles. We may never know if misinformation, bad leadership and/or bad luck caused the disaster that followed. What is known is that Somalis shot down two of the helicopters and that the ensuing battle raged for eighteen hours. Eighteen Americans and hundreds of Somalis were killed. <br />\\"Black Hawk Down\\" concentrates on the battle itself. There are nearly two hours of nonstop carnage. Not even \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was as intense and graphic. As things go from confusing to utterly chaotic, Scott does a good job of arranging scenes so that the audience still knows what is going on. This is one of the movie's strongest points, since viewers are often confused as to what's going on in a war movie. <br />Though based on real people, the characters are written as stock Hollywood types. Consequently, we feel for their dreadful predicament, but we don't feel for them as individuals. An hour after I saw the movie, I remembered few memorable details about any of them. <br />It's understandable that many people think \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a cinematic masterpiece. A lot of intelligent, gifted people worked very hard to make it succeed. Their craftsmanship is to be admired. The movie doesn't work for me, mainly due to that lack of historical perspective. The Somalis come off as a swirling, seething, murderous mob. Indeed, they may have been. But the movie misses greatness by completely ignoring one important of question: Why? The implication is that these people were essentially subhuman and incapable of appreciating the great saviors from the West. Trust me, there is a lot more to the story than that.
B000003TAW|5.0|I'm pretty sure if you don't own this album after reading all these positive reviews...you will.  &quot;Only in Dreams&quot; (track 10) is my favorite song of all time.  So, of course, this CD is one of my favorites as well.  EVERY single song on here will get you singing and you'll know all the words in no time.  I'm not really into a whole lot of what most people consider &quot;classic&quot; albums...but to me, this will be one of them in the future.  The lyrics, the music, the solos, the harmonization.....alllll great!
B00005JKTF|1.0|Gillian Armstrong utilises her talents to the full in this truly dreadful film.  All her hallmarks, so wonderfully showcased in the appalling 'Oscar and Lucinda', are on display once again.  Characters with all the depth and complexity of shop window mannequins, are seen from all angles (thanks to cameras mounted in helicopters and on other forms of whirling apparatus) and in all manner of hackneyed situations, unveiling one earnest emotion after the next.  Mercifully, my friend and I managed to survive the film without falling victim to coincident cerebro-vascular accidents or some other fatal misfortune, because it would be regrettable to have this schmalzy garbage as one's last memory of this world.  *  The cinematography is striking, as is Ms.Cate Blanchett.  She wears a thrilling parade of French couture throughout the film, changing costume with a frequency that would make Barbara Streisand envious.  Her hair, despite wartime shortages, is also in immaculate condition and coiffure, and her make up is simply to die for.  She rides a bicycle with aplomb, and points a gun manfully.  Described early on as a most cunning linguist, she manages to speak English with a Scottish, an Australian, a fishy (or was that Vichy?) French, and quite possibly an Icelandic, accent: this feat in itself upstages the accomplishments of Meryl Streep, who needed a half dozen movies in order to employ her full complement of accents.  Billy Crudup only manages the regulation American, the botched English, and the wan French.  Still, he bests the rest of the cast, who don't bother attempting any accent at all.  *  The story's engine is love.  Kate meets a likely lad, a Royal Air Force chap in fact, one night at a soiree and ends up sharing a misty window pane with him the next morning, after a spot of wartime bedroom desperation.  He goes off to fight, and she, determined to be brave, follows.  Admirable indeed - a jolly capable young filly, what ho!  In occupied France she meets villains (boo! hissss!) and heroes (one can almost hear the Marseillaise playing in the background) and she is drawn to the latter and repels the former, God what!  You can guess the rest from here.  The music swells (as did I), the tears run (as did my friend - out of the theatre), and highly manipulative and distressingly bad cinema is the result.  Hopefully Ms.Armstrong will collaborate with Mr.Spielberg in the near future, for something unequivocally nauseating.  *  While the cost of the DVD is quite reasonable, I would willingly pay many times this amount in order to avoid seeing this film.

B0000640S2|5.0|The only reason I will go into detail about how I feel about rambo 2, is because i work at a retail store that sells dvd's and I dont feel people remeber rambo very accurately. Heres the breakdown.<br />First Blood - now this is not the prequal to rambo II and III you would expect had you seen 2 and 3 first (which they were not released in any kind of reverse order) I believe it is based on a novel (i know the uncertainty paints me as an amature on the subject but im not)its a deep moving story of a war man caught up in a bad situation, kinda of a flashback picture. Ok this movie is good, personally i dont like it enough to own.  This movie instilled in people(the more manely audience) the question, why arent we watching a war shoot-em-up movie. We have this character that we hear is a fighting machine, he was awesome in the vietam war, but we dont get to see it. So whats the answer make a bad war movie sequal. But what they forgot to do was make it bad, it turned out great!<br />Rambo: First Blood Part II<BR>     Notice the name change, new movie, a novel movie sequal, always a bad idea, doomed to fail, but somehow a great emotinal script was written, very well directed, alot of people love the vietnam war angle the whole, do we get to when this time thing, but i was only 3 when it was made, and i knew nothing of the war, and i still no nothing, I just love the action.  What makes a sequal bad: simple really once you know you see it everywhere, i suppose you have to start with what makes the first one good: well you have the whole buildup of what the characters can do, how the plot may twist, and all the little things you learn along the way, the exposition if you will, now in the sequal you always know everything already, there is no plot buildup, though you may wish for more action during the original(whatever movie) you get too much in the sequal often and thats the problem, this movie starts from the begging, it doesnt just throw him in the jungle killing people<br />Rambo III<br />    I thought it was really bad, i admit i havent watched it much but its like rambo cares about other nations and he is not all red white and blue. Its just a sequal to a good action movie, notice the full title change, no more first blood, just rambo, its lacks good plot buildup, acting a record low, people that recklessly buy a rambo movie, i believe ment to buy the 2nd one, and just didnt know the facts. Basically rambo is at home in the jungle so in the movie where he has that chance in the best one
B00005LK94|5.0|Honest, simple and marvellous directing. All acting even geeses ;-) are very down to earth, cinematography is marvellous, every shot and music is wonderful. Also, it is a movie with great moral about what really matters at the end.    I am a movie fan and not the easy one, believe me this movie is one of my 100 best movies all the time with others such as Sling Blade, Leolo, Space Odysee 2001, Blade Runner, Shawshank Redemption, Innocence, African Queen, Amarcord ........
6304712936|5.0|This is truly a great movie. It is my understanding that the directors cut that recently appeared in theaters is a considerable improvement over the original theatrical release. The current DVD is satisfactory, but a directors cut DVD would be worth waiting for [if it is in production].                    Update February 2007:  The Directors cut DVD now available is well produced and a substantial improvement over the first release DVD.
B000065U1N|5.0|After reading the book and watching a documentary with interviews of the guys who were there, Im thinking they put a little too much hollywood BS in despite their claims of &quot;making this film as accurate as possible&quot; Wish I could hear what the guys who were there thought about the movie, God bless all of them.
B00000HZFP|5.0|I just got this CD less than a week ago and I must have listened to it twenty times since then. Seriously, I think I listened to it four times in one day! It is the story of a German rockstar, Hansel, who in an attempt to become Hedwig and marry an American marine, gets a sex-change operation. Unfortunately, all does not go as planned, and he is left with an \\"angry inch\\". Now, she is touring the United States with her band, \\"The Angry Inch\\", telling her story, which stems from the \\"Origin of Love\\" itself.<br />The CD, which I read is based on the riffs of rock legend David Bowie, is superb! Any doubts John Cameron Mitchell had about putting on some makeup and a blonde wig, should be blown out of the water. He is incredible! He carries the show! I was also quite impressed with the instrumentals, and even more so, the lyrics. This play doesn't just rely on the shock value of having a transsexual main character. Instead, it deals with universal issues that we all struggle with, such as finding a soulmate, and overcoming adversity. Stellar tracks on this album include:<br />1. Tear Me Down: Hedwig is here whether we like it or not. Great music and a compelling commencement.<br />2. The Origin of Love: Hedwig's retelling of \\"Symposium\\". Just see if you don't feeling crying after hearing this one.<br />3. Random Number Generation: A bonus track. A pretty unique beat.<br />4. Sugar Daddy: Has kind of a bluegrass beat. Different tune from the rest of the album, but it grew on me.<br />5. Angry Inch: \\"Six inches forward and five inches back...\\"<br />6. Wig in a Box: Hedwig turns his tricks as Farrah Fawcett, Beehive Queen, and Punk Rocker.<br />7. Wicked Little Town: Another sad one, but seems kind of hopeful, too. Nice piano playing at the beginning.<br />8. Long Grift: Hedwig laments feeling gypped and betrayed.<br />10. Exquisite Corpse: Totally chaotic and hard-rock.<br />12. Midnight Radio: Dedicated to all the rockers on the radio. \\"Lift up your hands\\" for this finale!<br />In other words, pretty much all of the songs are stellar. My only problem with this CD has nothing to do with the music itself. It is that no synopsis comes in the packet of lyrics, so I get confused about what is going on throughout the play (except of course in \\"Angry Inch\\") and even how it ends. Other than that, this has to be one of the most original musicals ever to be staged. I can only hope that the recent movie has done it justice!
0788812807|5.0|I have often heard it said that food can be romantic, in which case &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; has the most romantic food scene in the history of the cinema.  In fact, it is hard to think of many scenes more romantic than that one.  Add to that one of the most mismatched couples in the history of romance: she's a sheltered Cocker Spaniel from high society and he's a mutt literally from the wrong side of the tracks.  Actually the kids will be caught up in the adventure and it is the adults who will feel the tug on their heartstrings.  Barbara Luddy does the voice for Lady while Tramp is voiced by Larry Roberts; it was the only movie he ever &quot;did,&quot; but Luddy went on to do the voice of Kanga in Winnie-the-Pooh films.  Still, it is Peggy Lee who does all the canine vocal scene stealing in this Disney film (&quot;He's a Tramp).<br />Most romantic line(s): The line of spaghetti between Lady and the Tramp, of course.<br />Three Tear-Jerking Scenes: (1) the romantic dinner; (2) the rat attack; and (3) the heroic effort of Rusty.<br />If you like &quot;Lady and the Tramp,&quot; then check out these other films on AFI's list: #34 &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; #53 &quot;A Place in the Sun,&quot; and #17 &quot;Moonstruck.&quot;  Why?  Well, it depends on if you like animated films, a guy from the wrong side of the tracks trying to reach for the moon, or Italian singing and pasta.
