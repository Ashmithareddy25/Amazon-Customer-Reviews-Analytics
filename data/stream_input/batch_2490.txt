B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Oh Boy !!!, and I thought the first movie was good. This one is supperb. I hope this movie will be the key stone for a TV series to follow with the same movie stars. I am glad to live in a time when movies like this can be produced. Mr. Abrahams is nothing less than a prodigy to create this piece of Art. I am sure it will get several awards.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I have to admit that this story has been one of my favorites since before I was even a teenager! I love all of Fannie Flaggs stories and their awesome characters. I enjoy scary creepy stuff but I will always love Fannie's Southern stories they are the best and I will always recommend them. Thank you Fannie Flagg and I love you!!!!
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|There's nothing really new to be said here. We got the Free App of the day then they took away half the levels when we updated.  Its very frustrating. I think Amazon should do something about it...it makes me not trust their opinions as much. I've bought a lot of things based on the free app recommendations...but I will not give this company any more money unfortunately.<br />Like a couple people have also said, it occasionally quits before getting past the main screens which is also frustrating.<br />It gets a star because I do enjoy the game so far...I just wish I could keep playing...
B001G8XON0|5.0|I love this movie and the blu- ray made it better. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes musicals.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far this game is amazing and very easy to figure out. Just find the items in the room that the missions tell you
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I really loved this app it makes u work on your work easier but it can be some times difficault
0316228532|1.0|I read all the Harry Potter books and had really high hopes for this one. I read maybe about 150 pages and had to put it down. First book in years that I couldn't finish.<br /><br />Too many characters, very confusing and just over all bad writing. Complete waste of time.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|So I'm trying to download this app but it quits as soon as it starts. I'm guessing I don't have enough memory on my kindle fire but I don't really have much of anything on here. it says in the info that it needs nearly 2gb because of the high quality but I don't even have that in application space with nothing on here at all. What should I do???
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|Not only slowed my phone down, it prevented me from connecting to the internet to play my games.  It also shut my phone off twice.  I had to uninstall it and clear the cache to correct the problem!

B00BSBY38A|5.0|Cinematography was excellent. It follows the book very well, It's a spiritual journey. Watch it! You know you are going to love it.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha Faltskog, the beautiful blonde songstress and one of the A's in ABBA, has returned (hopefully, not for the last time) with a fine recording of songs of love lost and nostalgia. Many will call these songs Euro-pop ballads, adult contemporary, torch songs, bland... I prefer to just call them nice song sung beautifully by one of pop's most enduring singers. Yes,  Agnetha is now over 60, but I have to agree with the many reviewers that have commented on her still youthful sounding voice. It hasn't aged at all. Her tone, still crystalline and pure. She has not lost her range and fluidity since she manages to constantly switch from her chest voice to her mixed or head voices quite effortlessly. Her vocal timbre remains lovely and as stated before, rather youthful. This does not mean that her voice has not changed, or that Faltskog, hasn't changed her technique. I noticed, her vocals have become more mellow, tender and a bit more pleading which enhances the mood of some of the slower tempo pieces.<br /><br />The standout tracks are many and one of my favourites is the opening song - \\"The One Who Loves You Now\\". It is a beautiful ballad with an infectious chorus and Faltskog's vocals are rich and sublime. Her voice here gives us a reminder of her earlier works when singing those many ballads in ABBA and the song is a great opening track. Definitely A+ material.<br /><br />Another highlight is the irresistibly catchy \\"Perfume in the Breeze\\". Again, Faltskog's voice is the star as it sounds rich and enchanting in the chorus and the song has some charming embellishments.  The song that follows, \\"I Was a Flower\\" is the complete opposite in tone and has become another personal favourite. Starting off with just Faltskog's sorrowful vocals and a piano, the song is epic in that it captures an ailing woman at her most vulnerable. Her voice exudes loneliness and regret and only once, at the song's climax, does she slightly raise her pitch. After repeated listening, not only did the tune grow on me, I fell in love with Faltskog's voice all over again and her performance here is riveting.<br /><br />Other highlights includes the most famous song on the record - \\"When You Really Loved Someone\\" which is very popular with her fans on Youtube (over a million views), the slow paced \\"Bubble\\", and just like \\"Flower\\", this song took some time to grow on me. Agnetha herself has stated in an interview that this is her favourite song. It is catchy, it is poignant, and with Faltskog's voice singing it, it's fantastic.  This song has the added charm of Agnetha singing some fine \\"La-la-la's\\" and just like her echoed wailings during the opening of ABBA's \\"One of Us\\" or those catchy \\"Na-na-na's\\" from the still unreleased gem \\"Just Like That - Nana version\\" which was on Youtube for years until recently, those la-la-la's are pure ear candy. For those who want something more up-tempo, the Disco track \\"Dance Your Pain Away\\",  is shimmering and energetic and how I love the perfectly delivered \\"Da-Da-Da-Dance...!\\".  The Gary Barlow duet \\"I Should Have Followed You Home\\" is becoming a fan favourite and although I am not too familiar with Barlow or his work, I admit the blending of their voices is successful. The upbeat ditty \\"Back on Your Radio\\" - has it charms and a lovely chorus and Agnetha's own \\"I Keep Them on Floor Beside My Bed\\" is very nostalgic and resets the mood, for the last time, to more depressing grounds as Agnetha sings about love lost.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a terrific album. Admittedly I have been an Agnetha and ABBA fan for decades now but I also know quality work when I hear it. At 63 and already having conquered the world charts with ABBA, Agnetha is not returning to break new grounds and gain international fame and attention. Those who have criticized her for giving us more of the same, well, I guess this is not the album for you. When I heard that she was going to make a come-back in late 2012, I was not expecting Agnetha to dust off and put on her old cat-suit, 5-inch platforms and blue eye shadow and release some quirky, electro-pop music video in a vain attempt to relive her youth. Since she has always been a reluctant star, and with the release of an age appropriate cd of 60's covers 9 years ago (which I loved BTW), I pretty much knew what type of material Agnetha was going to release and this album was just what I expected. Now after listening to it, first on YouTube (many of the recordings are low quality so listen with caution) and now the CD, I am thrilled she has returned and is singing once more. I am praying this is not her last release since a voice like hers should not remain silent for long. Her crystalline tone and emotionally charged vocal performances were missed and in this day and age, she is a welcome change from the excesses of Gaga, Beyonce, Rihanna etc.<br /><br />\\"A\\" gets a solid A+ust off and put on her old cat-suit, 5-inch platforms and blue eye shadow and release some quirky, electro-pop music video in a vain attempt to relive her youth.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great graphics make this game a pleasure. Though not familiar with non-PC shooters easy play mode was good for a new player like me. Controls seem logical.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|This was a gift to a person who is a big TV Castle fan. They thought it was well written and as interesting as any other mystery novel with characters they knew.
B005V20JKI|4.0|This game is great but I want all the world's. Wish it was like that. And I'm afraid I won't get to unlock all the characters. Please  because u have to buy the world's. Don't want to do that for two dollars. Please.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|What a great app!  No more paper &#34;to do&#34; lists everywhere.  Using the colors makes it fun, and I love getting reminders in the notification bar. You can have many lists going at the same time!  This app deserves 10 stars!!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I first learned of Rodriguez while visiting New Zealand in March, 2013 and hearing him interviewed on a radio station there.  When I returned to the States, I bought this album.  It's a marvelous work.  With lyrics, song structure, and instrumentation, Cold Fact takes some twists and turns that are unexpected and, yet, seem to fit Rodriguez and his music perfectly.  Moving and melodic.  Now a favorite album of mine, 40+ years after it was released.  Life is strange.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely smitten! This book had all the ingredients of a delicious story. I loved Ms. Chase's sense of humor and found myself giggling out loud several times. What a great debut. I look forward to hearing more from Emma Chase in the future.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This game is great at testing your reflexes and planning skills. Nice graphics and sounds, addictive.<br />It is not about how to cook :-).
0060523794|4.0|this is a must read for a better understanding of how IBM made it out of the crisis in the late 80's.
B0018BB20W|5.0|This album is as classic as it gets!  The blend of music is so beautiful, that it draws out moods, inspirations, and feelings that no other album can!  Not my favorite Moody Blues album, but I love it just the same!
B0012GMYRS|4.0|the cd is good and the music is awesome........ thinking of learning french after listening to this cd, and will surely do.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|Even with their sub par &#34;Waiting for the Sun&#34; and okay &#34;Soft Parade&#34; albums, The Doors totally reinvented themselves with &#34;Morrison Hotel&#34; and &#34;L.A. Woman&#34;.  It's a total waste, having Jim Morrison die at such an awesome time of the band.  I believe they had the power to change the face of music forever!  They were totally awesome in that psychedelic to progressive rock stage, and had strong potential to be the leaders.
B008US25FW|4.0|the cd is good and the music is awesome........ thinking of learning french after listening to this cd, and will surely do.
B006NXI58M|5.0|Epic book. I like a lot. It was funny sad and weird all at the same time. I can't wait to read the next book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game!!!! It is nice that it requires you to interact with the training and competitions.  I do wish there was a way to earn energy faster, but otherwise it's a great game for kids or adults.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I am a huge Columbo fan!! I've missed seeing the mystery episodes just to keep us reminded of the great work. I was browsing my Amazon wish list and there it was Colombo the Complete Series for $ little of nothing. My husband and I are extremely impressed wih the quality, clarify and The Complete Series. Thank you so much for this great item at a really good price and as usual Amazon is a great E-tailer
B0072GPPNC|5.0|The movie is great and the video package has everything you need to enjoy the movie. I recommend getting the video from Amazon.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|does exactly what I need it to do and pleasant appeance as well. very impressed with the overall product and behavior of it.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|this game is fun. one of my favorites. BUT... it is only free for a few levels then you have to purchase the upgrade to continue. if I wanted to pay for it I would have. uninstalling.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzles and storyline. Love the whole concept. Awesome graphics too. I want to go into more depth about what I liked, but I don't want to give anything away. Just try it! I hope they come up with a sequel.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book then is the story of &#34;why something, something like the tail end of a sad dream&#34; may sweep the human heart. Life is full of choices &#34;either you tore free or you stayed and withstood its rigor even as it squeezed you into something smaller than yourself.&#34; In his beautiful prose, Hosseini croons the stories of losses and re-discoveries in the decades of this Afghan family's lives. Starting with the folk story at the start of the book, Hosseini peers deep into the souls of parents and children struggling to find their best selves.<br /><br />The div is a fearsome creature that once a year knocks on the roof of one house in the wretchedly poor village. He claims one child chosen willingly, or all the children of the house. Only Baba Ayub follows the beast to claim his child, only to find she is granted a life of beauty and safety, happy under a spell of forgetting. Hana's choice resonates through the rest of the book. First we meet Pari and Abdullah, loving siblings. Each is the mirror to the other. Abdullah, especially since the death of their mother, has always protected her. Their parting starts the resonance of the travels throughout the rest of the book.<br /><br />Several threads of family love weave through this book suffice it to say that we see the &#34;the path behind our characters littered with all the shiny little pieces that life has ripped from him.&#34; Yet this path has great beauty, and sometimes light the way to a more complete life This is a lovely book, and it is one to savor. I was going to go to sleep but I just may read it again.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I happened upon this series by chance and am so happy I did! i didn't see this series when it was first aired on television but after watching the first and then second seasons on Amazon Prime I am so addicted! A great Scifi series which is hard to find nowadays. Watch this series and you won't be disappointed!
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I thought this would be great, the book itself was a fast read but I felt the story was lacking...I have no desire to see the movie.
B0063FGG22|5.0|This movie was very interesting and engaging.  The quality was also very good.  The price is better than simply renting.  If you haven't seen this movie then I would suggest it to everyone even if you don't really like older movies.  Not slow at all but rather very engaging.
B008469DGY|4.0|I love this game.  I was instantly addicted and it's really easy to get the hang of.  How is it that I haven't come across this before?!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I don't often read biographies but I had heard this one was worth reading. It was really insightful and now has me often thinking about and analyzing the personalities of the people I work with. It's amazing and inspiring what Steve Jobs and Apple were able to accomplish. And how fitting that I read the book on my iPad. Thank you Steve Jobs!
B0055SWM08|5.0|When you've played what seems like every kind of mind game, was surprised to find one that keeps my<br />attention as long as this one does. Very pleased!
B002QYNIHU|4.0|but its too poseable like the part is to loose but other then that not bad tho its all good
B009RH9FR6|5.0|All I can say is......perfect! I've looked around & this is the BEST one that I've seen! Sturdy case, the Kindle can rotate vertical or horizontal & stays put! Doesn't cover any of the outlets & perfect opening for the speakers. Stop wasting your time shopping around....you won't find the perfect one....but for the price & quality of this Marware......this is pretty close to awesome. You will be happy with it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to the series. Better than i expected it to be. Fascinating job in hooking the reader!! Loved it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great!!! Thanks a lot for giving us the opportunity to read for free a best seller I enjoyed the movie but after watching it I felt ansious about reading the book :) and I liked it a lot!!<br />Suzanne Collins writes with such a passion that makes us feel inspired and also makes us think about the future and human actions.<br />If you enjoy reading adventure stories or science fiction you would like it but it would be unfair not to mention the romance and values that are inside this amazing book.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Probably one of the best, or THE BEST movie I have ever seen in my whole life! Just incredible! Loved it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I used a different app and it only worked part of the time. I have had no problems with this app. Works great and I picked a totally annoying buzz so that I can't crawl back under the covers!
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Kept me glued to the seat. Great mix of action with occasional comic relief. Well developed characters and plot line.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love having my weather report right there on my kindle...as a teacher, I can check the weather and plan activities accordingly. Very handy
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Okay, so I must start out by saying I had some things that bothered me, the author started the book, got me emotionally attached to a character, and then, Bam, that's not the protagonist...<br /><br />So, I read a bit about how this series came to life, and I see now that this was not the authors original intention, so forgiveness is due, although, I'd say this:  A complete re-work into a commercial novel, that starts with the actual protagonist, and has some other stuff fixed, could end up being something similar to the Hunger Games, and a movie too.<br /><br />But, that's beside the point, just an observation.  I was talking (well, not actually talking, exchanging messages online) with someone about zombie books and dystopian stories and she mentioned Wool.  Now, another problem, the title, I bought this 6 months ago, but only read it last week, the title was misleading and stupid me, I thought \\"omnibus\\" meant something about the story, not that it was a compilation, duh.  That resolved, I took my friends advice and tried it, I was hooked right away.<br /><br />So, if you're into dystopian stories, and a bit of rebellion stuff, Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Hunger Games, The Road, etc., you'll enjoy this book.  The characters are likeable, the storyline is credible entertaining (side note, some of the technical stuff is, well, not possible, but Michael Crichton and others have gotten away with this stuff, so I won't complain too much, but it was a minor drawback).<br /><br />I recommend this series, it's good, and I really enjoyed reading it.
B000002GYR|5.0|have always been a tom waits fan; i'm actually replacing vinyl with this purchase.  he's a poet, a great writer, and his delivery is so well done.  again, i'm still replacing vinyl, and i'm hoping to replace all of my tom waits--his catalogue has gotten far bigger, so it will be a task.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|The Four Agreements is so simple that many of us don`t get it.  We want to live from a place of love.  I believe this book gives a foundation of how to step out and live from a place of love.  As the author said, \\"it`s a choice.
B000002GYG|1.0|one of my favorite tom waits cds.  i'm replacing vinyl, and I was most excited to finally get going with tom waits.  this is one of my favorites of his work.  have played it quite a bit since receiving it.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I said it all: boring and extremely predictable. I can not find a good reason these two actors will agree to make a movie like this.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|I liked it, but there was something missing, and i'm not exactly sure what it was that was missing.  did I expect more scandal?  no.  i'm not sure exactly what I was looking for, but even tho I liked the movie, it was a slight disappointment.  the problem is I cant explain why.
B00280LYIM|5.0|No flaws, but the most heart-wrenching part was when Pan (nature god) passed. Cried for hours. Love it. On the EDGE OF MY SEAT! I recommend this book to people who don't like reading. Trust me, before I started reading Percy Jackson, I HATED reading! Now, I love it!!
B00C061I3K|4.0|This is an album that has garnered praise and much criticism. Check out the five star reviews and 1 star reviews. Some people hate it for the sake of hating; some people have a real argument. Some people love it and think it is a classic. RAM is a polarizing album but has people talking about music again. Daft Punk is known for changing course, did people seriously expect them to do the same thing every album? Here Daft Punk traveled in a time machine and went back to the 70s and created a retro album. I can hear Fleetwood Mac in `Fragments of Time'.  `Lose Your Self To Dance', `Get Lucky' are disco club bangers. But there is modernism in it...Daft Punk enlisted Julian Casablancas for `Instant Crush' and Lennox of Panda Bear fame delivers on `Doin It Right'. The album closes on an epic vintage Daft Punk voyage in the form of song 'Contact'. This album is a exploration in music that requires many listens. It is a epic journey and sounds perfectly mixed and I can not wait to experience it live. Love it or hate, Daft Punk does not care, this is their ultimate ode to music.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it its super fun super cool and super addictive. I cant bilieve that it is on android now I have been waiting so long
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it. Romantic, humourous, timeless. Exceptional acting! I'm so glad to have it on DVD!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|We are only part way through the first season and look forward to many more viewings of Columbo. It has been many years since we first saw Columbo; but, it has brought back to us the feeling of what a top notch TV series should be.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I had some laughs, and it took up some time so I wasn't completely disappointed but for me the high point was the comedy stuff and no so much the main plot I know that sounds odd. It was a fair enough movie with a good enough character progression though it was not as funny as I thought it was going to be. Meaning I would have liked more haha and less \\"romantic pursuit\\"  as it where.
B008JEJNCK|5.0|I stand on my feet all day, but not walking around.  I also have arthritis in my feet and have to have a comfortably cushioned shoe.  This clog is the most comfortable and cushiony shoe I have ever worn.  Thank you, Amazon, for providing this. I did select a smaller size (I have a 1/2 size foot) and it was perfect for me.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This movie shows how it used to be before it was 'correct' to allow Blacks into our lives.  If a Black man looked at a woman he was a dead man.  Everyone should watch this movie.
1451613512|5.0|Best historical read in years ... unfortunately it divulges the corruption and self-interest of politicians and those in power. Excellent referencing.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I had anticipated the scenes that were omitted from the original film, which disappointed me because of the revocations. This is my favorite book of the series, and I simply enjoy Kristen's portrayal of Bella in this portion of the saga. She did amazing and was passionate about the role. I thoroughly enjoyed the Breaking Dawn DVDs.
1401937519|5.0|This book is one of the most inspiring stories I have read.  As a Life and Personal Development coach, I found that the story and experience Anita had are extraordinary lessons to anyone living a life of fear or living in lack of love.<br />I highly recommend and challenge everyone to read regardless of age, gender, or culture.  It teaches a way of life that we all want but don't dare...and it's time we all dare!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great to help you fall asleep to take noisy thoughts away. Stills the mind and helps get great sleep, a good routine to listen to at night.
159463176X|5.0|'A story is like a moving train: no matter where you hop onboard, you are bound to reach your destination sooner or later.'<br /><br />Within the first few pages of this book, the reader knows s/he's in the hands of a master storyteller. In a village in rural Afghanistan, mid 1940s, a father tells a folk tale to his two young children. On the next day, they will travel to Kabul and start a chain of events that will take the reader on a journey across the world and through the decades.<br /><br />The novel is made up of a series of linked and interlinked stories about members of this one family, their descendants and people whose lives they touch. Hosseini takes us back and forwards in time but each episode tells a whole story of one of the characters. This made the book feel in some ways like a collection of short stories rather than a novel, but Hosseini brings us round in a perfect circle and the last few chapters bring all these disparate episodes into one immensely moving whole.<br /><br />The beauty of the writing is only matched by the humanity of the characters. Hosseini takes us inside their minds and their hearts and we see them laid bare, essentially good people but with their flaws and weaknesses exposed, to us and to themselves. Although much of the book takes place in Europe and America, Afghanistan remains at the heart of it because it remains in the hearts of the characters, even though they may have become part of the war- and poverty-driven diaspora.<br /><br />A beautiful and very moving book that brought me to tears on several occasions, this isn't fundamentally about politics or war; it is about the unforgettable people who populate its pages - about humanity. And though there is sadness and sorrow here, there is also love and joy and a deep sense of hope. Highly recommended.<br /><br />NB This book was provided for review by Amazon Vine UK.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I got these in addition to the big castle decal and I love them. They're really cute and girlified my daughters room
B00CRW2066|5.0|The National is in the middle of a hot streak.  Don't get me wrong, all of their albums are worth a listen if you enjoy contemporary alternative rock (or whatever they call it these days), but their three album run of Alligator, Boxer, and High Violet have been some of the best albums released in their respective years.  So when I realized that The National's new album, Trouble Will Find Me, was nearing its release date I wasn't exactly hyped or ecstatic.  After all, music from their past records is still just as good years later as it was when I first heard it - additionally, I felt confident that the band would put out another great record.  I was never worried that The National would put out a bad album or even a mediocre one.<br /><br />Everything that made Boxer and High Violet great are back: the atmospheric swells, Berninger's mournful croon, the nearly rhythmic and propulsive percussion, the melancholy and personal lyrics.  By and large, if you've enjoyed the past work of The National, you're sure to enjoy Trouble Will Find Me.  The album is a slow burner - perhaps even slower than High Violet.  It's not inaccessible by any means, but many of the songs' twists and turns, many of the lyrics' confessional turns of phrase, become more salient with repeated listens.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"I Should Live in Salt\\" bears more than a striking resemblance to High Violent's opener \\"Terrible Love.\\"  The song begins in skeletal form: an acoustic guitar, Berninger's voice, and a few slight synthesizers.  The phrase \\"you should know me better than that\\" is repeated throughout the verse (much like the title phrase of \\"Terrible Love\\"), and the song slowly builds to what feels like an anthem.  \\"Sea of Love\\" - the band's first video in support of Trouble Will Find Me - starts with rapid snare taps that make the song feel on the verge of an enormous crescendo.  \\"Sea of Love\\" follows a few different changes of tempo and sound, and it contains the album's namesake lyric - it's sure to be one of the album's most prominent tracks.<br /><br />My only real complaint with Trouble Will Find Me is that the band doesn't really expand its musical palette from previous records.  Tonally, it sounds a lot like High Violet, and most of these songs would have fit perfectly in place with that record.  Maybe it's for this reason why I wasn't hyper-ecstatic about the album's release - it feels too comfortable.  It feels like a warm sweater that I've worn for years now.  I don't mean to suggest that the band needs to run out and experiment with electronica, but the band's sound is by now very familiar.<br /><br />Fans of The National owe it to themselves to check out Trouble Will Find Me.  It's a great album that only further extends this band's fantastic catalog.  If you've never listened to The National before, this record is a good one to start with, but I might recommend Boxer over it for beginners.  I'd recommend this band to fans of Arcade Fire, Grizzly Bear, or Iron & Wine - while The National don't sound exactly like these bands all the time, they share many sensibilities of songwriting.  Listeners who have never been convinced of The National's merit probably won't find reason to change their minds here - Trouble Will Find Me is made of the same exact ingredients that endeared them to so many people in the past.  Trouble Will Find Me is a great record sure to be on many Best Of 2013 lists.<br /><br />Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"I Should Live in Salt,\\" \\"Sea of Love,\\" and \\"Don't Swallow the Cap.\\"c - it's sure to be one of the album's most prominent tracks.<br /><br />My only real complaint with Trouble Will Find Me is that the band doesn't really expand its musical palette from previous records.

If you've never listened to The National before, this record is a good one to start with, but I might recommend Boxer over it for beginners.  I'd recommend this band to fans of Arcade Fire, Grizzly Bear, or Iron & Wine - while The National don't sound exactly like these bands all the time, they share many sensibilities of songwriting.  Listeners who have never been convinced of The National's merit probably won't find reason to change their minds here - Trouble Will Find Me is made of the same exact ingredients that endeared them to so many people in the past.  Trouble Will Find Me is a great record sure to be on many Best Of 2013 lists.<br /><br />Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"I Should Live in Salt,\\" \\"Sea of Love,\\" and \\"Don't Swallow the Cap.\\"
B00A81MV3U|4.0|This show is about a man(BRADLEY COOPER) who struggles with certain mental problems such as depression ,anger, and more finds his way back into the world by meeting another person(JENNIFER LAWRENCE) with problems of her own. This show is much more than a romance. It is funny, sentimental, and has plenty of drama. It really gets into the lives of people who suffer with mental problems and how letting someone in your life can change everything for you for the better.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Is there an alternative rock group that can make music more elegantly beautiful than The National? If so, it is probably recording on another planet. The National has produced in \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" another dense collection of melancholy songs that demand to be savored, not gulped, like a neat glass of peaty Scotch whisky.<br /><br />The themes of the songs in \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" are consistent with other albums from The National, all asking for, but not demanding, thought and introspection from its listeners.  The songs include a study in miscommunications between a couple who really should know each other better and in emotional clumsiness that leaves one lying face down on the ground. We also are introduced to a person with a shell so impenetrable that she cannot be burned and to another whose own identity shrinks because of intense longing for another.<br /><br />Musically \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" is a worthy complement to \\"High Violet.\\" It is different but recognizable at the same time. There are distant, pleasant hints of U2 and Sting in the music, but the sound remains distinctly and addictively that of The National.<br /><br />I appreciated too the inclusion of the lyrics and nifty works of art for each song as part of the packaging. \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" is as strong, if not better, as two of my favorites from The National, \\"High Violet\\" and \\"Boxer.\\"<br /><br />Make my \\"Trouble\\" a double: I want to savor everything about this album.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is a extremely addicting and fun game! Those of you that have not played it yet, I recommend that you play it, especially if you are a RPG player like me.
B005I6EU48|5.0|This case is even more beautiful than the pictures show. Every single person that has seen this cover has gasped and told me how amazing it looks. And it does! Everything seems to be of very high quality.<br /><br />I like to fold my cases back while reading, and it's obvious that this case was made with that in mind. I don't feel like I'm forcing or bending the case in any way.<br /><br />For the comments that say it doesn't close completely, that's true. But after only a few days in my purse it now completely closes against the surface of my Kindle. I would recommend carrying it in a book bag or purse for just a little added pressure. The full closure of the cover really completes the &#34;book&#34; look! I can't recommend this highly enough. If you're at all thinking of purchasing, DO!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I cannot wait for the third installment in the series. A friend turned me onto this series, and I fell in love. It switches between first and third person, past and present, and it's so well done. IF you love fantasy, and don't mind it having more of a &#34;scientific&#34; grounding, then you will love this book.
1476734941|4.0|Good information on how your body's digestive system works or doesn't. Book has good tips on how to fast top days a week. I have been doing this for last three weeks and have lost about five pounds. This has changed my mind about fasting.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It took me a little while to get into the book. The first few chapters were sort of boring to be honest. (Then re-reading, they made a lot more sense and were MUCH more interesting). Once I got into the swing of the story, and we started hearing Kvothe's story and life, and all, I got much more interested. I couldn't put the book down. (or kindle, I suppose). I stayed up late reading, and went straight into the second book.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is second of a series of many exciting books. You'll want to read it again and again. So amazing I was almost up all night reading it
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I wish I could download NIV and NLT for reading when not on the internet. They are my favorite versions. Other than that this app is great.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I can never get tired of Bogart!  This is a timeless classic.  Everytime I watch it I fall in love all over again,.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is really nice and family friendly!! I'm nine and I love this game so I suggest you get it I recommend it and like it!!! I think this game is 2-18 so any age can really play it my mommy loves it so please get it
B0009X75RO|5.0|I loved the movie.  I recommend it highly. Great price and I looked around before purchasing the cd. Got reviews and I agree with the reviews.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I'm not its biggest fan but it sure is addicting.If your looking for a good review this would be one of them.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I would recomed to anyone who just likes to read and enjoys short funny stories.  Enjoyed it. Gotta love Vegas.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is one of my favorite apps ever so if your looking for a good app get this one ASAP!!!!!!If you are looking for a review to listen to you should listen to this one!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Wow I love this game, been waiting too try it, and its so totally addictive to say the least, even my kids enjoy it, we have a good time playing against each other and most of all its funnnnnnnnnn.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was great. I couldn't put it down. It was fun to try and find the pieces of the puzzle. Finally a puzzle game meant for adults! I only wish it had kept going rather than ending after a couple levels.
0321356683|5.0|It is great to have a best practises book handy. A solid read. One for the library for later use
B00C061I3K|5.0|This has been one of the best albums I had the pleasure to listen in a very long time. It is perhaps the best album of Daft Punk to date.<br />This is an EPIC album that will be never forgotten.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Snap, crackle, pop, and not in the \\"rice krispies\\" way.  I sent the first one back and they sent me a replacement.  It does the same thing, although not quite as badly or quite as frequently.  I've tested the unit with different 1/8\\" cables and different headphones.  This thing is a pile of crap.  Don't even think about it!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really love Kate and Drew. Kate is such a string, smart woman and Drew is hysterical. The two of them together and how they can dish it out to one another I fell in love with them both. I really liked how it was in Drew 's POV but sometimes I wish the author had some things in Kate's PIC. Great first book. Had me laughing really hard. I needed that from all the depressing and serious books I have been reading lately.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I thought that this movie was really good.  It stars an incredible actor - Aaron Eckhart who had a starring role in the Batman movie &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; as both DA Harvey Dent and one of my favorites, Two Face.  Aaron's character plays a Marine who is just about to retire when aliens invade Los Angeles and start killing onlookers on the beach.  The premise of the movie is that Aaron's Marine squad has to find and rescue several people trapped in a police station before the Air Force drops enough bombs to level the city and surrounding areas to destroy the invading aliens.  Overall, the action was solid as well as the drama which totally sold me on purchasing the movie.
B008PPUMVY|2.0|I don't think this is a good place to start if you're interested in Frank Zappa music. This album is annoying. There are good bits of music here and there but a load of junk in between.
B009MO5G90|2.0|I love the series, but this movie misses the mark.  The action is disjointed and the story is nonexistant. They took the video game motife too far with this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't put this game down!! Temple Run 2 will definitely test your reflexes and your hand-eye coordination. This one is an absolute winner!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I got this to improve the audio quality of videos i make with my Hero camera.  The cost was so low, i went ahead and ordered two.<br /><br />I'm not a huge audiophile, but i can tell a drastic improvement over the onboard mic of that camera, with the skeleton case.<br /><br />It has a 20 foot cord, so it allows for lots of mobility.  I wasn't expecting it to be longer than 6'<br /><br />For the price, if you're a beginner like me, i'd recommend it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My granddaughters really love playing this game.. A game about owning a horse is as close as they will get to owning a horse until I win the lottery and buy the farm I have always dreamed of.....
0763619612|5.0|make you child believe in him self.and makes them explore and discover more stuff even if they thought they can't do it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book! I wish there was an epilogue, because I want the author to tell me what happened to the characters in the end, but it was such a great story. I still haven't seen the movie, I hope that I can say that the movie does the book justice. Read it!
B0000DZTIL|5.0|I was very happy with the movie. it was good and very humerous and I liked the teacher that Dennis hopper played.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love Sparks' books, but they are all pretty much the same. So to me, it's a must read even though I already read all his other books with the same story/plot line.  Either way I always get sucked in since I am the most hopeless of romantics...
B000ICXQXI|3.0|I rented it but the 24 hours is a very short time. i was to analyse it on a school project. Had to watch it in a rush since the time was very limited
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I always say his books are all the same, which they are, but that doesn't mean don't read them. With each story line you get hooked and with each character you grow a connection. I have nothing bad to say about The Lucky One because it really is such a great love story and I'm glad Sparks' continues to keep me hooked on his writing.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love cut the rope I already finished the other two games and this one is as awesome as the others
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sad and beautiful, brought both tears of happiness and sorrow. Please read this book, you'll be missing out if you don't.
B00CVSMLXS|5.0|This show has been exhilarating and frustrating all at the same time, but it's grown in intensity to a magnificent season ending climax. One of the best detective shows I've ever seen, and I do love a good detective show! Plenty of interpersonal complexity to make it completely absorbing. Love it, just love it!
B005UL53AQ|1.0|Somehow neither of the discs were able to play. The cover had a warning stating that they might not play in foamy blu-ray players but that was definitely not the issue.
B0073COMKW|5.0|(See my other reviews on other wattages and colors)<br /><br />After testing several colors / wattages this is what I'm using to replace the 15W CFLs being used in the kitchen in recessed (can) overhead lamps. The warm white color is perfect for indoors (IMO, obviously) and isn't as harsh as the cool white. The color temperature is almost identical to the 15W CFLs these are replacing and these are producing slightly more light at 2/3 the wattage.<br /><br />I purchased my first set of LEDs 6 months ago and am using them indoors and out, so far they're great.  As the rest of the CFLs fail in the kitchen, these will be replacing them.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I so enjoyed reading The Selection and couldn't wait for The Elite to come out.  I even read the prequel The Prince.  Maxon and America's relationship kind of reminds me of a rollercoaster: really big highs followed by really low lows.  I felt pulled in too many directions but I was constantly shooting for Maxon and America's relationship to work.  I cannot wait until the next book comes out.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|For a movie with such hype it sure was a let down.  My major gripe?  Moviemakers, if you are going to make a movie do your homework.  It is pronounced Trazodone like cat not Trazedone.  I seriously had to stop watching at that point.  I have taken this med. for YEARS and never once has a doctor, pharmacist, or doctor pronounced it this way.  If you're gonna focus on something get it right.
1609611543|5.0|This book was full of the latest info surrounding our food sources and their impact in our ever changing world.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I thought this would be good, but it's take alot of memory, moves slowly and you can't do too much without buying (with real money) more packages.
B00932A4XE|4.0|If you have ever been pregnant you will appreciate this movie. It's funny, touching, romantic, action-filled and it even has a few moments of suspense and tears. Overall this is a great movie to watch pregnant or not. It's not the chick flick you think it is.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My 8 year old autistic son loves this game. He plays it often and keeps reminding me that he is playing it.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|The book started off slow but got better with every page that I turned. The build up was great for the phenomenal ending.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This is a cool app, with it's graphics and such, but it's kind of useless as it's not a very exciting game and my son want's exciting.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Best game ever, reminds me of playing diablo. Going to get in trouble for playing this game so much. Fun.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I love this album, and it is my current favorite album in the car. I love the beat, the words and the voices. I sometimes feel like pulling over so I can dance!
B00BD62X14|4.0|I am a francophone, and so look for contemporary music to listen to.  Carla Bruni's songs span three languages.  They are charming and easy to understand.  The instrumentation is lovely.
B000P2A256|3.0|Maybe I would have liked this album more if I had received it first, but it can't compare with &#34;Hands all over me.&#34;
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|This is Willie Nelson at his best.  He rolls out some oldies, and carries them off beautifully.  His gravelly voice has only gotten better with age; he plays with love and great skill.  I'd recommend this to any Willie Nelson fan - it's a must have.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|...and well worth the price. Great graphics and story, It would be nice to have the option to turn off the voices though. I read faster than the characters speak and in this game, you have to turn off the effects volume completely. It's a fun game, that's all that matters.
B000002H33|5.0|thanks i don't like doing homework so stop making me and thanks for the cd its just the way i remember it
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy this game so far but how it is not limited, over once you complete each level. WE'LL SEE.
B000002H2H|5.0|here we go again with home work i dont need 10 more word ok now 6 well i will ride the lightning now thanks
B00BDPW7XE|5.0|Part 2 is a sequel as good as Part 1 placing Big Big Train at the height of the prog world. These days it would seem they can do no wrong, and for our sake, I hope it remains that way.
B000002H97|5.0|again i hate homework but here you go its the black album so it rocks what ealse can i say thanks
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is the best-engineered/mixed recording I've heard in a very, very long time. Mick should win another Grammy for this one! I'll sum it up in one word - EARgasm!!!
0307594777|5.0|It is truly sad that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us because he had a way of writting that truly brought the charators in his books to life. When I started the first book it was a little tricky at first to get used to but when it finally got to know the charactors and was about a third of the way into the book you don't want to put it down. As a matter of fact you just keep saying to yourself ok, ok one more page and then I will set it down until you get to the bottom of that page and you say it again. There is so very much action and excitement through out all the books that you just wont want to stop reading them. You get so indepth to their situations and goings on that you feel like you are right there with Lisbeth and Mikael. Be glad that you can get all three books together because when you finish the first one you can't wait to start the next and so on right through to the end of the third. Even on the long journey you go through with Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist when it all come to a close you feel forfilled but you still would like to read more with them and find out what else their lives lead into. This is Truly a Treasured Collection and I believe will be in the Great Classics in Years to Come.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|it is a great game with great graphics it has a great storyline and I would recamend it to anyone
B004ZNB12O|5.0|This is a single disc with a Great Collection of Pink Floyd music. I have the Echos 2 disc set that came out a few years ago and that is Amazing but this is like a single disc version of even the best of the best of Echos. makes a Great Pink Floyd Collection at a Very Good Price worth the money. AAA+++
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|When I first started playing this game, I was dazzled by the graphics (at least in comparison to Temple Rune 2).  Then, as play progressed, it became more fun than TR2 because the player progresses through different worlds and has new abilities.  Of course, in the end, you are just running, jumping and sliding, so the game inevitably gets old after a few hours of play.  Still, as long as this game stays at 99 cents or less, it is a worthwhile purchase.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I had heard about this movie for a few years but had never had the chance to see then I caught it on a cable station a while back and it was already about 45 minutes into it. So I watched it and when it was done I had to get on Amazon and buy it to see the whole thing it was truly amazing. I can't say for sure how close to real life it is but it sure seemed to have feeling and heart in what I had seen and makes you really feel for the charactors in the story. A walk through the days of a team of bomb deacrivators stationed in Iraq during the war. I was never there and I thank my lucky stars for the men and women who have and are serving for the US and I hope they all come home safe soon but if this is even a little like it is over there my heart truly goes out to each and everyone of them.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|We enjoyed this movie...quirky and nice story line. Is it worth buying...rent it first then decide if it's a &#34;keep&#34;.
0062059963|5.0|Couldn't put it down and wish it had never ended!!! I can't wait for the 3rd to come out! Maxon is such an amazing male character.
1577314808|5.0|ITS A BOOK YOU CAN ALWAYS RE-READ.<br />LOVE THIS BOOK IVE SENT IT TO SOMEONE ELSE IT HELPS<br />LIVE IN THE MOMENT
B00C061I3K|4.0|Daft Punk's latest release needs to be heard in its entirety from start to finish.Once you've done that,<br />you come to realize how all the songs work together and the result is sheer brilliance: a combination of disco, house<br />and funk that will delight both old and new fans.<br /><br />Most of the songs including \\"Get Lucky\\" are extended versions.<br /><br />Worth the wait andwill be this year's greatest dance record!
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I'm a unique horror movie watcher: I'm utterly terrified/disgusted by gore and gratuitous violence, but I don't mind a good dose of morbidity and twisted metal states. This movie was a perfect balance because it had the quick cuts and jumps to get you gasping, but there was no gore or useless chainsaws. The story was morbid but plausible (who doesn't love a 19th century insane asylum ghost?) and the added unsettling concept of two little girls being raised in the words for five years without human contact, and how twisted that simply makes them, ghost aside, was great.<br /><br />Good acting, great combination of jumping scares and a legitimately terrifying ghost in Mama; she was just my sort of horrifying: tattered shroud, distorted features, HAUNTED eyes, nightmarish voice. I'd suggest you watch this in a heartbeat. Definitely a nice surprise after a lot of mediocre horror flicks.
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|I have been a fan since the first album and I find this one a step in the right direction. What I love about Mars is that with all of their albums, each one has it's own sound and own story to tell. Jared Leto's raw voice and emotions come off so effortlessly on this album as it does on all the others. On my iPod, I can put all Mars albums on shuffle and get such a beautiful assortment of music from them, never being bored and that is not easy to do for an artist/band these days.<br /><br />This album is great. It shows that they are comfortable with themselves and their sound. They know who they are, their messages are the same and will continue to be the same just with a different tune. I can see where ppl say the sound is not the same, yea this isn't their first self-titled album where the sound is hard and the drums are crushing, this isn't A Beautiful Lie where the songs are wild but tamed and their messages are starting to become clearer, this isn't This Is War, where they set a tone, stuck with it and created an amazing vision this is where you hear their love for their music, smile at their musical lusts, feel and respect their faiths and live their dreams with them through the sound of Jared's voice and Shannon and Tomo's instrumental talents. Like another reviewer stated, their experimentation with different instruments and sounds is what makes this a solid album.<br /><br />I will forever be a fan of this band because they do something so well that only a few bands (That I like) can do. . . . . .they evolve and they do it with ease. . .that's talent. (However I gave this four stars because their first album will remain one of my all-time favorite 5 star albums.)<br /><br />Kudos
B009UX2YAC|5.0|MY THREE YEAR OLD STUMBLED ACROSS THIS GAME AND HE LOVES IT. ITS NICE TO SEE MY SON JUMP THE TRAINS, EVADES TRAINS AND ADDICTIVE GAME. NOW I STARTED TO PLAY THIS GAME AND CAN'T SEEM TO PUT DOWN THE KINDLE DOWN DUE TO THIS GAME.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I had put off reading this book that came so highly recommended by everyone I knew because I knew it was a tough subject to stomach. Now I am sorry I waited. It was an amazing story about a time none of us should ever forget or ignore. Touching, heartbreaking and inspiring.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|This book was well worth the wait.  The scope of it was amazing, and the closing of the various story lines was fantastic.  I do wish that some of the conclusions were different, but they all worked well for the story.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see another book or two dealing with the aftermath of the battle, and more details about some of what was revealed in this book.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|It's a great movie that really makes you think at the end. It also was really fun to watch in 3d.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|Our preschool music teacher is retiring and moving away at the end of this school year.  The school gave this watch to her as her retirement gift.  She LOVES it.  The watch is a really great size - larger than I thought it would be, which is good.  The colors are pretty and vibrant.  I want one for myself now!
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|The great albums I grew up listening to, BLIZZARD OF OZ, MOVING PICTURES, BACK IN BACK, HIGH AND DRY AND SOME ENCHANTED EVENING, to name just a few. Those albums all had something in common with this new release by CLUTCH, these albums are complete rock albums! The whole album track 1 to the final track are worth while rock songs! I am underselling EARTH ROCKER here a little because truthfully I can't believe how good this whole album is! ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE HARD ROCK ALBUM
0316067598|5.0|Great, fast, and quick read. The first few chapters, the words just caught me off guard because I feel like I've heard those words before during my service that's probably why I kept on reading and reading and not stop until i finished the book. After reading the book, I was disappointed because I wanted to read more about Marcus and how this brave patriot is doing now. Overall this is a great book! Must read!!!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Survival and recovery autobiography. Amazing how someone could survive this horribl physical, mental, and emotional abuse . And have the courage to speak about it
B009NY43NY|1.0|I admit, after the previous two books, I had low expectations for this book.  That being said, I was still greatly disappointed.  I've read rumors that the author had lost interest in her series.  This book really seems to indicate the truth of that rumor.  I feel sorry for all these characters who have been left with such a lackluster final story.  Having read the entire series, I know Charlaine Harris is capable of more than this.
0307352153|4.0|I found the main subject very interesting. The writing is very engaging and the book is obviously very well researched. I enjoyed it.
B000KIRT6A|4.0|I bought this pedal because I have always had a very good experience with Behringer products.  Plastic casing aside, this pedal is solid and get's the job done.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with this pedal is the sliders.  They feel pretty loose which can be a good or bad thing.  If you were to step on the foot switch with your heel, your toes could easily move the sliders.  This won't be a problem for me but I could understand how it would affect some people.<br /><br />The EQ itself works fantastic.  All of the frequency ranges work very well and get the job done.<br /><br />The LED light is a normal complaint I see on Behringer pedals, however this pedal's LED is tame.  It is not blinding but is bright enough to see in a well lit room.<br /><br />I give this pedal 4 stars because the price is fantastic, the pedal works tremendously, but the sliders are a bit loose.  Don't let that stop you from purchasing this pedal as no other EQ can compare to this price and quality.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|I love it- it has all the songs I love.  Shipped fast, was in good quality.  It's a good value and, let's face it, Billy Idol is pretty awesome.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game for the money. Bought it a short while ago and can't put it down. Hope they come out with additional worlds to play.
B006T3RM08|5.0|First product I've ordered from this company and it works perfectly. No issues with fit. I took the item out of the box, snapped BOTH my keyboard and trackpad in, turned on both power buttons (great design on this) and I was up and running in :30. I've sent out a group text to all my friends who have Macs and prefer the trackpad over the mighty mouse letting them know that this should be their next purchase. Great product. I'd reccommend. No complains with the asthetic design of the product; looks sleek/sharp.
B006LQL92U|5.0|Stunning cinematography and art direction; believable characters and story line. All the actors are A+, but Elizabeth McGovern looks as beautiful as any John Singer Sargent. Tasteful.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Well done. The whole family got into the story line, and the 3D was a good quality. Highly recommend for all ages.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|Basic counting methods with the very hungry caterpillar, which is always a treat for little ones.  I recommend this as a good teaching and learning tool for parents of 18 - 36 month old kiddos.
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOME game<br />not a waste of money. you can make just about anything because I made a Steve head<br />Get this app
B007MCTTHY|1.0|Not well designed and not enjoyable for me.  A bust!  Graphics were dull and sound not clever.  I will try something else
0307271080|2.0|What a slog getting through this way over-written book. When Maureen Corrigan gives her blessing to a book on \\"Fresh Air\\" (NPR), I go immediately to amazon.com to see what readers thought. And at the time only three readers had \\"reviewed\\" the book, all of them positive. But I cannot do that. The central character became more and more uninteresting to me, and unbelievable. When she gets to Philadelphia and cannot get a job and you trudge through page after page after page of what she tried to secure for a job, I realized that the writer really doesn't understand America as well as she claims. Sure, we are a racist country, have been for a long time, and still are--think Tea Party!--but in Philadelphia there is no reason the protagonist would not eventually get a job. Then there are factual errors such as a doctor saying an appendix needed to be removed immediately but then scheduled the surgery for the next day. Do we not all know about burst appendix and how you don't wait?! So if you judge a book by it's cover--I don't--in this case the blah cover is just perfect for the journey that takes too too long to cover a plot that really is quite thin.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|We love all the ice age movies!  Very entertaining and all have a great message!  My kids (5 & 2) get excited every time it comes on!!
B000F9RB8K|5.0|I love having my own movies for my own collection.  Very good quality.  Very pleased with this this movie and the others I have ordered through Amazon.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|My kids were very entertained by this movie.  I'm not a huge fan of vampire movies for children.  It seemed to be cute and innocent.
B001B7CNXI|5.0|Very good quality.  I love the music.  Excellent movie.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I saw the old, original &#34;Miami Vice&#34; when it was on television.  I was NOT disappointed.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|Could be a little scary for younger kids.  It centers around the &#34;boogey man&#34;.  I have a 5 and 2 year old and they liked it, but seemed to get a little uneasy when the boogey man was on screen.  Nice plot of good vs. evil.  Overall decent movie.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|When you mix Joe Bonamassa's excellent soulful playing with the growling sexulaity of Ms. Hart, what else but a top notch CD. Their cover of Etta James is powerful and compelling, I would guess Ms. James is smiling from the heavens. This tandem has captured all that is great in American Blues today.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This movie is too cute!  My kids (5 & 2) LOVE it!  We own it!  They can't get enough of it.  The love story (which is just a small portion on the movie) is a little much and could have been completely left out and it wouldn't have affected the movie at all.  Overall definitely worth the watch!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Writing and acting of the highest quality.  I'm not much of a TV person but I can't get enough Downton Abbey.  Maggie Smith is phenomenal.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have had this game for some time on the family iPad and am excited to have it on the kindle fire now.<br /><br />The game is free to play if you have patience. Your energy does run out pretty fast at first but as you level up you gain a larger amount of energy and you get rewarded &quot;food&quot; as you play.<br /><br />This is not a play and win within a few hours you can play for days,something I love. Another plus is the ever evolving puzzles,challenges and quests.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the big easy to read buttons. I only have had this one week but so far so good. lol
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very good game better than hill racing that I bought but I don't know which one to delete but hill climb racing is very good you should get it and its very fun
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Hard to understand how this won Best Picture. It's a mildly suspenseful story of the extrication from Iran of the hostages who had fled the U.S. Embassy and sought refuge in the Canadian Embassy when Iranians stormed the battlements demanding the return of the cancer-stricken Shah. Affleck uses the pretense that the hostages are a film crew working on a flick called \\"Argo\\" to smuggle them out of the country to safety in Canada. There are a few somewhat tense moments during their escape. Other than that, it's a very routine movie. Not terribly involving.
B000FA675C|5.0|I have never understood the controversy surrounding this book. To my mind it enhances faith in our heavenly father - it doesn't undermine it at all.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|it had all the witty banter i have learned to love with these two talented and funny actors plus all the great SiFi puns i know and love. all the other characters were a perfect match with there actors too. great funny move
B008LAO7C8|5.0|Triple 180g vinyl. It's quite nice to have the album in this format. The only strange thing is that the track order in the vinyl press is different from the regular one. It's completely different. I don't regret it because, in some strange way, it makes you listen to a whole different work. It's the only detail you should know. It comes with digital download with the normal track order. Great, great album.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|J.J. Abrams (Lost, Super 8) hit this one out of the park because Star Trek (2009) was an amazingly good character driven and origin story film filled with good drama, some comedy and some action, \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" is literally a visual roller coaster of action and fun. The 3D is effective in this film and more importantly the action and suspense does not stop at all.  Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (both on Transformers and Fringe), along with Damon Lindelof (Prometheus, Lost) to the story to the next level and the stakes are much higher in this film - literally.<br /><br />Watching this film was also an experience of audience participation with cheers, tears, fears, applause and even \\"oooo's\\" and \\"ahhhhs\\" and tons of laughter, laughter and hysterics throughout most of movie! What I really liked about the movie is that once again it took the original series concepts and turned them upside down and twisted them and made them fresh. Some familiar and yet not familiar moments do occur and you have to see it to understand what I mean.<br /><br />What also received a warm applause at the end of the film from the entire audience was a proud dedication the filmmakers give to the \\"...Post 9/11 Veterans...\\", giving them thanks and praise for their past and present service at home and abroad.<br /><br />Chris Pine (Rise of the Guardians, This Means War) does the comedy just as well as he does the drama and his passion for the role is clear with his wild James T. Kirk agenda, which often isn't exactly what Starfleet would approve. Zachary Quinto (Heroes, Margin Call) does an incredible Spock once again. His passionless persona is passion-ful and his commitment to subtlety conveying meaning without saying a word is amazing. The chemistry between Chris and Zach is blissfully apparent on screen and their compassion for each other as Starfleet officers is fully developed in this film<br /><br />Karl Urban (Dred, Bourne Supremacy) is the cantankerous \\"Bones\\" McCoy and Karl is having an amazing time with this in this film. His charm is burning through his bitterness and sarcasm throughout the film. Zoe Saldana (Avatar, Columbiana) as Uhura really gets to shine in this film as her relationship with Spock is tested and it happens in some very funny scenes between their domestic arguments they have. (And they have them in front of Kirk!)<br /><br />I waited till now to discuss the story and I don't want to give any spoilers away, but the plot centers around why the film was dedicated to who it was dedicated to in the first place. Benedict Cumberbatch (Warhorse, Sherlock) plays a villain that would rival most villains. Mean, sadistic, relentless and extremely intelligent - all the elements you do not want a madman to have, and he has got them in spades! He is a terrorist who affects Kirk in a very personal way that causes Kirk to make his entire mission to get Benedicts' character. (And I am avoiding his name for a reason!) It's a real terrorist story.<br /><br />Did I mention that Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) playing Chief Engineer Scott is one of the funniest things you'll ever see on screen in this film? Even when he resigns? (Oooops, tiny spoiler - or maybe not, you'll see.) John Cho (American Beauty, Harold & Kumar) has an amazing moment of power when he gets an unexpected upgrade and John plays it to the hilt and even has a moment that impresses himself quite a bit! The one who has the least amount to do, yet some very funny moments and one truly heroic moment, is Anton Yelchin (Fright Night, Terminator Salvation) as Chekov. He literally fixes and saves and fixes and saves...you have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Another brilliant performance by the father-figure Bruce Greenwood (I,Robot, DejaVu) as Captain Pike, sole `cheerleader' for Captain Kirk and all his troublesome antics. Bruce and Chris also have amazing chemistry as the surrogate father and son relationship that they have developed. And joining the cast this time around is Alice Eve (Men In Balck III, The Raven) as Carol Marcus, a specialist in a field that defiantly helps in the hunt for Benedict's character, as well as unexpectedly helping Benedict as well.<br /><br />Now ad an Admiral with a mission and a twist (or two or three) that will very much surprise you and you have you wondering at all times, is Peter Weller (Robocop, Buckaroo Bonzai) adding to the mix of extremely high energy and fast pace.<br /><br />And there is a really big surprise too! Everyone is back and in full form and full force and this is definitely a candy film for the soul. Take the drama and passion of the first film, sprinkle in some suspense, plot twists, a double extra helping of humor and scene by scene action on top of action on top of action on top of action, and you have \\"Star Trek Into Darkness.\\" A film that will literally have something  for everyone, of all ages, to enjoy and you will definitely `feel' much better leaving the theatre then when you came in!

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|DP's inspiring the world again. Nile Rodger's additions to this album and this track were so perfect to make this top40-worthy. So many artists have been touched by this song too, if you google or youtube search for remakes of this song you'll be blown away (like Kellee Maize's, it's just insane). Thank you DP!!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It is difficult to not become mesmerized by the way DDL manages to bring Lincoln to life on the screen. The fact that the Academy Awards gave DDL his due is an understatement. This is an automatic classic movie for the future of our nation.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Need I say more? I like that Canon designed it with a space provision for the camera's battery door so you don't need to remember where you put it. Also, there is no magazine for the LP-E6 batteries so you can put it in individually. I also like the thought of having the ability to use AA batteries as spares. My camera now looks like a pro. :)
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Talk about a &#34;touchy&#34; subject. I have to say that Helen Hunt besides being one of my favorite actresses, is completely at ease in this role and that is saying something for sure. Great story well acted and, ahem, dare I say, visually riveting!
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|John Green is an astute observer of humankind. He composes symphonies with his words. Often when I listen to Mozart or Beethoven I realise that each note they wrote for a particular piece of music is essential, has a function and without that one note the music would be all wrong.<br /><br />John Green's writing evokes in me a similar understanding: every syllable on every page is essential to the story. In many places I have felt that the book is profound. I am not normally a hunter and gatherer of 'quotable quotes' yet in this book I felt compelled to highlight. There are so many passages that one wants to read and reread until they become a part of your being.<br /><br />This book is not for the fainthearted - I have been avoiding it for a while because I was initially not brave enough, now I am sad that I did not read it sooner. I highly recommend that you do read this splendid book.<br /><br />Well done John Green! I am looking forward to reading your other works.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I was looking forward to the film since I enjoy Hawke's performances but about 1/3 rd of the way through the film, the writer seemed to have lost their way and the plot became a rehash of so many other past horror movies. The graphics were mediocre when there was a moment of &#34;other worldliness&#34; and the scope of the plot was jumbled as it attempted to make the story try to do too much. Three stars was gracious.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|If you were to take a standard 70's script and add cutting edge special effects you would have a movie very similar to Iron Man 3.  A sapping story line with a kid of course teaching him the way, a very forgettable villain with no personality and a great many one line zingers.  I loved the Avengers, but this follow up was pure garbage.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It is hard to fault Pixar and their work since they have set the standard for the industry. The story, however, takes the prize as a super story for young girls to enjoy and see themselves in the story line. Merida is a great character since she portrays more real-life situations and reactions than a whole host of other stories that attempt to address the same scope of emotions. We all enjoyed it!
B004PAHZMC|5.0|my 6 year old loves to use this to store his star wars figures and legos and to play with them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|After completing this wonderful game I am left wanting an entire estate of &quot;rooms&quot;!!!<br /><br />Please, give us more!! Eager to see where you go with this!
B00BWU0S3Q|4.0|It is a little grit and grimy, but if you like LA back in the day, this story follows a squad that is not on the books to go to war with the &#34;mob&#34;.  I found the plot to be able to move along, tells a good story however it is very shoot em up.  So if you don't like that this isn't the movie for you.  Having Josh Brolin and the others Sean Penn, great acting.
B000NA28I4|3.0|Eragon, ah, when this movie was released at the end of 2006, it received a lot of hate, from both critics and fans of the book. I can see why. Reading the book after seeing the movie, I noticed how loosely adapted it was.<br /><br />Eragon, a poor farm boy (who wears rather expensive-looking clothing), living with his uncle and cousin, finds a polished blue stone in the forested mountains called the Spine. After finding out it's actually a dragon egg, he raises the creature and bonds with it, becoming Alagaesia's next new Dragon Rider. The Ra'zac, creepy monsters summoned by Durza, one the film's antagonists, kills Eragon's uncle Garrow. Eragon enlists the help of the village's drunken story-teller, Brom (played with nice flare by Jeremy Irons). Together, they embark on a quest to find the Varden, a rebel organization. Along the way, Eragon learns how to use magic, meets a fortuneteller, battles Urgals, and travels across Alagaesia.<br /><br />Before I saw this, I was just fledgling into the genre of fantasy. When I heard about Eragon coming out, I was super excited about it, expecting the next Lord of the Rings-type franchise. Well, after first seeing it, I was greatly disappointed. It wasn't the next Lord of the Rings, and it wasn't entirely a good movie. Years later, I've softened up to it. No, Eragon isn't a great a movie, but, it's not as bad as Max Magician and the Legend of the Rings, haven't heard of that? Search it up and rent it, then you'll know what I mean. It isn't a close adaption if the novel either. Yes, the barebones plot is there, and tweaked a little bit, but it isn't the same. In the book, Eragon and Brom journey to kill the Ra'zac, seaking revenge of the death of Garrow, not journeying to the Varden. That's just one of the many differences between the book and movie.<br /><br />The film tries to pull a Lord of the Rings-type style aerial cinematography, showing the lush landscapes of the imaginary world, in too many travel montages. Yes, the imagery is beautiful, but there's more than enough of it. Instead of focusing on that, the film could have had more down time, more plots of the book, like Eragon and Brom going to Teirm, or visiting the tavern. Things to make the world feel grounded. Instead, it's all too rushed, and we don't get that other-worldly, complex feel of the Rings franchise.<br /><br />Though, on the up side, Eragon is an adventure quest story, and the film shows that, albeit in not the best way. It manages to not need the viewer to read the book to know every detail (if you read the book before, you'll probably be more annoyed by it) before seeing it. Any fan of fantasy might enjoy it, or hate it, it all depends on you're own opinion.<br /><br />Eragon isn't my favorite fantasy film, though it's not my most hated. It could have been much better, but being half good isn't as bad as being dreadfully awful.<br /><br />**1/2 out of 5gery is beautiful, but there's more than enough of it.

B00BYH6OJO|5.0|If you like a good action flick and Mark Wahlberg this is a great movie.  I enjoyed thourghly.  I will not give any spoilers!
193700788X|5.0|What a great ending to the Sookie story. While the mystery part may be a bit on the convoluted side, and the occasional third person interludes slightly odd, I felt the characters and setting remained consistently charming and the plot arc  to the the \\"happily ever after\\" was well founded in the previous two books.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Personally, I thought this app was a great game. the only flaw is that it can become horribly difficult, requiring split second movements and attacking at the same time. While I understand some people posses this superhuman skill that is absolutely required to play this game, I don't. I know the reason for this being so difficult is because they want us to pay money to buy more gems to revive yourself when you die, and to unlock the armors without the slightest bit of effort but the tap of a button. These gems are ridiculously expensive and there is no way you can get as many gems as you need by EARNING them. I thought the point was to play more and level up, unlocking better armor as you go. Unfortunatley, the process is to PAY more to get better things, or spend your entire day playing the game to make it a tenth of the way to unlocking a basic and lower level armor. I'll accept this challenge rather than pay 100 dollars to get new armor!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I think this game is ok, but you have to pay to play. And for that reason I did not play , as much as I wanted to.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game so much I wont it so much I want  it so much<br />The game is going to be awesome
B004TI1WME|4.0|I do like this calculator, because you can and make a list, with it. and that it does come in handy at times.
0345803507|5.0|Reading this book had me in a trans..it made me feel like i can live through the characters. It feels like home to me.<br />I am waiting patiently for whatever character, book, she has next.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|This is fun to do, when you have some time on your hands.  I like it a lot. I also like how it is set-up, and easy to draw. I would recommend this APP, for people who like to draw, or mix colors.
0345803493|5.0|I finished reading this in a week, i was so stunned of all the unexpected details leading up to the end, i know part three is going to be the icing on my cake. Have to read it asap.
B009LGO88E|4.0|The 3DS XL Circle Pad Pro is a much-appreciated attachment for games that can utilize it (thoroughly enjoying Moster Hunter 3 Ultimate with this accessory!).<br /><br />One of my biggest praises for this attachment is also my largest complaint -<br />It is only compatible with a small number of games.<br /><br />Now hear me out -<br />I know Mario Kart and other games wouldn't necessarily benefit from use of an additional Circle pad, HOWEVER I would LOVE to simply play games like Mario Kart with Circle Pad Pro so I can use the included (and MUCH welcome) ZR & ZL shoulder buttons.<br />They are SO much more comfortable than the standard L & R buttons, however since Mario Kart and other games don't support the Circle Pad Pro, they won't make use of even the ZR or ZL buttons, meaning that if you want the added comfort of this attachment, you will have to strain even harder than normal to just reach the R button (L button is easy enough to reach..)<br /><br />Overall, I highly suggest all owners of compatible games to purchase this wonderful piece of hardware!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I had never seen this movie before but had always heard of it.  Normally I like action-type movies but this one has a pretty good story seemingly based loosely on historical events.
B000000993|5.0|If you like Tool, you must have this one. It got here in great condition, no scratches or bumps.<br />Great buy
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I had fun with the mystery and mind boggling tests and secrets that the room held. I am look forward to the next installment.
B000002B2T|5.0|This is one of the best work by Layne Staley, you definitely Buy It!<br />Got the MP3 version as well for free
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|My husband chose \\"Jack Reacher.\\" I was not expecting much, but it riveted me from the opening scenes. Reacher was a modern Lone Ranger --- very modern --- whom Cruise played to a tee. The plot turned a couple of times; the car chase was suspenseful and fun; and the end held a surprise. I found this movie to be one great escape.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|pictures won't save. tried everything I can to troubleshoot.<br /><br />Droid RAZR maxx HD<br /><br />otherwise I love this app. my favorite editing app.  I love being able to control filter strength. but now the app is useless.
0425269205|5.0|Sookie Stackhouse is coming to an end and thru the sadness of missing her and the wonderful world created by author Charlaine Harris I can only say that I have loved the whole ride, the whole story, this ending is perfect and the special edition is a MUST HAVE for any Sookie lover~!<br />I am so happy to have this final book in the series signed and numbered by the author~! This special edition is not only linen bound, signed and numbered by the author in a slip-cased cover, it is the well known work of the artist Lisa Desimini which makes this last book in the series extremely beautiful. I highly recommend this special edition to anyone who loves beautiful books and anyone who loves Sookie....but the limited number that were made are most likely sold out by now! You have to be on top of it if you expect to get these for yourself!  ALL STARS FROM ME!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|So, only a short part is free, but for the sub 4.99 price, absolutely worth it.  For the multiple hours and potential reply, I give it 4 stars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As stated earlier, if you liked Myst, this game is definitely for you. I cannot wait for a new chapter.
B004I2K4DY|2.0|The performers were very good.  However, I am disappointed in the story line.  I am getting sick and tired of slavery stories.  My ancestors were not slaves, and they didn't own slaves, but some of them were persecuted and killed for their religious faith.  I don't force everybody to listen to their injustices.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a beautiful person.  Jaycee has turned negatives into positives.  I know that she will continue to grow. I couldn't put this book down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I enjoyed every esposide  and the writing is wonderful.  This drama is better than some movies. Excellent series.  Thank You.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My family has this on our Ilario and we have everything unlocked so I know this game is awesome! I was really happy when it came out on the android appstore this is a must have app! enjoy! ;)
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Dance With Dragons covers the same time period as Feast For Crows, but from the point of view of different characters.  I read the books more or less back to back, but I feel sorry for anyone who read Feast For Crows and then had to wait five years for the other shoe to drop.  I really wonder whether Martin knows where he's going with this series.  I suspect that he's overcommitted with the TV series, other writing projects or just being a celebrity.  But if I have to wait another five years to find out what happened to whether character X is really dead, or what happened to the dragons, I don't think I'll remember (or care) by then.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This a fun little game for passing the time... The controls are simple, and the concept is easy, but the game is still quite challenging!
B001NXDSLG|1.0|You unlock this cesspool with a key of insight-beyond it is another dimension, a dimension of egoism, a dimension of hedonism, a dimension of self entitlement. Your moving into a land of both thoughtlessness and insensitivity, you've just crossed over into the zone of baby boomers.  Witness a theatrical musical festival-the year is 1969. Put on by a bunch of charlatans who &#34;for the most part&#34; have no more character than what you might find described and pictured on an FBI poster at your local post office. For the rest of their pathetic lives those who preformed and attended,  will boast and brag about what a historical and meaningful event took place at Woodstock N.Y. and how great it was to be there. Sadly, all these delusional pathetic characters were never at Woodstock-although they may try to convince you, but the festival never took place in Woodstock N.Y. It took place 100 miles away in a town called Bethel, New York.  This disjointed festival portend the social nassissistic self-indulging climite that now pollutes American culture.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I've been a fan of Daft Punk for years. I don't like ALL their stuff, but I'd consider myself a fan. I was pretty anxious for this release ever since their foray into the world of movie soundtracks. (Tron: Legacy). This album feels like a return to roots. It's a lot more contemporary than their previous work, having said that, it still feels very much like Daft Punk. There's a couple 'weird' parts, but I always find a few of those in any Daft Punk album. There is also a song or two that seems to go on a little long. Again, not that unusual for Daft Punk. There's a lot of elements in this album that makes me think of Daft Punk on valium. Despite that fact, I find myself bobbing my head along with the beat. This is, ultimately, a great addition to Daft Punk's releases.<br />Plug in, press play, and turn off the outside world.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed the book!  There were many funny points that had me laughing for days (of course to myself).  Martel's sense of humor is great!  I enjoyed his irony and various views of how religion can help us through those difficult times!
0307744434|2.0|Erin Morganstern paints beautiful pictures with her words, and has created a unique world.  However, I wish that she had spent some of her efforts on creating complex characters and an actual plot.  Maybe she needs a better editor?<br /><br />I wanted to love this book, and I didn't even like it.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble offers song interpretations at a level of expertise and quality that is definitely &#34;old school&#34; in the best way! Superb.
B003SQVI54|5.0|This is such a funny series.  I wasn't interested until a friend made me buy it while she was visiting.  Glad I did!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is a good reminder of small town, simple living which is where we all began.  The regard that neighbors have for one another and the many emotional human dramas keep it very interesting. The characters are seen as charactures of types that are easily identified as people you know.
0385528752|5.0|The Difficulties of Change:<br />  In Switch, How to Change Things when Change is Hard, Chip and Dan Heath provide new insight to an old problem, how to implement change. Implementing change can be, and often is, a difficult and messy process. Yet, for as difficult implementing change is, many recognize that change needs to occur. Then why, if many recognize the need for change, is change so hard to implement? This is one of the essential questions the Heaths answer in their book. Throughout the book, the authors offer numerous examples of change efforts that have failed and numerous examples of change efforts, seeming impossible, that have been successful. What I like about this book, is the authors do not dwell on the examples that failed, instead focusing on the examples that were successful and why. In fact, this is one of the basic tenants of the book: Focus on the bright spots. By focusing on the bright spots, the authors are suggesting to the reader to analyze why a solution was successful. This kind of thinking is refreshing in a society that loves to lay blame and avoid responsibility. You will receive much more of this logic throughout the book. For example, the theme of the Rider (rational side) and Elephant (emotional side) and how during times of change, both of these components must work together.<br /><br />A New Paradigm:<br />  Another bright spot in this book, is the paradigm shift the Heaths offer when it comes to implementing change. The conventional method of implementing change follows the analyze, think, change format. The Heaths offer a new paradigm for change: see, feel, change.<br /><br />Old Paradigm: Analyze, think, change<br /><br />New Paradigm: See, feel, change<br /><br />Only after participant see and then feel, can change begin to occur. The Heaths give a number of excellent examples of this in their book. I found the examples to be relevant and they helped conjure up ideas for my own change efforts.<br /><br />Change is Difficult Because of the Scope of the Process and the Feeling that Success is Far Away:<br />  Many times change attempts fail because participants do not experience any immediate/frequent gratification or positive feedback on the change process. The destination feels like it is out of reach and the well-meaning change attempt is abandoned. The authors offer a number of strategies to combat this problem. One is to send \\"postcards from the destination.\\" This practice increases motivation in the participants by providing them with a glimpse of their future. Another strategy, when the milestones seem to far away, is to provide \\"inch pebbles.\\" Inch pebbles are small incremental steps that need to be celebrated along the way. The inch pebbles are confirmation to the participants that the change process is working. The authors do an excellent job of explaining how these glimpses of the destination and small incremental changes can be the key aspect of change, and in fact, is the key aspect missing from many change initiatives.<br /><br />  Overall, this is a fantastic read. The book is filled with complex ideas presented in a very accessible way. One of my favorite aspects of this book is how you can read a chapter of this book, and begin to apply the information immediately in your daily life. This alone makes the book worthy of your time.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed the book. As the last of the series Harris did a good job of closing the story lines and characters from earlier stories.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Charges my nexus 10 fast. So glad I bought this. The magnetic connection really holds it in place.  I just wish it worked with my case closed.  I highly recommend it.
B0097K21YW|5.0|Burn The City is lots of fun.  Great for a bit of a distraction.  My kids love this game also
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Awesome.<br /><br />Really. This book was maybe the best I have read this year, I enjoyed the setting very much. Also the characters are believable and well though out, even if you don't get to know many of them very much. The humor of the main character really made me laugh more than a few times.
0345529057|5.0|I'd already read the series up to and including A Dance with Dragons (not included in this set), but didn't have any of the paperbacks on hand to share.  That's why I purchased this set.  I'm not going to review the series itself, partially because a) if you haven't read them what the heck are you waiting for? and b) if you haven't read them, there's no way I'm letting a review spoil it for you.<br /><br />Product-wise: the quality of these paperbacks is high and they feel like they'll last a while even with repeated use.  I was miffed that they were stacked out of order within the case, but that was remedied as soon as it was opened.  The covers are shiny.  I particularly like the image of Ned Stark brooding around on the side of the case, but I'm glad it wasn't used on the books themselves.<br /><br />Story-wise: if you've watched the series, READ THESE BOOKS!  If you haven't read them -or- watched, READ THESE BOOKS!  You won't regret it until you become obsessed, and then, you might regret getting so involved in a series that seems like its next installation may never come.  Truthfully, I want it to come, but I don't want to see the story/stories end.<br /><br />Buy these books.  And also, buy Dance with Dragons afterward.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great read, and very good value for money. Five short(er) stories collected as one larger book, it tells a gripping and gruesome story.
B0097K21YW|5.0|Mostly simple fun, but it does throw some puzzling curves in later levels. Good stress-reliever, and I like the feature of new unlockable monsters. Recommended!
B00AYR2FOI|1.0|If you want to take a nap.put this on. I really like Boz but this is a joke folks. avoid
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I am too young to have seen this series when it originally aired. Also, when it does air in reruns, there are too many commercials and many episodes are not aired. This collection is more than I could have hope for. Every great episode, including rarely seen ones plus bonus features. Peter Falk embodied one of the greatest television characters ever created and this is the proof. It is also delightful to see other actors before they were famous or long after their career peak.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|You know, it was was a good story.It as a whole was good read and easy to follow along and keep up with.The first book is the best one hands down for me.it kept my attention the best and to me had the most action in it.The second one has a few surprises in it but kinda dragged a little. And the third...Good, but was hard to keep up with for me.Interesting ending.I won't give anything away. It will be interesting to see the next two movies come out and see how well they match the books.My wife got me to check out this trilogy, and I have to say I'm glad she did.not the best books I've ever read, but it is infinitely worth looking into. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS A GOOD ACTION SLASH ROMAN TIC NOVEL. ALSO someone needs to let Kindle know that it is hard to write a book review on your Kindle when it messes up the text placement when the courser keeps doing its own thing. Anyone else have problems with this? I DON'T NORMALLY TYPE THIS BADLY! Anyways, enjoy this trilogy if you get it!
B000A59PMO|4.0|A mystery every episode and a large mystery over the whole season.  This is a great series if you like a little private eye work.  Veronica is sassy and makes you want to watch to see what kind of trouble she gets into every time.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|needs more levels to make the game interesting. and buying credits is a drag. good game's not. need. I say more<br /><br />great
B00ANDT3P2|4.0|I really got into this series when it was on TV and couldn't wait to buy the seasons.  The main characters are people you really want to watch and can't wait to see what happens next.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|The scenery and aerial photography are breathtaking & the acting superb. The flying scenes, in my opinion (as a former DeHavilland DHC-2 Beaver bush pilot), are superb, but the scenery itself more than makes up for any possible faults one may find with any other aspect of the film. It's one of those movies I'll not get tired of watching over time. Anthony Hopkins was absolutely superb - a refreshing and very &#34;different&#34; look at his abilities as an actor (compared to his character of &#34;Hannibal the Cannibal&#34; in &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;)!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This game was made by Japanese man.<br />The system is very simple but it is very fun to play.<br />Try it!
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Good story line, if a little predictable.<br /><br />Kept me in the story and I had to make myself put it down at 1 in the morning.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What can I say...it was free and it works really well. It's there on my desktop and ready to be used at a moments notice.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo was always one of my favorites and this collection just proves it. Having all the shows and movies is great!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|What's not to love about Columbo?  Best detective ever besides Sherlock, of course.<br />Great deal to have the complete series for a very good price.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a good game but you can only play a good five minutes.You get one heart every seven minutes unless someone sends you one, no other way to get one without buying it. It takes forever to get gold bars. This game did sync with my Facebook on my kindle fire HD. Needs some upgrading though.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|PicsArt Photo Studio has to be one of the easiest apps I have used thus far. I would pay for even the free one. I'm glad I don't have to :)<br /><br />deffinitly recommend this product.
B000063Y8F|5.0|After battling with a lot of other garlic presses we started to cut garlic with a knife. This is expensive for a kitchen gadget but worth it in terms of time saved, summation of other less effective (eventually breaking) substitutes, and no more garlic smell on your fingers. Splurge buy it and feel good about all the time you save, money you eventually save, and the way you smell
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't buy it you are a butt  and  a *** hole . Minecraft is good because their aren't  one rule!!!!!!!!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|This third book was not as interesting as the two previous books. I was very disappointed in the ending.  Sound like a fourth book should be written.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It got words that Do not have on the old dictionary and it got more room than the old dictionary.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Very interesting don't want to put the book down series. Understand the wars a lot better now than a history book in high school. Can't wait for the next book.
B004Z7AHZC|3.0|For kids and even adults, this movie was enjoyable, however, childish at times. Which is great for children, but it can be slightly boring for parents. I found myself chuckling occasionally. It was pretty funny, but anyone 13 or older might get pretty bored pretty quick.<br /><br />Another dislike of mine was the elimination of the Angie Steadman character. In the original film, smart, witty, fasionable Angie was defintely my favorite character, hands down. She had great look on life and, let's face it. Chloe Grace Moretz is a revelation. I hated the fact that they replaced her with perfect, Mary Sue-like Holly Hills in this film.<br /><br />The reason this movie gets a pretty good rating (for movie standards) is because it's a great look on how relationships with siblings and how crappy middle school can really be. 100% accurate on all accounts.
B00B4W8AIW|5.0|I was skeptical of Jesse's return at vocals; I was not a big fan of the first album for exactly that reason. I have loved all of the albums with Howard out front, but Disarm the Descent, surprisingly, is my favorite album by far. Highly recommend.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Let's get one things straight.<br />Best.<br />Movie.<br />Ever.<br />Spider-Man, Avengers, X-Men, everyone GO HOME. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl are now in the lead.<br /><br />This movie was hilarious, dirty, sassy, action-packed, and even romantic all at the same time. It had me rooting for the cahracters the whole time. Movies rarely get five stars from me, so this is an incredible deal. It is one of my favorite movies in the entire world and it will be that way until I'm dead in the ground!<br /><br />Nice plot. Grabbing and never fuzzy. Excellent characters. You root for misfit Kick-Ass and cheer on show-stealing Hit-Girl from begining to end. And might I add, PERFECT casting. Aaron Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Nicolas Cage, Mark Strong, EVERYONE IS GREAT. And for Chloe, who's such a young actress, to be playing such a strong female character, she's incredible! Second favorite actress ever! (Behind Jennifer Lawrence, but let's not get into that.)<br /><br />One problem: This movie was definitely over sexual. Anyone younger than fifteen should steer clear and, depending on your parents if you're still a teenager, look it up on IMDb to make sure it's ok. There's also some intense language and medium violence and gore, so check up on that on IMDb as well.<br /><br />Long story short, if you love movies, heros, comics, or ANY of the actors in this film, (or perhaps all of these) then GO SEE KICK-ASS!
B00A8ZZ3WM|5.0|Great record! Awesome collaboration! I suggest you run your happy ass on out and get it! I said, do it!  NOW!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is very good. I love the maps and the 25 day radar.  (: Really buy this app for FREE!
B00B1ME11U|5.0|Clutch never disappoints. This LONG play record is HARD! It throbs and pulses with heavy grooves.<br />BIG, HARD AND HEAVY.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really like game. It has different layout on each game. I would recommend this gamer to all my friends. I have downloaded just about every Maugham on my kindle
B0002O06NA|4.0|This LONG play record is a lot of FUNKY fun. It will make your love pump throb with giddiness. It did mine.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is written like no other that I've read before.<br />This novel definitely is a coming of age story, but this is not how all freshman years go.
B003TTKB5I|1.0|this is a girl show and somebody told me to check it out but I didn't like it at all.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite books! It is a must read. I think I have read it at least 5 times. I would recommend this book to everyone regardless of age.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|It was an interesting plot but I was not crazy about it. I would not watch it again. The mom's nagging throughout the movie had me going nuts! It was just continuous and ugh! Seth Rogan was not given the opportunity to be his usual funny self because he couldnt play off his co-star as well.
B005HY1P94|1.0|My one-star rating is given to the DVD package, not the series itself.  I like the show a lot, and I'm disappointed that it was cancelled so quickly.  I'd give this a 4- or 5-star review if the DVDs were formatted properly.<br /><br />Whoever is responsible for the two volumes of the DVDs really screwed up.  See my review for Volume One to see the problems with those disks.  Oddly enough, Volume Two has a completely different issue than Volume One does.  The disk package says that the disks are in widescreen format, enhanced for widescreen TVs.  This is the format Volume One is in, and is the format the show on TV was in.  BUT - in fact, the episodes in Volume Two are in full screen (4:3) format.  It is irritating, to say the least, that the 10 episodes in Volume One are formatted differently than the 10 episodes in Volume Two.<br /><br />To make this more odd and irritating, the extras included in Volume Two are in the proper widescreen format.  So the actual episodes are in the wrong format, and the extras are in the right format.  It might be a little more understandable if the disk package said the shows were in 4:3 format, but it does not.  As I said, the package says the shows are in widescreen format.<br /><br />Maybe this is why Volume Two is so hard to find; the studio was embarrassed at the error they made, and pulled the package.  Regardless, I wish the studio would re-issue both volumes, and correct the problems with the disks.  This is too good a show to be treated in this manner.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A great movie. Denzel did a good job portraying his character. Movie started strong in the beginning then had a bit of a lull then went back to interesting lol
B0006399FS|5.0|A A A + + + ! ! !  One of the Best Albums ever released!  Finally had to replace my original 2004 copy.  Listed as &#34;Used&#34;, but like &#34;New&#34;.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|boring. the movie was about the war, but why did we not see the war? it was all talk talk and talk. some good quotes but over all a total snooze
B000001EAQ|3.0|CD and Cover Book like new but Jewel Case broken beyond repair in several places. It was listed as &#34;Used&#34; however.  Packaging and S/H Excellent.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Good movie, but recommend it more for children. I was told it was really funny, so I expected a Shrek-ish type of movie, but it was not like that. It was still good.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I play it dusk until dawn it is really addictive and it never stops working even though its on a kindle
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I don't watch TV so I had never heard about this movie. I saw it on here and read up on it; I thought I'd give it a try.<br />So glad I did, fantastic movie.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Great I love this board game and was so glad to see it for my Kindle it is so fun
B007REV4YI|5.0|Loved Skyfall in the theater.  Love it even more as part of my James Bond collection.  Bu-Ray really enhances the experience.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Item arrived nicely packaged,Great movie, but not as good as the first ones. great special effects through out the movie. kids would love this one.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|a band that no one saw coming and now they are everywhere.their music offers something for many different genres all at the same time.you get elvis presley and crunchy metal all in one sitting.wicked fun.
B005FKGUTK|4.0|I read this prior to seeing a stage production. It helped reading the introduction and learning more about the slang used in the book. Having said that, I found the book really engaging and easy to follow.
B002L5GQGY|4.0|saw this show on a local tv channel while surfing.just like the hosts said joe b. is the greatest blues guitarist you never heard of.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Who could forget the trench coat wearing, always underestimated detective who always had to ask &#34;just one more thing&#34;.  Not the typical whodunit, rather how can you prove it!  Brings back great memories.
B00BF11STU|4.0|An enjoyable film about an important historical event, well acted and directed, although I felt it worked too hard to depict one female individual as the most important figure behind the raid
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I love Columbo and having the complete box set just makes sense. I was able to see episodes that I'd never seen before, I only wish they'd been digitally remastered, so the quality was better.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful film, exceptionally well photographed and acted and animated. I chose it because of the buzz surrounding it, and I'd un-hesitatingly recommend it to everyone, young, middle aged, or old, male or female. It was excellent!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it so much I have it on my phone and kindle fire so I can play it anywhere.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers has amazing details that make it fun! I love the game so much! I think the makers did a great job making this game
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this app. Keeps u entertained for hours. Not one of those games u can Finnish in a day. Doesn't freeze like other apps
B00992CF6W|4.0|I got this app thinking it had all the same features as the computer version but that was a stupid idea it doesn't,t have the nether and you can walk to the edge of the world you also don,t have all the blocks but overall it,s a good game.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I guess after reading the Harry Potter series, I expected this to be online entertaining wise. I expected too much. The permise of the book was okay but it dragged on waaaay too long. I also think more people thought it was to be a MORE adult theme but it wasn't. This book would have been okay for teens to read but I think even they would have been bored after a few chapters. I sincerely hope this is not the kind of thing she will write in the future. She definitely needs more pazzaz!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you liked Myst games, then you'll like The Room. Puzzles are difficult enough to keep you on your toes. Give it a try.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I think Jimi Hendrix was and still is the best guitarist ever with Clapton coming in second. I remember buying his very first album and have been mesmerized ever since. I have everything he's done and was thrilled to add this to my collection. It's great to hear something new and also different renditions of some of the old stuff. Jimi was the Master and I can't help but wonder how his music would have evolved if he were alive today. To the kids today...THIS is real music. Do yourselves a favor and ditch this crap coming out today and listen to the MAN! Jimi is greatly missed!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I checked this out to see if it would be a good game for my car loving pre-schooler.  It is simple enough they could have fun with it.  But I didn't expect I'd have hours of fun playing too!
B00B23O96A|3.0|I'm a BIG Clapton fan and love Clapton's blues but this is a bit lax and draggy. Disappointing. Kinda wish I'd saved my money.
B00C061I3K|5.0|With thought bubbles, sparkles, unicorn smiles, and pop rocks.<br /><br />Enough has been written about the technical mastery exhibited in this album.  I want to write about how this makes me feel, and why it makes me feel.  This is forward thinking music, achieved through visitation of the past, as only Daft Punk can do.  First they showed rock kids that techno could be cool (Homework).  Then they showed techno kids that soft-rock and rock could be cool (Discovery).  Then they allowed themselves the cathartic relief of making a less than brilliant album, which served as the foundation of a genre-creating live album (Alive 2007).  With RAM, Daft Punk challenge the principles of EDM by focusing on just making the best music they know how.  This album is ostensibly the story of two robots desperate to become human.  But more than that it is a challenge to the dance movement of today to create something grand, something epic.  That will be lasting impression of this album because it is so full of emotion, complexity, and consideration.  It makes me feel bigger than myself, like I have too many feelings for one person.  Excited, happy, sad, introspective, awed, philosophical, shocked, calm, sometimes all at once.  If you're trying to decide whether or not to buy this album, I would recommend buying it because you might learn something new about yourself.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is the best! I only wish he could write more quickly as I hate to see his books end. Terrific stories and a character you can relate to. When the book is over, you feel the loss and can't wait for more!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I know this isn't a book for a 16 year old to read but it is very intriguing and very good. Once you get past all the intimacy you can see that it's a story of genuine love. I wish James would write more to this series as it will go far. Every girl deserves their Christian Grey.<br /><br />Laters. x
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I've read almost all of Michael Connelly's books and he never fails to entertain. Terrific writer. Can't put them down until the end then I want more.
0062206044|5.0|These are the best books I have ever read.<br />No kidding, and I have read a lot.<br />Don't listen to whatever people might say... these books are not children books. These are a must read at least twice in your life: once when you're ten, another time when you are already combing white hairs. They are so witty, so critical, Lemony clearly has an outstanding sense of humor... and of life. Oh! And he is very well read, if you are so too you'll understand what I mean when you read them.
0451418441|5.0|I read The Pillars of the Earth and then this followup World Without End and can't wait for the next one to come out to continue this story. Ken Follett is a sensational writer that will keep you hooked right up until the very end! This saga is fantastic! I'm now reading other books of his and am never disappointed.
B000OSC3GM|5.0|Rod Serling wrote the script. Burt Lancaster is the villain. And it's shot in beautiful black and white. One of the greatest cautionary tales of all time! Frankenheimer's direction is flawless
B00A77II0U|4.0|The game had a good back story, although the seek and find sections were a bit redundant, as the same items kept popping up. However, the game was interesting, although it seemed to use a recurring theme.
B000050XEI|3.0|I cannot comment on this product, since I purchased it as a present for another person.<br />However, I have not received ANY negative comments.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this is the best game of all times this is my opionn so I don't know what the others think
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What can I say, its Angry Birds!!!<br />lots of fun, even in the free version<br />I purchased the app on another device, but the quality was the same as the Kindle
0399157565|4.0|Kay Scarpetta's having a hell of a day.  She arrives at her office and opens an email containing a photo of a severed ear. She's due in court after lunch, and wouldn't you know, gets called out to recover a body floating in Boston Harbor. Strangely, the corpse, which appears mummified, is tied up in such a way that it's likely to be pulled to pieces during recovery, so Kay must dive in and figure out how to prevent that from happening. When she arrives late to court, the judge reads her the riot act in front of the jury. When she finally gets back to her lab, it's to find that the FBI has horned into her case.<br /><br />Over the course of thirty six hours, Kay and her team (Lucy, Marino, and Benton) discover and scramble to solve a string of interconnected murders.  Kay and her  cohorts are brilliant people all, but talk about emotional baggage! While struggling with their personal problems, which are heavy, it becomes evident that the killer is taunting Kay. Rarely has she felt more vulnerable or alone.<br /><br />What is refreshing about this, the twentieth Scarpetta novel, is watching four pros who care very much about each other pool their first rate clinical specialties to resolve some nasty crimes; while it's disconcerting and often aggravating to see them at odds with one another, it is this that makes them truly real, truly human. Unlike the characters in some long running series, they do grow older, and along the way, act and react and evolve over time. They stand by each other nevertheless, even after they've hurt each other.  Sometimes, they're a bit paranoid, but then again, who isn't?

B0000T70K4|5.0|For such a slim book, it took me a LONG time to read.  The premise is simple.  The day in the life of a billionaire as he rides in his limousine through New York in search of a haircut.  On the way he has sex twice, an intimate medical which brings worrying news, and he gets attacked with a cream pie by an anti-capitalist protester.  Meanwhile, the US President is in down and the funeral of a rapper is taking place, adding to the traffic chaos.  Someone sack the Mayor for bad planning...<br />Then our billionaire decides, seemingly randomly, that he'd like to kill someone.  All in all, it's an exciting day by anyones standards.<br /><br />I am writing this review from the point of view of someone who has only just discovered DeLillo's work.  Having read Falling Man, also a challenging book in regards language and content, I was prepared to be challenged in this one.  And it delivers, but what we also see is DeLillo's playful side.  He stretches language, tosses it in the air to see what shape it forms when it lands.  He experiments and displays his dark sense of humour.  The dialogue can seem stilted.  I would give an example but that would take it unfairly out of concept.  I would say stay with it.  This is a book that needs to be read more than once. There is so much packed into this slim volume that mentioning it all would spoil it.<br /><br />There are echoes of American Psycho here, as our increasingly (so it seems) sociopathic anti-hero grows progressively more paranoid as the day goes on.  He thinks someone is trying to kill him and he is right, although the dangers he fears are not the ones he should be worried about.  Death is all around him.  A colleague on the television, a random man burning himself to death on the sidewalk, the corpse in the coffin and the assymetrical prostate that causes him unending anxiety.  There could be so many meanings to this book, but I get the ultimate futility of wealth, wrapped up in a dark, maybe unintentionally humourousnovel that is far more complex than it first appears.<br /><br />I can't say if this is vintage DeLillo, but the book stands out as a damning indictment of overblown corporate America, written with a mixture of savagry and wit.  Stick with it and you will be rewarded.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is one of my top favorite games! I gave it 4 stars for the price which I think is to steep. I was able to purchase the game using free Amazon coins so the game didn't cost me any money which I was excited about. It worked well on my Kindle Fire HD with no problems. As I had read the reviews before playing the game I was able to get through the managers office with no difficulty. I have played many games which ended up being disappointing but this one is one of the best. I hope to enjoy more games like this if the price is cheaper but I find $4.99 way too  steep especially in this economy when you have to watch your money. I will definently purchase more of these games when they are reasonably priced.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Absolutely a requirement for any handheld Androids I ever use.  It's rich with features and even has a slick red skin which I quite enjoy.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game!!! If you like military then this your game. It's so fun and the graphics are completely awesome!!! And it is so fun to build your base and become a super power. It is so fun to destroy the enemy and and to build awesome vehicles and troops.
B001F12J48|2.0|well I should have read the print that wasn't there, but I guess it is my fault that I didn't realize that it is not blu ray 3-d, it is not for today's 3D technology flat screen tv, you use the &#34;paper&#34; glasses that come with it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Definitely worth getting!!! Being a fan of Myst, I really enjoyed the pace and having the clues was helpful. Looking forward to the next Room.
1451678193|5.0|First published as The Silver Locusts, this is a collection of short stories about a fleet of locust-like spaceships leaving Earth to settle Mars.<br /><br />In this world the Martian air is just about breathable but thin, and the first astronauts find abandoned city after city with water rippling through canals. They start to see ghosts and gradually we find that there are some living Martians, though perhaps they live only as memories.<br />But Earth is too crowded and people come to settle, bringing juke joints, small homes and beauty parlours - recreating small town America which was Bradbury's home. In one story, the war on Earth escalates and strangely most Mars settlers think they should return - not a great idea when war means nuclear war. A young man left alone decides to find a young woman if one is left, and rings every beauty parlour until he finds one. (This female would have been out securing food.) But his idea doesn't seem so great after a while and he leaves her, stumbling onto a couple of females who are actually androids built by a nutty professor, not that he knows that.<br />Other stories such as Billion Year Picnic at the end tell of a family exploring Mars looking for a city to settle in, knowing that now there is no going back to a devastated Earth and they have become the Martians for real.<br />One or two of Bradbury's stories were omitted from the collection, such as the tale of the ship full of coloured people who left homes in America for a better future, but most of them are more social comment than hard science, a warning that the future of humanity may depend on our ability to leave this planet and a query as to what we will bring and build.<br />Because this was never hard SF it has not dated, so read it as a fantasy or allegory and enjoy.

1400069807|5.0|How The Food Giants Hooked Us is the wry subtitle of this intriguing read. Children too obese to play suffer from diabetes and the early signs of hypertension and heart disease, all caused by diet. Why do the food giants add harmful ingredients and fool us into thinking a yoghurt with twice the sugar content of a sweetened cereal is good for us?<br /><br />SALT SUGAR FAT is the list of three main additives used by processed food firms which make food more alluring, or specific to children's tastes. By the end of the 1990s over half the adult American population was overweight and nearly a quarter obese, healthcare costs were high and linked illnesses such as cancers were on the rise. Adults worked a second job and needed quick food, with no time for exercise. Generals testified in Washington that young people were too obese to recruit while surgeons blamed a rise in maternal deaths on overly fat mothers undergoing problematic caesareans. Yet in 1999 a meeting of CEOs of all the major food companies was presented with the alarming facts and refused to change policies.<br /><br />Low-fat food often contains high levels of sugar, disguised by names such as glucose, fructose and dextrose. Sugar, fat and salt are cheap and useful additives. Neurologists have found that the brain lights up on receiving sugar just the way it does for cocaine, so manufacturers pour it into everything from breakfast cereal to main meals. This empty-calorie filler replaces tomatoes, fruits and grains. Salt brings out the taste of food and fat improves texture, also adding bulk.<br /><br />The tobacco industry and food industry firms in some cases had the same parent company and were undergoing the same threats - from people concerned about marketing to children and ingredients listings.<br />Michael Moss persuaded some firms to make him versions of his favourite products without the additives. Kellogg's made him a saltless cracker which he now found was like tasteless, chewy cardboard. Campbells made him soups with reduced fat, sugar and salt; they were either bland or metallic and bitter.<br /><br />The book contains Moss's visits to molecular biologists and biopsychologists, results of lab rat experiments and comparisons with addictive drugs. We learn the science behind the term 'mouth watering' and see that food technicians experiment to add the three ingredients to food in innovative ways. Diet soft drinks make people prone to eat more and high-fructose corn syrup added to soft drinks makes people eat more and even when they don't they still gain weight.<br /><br />This book is similar to 'Fast Food Nation' - showing the demand for quick, easy, tasty, cheap food; the dubious methods used by industries to protect themselves, such as paying private food health inspectors. Slaughterhouses refuse to supply meat to food processors unless they are guaranteed it will not be tested for harmful e-coli bacteria prior to being mixed with meat from other producers. In Europe we value traceability 'from farm to fork' and at the order of the Irish Commissioner, the whole of the EU area is currently testing the DNA of processed meat products - finds have included pork DNA in supposedly halal meat supplied to prisons and a supermarket own-brand beef lasagne which was 100 percent equine DNA; arrests have been made, meat producers closed and major contracts cancelled.<br /><br />The message of SALT SUGAR FAT is that no matter what we do about banning advertising to children of unhealthy foods, or taxing sweet drinks, the manufacturers are so dependent on their processes, often with government connivance in America, to make profits that they are not going to stop. We need to protect ourselves from this diet with correct nutritional advice and to make the right choices.lls made him soups with reduced fat, sugar and salt; they were either bland or metallic and bitter.<br /><br />The book contains Moss's visits to molecular biologists and biopsychologists, results of lab rat experiments and comparisons with addictive drugs.

B002EXAB5K|3.0|It was a pleasure watching the detail that has gone into the making of this film. New York comes to its full glory in this film. It is however quite long being the extended version and therefore did not keep my attention 100%. It remains a wonderful classic that should be seen by all generations present and future.
1439152802|3.0|Secrets and revenges chase each other in this tale set in England, moving between modern times and various points during the second world war and after it. A mother and daughter never speak of the poisonous tragedy in their family.<br /><br />A murder witnessed by young Laurel in the 1960s has its roots in wartime and her mother's friendships. In 2011 her mother Dorothy lies dying and Laurel doesn't know whether to speak about the crime or just stay in her own acting environment. As she and her sister sort through her mother's things occasionally Laurel glimpses reports of a man called Henry Jenkins. Dolly works as companion to an elderly lady in 1940, swallowing her pride, believing that she would be well provided for in that lady's will. When her mistress dies all Dolly is left is a few coats, and Dolly knows who to blame... a young woman called Vivien. The two tales overlap due to Vivien marrying Henry Jenkins, whom Laurel obsessively traces by records in modern day before she tells her younger brother Gerald the story of the murder.<br /><br />Gentle rural England contrasts with rough wartime London, when people were frightened out of their minds by the Blitz and everyone's lives were altered. Kate Morton recreates her settings with care and piles tensions and responsibilities on her characters, not least keeping a secret that a child should not have to keep. Those who enjoy researching family trees, old scrapbooks and photo albums may potter around in this book to their heart's content. I didn't really feel it engaged me and while the setting descriptions were good, I couldn't take to the characters.
B004AOECUG|5.0|I know there are tons of reviews on this movie out there, but I have watched it in all forms. In fact it was one of the earliest movies created in DVD when they were invented.  I just bought the Blue Ray version and watched it again.  The Blue Ray takes it to a new level in clarity as you would expect.  I love that they kept the subtitle options and alternate language options from the original DVD version because some of the dialogue is so quiet that it is helpful to read along with it so you don't miss a single word. This movie should be in everyone's permanent collection because of the extremely well written story, extraordinary acting by De Niro and what was put into this to make it successful.
B003X2O6KW|1.0|I love this album and bought it because I wanted the hard copy of it but half of the songs won't even play on this disc. Not very happy about that.

0316187216|4.0|Abercrombie's take on the wild west has all of his usual variety and excitement, great characters with flaws galore, and really good, clever dialogue. The storyline sort of ricochets from one hair-raising event to the next, with constant good humor, gruesome violence, and the shadows of past misdeeds riding along as accompaniment for our band of protaganists. Such a mix, and all set in the vastness of the previous world's western expanse. Completely different, yet reminiscent of former books in that the baggage of a bad past follows Logan and others into this new province where the lawless make the rules.<br />A good and satisfying read, if ever there was one.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|My daughter loves to watch this movie. It is very cute and not too scary for the little one. Should probably buy it as many times as we have watched it.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|i actually bought me two of these lav mics, and i've got to say one of the best low cost lavalier mics you can find.<br /> we were shooting out in the open it was very windy and i got great audio no wind at all....

B008KMHFJY|5.0|A crazy romance, literally crazy!! The characters can get a little frustrating with their constant fighting, however I thought it was a great story line with just enough drama. I read it so fast I will definitely be reading it again. I love how there is a book 2 for Travis' POV.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I very much like how this story turned out.  The author leads the reader to care deeply about the characters and I have always thought that to be proof of good writing.
B006Y9BULE|4.0|I have 3 Sieko's and love them all. 1 auto,2 batts. Wanted to try a solar.Really like the looks of this watch(black and red). Reminds me of a vintage Heuer Bundeswehr Flyback Chronograph. Nice finish and detailing. Wish it was a little larger(46-48mm) and had a cyclops over the date(little small).I have 8.5\\" wrists,so it's about right. Also a 22-24mm band would be nice. I swapped out the steel band for a black,4 ring Zulu(more comfort).A black leather Bund strap would really look terrific too!The holes in the case make for easy removal...nice! Keeping excellent time.Overall a very nice watch for around $200.
B005LAIII0|4.0|I did not know what to expect when I watched this movie. It was very different than anything I have seen for a long time. Beautiful cinematography, unique story. The end really got to me. I did like this movie, but I can't say that I would watch this one too often. Only for the fact that it is a little slow starting and it is kind of sad. Other than that, it was done beautifully.
B00BHO70L0|5.0|The Blu ray came in perfect shrink-wrapped condition with the soundtrack. The semi-rough texture on the case was very pleasing to the touch. But the awesome thing was, my PS3 doesn't care about region codes, so I was able to watch it on my projector!

B00BUT5I84|3.0|Thirty Seconds to Mars latest album is a hard one for me to rate, there's a lot of things on LOVE LUST FAITH+DREAMS that I liked and a lot of things that fizzled out for me. By all means this is not a bad album; you can clearly tell that a lot of hard work and experimentation was put into each song. The problem is for all the hype for this record made (releasing \\"Up in the Air\\" in outer space, all the promotion) LLF+D is not a groundbreaking album. It's not average or lazy, it's just not as epic as the band tried to make it out to be. I consider myself a dedicated fan to these guys and will continue to do be one but all of the loyalty aside I have to be honest.<br /><br />What I admired about this album is the experimental approach it delivers. Each song has something different to display and offers no apology, in my opinion that's what makes 30STM a solid band. All of the electronics, string arrangements, and larger than life production are phenomenal; musically the band is stronger and more creative than in their previous albums.  The songs that fill the four sections of the album (LOVE, LUST, FAITH, DREAMS) are filled with unique songs that somewhat relate to their themed titles: The album starts off with the trippy/electronic track \\"Birth\\" that keeps your attention only to hit you with the rocking \\"Conquistador,\\" once that ends you enter the \\"LUST\\" chapter with \\"Up in the Air.\\" Those three songs alone blew me away, after those tracks though the album goes to different places lyrically and musically that dampened my feelings towards it.<br /><br />Stephen Lillywhite (who produced a lot of U2's records) lent his hand in producing LLF+D and did a great job. I'm not sure if it was his influence in the studio but what bothered me a lot is that there are lot of choruses and themes that resemble U2's style of music which takes away from this album being a 30STM album to becoming that \\"U2 sounding record.\\" Lyrics are not a strong point on this album- consisting of the repetitive anthems of rising/conquering and the endless \\"whooas\\" choruses become tiresome. The direction of this album is very uncertain. \\"This is War\\" had a structure and a theme that flowed and burned strong while in LLF+D tends to go nowhere. History doesn't repeat itself on this record but the goals do: all of this \\"going the distance\\" momentum gets old.<br /><br />The songs that grabbed me the most were the odd balls of the album: songs like \\"Birth\\" and \\"Pires of Varanasi\\" are probably my favorites. I also enjoy \\"Conquistador,\\" \\"Up in the Air,\\" \\"Do or Die,\\" and \\"Northern Lights.\\" This album is definitely something to for the fellas to be proud of and I'm sure the material will be a lot of fun to play live. LLF+D is not a disappointment for me; I personally feel that the band shot themselves in the foot making it larger than it really is. Confidence is a good thing to have while making music, but it's another thing when it's something it's not. I really hope that their next album moves on from the \\"anthem\\" themed songs into stepping outside their comfort zone. All of the negative things aside, I love these guys and hope they continue to grow and give us more albums to enjoy.
B007UXSKMU|4.0|I am not usually a Tom Cruise fan but the Mission movies are the exception.  This one is no exception and was nicely done.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I have already read this book twice!  I read it once by myself and then read it aloud to my husband (who is studying to be a video game programmer) immediately afterward.  It felt like I was playing a video game while I was reading the book!  Cute, heart warming, exciting.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can listen beginning to end, without skipping any songs. And then let it start over again. It still makes you want to sing (or shout) along, and yet it mines deeper feelings and ideas as well. It is well written, has moments of irony & humor, without being pretentious. It is unfortunate that none of their further offerings were this solid, with only a good song here or there. That doesn't really matter though. They made one album that is still a really great listen. Most bands are lucky if they get one hit, let alone make something that is a real contribution to rock and songwriting. This did both.
0439023513|5.0|The symbol of the resistance among the inhabitants of Panem became the &#34;mokingjay&#34; the genectic engineered hybrid. The combination mokingbird and blue jay that served to mimic sounds, usually songs. What a creative and innovative use of symbolism. I really do not have any criticism to convey. I look forward to reading about the &#34;Hunger Games: The Next Generation.&#34;
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I find that this is the album I listen to most; hand's down. Like so few other band's, they have managed to create an album that is not only thematically cohesive, but listenable beginning to end. One of those rare 'perfect' albums. I still can't stop listening to &#34;Sick, sick, sick&#34;, because of it's hard driving guitar bridge. I find it pumps me up, gives me energy to get through the day. Same for the punk tinged &#34;Battery Acid&#34;. Guitar riffs on &#34;3's & 7's&#34; always grab me, along with the bitter, biting lyrics. I never get tired of listening to this album because it pairs dark, deeply felt emotion with serious musicianship. My brain gets bored easily and I never get tired of counting out rhythm's for each instrument. Not one note is a throwaway. Everything is precise, except for Josh Homme's voice. Funny how the precision of the instrumentation is what makes the instrumentation fascinating, yet Homme's voice is deliberately blurred, stretched, muttered, altered. By making his voice hard to interpret, you listen closer. It even allows you to interpret what he's saying, since you might not be sure. Listen closely and you will find that Homme's insights and observations are perceptive and deeply felt. I still listen to it often because it speaks for me and yet it still challenges me. I find new things in it all the time. I guess you could say it engages me deeply on all emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and musical levels. One of the best albums ever made.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|You may never eat at a fast food joint again after you see this. On a positive note, it may inspire you to raise your own food!
B00887490Y|3.0|Some spoilers ahead.....<br />I enjoyed \\"The Tall Man\\", but I have some serious questions after watching the whole film.  If Jessica Biel knows who the Tall Man is, and is actually helping him to save these children, then why is she so hell-bent on catching up to the van that has her \\"son\\" in it?  Did she get attached to him, and doesn't want the Tall Man to take him?  At the end, the Tall Man says that one person is dead and Jessica Biel destroyed her own life to save her \\"son\\".  Then why almost get yourself killed trying to save this boy?  I like movies such as this, IF the ending makes sense, which this movie ending doesn't.  Pretty good, suspenseful movie, confusing ending.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|OK, right from the start you know this is a tongue in cheek, high-camp piece, by a master of the genre. The original tunes, specifically the lyrics, are so embarrassingly bad that they're kinda/sorta good: We were cracking up while the opening tune played.  The movie is way too long and the middle bogs down for reasons only known to Tarantino. The action is goofy, the gore over the top to the point where it doesn't even gross you out.  The actors all put in credible work, but the plot is so predictable, almost from the first two minutes.  Pulp Fiction is one of my all-time favorite flicks.  This is NOT that movie, or even close, when it comes to its entertainment value. If you're a big QT fan, you'll like it.
B00006DEF9|2.0|We tried watching the DVD and it kept skipping. I'm sure what is the cause, I've had good luck with previous purchases.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Started with the free version and liked it a lot, so I bought the paid version to support the developer. I ran the calibration tool and it has been extremely accurate ever since. I love how you can customize which battery times you see when you open up the pull down menu. It's a great app if you want to be able to know exactly how much time you have left to browse the internet, read, watch videos, etc.

No mem button, but really does not bother me.<br /><br />The internet access is odd, I turned off my internet and it works fine. l'm pretty sure no one will be watching my calculations to advertise fractions to me.<br /><br />I needed this app when I was in high school!
B0072IVGZG|4.0|One chord strikes out, then four symbol taps, then it starts ripping, and we're off running down the streets on what seems like a drug deal gone bad. So starts \\"Choice Of Weapon\\".<br /><br />Power play order of preference:<br />Honey From A Knife<br />The Wolf<br />For The Animals<br />Amnesia<br />Until The Light Takes Us<br />Siberia<br />Lucifer<br />A Pale Horse<br />Every Man And Woman Is A Star<br />Embers<br />Elemental Light<br />Wilderness Now<br />Life > Death<br />This Night In The City Forever<br /><br />\\"We got the drugs\\"<br />`Honey From A Knife' sounds like it could have been on \\"Born Into This\\" except for the 60's backing vocals, which sing out \\"We go the drugs\\". The image that first comes across is that choosing drugs as your weapon is a bad choice. But according to Astbury, the story behind the song is that he had cut himself on a knife and was running to the hospital in pain. So the \\"We got the drugs\\" might be the hospital itself, calling out to him.<br /><br />\\"Don't be deceived by the liars\\"<br />`The Wolf' is a blistering rocker that every critic thinks is `Sanctuary' clone. Maybe one guy writes a review and then all the rest copy him. Fans are always the best critics, stick to what they say and not the people who are getting paid to write words about bands they do not care about.<br /><br />\\"I came to you with love in my heart\\"<br />Lots of love on this album. Lots of nature references sprinkled throughout. Judging by the cover this would be a back to roots album. Like \\"Dreamtime\\", some of this is Native Americana. `For The Animals' is their take on how the band does what it wants, raw and independent. The song rocks with outright energy.<br /><br />\\"All my senses are torn\\"<br />The guitar attack of `Amnesia' may be the heaviest rocker on the album. That same intense energy is focused here but at a faster speed. The lyrics deal with losing your identity, and interestingly enough they are the easiest ones on the whole album to forget.<br /><br />\\"Cast out these snakes these heathens\\"<br />`Until The Light Takes Us' is pounding rock with a steady guitar and drums blasting away at constant speed. It is a straight ahead burner, there is no deviation in speed here until it does that great downshift at the midpoint. It has that same dark vibe that all four of the capsule songs have.<br /><br />\\"Surrender forever\\"<br />`Siberia'. Man, this one cooks with the cold dark power of bass and drums pumping out a rhythm that ends way too early. This is the only song to me that just seems to end and it should have been given more time as it is such a good grove.<br /><br />\\"You're high for the devil\\"<br />`Lucifer' may be the catchiest song here. Don't go to sleep after playing this one. As the song is about someone doing crack and making drugs their weapon of choice, Lucifer may refer to the drug itself. Not a good thing either way you take it. The song is good, though very basic compared to most of the others here.<br /><br />\\"Love in the shadows waiting for you\\"<br />`A Pale Horse'. After seven straight fast songs we slow done a bit with this one. The start stop of this song runs into a chorus that would make The Supremes happy. Powerful stuff. The loopy guitar solo cranks, right down to its false ending.<br /><br />\\"Running out of the shadows\\"<br />I cannot believe how powerful the capsule songs are once they are taken out of YouTube and put in the context of the album. `Every Man And Woman Is A Star' just rocks! `Everyman' and `Embers' fit so well with `Elemental' and `Wilderness' that you would think they were all written together.<br /><br />\\"Watch your embers turn to flame\\"<br />`Embers' is the love song of the album. It seems like a natural extension of `Every Man'. Pat Boone might actually like it, but Perry Como and his ilk would be crushed by its sonic weight.<br /><br />\\"Every one of us feels alone inside\\"<br />Now we have reached the slower set of songs. `Elemental Light' brings back the textures missing from the last album. And it shows that they have more to say, as lyrically one would think he wrote this one after his Doors stint. There is more going on here than last time around, less simplicity and more lead guitar lines. \\"Born\\" may actually rock harder overall, but this sounds like a studio band compared the garage band of \\"Born\\". There is nothing here as mellow as `Holy Mountain'. In fact if you are playing it loud, you will found there is nothing mellow about this \\"Weapon\\".<br /><br />\\"I see your blackest eyes\\"<br />Guitar and piano lead off the slow paced thinker called `Wilderness Now'.  There is a power here that just hunkers down in the chords and comes across thru the bands passion that they really believe in what they are making. These are not party songs. Once again, this is Native Americana.<br /><br />\\"I lay down with the beasts on the ground\\"<br />`Life > Death' is the slow one here, layered with strings. At the start it almost seems too peaceful for the album. But it builds slowly, adding a little piano and some obscure backing vocals, until Billy adds a ripping lead before it ends in single notes. All these songs have a thought out end, no fades here.<br /><br />\\"Throw your weapon to the ground\\"<br />`This Night In The City Forever' is the most mysterious song here. The dark feeling found throughout this album now comes to the forefront. Ian wails and Billy sets them down. Then it fades away with a single guitar note leaving you wanting more. A good ending to the album.<br /><br />No skippers here, no filler. All these songs sound like they belong together. This is a well thought out work that has good production and great packaging. After a full year of listening to this I would say that none of these songs are among the best they have ever done, but taken all together they create a solid album, one that should not be taken lightly.<br /><br />Death walks right beside me<br />A light shines right behind me<br />Kali...

193700788X|4.0|And so ends the adventures of mind reader Sookie Stackhouse. This final chapter of our favorite bar maid is full of suspense as once again Sookie finds herself in danger. Some of the characters from previous books come back to help her out as she tries to find out who wants her convicted of Arlene's murder.<br /><br />I wasn't able to put the book down because I wanted to know where Sookie was going to wind up and if she'd find a happily everafter. I'll admit I had to know what the final sentence in the book said. I was surprised to find out that what I thought would happen and what really happened were totally different but I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Charlaine Harris could definitely continue on with Sookie's story but it needed to end somewhere and this was probably the best time for that to happen. Most of Sookie's true friends are happy based on how the last book ended and other true friends showed how much Sookie means to them by coming to her aid in this book. Thank you Charlaine for an interesting journey through the world of the supernatural.
B008OW1SAC|5.0|Alt-J has a unique sound and I really enjoy listening to them. I am very glad that I recently started listening to this band because I really love them and look forward to listening to them more and more in the future. Yeah, Alt-J!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Liked It very much. Read the book first and did not think the movie was going to be that good. Was pleasantly surprised.
B0002BO05S|5.0|i have not watched it yet but upon arrival i inspected it and not a single scratch was found on the dvd and it arrived sooner than expected
0425263916|5.0|This book was excellent and it was better than the first one! I dare say it's even better than 50 shades! It's very real and raw, and at times sends such strong emotions through the reader...you might find yourself feeling so angry or distressed over what's happening on the pages!<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the third one. The whole series is really worth your time.
B004J47BNM|5.0|This album is phenomenal, I was listening to it every day on youtube and had to buy it to support them. If you like this type of music you will love it as well.
0425263908|5.0|This was an excellent book! I loved 50 shades and read that before this. I read this because it was recommended to fans of 50 shades and I almost like it more! There's just something more real, and more raw in this book. I feel that this book is much edgier and more real. There's a lot of parts that were hard to read but in the end it was worth it and I hope they have a happy ending for them at the end of it all!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Nice and entertaining.  For the most part light and not too deep.<br />Interesting story lines.  Glad I made the time to watch this.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I can't believe it's FREE!!! PicsArt is way to awesome to be free! It has all the effects I need! Except makeup and hair but it don't matter! I'm so happy to have this app!! Every time I want to edit my pics Picsart is the first one I run to! It has everything! Get it you won't regret it! I know don't and I'm very picky about my photography editors look no further picsart is the best!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Second season continues to be enjoyable.  I especially like how the writers include re-occurring characters and expand on the story lines.<br />Episodes with Michael J Fox are my favorite.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Story has no ending so readers can read into it and have their own endings. It may be satisfying for some, but frustrating for others.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Who doesn't love Monty Python and the Holy Grail?! Unless you have NO idea about Monty Python. Then maybe you wouldn't. But then you would be a turtle stuck under a rock. With giant fangs. Aaargh. Aarr.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Fairly obvious what this book is about.  Great read, giving a slice of life that we've read bits about but have no real awareness of.<br />Recommen
B00BYISQTO|5.0|This is a very good album by The National. Don't look for great surprises or radical shifts of direction - they carry on doing what they were already doing on High Violet and they do it very well - mournful, haunting and to me very beautiful songs, excellently sung and played in their distinctive style.<br /><br />I'll spare you a lot of superfluous verbiage. I've listened to this album a lot (I was fortunate to get an advance copy) and it seems to me that the long and short of it is this: if you like The National's work so far then you'll love this. If you don't you won't. I most certainly do.
0425252868|5.0|I've read many accounts of WWII including \\"Unbroken\\", \\"Band of Brothers\\" , \\"Helmet for my pillow\\" among many others, and I've got to say this was one of the best. The book focuses more on the German pilot, \\"Franz\\", and his wartime experiences, but one gets the point by the end of the book. I hope someone makes a movie adaption of this one!
0764141201|3.0|while the book has a lot of phrasel verbs and idioms, there seems to be no coherence as to the organization. the layout of the book is bad and the exercises and not well written. a student requested the book which is why i bought it. othewise i would have used another book.
B0047S1KMS|3.0|The inevitable zombie apocalypse never comes at a convenient time. People stuck at work or stuck in traffic or stuck in the tubes or stuck in the suburbs or stuck outside the pub. Dramatically, that works nicely so instead of hunkering down and waiting it out, people are forced to move around through a completely inhospitable environment to get to where they want to be. What could be more inhospitable to safety and sanity than a reality TV show set?<br /><br />In Dead Set, a short series for Channel 4 (it's five episodes representing about two and a half hours running time), the British version of Big Brother is having an eviction night, meaning one of the contestants is about to be voted out of the house. We see both the contestants and the behind-the-sceens production crew, though the story is focused on Kelly, possibly the lowliest employee on the set. She's the girl who has to get the coffees and the sandwiches and whatever random things the producers want. And nobody remembers her name, especially the insufferable producer. She's been seeing one of the guys on the set, who apparently has dated just about every female on the crew. Kelly has a real boyfriend in the outside world but she's a little stressed out and confused about her life.<br /><br />The producer is stressed because, as they come to broadcast time, news reports of riots breaking out across England are taking over all the stations. Will they be pre-empted by real-life drama? He uses his rudeness, bravado, and arrogance  to keep  the crew and the housemates ready to go. The show does go on, but the zombie invasion comes right after the station break. Zombies make it into the production facility but not into the sealed-off Big Brother house. The housemates are completely unaware that the rest of the world is falling apart. Of course, they are clueless and narcissistic to begin with, so hilarity and horror ensues.<br /><br />The premise is well-thought out. Kelly's ability to scrounge quickly translates to survival skills in the new zombie paradigm. The producer is also a survivor, having guided many reality shows and manipulated many people into doing his bidding. He gets locked in a green room with someone while Kelly has to face the contestants incredulity and incompetence. A side story follows the boyfriend as he tries to make it back to the set.<br /><br />The zombie gore is full-on and not for the faint of stomach. The satire is also pitch-black and was a little too dependent on familiarity with Big Brother and reality TV (they had actual on-screen talent from Big Brother like Davina McCall). I felt like I missed some of the jests and jabs at the genre. I saw moments that could have been funnier if I'd had the bigger context. The obnoxious yet cunning producer is an interesting if unlikeable character. Kelly and her boyfriend are likeable and keep you hoping for a good outcome. Yeah, right...<br /><br />If you're a fan of reality TV like Big Brother and zombies a la George Romero, you will enjoy this show a lot.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|VERRY interesting loved how the after word was written SAD at the end😥😭  every one should read it 👍THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!! 👏👏👏
B00CL151G4|5.0|(This is a review of the CBS TV series)I've read all of Sir Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. I own the media and have watched all the movies and TV series. All such productions offer much to the average Sherlockian. The CBS TV production is on a par with their best procedurals with interesting updating and twists. However, I am most impressed with the post-denouement segments where Holmes and Watson interact on a more personal, almost intimate level. For example I suggest that the final scene of the Season Finale, \\"Heroine\\" <nice double entendre title that> is a tour de force in writing, acting and directing. In an economy of words, action and emoting we see and feel where Holmes and Watson have arrived as a deductive detecting team as well as a pair of interesting people. I shall be adding the Blu-ray to my collection and look forward to next season.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Buck is the featured hero in one of the great story's in all literature.  You owe it to yourself to read it again, or certainly to read it if you have not read it before.
B004FN1T3A|5.0|I was unable to take the hypnobirthing classes due to time and financial constraints.  This book worked great for me.  I was even able to download the Rainbow relaxation to my phone.  I had an easy and successful natural birth thanks to the techniques learned from this book.  I highly recommend it!!
B00C061I3K|2.0|D.P.'s RAM is a huge disappointment and utterly boring. Aside from the Pharrell hit it's unlikely any other hits will come out of this. Possible remix potential but the retail album is dull.  Make sure you scan through this Album before you purchase it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great songs, very pretty ladies, great story, I have watched it a couple of times now, and I will watch it again.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Of the romance variety ;) I love this movie! There is nothing about this movie that is not amazing. The story line with the stand-ins was really quite unnecessary as they don't really overlap in an important way with any of the other characters and could have been left out so we could have seen more of some of the other story lines... It was amusing, just not necessary to the rest of the stories. My only ONLY dislike is that If LIam Neeson's character were the love of my life, I would seriously hope he didn't move on QUITE that quickly. This movie had almost all my favorite British actors in it and I was just in heaven!
B008N1V11U|4.0|You get all these cool gadgets but then you enter this including open all the doors drafted all the punks but it say I haven't past the level
B002BWQ586|5.0|My interest in zombie related materials is a little more than mild but I'm always up an entertaining read. Not only was the book entertaining, and fun to read, but at times, it almost felt like it was non-fiction. This doesn't need a drawn out review. It's great. Buy it.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headset has a big issue staying connected to the computer, even when different software versions are used and the receiver is placed at varying distances. The times that it is connected has great quality, but constant disconnects causes great problems. Problems that need to be avoided. This headset is now shelved for me.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen many performances of &#34;Les Miserables&#34;, especially on stage. Though Javert was not the best, the other actors and the settings were exceptional. It was more moving at the end than any other performances I've seen.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|I bought this app because I needed a flashlight obviously.  My friend got one on her iPhone 4 s and hers has a strobe light.  That is not a necessity, but it is nice to have.  I also think that the light you get it kinda lame because really it's just a bunch of color on the screen that's really not much brighter than the regular screen brightness on the highest setting.  I wish I was able to use the led light but I can't because kindle dont have cameras on them, but I guess that's not really the apps problem, us it?  Honestly, I expected much more from this app and was let down.  I am too lazy and don't want to spend a bunch of my money to buy a GOOD flashlight.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I'm a fan and have seen several of Cirque du Soleil's performances, whether in person or on DVD. This was second only to &#34;Allegria&#34; in my opinion
B00B4804KS|5.0|It was awesome to be able to watch it in 3d. This is one of my favorite movies to watch.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Definitely worth the $, and once it gets lots of levels it may be better than the others...<br />cuz the new mechanics are really cool
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|Great action movie, just not quite up to par with the other Die Hards, but still a lot of fun to watch and enjoy.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love it, it came fast and had no problems<br /><br />I even have it on right now and it was easy to get on<br /><br />Recommend to all

B005Y423ZC|5.0|She is absolutely a great singer. This CD is highly recommended for everyone. All of the songs are great to sing too.
B00CW665VI|3.0|My thoughts...<br /><br />Going into this book I knew that Drew Evans was arrogant and a womanizer. What I didn't know upon reading this was the fact that he's also a first class prick. To be honest I didn't really care for the guy to begin with. He was very demeaning towards women. He basically treated them as if they held absolutely no value other than to service him and his sexual needs. Having said those things about Drew doesn't mean that I eventually didn't come to like the guy.<br /><br />Katherine. I loved Katherine from the beginning. She doesn't put up with Drew's crap and stands her ground where he's concerned. When I say he's finally met his match that's putting it lightly and I really enjoyed this aspect. I really liked her. Her character is very strong and I couldn't help but admire her.<br /><br />Tangled is written in Drew's POV and while this is something new to me in my reading endeavors it was interesting to read. It was enlightening to see how the male mind works to say the least.<br /><br />For the most part Tangled was a pretty good read. It's rich with emotions and parts of it are funny and I found myself LOL'ing several times, but the religious references within the dialogue left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think it's necessary to say Goddamn or Jesus Christ over and over and over again. It really doesn't add anything to the story in any way and I felt is was unnecessary, but that's just my personal opinion.<br /><br />The sexual scenes within Tangled are really hot and well written. The chemistry between these two was off the charts. Slowly but surely Drew changes throughout the book and I found myself starting to root for him and Katherine. I wanted them to come together and when they did it made for some hot and steamy reading.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed Tangled. The plot made for an interesting read and I'm glad that things worked out for Drew and Katherine in the end. I think Katherine was good for Drew. She made him change his way of thinking and eventually he came to see that women were more than a piece of ass and should be loved, cherished and most of all respected.
B00483ATL0|5.0|I would recommend this CD to everyone. It is one of the best CD's I have purchased. All of the songs are great.

B004E5D2M0|5.0|This is a great series on a great DVD collection. The acting performances are phenomenal. It even has bloopers and deleted scenes.
B00005QB42|4.0|But, I did not like if for deep meditation. To much &#34;Fifth Dimension&#34; type of singing for me personally. Otherwise their voices are beautiful...MO
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you're into a style of show where it's almost more graphic novel than this is the show for you. It's the prequel to Spartacus Blood and Sand and has just as much action. It's great to see the back story of some of the characters. Great show and very graphic.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you love star wars then this is a great purchase. The films look and sound spectacular and the bonus disks are filled with fantastic and funny.
B005LAII80|5.0|Just on time, great quality, nice 3D.<br /><br />The movie... well, it rocks!!<br /><br />One of the best comic book movies of all time.<br />In case you people have forgotten, this movie operates under the same rules as the rest of the films. Sly is not the law... Urban is the law.<br /><br />The world. 7 billion people trying to forget the ruin of the 90's Dredd and waiting for 2012's new mega adaptation.

B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A great story worth reading. What an amazing generation of men and women. This story has to be one of the greats of all time.
B000V63BEU|5.0|This album is OUTSTANDING!!! I don't believe there is anything negative about this album, all the contributing artist did a fantastic job; Bob Marley, his songs, his music, and all the contributing artist blend perfectly, as if they were actually in the recording booth with Bob in the studio. Bob Marley's vision for his music wasn't just caught, but rather expounded with the most intricate and skillful detail. If you're a true Bob Marley fan, I'm sure that you'll appreciate this collaborative artistry.
1400079276|4.0|Initially, I had a problem with this book. Kafka On The Shore is a story of fate illustrated with metaphors. The story is told in both the narrative of fifteen year old Kafka; and through third person perspective featuring Nakata, an elderly mentally challenged man. Murakami tells his story with the use of subplot, on subplot, on subplot; and eloquent, yet detached dialogue. My problem existed because these dialogues, although beautifully written and dropping pure philosophical insight, lacked voice. Kafka, Nakata, and all the other characters all spoke without nuances to set them apart.<br /><br />A few hundred pages in, and subplots seemed non sequitur. I am a patient reader, always regarding works in their entirety, but without clever dialogue, I was beginning to lose hope. Somewhere, about three quarters into the book, Murakami masterfully stitches together these subplots. Like buying furniture from Ikea, Murakami illustrates the pieces in a heap: a nut here, some screws there, and a few planks of faux wood. He assembles the pieces, and the end result is cohesive, and functional. Beauty and sadness are symbiotic. I am convinced the lack of voice was not only purposeful, but expertly chosen by Murakami to be secondary to the interactions of the subplots and characters.<br /><br />Kafka On The Shore was my first Murakami book, and I was not only impressed, but mystified. It provokes the same kind of feelings as the grandeur of nature. Picture staring into a canyon, and feeling futile in the bigness of it all; or being lost in an old forest watching shards of light peering through the leaves. Read this if you liked the Evangelion Neon Genesis series, and reciprocate that if you've enjoyed the book.
B000H0Y0CM|3.0|It was a fun movie. Sonja is hott. I thought her mullet was the only way a mullet could ever be pulled off. It sucks that there wasn't really any character development, or much character at all. Couldn't tell if that was the acting or the script. But it was light and fun and I'd recommend it if you just want to turn your brain off and enjoy some hot chicks with swords.<br /><br />PS. I *love* the subtle lesbianism in the film. Not overplayed, not forced down your throat and tasteful.
B0015442YU|3.0|It's a good movie but it is very predictable and slow to establish.  Typical of most sequels - it just didn't compare with the first movie.  Anthony Hopkins character is great but the supporting cast just doesn't help carry the movie through.
B005D4YHP2|5.0|I love Keen's but I always fret over the price.  When I ordered this pair I remembered the pair I am currently wearing was purchased in 2004.  I wish Keen made vehicles, more bang for the buck
B0038P59A0|5.0|This is a fun move.  Purchased the second one for Christmas--needed to go back and watch the first one, again.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Good movie. Could have been great. Those of us who have grown up on Marvel understand the wisdom of Stan Lee when he stated,  \\"Spider-Man is, and always has been, at the center of the Marvel Universe, but it's success does not come from Spider-Man; rather, this is truly the story of Peter Parker... Peter is the foundation and the very heart of Marvel\\" (Paraphrased). I believe this truth is understood by many, but is sometimes overlooked by the movie industry. Certainly, I believe Christopher Nolan nailed it with the Batman trilogy. Remember how long it took to develop characters, and not just the headliners. Each character had time devoted to them, including the thugs, the detectives, the mayor etc. This is not an easy task, and with precious screen time, directors have to edit and cut portions they devoted great resources to. Still, Nolan both \\"got it\\" and even better, he \\"did it\\". The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made, and should be a required course for up and coming directors. The true depth of the movie is not from special effects- it comes from character development, which of course requires great acting and a genius script. (Bullseye on both!)<br />...Despite the mistakes of Iron-Man 2, this third offering had several great opportunities to do the same, but ultimately blew it. Here are two riveting character developments- character maturing themes:<br />... 1. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts love for one another. It grew throughout 1 and 2, but was not given enough time nor \\"heart\\" in 3. Simply put- they didn't slow down the action and let them interact so that we could get to know them as a couple. Compare and contrast this with Peter and Mary Jane in Spidey 1 and 2. GREAT MOVIES, with deep, interesting, and even \\"real\\" issues that ALL couples face. They grew to know one another, but Sam Rami knew this would take time, and he indeed gave them plenty of screen time to do this: to tease each other, to cry, to misunderstand, to laugh, to sorrow, and ultimately, to grow individually and together! (Read Ecclesiastes- \\"there is a season...\\") Think about how many \\"un-rushed\\" wonderful scenes Sam devoted to them: behind their homes after MJ's father demeans his daughter; their frequent \\"coincidental\\" encounters- yes I know he was in costume, but you felt the heart of Peter and MJ at all times; the encounter in the cafe, interrupted by a car thrown through the window- NOTE, WHAT REALLY MADE THAT SCENE SO WONDERFUL? (Hint- it wasn't the car nor the 8 limbed villain!) Great script- great acting!<br />...2. Tony Starks anxiety- his post traumatic stress. Yes- it's a wonderful opportunity to understand Tony Stark... not Iron-Man. Once again, the concept was great, but the scenes felt rushed. I never felt his anxiety, and a great film maker could have done that to me. (More slower... flashbacks?)<br />....For me, these two great story lines, his loving relationship with Pepper and his severe anxiety condition are a \\"match made in heaven\\"- they are absolutely perfect for each other. Yes, they got it right in concept, but didn't take the screen time to slow down and let this wash over us. I struggle with anxiety, and I only make it some days because of the wonderful woman in my life- my wife of 33 years. Put another way- why did we not see them together more. Guys, you should have given us more of that, and junk 80% of the \\"Iron-Man remotes\\" at the end. The climax was kind of silly- we were looking for something richer- more endearing.... more human. less robotic... something that wouldn't \\"rust\\" like iron.<br />...SPOILER ALERT- DO NOT READ WHAT FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE MOVIE. One last opinion: The \\"twist\\" regarding the Mandarin was brilliant. I never saw it coming! Hilarious, well acted, and really, really clever!<br />...ADD YOUR COMMENTS BY LISTING SUPER-HERO MOVIES THAT GOT IT RIGHT: Where the movie was about the man or woman behind the costume.

B00CL68NOG|3.0|I expected something more from this film. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. Then it was a mother son road trip. It seemed to drag on. Identity Theft has the same in the car road trip scenes in that movie. There was action and it was funny. I guess I felt as if I had seen this before but done better. It was a bore. What is so funny about Barabra Streisand acting pissy before eating a steak in a timed eating competition? Seth Rogen looked like he was bored to be in that scene. It fell flat. Green Hornet should have taught Hollywood Seth Rogen can not carry a film. The bar scenes in the trailer were about that short. I don't know if the editor left the funny on the cutting floor or what happened there.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Lots of twists and turns, and once you might figure out where its heading something else happened. if you like drama, suspense, action then get Season one and watch from the beginning. If you like this, start reading the book series and catch up on things that wasn't in the series.
B009GX7IRA|3.0|Everything about this show has always been top notch...and maybe it still is; but I will have to get back to you on that….after I re-watch it and see if it was just me not paying attention or if it was the writers being way too cryptic.<br /><br />Last 2 seasons have been a triumph BECAUSE of all the great Intertextuality- allusion, self-reference, pastiche and parody<br /><br />This season, not sure.<br />Too often I was left confused, expecting things to be untangled next week, but just more and more knots…and they seemed gratutitous.<br /><br />There has always been 'code words’, the ‘rules’, and things characters knew, but as a viewer could trust they made sense if and when the whole picture came into focus.<br />This season I felt like an outsider.<br />It’s always been worth the wait for the resolution, even if resolution was that nothing was resolved.  But it was a shared experience with the characters.<br />Just not so this season<br /><br />I think they missed opportunities to develop characters….always slow, but may have lost ground this season<br />Skimmed over Ducky's health crisis, Jimmy's marriage; And Tim's either disappearing into the background of there is something big going on in his life and there is nothing to point in either direction….Abby's family situation?…and what the heck with Ziva and Tony? Something is going on but they sure worked overtime to keep viewers out of the loop.<br /><br />Obviously Gibbs has some kind of deathwish, but now there seems to be something completely unknown escalating it.<br /><br />Also kind of missed the weekly cases that too often were over shadowed by whatever is going on with the Vance-Mossad-inter-agency politics and international intrigue<br /><br />NCIS was never a 'keep it simple' show and wouldn't want it to be....but I never felt like a needed a scorecard and a code book before.<br />Go back to what works.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Why I like this so much is that it carries you to a different place. That is what a good book or movie should do. It is not as great as the &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy, but it comes close
B00260HH3K|1.0|The worst movie I've ever seen, real fans of either the shows or manga will hate this. Everything is so wrong, the creators clearly just did not care. From bulmas hair, to gokus age, to leaving out characters and most importantly the character personae. All could of been easily resolved but they just didn't care, having to change things around a little to make it live action is one thing; but destroying everything but the character's names is another. And finally, even if you never saw the show or read the manga, it would still be a bad movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|GREAT BOOK. LOVE IT. I can't stop reading it. So much better than 50 SHADES of GREY. I highly recommended
1451626088|5.0|The characters in Ms. Gregory's books are like old friends.  I enjoyed the same story being told from different points of view.  She really makes the characters come alive and I love the continuing saga.  I try to make sure I read her books in the order that she wrote them.  The history is accurate and I've learned so much from reading her works.  I am about to start the &#34;Wideacre&#34; trilogy.  I can't wait.  If they are anything like the Tudors or Cousins' War books, I know I will have a hard time putting it down.

B00A8ZZ2Z0|1.0|Dear Helloween,<br />Did you review the album before it was released? Apparently not, because in the liner notes Andi Deris And Markus Grosskoph ARE MISCREDITTED-- IN GIANT TYPE. Worse than that, I spent 16.00 on the CD to get better sound quality than a RIP and it sounds terrible. I can barely hear the guitars. It sounds like 3 bass guitars. The album is really one big bass bomb with no clarity or differentiation. There would be 5 or 6 good tracks if it weren't for the F*$#ED UP production. I did re-sale the disc for 3 dollars at CD Warehouse, so I got  some of my money back. Fire your producer and hire Devin Townsend's producer for the next one. I'm glad to see that the band is steering away from silly lyrics, however.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have had several Sony headphones.<br />I like Sony - clear sound, not punchy, and has great high frequency response.<br />My sons have co-opted my MDR V6 for their Xbox, so I had a dilemna - get more of the ones I had or try some newer model.<br />I am glad I tried these - they are very light weight, come with a heavy duty cord that has plenty of length, and is much better at isolating external noise.  For music (of any type) they are truly beautiful.  The light weight makes them comfortable.  I wear them, frequently, in the office (which has a full server rack in it) just to cut the fan noise.  When I do play music, or training files, they delivery crisp response with natural sound.  For the price, I think these are a bargain.<br />Highly recommended.

B000O599ZS|3.0|This movie has received a lot of belated praise from many sources. I say belated because praise was slow in coming to the film as it won no academy awards at the time of its release. For fans of John Wayne it is probably a must see and many commentators say Ethan Edwards, the main character in the film, is John Wayne's best performance.<br /><br />We watched this movie because my wife has been reading an intensely dramatic and graphic book called, \\"Empire of the Summer Moon\\" by S. C. Gwynne which is the story of \\"Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History.\\"<br /><br />My wife read some of the more dramatic sections of the book to me and I was impressed by the barbaric cruelty of the Comanches and their remarkable skill as warriors; their ability on horseback was unparalleled. Having this book in my mind as I watched the movie only emphasized the romanticized version of the old West that Hollywood was creating during the 50's.<br /><br />It was so evident that much of the so-called Texas scenery was all filmed in Utah's Monument Valley with absolutely no concern for accuracy. The appearance of the indians and the other characters was also much romanticized in the movie in typical Hollywood fashion.<br /><br />If you want to watch the movie as a sample of John Wayne's acting then that is one thing; if you're hoping for an accurate glimpse into life in the old West during that time in history then forget it; any similarity is purely coincidental.
B003XDVUEG|2.0|Several years ago I purchased a pair of crocs in the Mary Jane style with a moveable heal strap. Anyway they finally wore out and these were the closest I could find. I miss the heel strap. Also I need a size 8.5 and crocs only come in whole sizes. The nines fall off my feet and these squinch my toes. I'm just sad.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|UPDATE (9/15/13): As others have noted, this version of the blu-ray does NOT contain all of the special features. In a move of sheer inanity, Paramount has distributed the special features to different retailers. Do your homework to find out which features you'll get from which vendor. I took off an additional star in protest of this sleazy marketing practice.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I might be the only person on Earth who liked this movie more than I liked Abrams' Star Trek 2009. Unfortunately, that's partly because I disliked the 2009 Star Trek. But Into Darkness does have stunning visuals, some fun moments, and a much more compelling villain. It seems overall that viewers who don't know much about Star Trek seem to enjoy this movie and Abrams' larger take on Trek, whereas many viewers who do know Trek despise this movie. I'm more of the latter category (I've watched Trek since 1994), and while I don't *hate* Abrams' versions there are serious problems. Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING: I've included spoilers in my review. I found out about some key moments in the film before having seen it. I think in retrospect it was a good thing. There are some moments in the movie that can be maddening for Trek fans and having them spoiled actually allowed me to get my frustration out of my system before seeing the movie. I think I enjoyed the movie more having been spoiled. IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, DON\\"T READ THIS REVIEW.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />I love the beginning of this movie. Basically, Kirk violates the Prime Directive to save Spock. However, Spock reports him and Kirk gets demoted. The story connects to classic Trek and it gives the characters more emotional weight.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really continue with this intro. The rest of the movie follows rogue Starfleet officer John Harrison, who engages in several acts of terrorism against Starfleet. This part of the movie becomes a bit convoluted. Basically, the entire plot is an attempt by Starfleet Admiral Marcus to frighten Starfleet and to start a war with the Klingons, but what a convoluted way of going about it. When Harrison flees to the Klingon homeworld, Marcus sends the Enterprise to Kronos (yes, it's misspelt in the movie) to kill him. This part of the movie is fun, but a bit short on logic. Apparently, nobody thought to make diplomatic overtures to the Klingons to request that they return Harrison. Given that Harrison seems not to get along with the Klingons, it's hard to imagine they'd keep him.<br /><br />I wish the movie had explored the consequences of Kirk's violating the Prime Directive and show Kirk actually struggle to get his command back. However, he's back in the captain's chair within a few minutes. This is fine. It gives the initial scenes a bit less emotional weight, but the second third of the movie is still fun. Where the movie really weakens though is the final third. It basically becomes a rehash of The Wrath of Khan. Things happen way too quickly, without any space to breath and let the emotional impact of events sink in.<br /><br />There are a bunch of stupid plot twists that drove me nuts. Why on Earth was the Enterprise underwater in the beginning of the movie? I'm sure it was because Abrams thought it would look cool, but it makes no sense. Why would Admiral Marcus tell Kirk to fire torpedoes with Khans crew at Kronos? Why not just regular torpedoes? Sure, you could come up with contrived explanations, but like the 2009 movie this movie stretches logic.<br /><br />THE VILLAIN<br /><br />Given that I claim the final third of the movie borrows heavily from The Wrath of Khan, it's worth mentioning that John Harrison is Khan. Yes, despite all denials to the contrary, he is Khan. This is both good and bad. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the few actors who can bring enough menace and charisma to the character to make a believable Khan. However, in this movie Khan's motives are pretty mundane. He just wants to get his 72 crew members back. Khan here has no ambitions to rule the galaxy, no epic quest for revenge. In fact, in one scene, Khan actually tears up when talking about his crew.<br /><br />In short, while there was potential, Khan in this movie just never rises to the level of epic villain. The only reason anybody would care about Khan is because of the legacy of The Wrath of Khan. For much of the movie, Abrams could have substituted almost any other name for John Harrison without changing the villain's role. In fact, by making the villain Khan, I think it forced viewers who had seen Star Trek II to drew too many comparisons with Khan from that movie. It might have been better to just have had a fresh villain, perhaps a human or alien terrorist.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERS<br /><br />As with the 2009 Star Trek, I'm impressed with how well the new batch of actors mimic their counterparts from the Original Series. That said, Into Darkness is even less about the ensemble and more about the Kirk and Spock bromance. There are two problems here. First, one of the key relationship dynamics in the Original Series was the three-way dialogue between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock represented logic, McCoy represented emotion, and Kirk was the balance. However, in the Abrams movies McCoy has been relegated to a background character and to compensate has taken Kirk to an emotional extreme. I think there's a real opportunity missed for a band of brothers relationship between the three men.<br /><br />Second, Spock is just too emotional. I don't mean that Vulcans never have emotions. However, in the Abrams movies, especially Into Darkness, Spock's default is emotional. This becomes particularly bad near the end, when Spock becomes enraged, yells \\"KHAAAAAN!\\", and goes off to chase Khan. The problem is that we never see Zachary Quinto's Spock as the cool, collected, logical Vulcan we see from the TV series and original movies. It's fine to show Spock's emotional side sometimes,but making him too emotional minimizes those moments.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY<br /><br />This is really where the movie shines. Abrams really knows how to paint a pretty picture. The intro sequence with the red planet and the white aliens with yellow robes was wonderful. The battle scenes are intense and when the Enterprise takes damage it really appears pretty damaged. Despite my other complaints, I do wish other Star Trek movies looked this good.<br /><br />That said, the movie just doesn't slow down. There's no room for viewers to breath and absorb the emotional impact of events. Nicholas Meyer, director of Star Trek II & VI, says it's important to make some scenes special and some scenes mundane. However, in Abrams' movies, all of the scenes are so bold and busy that viewers really don't get a sense of which, if any scenes, are special (perhaps except radiation chamber scene). It's like a roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs but to straightaways.<br /><br />THE ENDING<br /><br />As I said above the final third of the movie was the biggest disappointment. There's a situation where Spock grieves for Kirk. It's pretty much a direct rip on Wrath of Khan. I'm fine with a subtle homage. But what really frustrated me was that the end sequence is just a big fistfight between Khan and Spock. The scene lacks any tension and moreover takes place on a moving transport shuttle on Earth in broad daylight. While I think Abrams usually gets the visuals right, here the visuals were not only silly but also didn't provide a climax for the final battle. There was no battle of wits, just a pedestrian brawl.<br /><br />One reviewer (I think the Transporter Room 3 podcast) said it best: at this point, the characters haven't earned this ending. We've only had one movie before this one with Kirk and Spock. It's not clear how that emotional became so deep. It just doesn't work when viewers know that Kirk will be resurrected. I think the ending could have been just as effective if Uhura had died, and made more sense.<br /><br />THE VERDICT<br /><br />Overall I give Into Darkness 3.5 stars. It's better than the 2009 Star Trek in my opinion, but Abrams still doesn't seem to understand Star Trek. This is all popcorn movie with little intellectual or emotional heft. More importantly, Abrams seems a bit too willing to make large leaps in logic and to fall back on action sequences rather than develop the plot. I'd still recommend seeing it. Despite my complaints, I did enjoy the movie and I'll buy the blu-ray. It just lacks the thoughtfulness of Star Treks II and VI, and that's a shame. If Abrams does make another sequel, I'd recommend he watch Star Trek II and VI, but not just to copy the plot twists, but also the thoughtfulness in those films.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|How do you describe something abstrac, such as &#34;funny&#34;?  Well, my tried and true method is to simply say:  &#34;Fawltey Towers&#34;.  In my liffetime---i'm 71---I have seen many, many comedies but only two stand out as &#34;pure&#34; comedies, Amos 'n Andy and Twafley Towers.  You can trace its pedigree blood-line all the way back to the Commedia d'ell Arte.  This is laff-a-minit, farcical, slap-stick, good-for-what-ails-you comedy that is is worth two or three times the price of admission.  These thirteen episodes can give you six-pack abs from the laughter you will experience.  So, stop fooling around and do yourself a favor and get this DVD!

B009G8GRX6|2.0|I tell ya'.  I had such high hopes for this one.  After &#34;...Problematique&#34; and &#34;Absolution,&#34; I really have grown to see Muse as a go-to but their last two albums (this one included) have just been kinda 'blah.'  I only really listen to a couple of the songs and even those I  don't bring up too often.  I wind up preferring their older albums, actually.

B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I love this!<br />My Dad got it for me when I got home from college and though it took an afternoon to get it down, I have so much fun using it!<br />So far the only annoying thing is that a few of the controls are a little sensitive, like the tap. But honestly it's so worth it to wave it at the TV and have it turn on!<br />Keep in mind that it can only be set to one remote at a time, and only 13 commands. So if you want it to control your radio, you have to reset the commands and it forgets the old ones it was programmed to. Still, it's incredible.<br />Hope this helps!

B008YWY0HK|4.0|Brave(2012) is a solid, well-made Disney-Pixar movie. It's packed with side-splitting gags and a convincing, colorful 16 year old heroine. Kelly MacDonald is the voice of the red headed, blue eyed Princess Merida. Merida has to repair the damage after her mother is turned into a bear by a witch's spell! The story takes place in a mythical Scotland. Brave took Pixar 4-5 years to make. This CG animated film is packed with crisp, visually stunning images. There's action and a little drama and pathos. There's funny moments such as a horse slapping Merida's face with its tail. Brave is worth owning on Blu Ray and DVD.
1416955070|4.0|It wasn't as bad as some reviews make it out to be. Yea there were moments when I thought this is just like (insert book here) but it seems like a lot of reviewers are trying to find similarities and point them out. There are far too many books in this genre, especially the young adult ones that you can do that with and it would lead you to not enjoy the story. It was an okay book. Decent story, typical characters, nice world build, a lot of action. Not a great plot twist in the story just because of how it was done in my opinion. I still liked it enough I will read more of this series and probably check out the movie when it comes out. I can definitely see the movie potential.
B001GQSY5K|2.0|Star Wars The Clone Wars(2008) is the pilot of the TV show of the same name. This pilot was released in movie theaters as a feature film. It takes place between Star Wars Episode II(2002) and Star Wars Episode III(2005). It's considered one of the worst Star Wars movies. Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Padawan Asohka have to rescue Jabba the Hut's son. Jabba the Hutt also has a flamboyant cousin in the \\"Hutt Clan\\". Samuel L. Jackson, Anthony Daniels, and Christopher Lee lend their voices to this CG film. The music score by Kevin Kiner is decent and he borrows a couple of music cues from John Williams. The CG rendered action scenes are good. Fans of this show claim that the quality improved over time. On You Tube, there's a spoof of a Goyte song called The Star Wars That I Used to Know! This film is somewhat violent for a cartoon. This is more \\"product\\" from the Star Wars franchise.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|So weird and very inappropriate but amusing. Overall I loved it. Couldn't believe how vulgar it got but it kept me interested.

B00168HARG|5.0|Another great show gone far too soon... I really liked the idea of Cameron's Terminator.  You never knew what to expect, and there were always surprises in regard to her emotional depth and development.  This would have worked as a love story also -- odd couple and all.

Or, maybe Mr. Boyles, no, Moseley maybe? taking a better look at Thomas? And why are the Women always sick? Dearest Mr. Branson dropping a tray, clutching his heart?....I could go on &on&on....but, alas, I am not the writer.

0307951529|5.0|This is a wonderful book about many different ideas from people who are successful in small business and how they got there.  This is a small book, with many &#34;big ideas&#34;  about getting started with little or no resources. I enjoyed this book so much that I bought one for my friend who is retiring and might use some ideas here to earn a small income doing the things she already likes to do. The book is well written, easy to read and not too technical. Highly recommended for people slightly squeamish about venturing out on their own little business!

B000AP04FG|5.0|When I originally bought this movie I said to myself someday those two are going to get married in real life, and what do ya know..I was right? I'm never right. Great movie, I'd definitely buy it again, and again. New movie still in original wrapping.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|You'll have to get over the fact that this movie did really well keeping to how people acted and how society was in the old west.  So many people get butt hurt over the language and slurs, but honestly this is a big boy movie and you need to put your big boy pants on before watching... figuratively speaking. The story line is great and a does really well showing a black man rising from the ashes and becoming something.
B00005JNX0|5.0|We bought this movie to add to our home collection and it's great. We love Chris Rock in it he really makes it over the top humorous.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|What is wrong with many of the people in my generation (and on down).  Lets blame everyone else on our problems, because we aren't doing anything wrong. Its them, no me (us).  A story about two parents that have two great kids that are doing well, but with all their problems with their jobs, marriage, and getting older they nearly screw the family our of normality.  I wanted to smack these two all movie long and say grow up, your flipping 40 and have kids.  I know kids in their twenties that could handle their problems better.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I am so glad to have this film in my collection. It is worth watching again and again.<br />The ideas and images stay with you long after watching it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Sometimes you really want to dig deep and let you inner child out, this movie does great.  Mainly because it digs into our inner child with games most of us used to play (if you grew up in the 80-90s).  Plus it has a good twist of games used now-ah days.  Enjoy!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series, because of the characters, the writing, the acying and the setting.<br />Please could I live in a castle - just once.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|I found this book to be refreshing. The story is so simple, yet it really drew me in. I enjoyed the grittiness of childhood during the depression, and around that time.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A most beautiful film. A wonderful picture of how we each view life from such different places.<br />How we are shaped by life and still love every minute of it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I only got mine yesterday, but I am in love. The price was great too. I like how it automatically shuts my Kindle off and turns it on. I also like that I can prop my Kindle up for reading and viewing.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Excellent packaging. Would recommend it to any Alien fan out there. A must have in any DVD collection. Would be a bonus if it was released with Prometheus? But still good..
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I got this because it said it unlocked special camera items on the Kindle Fire. I expected it to take pictures from the other side. It doesn't. I don't think it does anything special except allow the user to set up a camera timer.
B005LAIGZU|3.0|I did not expect much of this movie so I was not disappointed.  It was good and entertaining but as a depiction of actual operations I think it fell short.  Of course what the subjects of the movie do is classified so it could only be so realistic.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This is a complete rip off. You pay 3 buck then have to pay 2 bucks 10 minutes later. My son hated it and wanted to go back to Seasons.
B00275EGX8|4.0|I would have given this five stars except for some scenes, like the drunken fraternal brawl, which I felt were unnecessary.  I guess they were put in to relieve the tension but tension is what this movie is about and the air of tension did not need to be suppressed, even a little.  Overall it was well-acted and realistic.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a touching story about growing up, overcoming obstacles, being happy within, inner beauty and strength, friendship, the love of a parent to their children, kindness, standing up for others, bullying, bravery, and love.  I recommend everyone read this book.  I am going to reread it to my kids.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I saw this first in the theater and had to have to Blu-ray to view it at home. This is not a movie for the squeamish. The scenes of torture are graphic and, I believe, very realistic. But, underlying all that is the intricate story of how the US tracked down the biggest criminal of our time and brought him to justice. I thought everyone in this picture did a credible job of portraying what actually happened (as far as we know from media reports and what the government will tell us). There is no doubt in my mind that we are in a war which our enemy intends to win and will never stop trying. The death of Osam Bin Ladin did not and will not stop it. This story, while it may seem to be an ending, is not and there will probably be more tales like this for God knows how many more years. But, this picture was a well-acted and vivid portrayal of what the men and women working to protect us and avenge us are going through.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is definitely one of the best rap albums I have. Most of the songs are good. They are better than most of the modern rap. And not only to you get a hard copy of the cd you also get the whole album in MP3 format so you can listen to it now.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I have seen this before on DVD.  It is the same movie, of course, on Blu-ray, however the images are sharper and the sound seemed better.  This story never ceases to interest me because, in part, I know someone who was on the ground there.  Also, the foolhardiness of the mission never ceases to amaze me. As a veteran myself and a keen observer of military history, I can readily see the warts in the plan and the over-confidence by leadership which led to this incident.  It is a story of bravery and professionalism but I wish it had never happened.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has definitely gotten lots of use in my household. You see i am in the army and living in the middle of the desert, where i am from you can hear crickets and night life. Well this app has that and I have slept so peacefully listening to the night and thunder selections. I would have never thought a free app would be this great.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|What can you say:  Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stuart in their heyday, and a great cast altogether!  Great antics
B00992CF6W|4.0|Overall it is just like the pc form i already have. However it feels to me like it has problems with movement, and also it does seem to lack in quanlity versuses the computer form.It also needs clarification for farming. Otherwise it plays well when going survival.
0307913090|5.0|Thoughts on Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One<br />[Audio book, Unabridged] [Audio CD]<br />George R.R. Martin (Author), Roy Dotrice (Reader)<br /><br />Ok... most of my buds know I am a big fan of the HBO series.<br /><br />On Amazon here: [[ASIN:B008CLI4N4 Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season]]<br /><br />And while I own the paperback version ([[ASIN:0345529057 A Song of Ice and Fire, Books 1-4 (A Game of Thrones / A Feast for Crows / A Storm of Swords / Clash of Kings)]], I haven't been plowing through it as fast as I want to (wacky things like, the farm, MS, and life keep getting in the way.)<br /><br />However, Sally and I on our recent trek to Toronto for Pinballapalooza (to support the Stratford Festival's production of Tommy: http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/OnStage/productions.aspx?id=20233&prodid=47004 ) we started listening to A Game of Thrones on Audio book.<br /><br />I cannot heap enough praise on the production of the unabridged edition of this book in Audio book form. Roy Dotrice does a phenomenal job of reading and imbuing each character with a distinct voice. This is very impressive for a series with so many characters. The audio itself is well recorded, crisp and clear and picks up the different intonations of Dotrice perfectly.<br /><br />This is the kind of audio book I like - unabridged, the entire original book. Read word for word. With appropriate vocal modulations to help you keep characters straight when listening. I found it much easier to keep track of who was doing what where from the audio book than I did the HBO series (which cuts \\"a bit\\" too much in some parts.)<br /><br />I have listened to some of the \\"fully dramatized\\" versions of audio books. Most notably I listened to the BBC's dramatized versions of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. I have not enjoyed them as much as the straight unabridged versions, as in order to \\"fully dramatize\\" there are usually sound effects, music, and worse modification of the text of the book to fit the story into more of an audio-play format. Given I am a fan of the original source material, whenever there is something dropped or added from the text, it jars my suspension of disbelief and takes me out of the book.<br /><br />Roy Dotrice treads a fine line. He does give each character a unique voice, and \\"acts\\" the books. But there is not any distracting music or sound effects, and Mr. Dotrice sticks to the source word for word. His narration of the book is spot on and absorbing. What's more, my wife, who is not as much of a Fantasy fan as I am, also found it absorbing and can't wait for the next chapter and next book.<br /><br />The number of books in the series is another big plus. Mr. Dotrice has recorded not just the first book, but the first five books in the series all unabridged. My wife and I look forward to listening to all of them. It is our hope he continues and does books 6 and 7 as soon as George R.R. Martin completes them.<br /><br />If you like fantasy novels, character driven stories, or stories told from a character (or different characters' perspectives), I highly recommend Game of Thrones. If you want to watch some great drama on TV, try the TV version (or try Battlestar Galactica or The Walking Dead). If you want to listen to a great story told well... try the audio book version. They are all good and worth owning and reading, watching, or listening to.xt of the book to fit the story into more of an audio-play format.

1438074085|5.0|Well written, good example and exercises for all sections. I will be very well prepared for the test with this book and  will not need any additional material.
0525457585|5.0|My son loved it. He started reading it and could not put it down. Will probably read the other books also by the same author.
B000S66XR0|5.0|One Of The Best LP's Of ALL Time. Love every Track. Distictive sound only Boston can create. I recommend this to anyone who loves Rock music
B00BYISQTO|5.0|I'm a big fan of all of their albums and this one ranks right up there at the top.  Such extraordinary songs and lyrics.  \\"Pink Rabbits\\" and \\"Slipped\\" might be two of the best songs they've ever created.  It always takes me a few listens before I can get into an album (as is did with \\"High Violet\\", which I am now obsessed with)... but this one was gold from the start in my eyes.  I am a big fan of their lyrics...  \\"there is a science to walking through windows without you\\" is just one example.  I would say \\"Fireproof\\" is likely the weakest on the album, and even it is a solid track.  I give this one an A+.
0399226907|5.0|My daughter is now 16 so the time for this book is sadly far gone. When my wife was cleaning out the close, she had a stack of books and there were three that were TOTALLY off limts. Miss Spider's Tea Party, a Winnie the Pooh book and The Hungry Caterpillar. I remember reading this to my daughter many times, the corners are all chewed and it is well loved. This is a great story to teach children to read. Kids love it and I could read it over and over because she liked it so much. I look forward to reading it to my grandchildren some day....and Miss Spider's Tea Party.

B0049P1VHS|4.0|Keeps you to want to keep watching and is not just the typical Zombie series it keeps your interest to want to see what happens next
B004WR125O|5.0|I was worried as to how this would work after all the negative reviews.  I've got it plugged into a tx-NR616 in the back.  Set up is easy, just make sure you press the USB(B) button to use the back USB slot.  All I had to do was type in my password and it worked perfectly.  To give you a sense of how well it works. The receiver is 40 feet from the wireless router.  In those 40 feet, the router is on a different story, there are three walls, a set of double doors and the 616 is inside a built in, solid wood cabinet.  They are the worst possible conditions for wireless and it performs perfectly.  Listening to Interned music and the songs load instantly and without hesitation.  Exactly as you would expect from a wireless product.  The fact you can get the dongle for $20 is even better.
B006C45CFG|3.0|It is a movie to watch one time it was OK and I am glad to have rented it to watch.
B008KZVNFS|5.0|The lead actor and actresses in this film were excellent in their characterizations of the protagonists. Benedict Cumberbatch,  Rebecca Hall, and Adelaide Clemens were outstanding in this film about a spoiled, evil wife (Hall), a husband who tried to do the right thing both in his marriage and in his military service (Cumberbatch), and the young woman (Clemens) who...you will have to see the film to find out the ending.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
0307913090|4.0|For fans of Martin, this audiobook is fantastic. There are characters a plenty, they all have voices of their own, and the reading is unabridged. Highly recommended.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Didn't mess with the heroine's looks as they planned to do! An online petition made sure that Merida would be faithful to the author's depiction of her princess. It is a great story and one that shows that girls and women can, in today's society, depend on themselves to solve their problems if they so wish.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.

B006QS0PF0|5.0|I found this book really interesting.  I watched Ally McBeal while it was on and seeing the weight changes of both Portia and Callista was disturbing.  Reading Portia's book was very spellbinding.  I am not one to read celebrity books but this was well worth the read. I don't have and never had an eating disorder but this showed how horrible they can be.  A wonderful, open and truthful account of her life.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Wow, what an amazing story!<br />I highly recommend this :)<br />There must have been a reason why he was veiled from fame during his youth.
B00AEFXKUI|4.0|It had been several years since I had seen &#34;Braveheart&#34;, and it was even better than I remembered. Terrific story, great cinematography and wonderful acting (yes - even Mel!)  It would be a hard one to watch over and over, but is well worth seeing once in awhile.  If for no other reason than to be reminded of what people have endured in the past to earn their freedom and to receive a lesson in integrity - something our politicians in Washington could certainly use!
B000TGJ80S|5.0|Gary Oldman gives an creepy compelling performance and forgeddaboutit it's from Francis Ford Coppola The supporting cast is top caliber. Movies of this level never grow old.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I got this as my very first kindle book, I am glad that Sean promoted his next book, so I bought 3. Sean is a great author, I read inspirational books a lot, this book and author are inspired from the greatest DESIGNER, in order to inspire others to bring out the greatest potential, just like Nikola Tesla tried to help all humanity.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|NOTE: There are plot spoilers in this review that were unavoidable as I wanted to sensibly talk about the music and its context within, and impact upon, the film, If you haven't seen the film yet, I might suggest waiting to read this until you have.<br /><br />The second of director J.J. Abrams' newly-revamped \\"alternate timeline\\" Star Trek movies is Star Trek Into Darkness, one of the most anticipated films of the early summer months of 2013. Set one year after the events of the last Star Trek film, Into Darkness finds Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and the crew of the Starship Enterprise - First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto), Chief Medical Officer Bones McCoy (Karl Urban), Chief Engineer Scott (Simon Pegg), Navigation Officer Sulu (John Cho), Communications Officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Ensign Chekov (Anton Yelchin) - on a mission to observe a primitive humanoid race on a distant planet. When one of the crew members finds his life in jeopardy Kirk is forced to violate the Starfleet prime directive of non-interference in order to rescue him, and upon his return to Earth is demoted by his commanding officer, Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood). However, things suddenly change when a mysterious terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) attacks a Starfleet installation and murders several high ranking officers, before fleeing to Kronos, the home world of the brutal and warlike Klingon race. Given permission to go after Harrison by Starfleet Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), and with a cache of prototype photon torpedos on board, Kirk and the crew sets off on a covert mission... but before long doubts about Harrison's identity, and his motivations, begin to surface.<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness, a few logical fallacies aside, is a superbly entertaining sci-fi romp, with an appealing and likeable cast that has grown admirably into the roles previously occupied by William Shatner and company, witty dialogue, some wonderfully exhilarating action set pieces, and several pertinent political statements regarding terrorism, drone strikes, and the nature of revenge. It's visually spectacular, with state-of-the-art special effects and some truly awe-inspiring shots, and has a great score by Michael Giacchino, who builds on the musical style initiated in his first Star Trek outing in 2009, and augments it with several new themes and motifs for the new aspects of his musical universe.<br /><br />Several of the three themes from the first Star Trek - including the main Trek Anthem and the theme for Spock - feature prominently in the score, giving the two films a pleasing sense of musical continuity. Both the A- and B-phrases of the Anthem crop up regularly: on noble horns during the first moments of \\"Logos/Pranking the Natives\\", on searching strings in \\"Sub Prime Directive\\", and with chaotic dissonance and skewed chord progressions in the torturous \\"Earthbound and Down\\", for example. Later, \\"Warp Core Values\\" and \\"Buying the Space Farm\\" cleverly echo the emotional sacrificial elegy from the first Star Trek score which accompanied George Kirk's death on the USS Kelvin, linking the fates of father and son. The music segues into a beautiful, ghostly version of the Trek Anthem complete with heavenly choir, before climaxing with a gentle solo piano rendition that is wonderfully poignant.<br /><br />The film's main new theme is the motif for the terrorist John Harrison. A slow-burning, languid, slightly feline-sounding theme for slithering strings and an undulating six-note rhythmic counterpoint, the theme actually first appears as a pretty, idyllic variation in \\"London Calling\\", where the menace provided by Harrison's presence is masked by elegant rhapsodic pianos and a lush, classical aspect. It makes its first full-fledged appearance two minutes into \\"Meld-Merized\\", announcing Harrison's destructive intent, and later makes its way into the sinister \\"Brigadoom\\", where Kirk and McCoy interrogate Harrison to strident string pulses,eerie glass bowl effects, and subtle allusions to Harrison's musical identity that grow bolder and more elaborate as the cue progresses to to the film's big reveal moment.<br /><br />Perhaps most ingeniously, Giacchino blends Harrison's theme with fractured statements of the Star Trek anthem, playing against one another, to accompany Kirk and Harrison in the daring \\"Ship to Ship\\" space jump sequence, offset by dancing string lines and frenetic, anxious percussion writing. This is the third of the score's four main action set pieces, all of which raise the testosterone and blood-pressure levels considerably. In the first, \\"Pranking the Natives\\", Giacchino introduces light-fingered tribal drums, a tingling hammered dulcimer, and leaping, prancing string-and-woodwind runs to accompany Kirk and McCoy sprinting through the red-tinged forests of Nibiru, fleeing from the yellow-clad, white faced natives. In the subsequent and similarly-orchestrated \\"Spock Drops, Kirk Jumps\\", Giacchino re-arranges the B-phrase of the Anthem into a new form which seems to be channeling Howard Shore and his stepwise whole note ascending scales from The Lord of the Rings, possibly as a subtle and very clever fanboy allusion to the Nibiru volcano and its fiery cousin in Mordor.<br /><br />The second action sequence - and the second new musical idea - is for the Klingon race, which makes its most prominent appearance in the show-stopping \\"Kronos Wartet\\". Jerry Goldsmith's rattling, percussive Klingon motif from the original Trek films is well established, and although Giacchino's take on the characters is different, it is no less effective. A mixed voice choir chanting in the Klingon language and a dark, descending motif for low brass and anvils is woven through a brutally powerful action sequence for the full orchestra. The actual brass motif, somewhat unexpectedly, reminds me of Alex North's growling motif for Vermithrax the Dragon from the 1981 score Dragonslayer, and conveys a similar senseof fear and danger.<br /><br />The final action sequence, \\"The San Fran Hustle\\", is a hard-hitting, propulsive, full-orchestral chase through the streets of San Francisco, and features a wonderful re-arranged version of Spock's theme as an action motif. Whereas in the first film Spock's theme was a dreamy lament for erhu and cello, his theme as heard in Into Darkness is full of staccato strings, snare drum licks and punchy brass phrases, accompanying Spock's full-throttle sprint through the rubble in pursuit of his quarry. The finale of the cue sees Harrison's theme get another major workout in counterpoint to Spock's theme, a guest appearance from the Star Trek Anthem A-phrase as the cavalry arrives, and even a brief allusion to Gerald Fried's classic original series fight music as Spock goes all pon farr on Harrison's ass, before it eventually climaxes in a frenzy of percussion.<br /><br />A lovely, sentimental performance of Sandy Courage's legendary Star Trek TV theme anchors \\"Kirk Enterprises\\", before the album closes with a large-scale concert version of the main theme, complete with a full and spine-tingling choir. A bonus cue, \\"The Growl\\", is a J.J. Abrams-penned piece of annoying electronica that features as source music in a nightclub sequence, and can be quickly skipped over.<br /><br />What I like about Star Trek Into Darkness is that, with this score, Michael Giacchino has firmly cemented the musical identity of the new Trek universe. The Star Trek Anthem is now clearly established as the new theme for the franchise as a whole, sitting as equals alongside Courage's original series theme, and Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece work for the 1979 movie and the subsequent Next Generation TV series. Which one you like best is clearly a matter of taste, but the nay-sayers who originally decried Giacchino's theme as unmemorable must now be forced to eat their words. Not only that, Giacchino's mastery of the orchestra, his clever variations on pre-existing themes,his knack for exhilarating percussive action, and his intelligent application of thematic ideas, makes Star Trek Into Darkness a worthwhile entry into the pantheon of Trek scores, and the first satisfying blockbuster score of summer 2013.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Hard to match the first in this series, But still an ok movie. The action, of course, is the redeeming part of the flic. Good acting and direction allow one to get involved in the period of this mystery.
0385532458|5.0|Awesome book !!! Very hard to put down. Love the short story concept that was so good that it made me to read the book twice. You will not be disappointed with this choice.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I own all four of their albums now and for me, Love Lust Faith + Dreams is, hands down, the most brilliant jewel in the MARS crown. I absolutely enjoyed the prior albums (S/T, A Beautiful Lie and This Is War - ahhhh, love End of the Beginning and Buddha For Mary and Attack and The Kill and Hurricane and Night of the Hunter and a host of other songs!) - what stunned me about LLFD was the combination of the most gorgeous lyrics I've ever heard combined with some of the most glorious and, in some cases, heart-shattering music I've ever heard - and I offer as a sign of this the fact that I've had the ENTIRE album ON REPEAT ever since I got it several hours ago (my repeat loop is currently on its 10th iteration). If forced to choose, I'd say my top favorites (by a hair!) are The Race, Up In The Air, Conquistador, Northern Lights, Bright Lights, Do Or Die and Pyres Of Varanasi.<br /><br />I'm exceedingly picky with my songs - yes, even with the prior MARS albums :) - and prior to LLFD I'd never ever (in over 15 years as a music lover) played ON REPEAT an ENTIRE album. The craftsmanship of this album - the multiple layers of sound and instrumentation, the symphonic touches, the superbly and innovatively textured drums, the most jaw-droppingly staggering guitar riffs, and the gritty passion and sheer beauty of the vocals - are all immensely staggering for me. And, for this reason, I heartily wish I could give Jared, Shannon and Tomo an enormous THANK YOU MARShug for giving me the very first album I've ever loved. Ah, I do so love my music...
098555780X|5.0|Great reference book for anyone doing paracord projects.Lots of different style ties or patterns to choose from to change up the look of your crafts.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Everything about this Movie rocked. Action, Story, Thrill, Suspense etc<br /><br />I wish every action movie can be as good as this one....period
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|It's mostly disco music with very little electronic or techno. I've got all their other albums and I'm already putting this one on the shelf. They (Daft Punk) even said it sucks. I wish I could return it. I wasn't up for slow music at all. I don't care much for disco either.<br /><br />[Sales for \\"Random Access Memories\\" reportedly dropped 73 percent as the album sold 92,677 copies in its second week. While a second-week dip in sales can be expected, a dropoff this large after a strong, but not record-breaking first week, is surprising.]<br /><br />I'm not the only one that thinks it sucks... What the hell were they thinking going from Homework to Tron and then all of a sudden this crap???
B0019I6WDG|5.0|Hands down one of my favorite movies. I've had an Amazon account for years but this is officially my first review of anything. It's that good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awsomg game 2 play very addictive you will never wanna put this game down cause I dnt
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But found it to be a little dull and the &#34;added&#34; scenes were unnecessary considering the body of work they had to pull from.  I enjoyed all of their casting choices immensely and the cinematography was visually stunning. My biggest issue was the story (the screenplay of course, the Tolkien source material was a work of art). That being said, I think part 2 of this series is going to be a great story and for those who haven't read the books (I say books because I think they will be drawing material from the Silmarillion) Part 3 will take some viewers by surprise.  I will still go see parts 2 and 3 at the theater and will by the Blu-ray disks too so clearly I am not that disappointed.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|My husband and I are therapists and this movie helps us to relate....  ha.. its so wild... It's a good movie, we recommend it.
1455523003|5.0|Wonderfully refreshing debunking of an avaricious, heartless megalomaniac, &#34;Romanian poisoned dwarf&#34;.<br />This should be compulsory reading in every Roman Catholic seminary.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The movie doesn't do the book justice.  It pulls you in from the beginning and emits her pain and fear having escaped her abusive cop husband.  I couldn't put it down.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|They darker they get, the better they are.  Dexter keeps you guessing, but still rooting for him to get more bad guys
193700788X|2.0|Very disappointed. Far fetched plot trying to pull too many past characters together. Boring ending - easy way out.  So sad. Hoped for more.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you are a fan of the movie or books that are already out this makes a nice addition. Looking forward to part two.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|There was always sonmething to make me read just one modre chapter before putting this book down.  Defending Jacob was one any parent should read.  My favorite part was the ending!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and I just love the music.  So I had to get the soundtrack, didn't I?  One day I hope to learn to play the piano just so I can learn to play this music.  That's how much I love it.  I play the CD continuously in my car and I have a station on Pandora for this soundtrack.  I love it and highly recommend it.
0263899403|5.0|This book was a very easy read, and extremely fun and unpredictable.I would definitely recommend it to those who are in love, skeptical of love, or looking for it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I wait for it to load then I name my park. Then after 30 seconds of loading the app shuts off and it goes to the page I was on last
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book would be liked by people who love the Irish  and their quirky ways. I liked reading the way they pronounce things. It makes me want to go back to Ireland!
B0091REZMW|4.0|For what it's worth this game is pretty fun. I really enjoy I spy type games so it's right up my alley.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I've seen this a couple times now and always laugh.  It's simple, light, and easy to watch.  The storylines are just a little corny, the characters are a bit goofy, and the presentation of the varieties of pregnancies is funny.  If you're looking for Oscar-level performances, complex storylines, and incredible character depth, then keep looking.  This movie is perfect for a chill evening with a glass of wine and comfy sweats.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was a great mix of puzzles and Intrigue. The kids at fireproof know what they're doing! Great job!
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is ok it is your usual hidden object game but with a couple of extra tasks. girl is a nice touch in the beginning.
B004HYHANK|2.0|This book started out with an interesting premise, as her books tend to, but the ending was excruciatingly disappointing. In the last few pages, the narrator is revealed to be a total liar with the weakest and most unbelievable of motivations and the husband, who so quickly and unexpectedly turned into a sadist, turns back into just a disappointed son and father. Complete let down.
0385341008|5.0|This book is excellent.  My friend who was born and grew up on Guernsey had told me the whole story years ago.  The book confirmed exactly what she had told me.  I have been to Guernsey to visit (1990) and seen the various areas mentioned including the little chapel.  The war story is very accurate.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Very good story line. HO not too hard but not too easy either. I hope part 2 is just as good.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|great size to carry when camping and does nice job with most of my knives i have.tell my family to get one
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very good app. I tried the weather bug which I love on my droid but the kindle didn't like it. This app is perfect
B0046MVVOW|5.0|Lots of ppl are saying auto-tune stuff about this young lady, please do remember that, she also is the writer of the songs. Take back your jealousies, this is talent you are condemning.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Ke$ha style as it was illustrated by the last ground breaking album, I'd agree with the similarity stuff on some of the songs compared with ones in last album, but this one still makes you want to dance.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I put off reading this book for a while because.  Was afraid of peeta and kat not ending up together. While I do agree that it was disappointing peeta had such a small role in this book I promise that the last three pages make up for all  discontent along the way.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I can view my inbox and others folders, but I can not open individual messages, I would not wasting your time with this app.

Good job guys!
B00BUT5I84|2.0|There is much to compare 30 Seconds To Mars \\"Love Lust Faith + Dreams\\" to Linkin Park's \\"A Thousand Suns.\\"  Both bands are known for a vocalist with an impressive range that switches back and forth between melodic and aggressive and always intense.  Both bands have put out albums with those moments with hard hitting guitars that perfectly compliment the intense vocals.  Both albums have a message that is lost on this reviewer.  And now both bands have put out albums where the guitar has become non-existent.  I am unsure why rock bands of today are feeling a need to replace the guitar with keyboards and fake drumbeats.  In an effort to improve the song, both of these groups have put out albums where the climax of songs come out flat.  Granted, both of these albums manage to pull together a few decent songs and I truly believe that if you put some of these songs live in an arena with the guitar in the mix, they could make for great songs.  Unfortunately, \\"Love Lust Faith + Dreams\\" is a disappointment in my opinion.<br /><br />Jared Leto claims that 30 Seconds To Mars is an \\"art project.\\"  This is clearly evident in their newest offering but as mentioned above, the art has failed.  Co-mingled with this \\"art\\" are plenty of oh's and whoa's and other singalong moments that are strategically designed for the large arenas that 30 Seconds To Mars sell out on a nightly basis.  While this album will do nothing to impede the quality of their live shows, I am hoping that their next album is more of a return to the group that put out one of the best albums of last decade, \\"A Beautiful Lie.\\"<br /><br />1) Birth (4/10): An interesting track that leads into a synth heavy album.  Although only about two minutes in length, it has some cool moments.  It begins with some keyboard and when Jared's vocals come in, I was feeling excited to hear what was coming next.  Sadly, I did not know that the keyboard was going to take over this album.<br /><br />2) Conquistador (6/10): Plenty of \\"oh's.\\"  References to fighting and wars and great background vocals of \\"We will, we will, we will rise again.\\"  There is some guitars in this song but unfortunately they are nothing special.<br /><br />3) Up In The Air (8/10): More \\"oh's\\" and \\"whoa's\\" designed for an arena singalong.  This is the first single of this album.  Again, not to sound like a broken record but hard hitting guitars would have make this an epic song.  But the mix of keyboards/synth and fake beats make it stale.  Leto's vocals are great as usual.<br /><br />4) City Of Angels (10/10): The highlight of this album.  A slower song for 30 Seconds To Mars but it is one lyrically that I feel is quality.  Again, keyboards reign supreme but this time it works.  Probably will be a second single.<br /><br />5) The Race (4/10): This song begins with...synth.  And what again sounds like fake drums.  There is a pattern here of similar sounding music and Leto starting quiet as the song builds.  This would be more effective with some sort of buildup of intense music but with synths, it cannot reach the apex required to cut you to the core.<br /><br />6) End Of All Days (2/10): Starts with piano which is a little different than keyboard/synths.  Leto's voice is quiet and it builds...ineffectively with fake drums and keyboards.  The chorus is simple enough: \\"All we need is faith.  All we need is faith.  Faith is all we need.\\"  The message of this song is lost on me.  I can't tell if Leto is being ironic as the verses seem to betray the chorus.  If that is the point, then it is pretty weak.<br /><br />7) Pyres Of Varansi (0/10): Worst thing I have heard in awhile.  It is a filler track with keyboards and what sounds like an Indian guy caterwauling.  It is one that I wanted to skip almost immediately and wish that I did.<br /><br />8) Bright Lights (4/10): Starts of slow with Leto's vocals.  Builds with keyboard/synths with some more \\"oh's.\\"  And then more keyboards and synths.  I am starting to wonder if anyone gotcredited with guitars on this album.<br /><br />9) Do Or Die (4/10): You'll never guess how this song starts...synths.  And then it is slow with Leto's vocals.  And then fake drums come in.  And if they are not fake drums here (or anywhere else on this album that I mentioned it) then they sure do sound fake and I apologize.  Then the song builds a little with more synth and some \\"oh's\\" and \\"whoa's.\\"  It never reaches the climax it deserves.  Leto's vocals sound great, though, but cannot save the mediocre song.<br /><br />10) Convergence (0/10):  Another throwaway, filler track.  Just keyboards for 2 minutes.  Press skip.  It adds nothing.<br /><br />11) Northern Lights (5/10): Fake drums begin this song.  It begins slow and Leto's vocals come in.  He does a little bit of his screaming which is unfortunately limited on this album.  My guess is that it is limited due to the lack of hard hitting intense moments.  It is a shame, especially at this point, when the album is near its close.  This would be a pretty good song if you added in some guitars to go along with the synths/strings.<br /><br />12) Depuis Le Debut (1/10): The last song is also close to a throwaway track.  It makes an odd conclusion to the lackluster album.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think it is obvious my feeling on this record.  The songs in themselves are decent but the constant keyboards/synth and fake drumbeats cause the songs go nowhere.  I will say if you were a fan of Linkin Park's \\"A Thousand Suns,\\" then you will probably enjoy this album.  If you are a fan of 30 Seconds To Mars previous output AND a fan of guitars, then you will not enjoy.  I still remain hopeful, though, as Linkin Park followed up \\"A Thousand Suns\\" with the excellent \\"Living Things.\\"  I can only hope then that 30 Seconds To Mars will do the same.credited with guitars on this album.<br /><br />9) Do Or Die (4/10): You'll never guess how this song starts...synths.

B00CW665VI|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun, witty and sexy read then Tangled is definitely for you.  This is Emma Chase's debut novel and she did such a wonderful job.<br /><br />Drew Evans is a sexy, arrogant, pompous ass who thinks he is God's gift to woman and yet I still managed to fall in love with him.  When we first meet Drew he has been holed up at his apartment for the last week with the flu, at least that is what he thinks it is.  His apartment hasn't been cleaned in a week, it stinks, garbage is all over the place and Drew is a complete mess.  That's what the flu will do to you, knock you out, cause you to be sick to your stomach to the point where you can't move and don't care about anything.  The flu will cause a workaholic like Drew to miss a week of work because he just can't seem to get himself out of bed.  Wait is that the flu or is Drew \\"ladies man\\" Evans in love?<br /><br />Drew has never had any interest in falling in love.  He doesn't do the relationship thing and certainly doesn't do love.  He is a \\"love em and leave em\\"  kind of guy and never rides the roller coaster more than once, his words not mine.  But when he meets Kate Brooks at a bar one night he finds himself drawn to her in ways he never knew existed.  But unfortunately for him, Kate is engaged and has no interest in being his next roller coaster ride.  Monday morning comes and Drew finds himself face to face with Kate again, only this time it is in the conference room at work. Kate is one of the newest employees that Drew's father has hired, so after trying to get Kate off his mind the whole weekend he must now try to find a way to work with the woman that he wants, but knows he can't have.  Drew's father assigns them the same account to work on which means getting Kate out of his head will most likely be impossible.  Drew isn't used to being rejected by a woman and when he wants something he usually gets it.  He finds himself falling for Kate and wanting her in more than just a sexual way.  Things between the two of them start to heat up, but Drew being Drew and thinking he knows everything about woman manages to screw it up.  Guess what?  Drew may not know as much about womand as he thinks he does.  Will Drew be able to cure himself of the flu and get up and fight for love?<br /><br />\\"She's all I think about. She's everything I neber thought I wanted. She's not just perfect-She's perfect for me<br /><br />Drew and Kate were so good together.  I loved Kate's character, she knew how to handle Drew and didn't take his line of crap that most woman would.  But at the same time she wanted him and couldn't deny the physical attraction.  But she also saw the real man beneath the arrogance.  I have to say that I loved Drew.  Yes, he was arrogant and there were those \\"Oh my god I cannot believe he just said that\\" moments.  But some of the things he said were just so outrageous that you couldn't help but laugh and smile at his comments.  You also begin to see that deep down below the surface, there is a sweet and romantic side of Drew Evans.  I think that Kate was a perfect match for Drew and definitely made him work for it in the end, which is not something that he is used to doing.  Two things in life that Drew Evans hadn't experienced before, were rejection and love, until Kate Brooks came along.<br /><br />\\"Fine's a funny word, dont' you think?.........How many men have told their girlfriends, \\"You look fine,\\" when they really mean , \\"You need to go back to the gym and work out-a lot.\\"  It's the universal way of saying we're just peachy-when we're really anything but.\\"<br /><br />Tangled is told from Drew's POV, but what I loved the most is the unique way that the author told the story.  It felt like you were sitting in your den watching a tape of The Drew Evan's Story while he narrated it all.  With him pausing at certain moments, and suddenly going off on some tangent about a past memory or his theories on life and woman.  He takes you onthe journey that was his life for the past four months and gives the reader an inside look as to how he found the woman of his dreams and fell in love, and how he ended up on his couch for 7 days with the \\"flu\\". Drew may have been arrogant, and pompous and even obnoxious at times, but deep down he had a good heart and made up for it all in the end.  The relationship that he has with his niece was adorable and comical at the same time.  It made you love him that much more.  I love Drew and Kate's story and I know you will to.  Emma Chase did such a wonderful job with this story and connecting the reader to the characters.  I look forward to more from Ms. Chase in the future.<br /><br />I received an advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

B00CRW2066|4.0|Albums by those American flag-bearers The National should be viewed as distinct chapters of a much larger book which is still being written. There are no sharp ruptures between their records and each develops in its own way and pace after repeated plays contributing to a rock solid oeuvre of songs. Simply put their records couldn't be by anyone else, you judge them on the strength of the songs and whether on the musical ledger book the majority of those pressed onto vinyl continue to be in credit column.<br /><br />\\"Trouble will find me\\" is by any standards the least rocking and most melancholic National album to date. If you love the National of \\"Mistaken for Strangers\\" or \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\" this album only partly plays to that constituency, alternatively if songs like \\"Daughter of the Soho Riots\\" or \\"Runaway\\" floats your boat a treat is in store. This reviewer will start with a couple of negatives since this album starts and falters. There is something about the repetitive lyric of opener \\"I should live in salt\\" and the almost looped lines of \\"You should know me better than that\\" which as yet to prove a great listening pleasure. Equally \\"Demons\\" sounds like so much like a \\"paint by numbers\\" National song that it is almost a parody not least with Berninger's mournful lyric. Then thankfully by third song everything comes right and just gets better and better. The pounding \\"Don't swallow that cap\\" with its creeping melody and throaty Berninger vocal signals a step change. Its followed by the lovely acoustics of \\"Fireproof\\" with a shape shifting band accompaniment and restrained singing plus the classic line \\"You tell me I'm waiting to find someone who isn't so hopeless - there's no-one.\\" The familiar evocative baritone of Berninger is to be located on the powerful \\"Sea of Love\\" where yet again can be found proof that drummer Bryan Devendorf is the beating heart of the band. \\"Heavenfaced\\" is just sublime. Other songs like the complex \\"This is the last time\\" mutate into a great Sharon van Etten-featuring orchestral coda from a more convention almost bluesy start. \\"Graceless\\" sound like it could have been happily located on \\"Alligator\\", but more profound the is American beauty of the brilliant piano ballad \\"Slipped\\" where Berninger reflects \\"that I don't need any help to be breakable\\". The albums final quarter is easily the best part of the album and to this reviewer's ears includes three instant National classics. The sweet guitar coda on \\"I need a girl\\" leads into a tender vocal but images of people losing it and driving cars into gardens give it a darker edge. It will be one of those great National live anthems but if anything it is topped by the two final tracks the superb piano driven haunting lament of the album standout \\"Pink Rabbits\\" a tale of lost love where the singer ruefully reflects \\"You were staring down the street cause you were trying not to crack up/Bona Drag was still on/Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out\\". Finally the album is rounded off by the epic \\"Hard to find\\" surely one of the great National songs in all its morose beauty.<br /><br />\\"Trouble will find me\\" is a brooding beast of an album from the best American band this side of Wilco. The National In short are a band who now clearly understand their own inner logic and have figured themselves out. They produce intelligent and emotionally weighty records which confirm the Dessner brothers are among rocks finest composers. The Guardian recently commented about the bands progress that \\" what they have perfected, over the course of six albums, is a kind of glistening melancholy, a strangely beautiful dourness\\". These words are well written hence you must promise to listen to this album to find out what they mean.a great Sharon van Etten-featuring orchestral coda from a more convention almost bluesy start. \\"Graceless\\" sound like it could have been happily located on \\"Alligator\\", but more profound the is American beauty of the brilliant piano ballad \\"Slipped\\" where Berninger reflects \\"that I don't need any help to be breakable\\".

B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm so didisappointed in this finale. I've got nothing to say that hasn't been said in the other low rating views, but wish I had all my time back that I spent reading this book. I just felt like it was an obligatory read, since I really enjoyed the previous books.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have been putting off reading this series because, even though I enjoy erotica as next as the next girl, I've heard the writing was juvenile. It definitely drew me in and kept my attention. It works because it's not really about the sex, although his tastes are a big part of the story. It's more about how she forces him to grow as a man.  I love that Ana is the strength in the relationship and Christian knows that.  I love that there's a reason he is the way he is and she doesn't give up until she uncovers those reasons.  I love that she forces him to stop wallowing and grow the hell up, while he finds trust by demanding it from her.  Something about Ana and Christian's story works (obviously, given the success of the books), although the writing itself  could be improved upon.

B00CSYRHG6|4.0|I'm surprised this is not being released by Disney, and was initially very suspicious. But apparently no -- it's legit.<br />This is a wonderful film. It's not in the same league as the Ghibli classics, sure (viz. \\"Laputa\\", \\"Kiki\\", \\"Totoro\\", \\"Whisper of the Heart\\", \\"Only Yesterday\\", \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\", and honorary Ghibli classic \\"Nausicaa\\"), but it's intelligent. It's melodrama is doing something very different from the older directors in the studio. It's a massive step up from Goro's embarrassing debut as director. And it's very enjoyable in its own right as an emotional shoujo weepie. I'll be buying it for sure.

This may be on par with the greatest fiction of all time, and even reaches the level of a Tennessee Williams or a Hemingway.

B00CRS88IO|4.0|The story begins with a bang and never lets up until suddenly you try to turn the last page (in kindle edition) and find that it is the end. The amount of adventure packed into these pages is quite incredible. I'm not sure whether to believe it as literal truth or not. Ian Fleming is equipped with all sorts of gadgets--a garrotte hidden in a ring, a compass likewise hidden, a deck of playing cards that peel back to reveal maps of the country side, and more. He is capable of seemingly anything--swimming under water to plant explosives, skiing down the side of a nearly vertical mountain, dodging bullets, side-stepping a flame-thrower, and he never breaks a sweat. There is a beautiful woman who, of course, turns out to be a double-agent.<br /><br />The writing is a bit odd--there is no context, and the story starts and ends abruptly. It feels more like a movie script or a novel than historical fact. Also, every single person who comes into view is given a complete description of his clothing, the fabric, the style, even military uniforms are described in detail, as are all the weapons. To me, it felt like filming notes.<br /><br />Still, it was quite a page-turner, and if true, well 007 has nothing on his creator!

In addition to PKD, I was also reminded at times of Animal Farm.<br /><br />The relationships are nicely drawn.  The opening is really effective. The pace is good.  Somehow, Hugh Howey manages to choose perfectly which parts of the story to explore and which ones to gloss over.  Without spoiling it by saying which is which, I'll just say I'm a grateful reader for his choices.  Overall the story is very engaging.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is an excellent game. from the graphics to the sounds and ambient noise, it is highly engrossing.  It just emanates suspense and mystery.  I played  through the whole thing without putting it down, which made it seem short, but it is WELL worth $2. I can't wait for the follow up to this.  If you loved Myst or merely wanted to, you'll love The Room.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|This album has been very well done.  All the artists playing contribute their own unique value and artistic sound which meshes quite well together.  Portnoy's drumming doesn't overwhelm,  yet he does an excellent job blending in when needed and standing out when needed.  Neal Morse's singing complements Casey McPherson's lead vocals very well, and his music playing is very good. McPherson I had never heard, but I feel very connected to the tenor of his voice and his vocal inflections. Well done Casey!  I think he has done a masterful job with the vocals on the album. I assume Neal Morse wrote most of the songs and each pretty much stands on it's own- not too deep yet very human.  Steve Morse actually has a guitar solo in every song I think:)!  When is the last time you heard a group where the lead guitarist plays within the constraints of the song yet manages to get in solos in almost every song which really adds value and yet these solos aren't overdone and complement and blend with each song ---outstanding!!  I love the Blue guitar he uses, and nice to not hear a lot of wah-wah! :)<br />The bassist David LaRue (I had never heard his music before this Album)does a fantastic job and his playing complements all the other instruments being played in each song.  All in all a very entertaining piece of work basically unlike any other ground, yet there are times when I am reminded of the Beatles, the Moody Blues, and many other timeless Classic Rock groups sounds.  Nice to get a feeling of comfort from this kind of sound.  I hope they can get together again soon for some more fine work! These guys are all top notch musicians in my mind and it shows here!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Absolutely hated this book. I never made it past chapter 3! Starts slow... keeps dragging. If you like desperate, clumbsy, personality lacking characters then you'll love it. Honestly I would think a high school senior could write a better story. Save your money, save your time.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Many have complained that the film is style over substance and, well, it is. But that's a compliment, not a complaint.<br />Director Baz Luhrmann perfectly uses visual representation of the various themes and emotions displayed throughout the film. He uses the changing style from ecclectic, to dark, to heartbreaking in order to accentuate the emotions deep within an otherwise traditional story.<br />It goes without saying that the musical numbers are heart stopping, especially El Tango De Roxanne and The Show Must Go On, and the chemistry between the two leads in thick and heartwarming.
0316077046|5.0|I loved this Book!!! Loved the whole southern feel to the writing.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Just started reading book 3 today.  Wow very good writing.  Love the story.
B000OLRH10|4.0|The film that made me finally appreciate Leo as an actor and even look back upon his previous films and appreciate his immense talent.<br />The film is riddled with great performances from Djimon Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly, and the Mummy himself Arnold Vosloo. An intense thriller with strong statements and emotional depth, I'd recommend this to anyone who loves a move that holds up as a thinking man's film, as well as some kick ass action scenes that only add to the film.
B007REV4YI|5.0|When you have a Bond movie, there is little more to say. The action and adventure with some classic memories from the past.

0345522478|5.0|If you're like me and you can't wait for the next Harry Dresden book...you have to pick up this series by Kevin Hearne.  I've already pre-ordered the next book.
B00C061I3K|5.0|It took years before most people could fully appreciate '[[ASIN:B000SNW0HA Homework]]' and '[[ASIN:B000059MEK Discovery]]'. Their '[[ASIN:B000TENK4K Human After All]]' was still a disappointment, but how they incorporated that into their [[ASIN:B000YBH2UG Alive 2007]] tour years later redeemed them. I still think '[[ASIN:B0064UPU4G Discovery]]' is a perfect album, and am glad Daft Punk is continuing to forge ahead, and this album will be a major influence, just as their others have.<br /><br />The first time I listened to it, it was good, but different. Second time left me intrigued wanting to listen more, and by the 3rd time, it clicked.  This is an album people of all musical backgrounds will be talking about for decades to come. It's not perfect as there are few places that fall a little flat near the end almost to the point where they could have cut the last 2 songs, but overall it is crafted extremely well with care.  From their scoring experience with '[[ASIN:B004EI3ON4 Tron: Legacy]]', you can tell they have learned a lot and applied much of their experiences on this album.  Each track is extremely dense, complex and full of many nuances that will keep you coming back.  It is a beautifully superb album and their own personal love song to the musicians who made them who they are today. As they sampled from others to make their own unique works, this album is a 'giving back' and is rife with elements that will inspire others well into the future.<br /><br />Though they looked back to move forward, and it does sound different from their previous works, this does not mean they have necessarily given up what made '[[ASIN:B000SNW0HA Homework]]' and '[[ASIN:B0064UPU4G Discovery]]' so good, as each album has been very unique moments in time, some out of time. As Daft Punk said, electronic music is currently in a comfortable stage, not innovating, repeating the same old same old. They said as much with track #1 \\"Give Life Back to Music\\", and this album is a huge wake up call and call to action.up call and call to action.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I'm not the least surprised that this was an excellent choice. Columbo was a great<br />detective series and It brought back memories as I watched this great series once again.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful story and the stories of the two primary pilots and their backgrounds that led them to be the leaders/men they became in such a tense situation.
0500516766|5.0|If you have ever seen good exploded-view diagrams, the best of which are found usually in color visual dictionaries, you will be amazed by this book. These are not diagrams, they are color photographs of painstakingly disassembled iconic objects such as the iPad, the SLR camera (both a 1973 version and a 2012 DSLR), a Blackberry, a chainsaw, an early 1980s Walkman, a 1980s Raleigh 10-speed bike, an early Apple Macintosh (the cover photo), a 1960 blender, and much more.<br /><br />The photographs of the disassembled objects, laid flat, are fascinating in themselves: often you cannot even tell what the object is from looking at an array of hundreds of parts. But the truly stunning photography is of the same objects actually \\"exploding\\" on the page: the author/photographer actually captured each part in mid-air, then combined all of these stills to make a VERY realistic photo of an early Macintosh computer, for example, exploding in mid-air. These are mind-blowing photographs - accomplished by what must have been an incredible amount of work.<br /><br />The masterpiece of the book is an entire airplane, the Zenith CH-650, disassembled and displayed in a 3-page foldout.<br /><br />There are 50 objects in all, each with the flat layout photo and the 'exploded' photo. The number of parts for each object is also included. At the back of the book there are four essays on topics related to the disassembly of objects. The great value of the book, however, is in its photography: nothing less than spectacular.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Used to watch this show with my parents as a teen.<br />I'm sure it's a bit dated but I know I'll enjoy it.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|How do you build a temple.  It's early in the game.  I'm sorry I don't remember the level.  Thank you to all so  much.
0670026603|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a book that makes just sob while reading it, and this book definitely did that at a few points. Yet at other times, I was reading it and laughing out loud. I loved this book and how they author undertook such a serious subject matter and really seemed to flesh it out, at least for me. By the end, I felt so connected with the main characters and loved the other details that unfolded with the secondary characters. The only complaint I have is that I found the relationship between Louisa and her boyfriend contrived from the get go, but it's a small part of a much grander story. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a moving read that will touch on your ethical beliefs and outlook on life.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was an interesting way of writing and telling the story of a zombie war, in the format of a collection of interviews.  But i still prefer the actual flow of a storyline featuring a cast of characters, can't  wait to see the movie tho!
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I was disappointed with this introduction to the LOTR trilogy.  For some reason, I was expecting it to be a let-down, and for me it was.  I didn't even bother to see it in the theater.<br /><br />Unlike the LOTR series, I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters (except maybe Gollum). I agree with some other reviewers that some of the action scenes were overdone, and way too much time was spent getting the adventure underway (at least it felt that way).<br /><br />To me, this movie was more about making money than anything else.<br /><br />All that being said, any serious Tolkien fan will need to add this to the collection.  But you might want to wait for the three or four different versions that will undoubtedly be released, then choose which one you want.
0385535147|5.0|The book was sent promptly and was as good as I expected it to be. Loved the plot, and I'm hard to please since reading Harry Potter. Read it in two days.<br />Thanks,
B0046H95PO|4.0|It keeps you eager to know who it was throughout the entire book.<br />I think I'd have rated it 5 stars if I hadn't guessed who the murderer was before the end of the book.<br />Anyway, &#34;Murder on the Orient Express&#34; is worth reading; it makes you feel you're IN the story trying to figure it all out, and it shows you things and hints Poirot (the detective) notices and maybe you haven't.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Not unlike Mozart dying in the middle of composing the end of his Requiem, and his student finishing it up for him, this epic  transcended the life of the writer and was completed by another, and while noticeably lesser in level, it is still good and great to be in existence.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a riveting movie that keeps you guessing until the very end.  Ben Affleck was great as the lead and the other actors are also very believable in their respective roles.  I did not have any background on this movie and was prepared to be bored.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very fun and entertaining. I love the game its good brain exercise. You can unlock levels and if you finish you can do them again. its great and lots of fun.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I have always liked the typical Bond movies with the pretty women, handsome men, beautiful location and interesting gadgets.  This Bond installment deviates from the typical Bond film.  It is much darker and more sinister.  I am not so sure I like this change.
034580404X|4.0|Ok so like others before me.....not the best written set of books but I was a sucker for the love story and characters and have read the trilogy a few times :).
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Is it the beautiful scenery? The camping? The defiant and endearing youth? The quirky Wes Anderson of it all? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. Loved this film. A great &#34;date night in&#34; for me and the hubby.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I just wanted to let anyone who owns the Joovy caboose know that this cup holder works PERFECTLY for that stroller.  I absolutely love it and can't think of a thing wrong with it.  And it's sooo much cheaper than the Joovy brand one.  The two cup holders are very adjustable and can fit all different sized beverages.  The device is very sturdy as well.  Have not had any issue with it tipping over.  Even with a three year old jumping to and from the sit/stand seat.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is my husband and my favorite Miyazaki animated film! We have bought several copies for nieces and friends just because it makes you feel so good, it is beautifully illustrated, and has a very important life lesson.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Personally I think that this game is unique & one of a kind. I downloaded it about 2 months ago and as soon as I started playing it I was addicted I played it all of the time and when the tokyo update came out I downloaded it right away and its really fun dispite the fact that Harumi (a limited edition character) dances like a creeper but that is what makes her interesting.So if you like like epic running games like temple run (except better)than this is the game for you with hover boards/ limited characters/ mystery boxes & more I would would totally get this application if I didn't all ready have it.

0802473156|5.0|I purchased this book after my marriage counselor mentioned it during a session.  It makes such good sense and, after applying the concepts, I have noticed a difference in my marriage.  It also explains why I was not 'happy' even though we were doing good.  It's interesting to know that you could be expressing love to someone in a way YOU know how to express love but then learn that that person needs to be shown love through a different method.  Would highly recommend.  I read the entire book in a day.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was anxious to read the last Sookie book. I had an idea of how it would end. And the ending was one of the two theories. I gave it 3 stars because it was readable and kept me interested.  A must to close the chapter on Sookie. Although I'm very upset Bubba didn't make an appearance.
0345529057|5.0|This is a great series!  I'm on the fifth book now, I cant stop reading! Five more words are required.
B005EEQN8A|5.0|To anyone who thought Oasis' last few albums were disappointing, give this a shot. While not as good as their first two albums, Noel seems more comfortable and in the groove here, and this record might be his best collection of songs since Morning Glory.

B00338QENI|4.0|The author puts a human face on the remarkable livability of Henrietta Lacks cell line. She then points out the many problems with medical research versus patient's rights. This is a discussion that will become louder in the coming years. As to the book, I enjoyed it, although I wish that the author has spent more time on the cell line itself; it's uses, it's proliferation it's impact and less time on the family of Henrietta. She fulfilled her promise to the family, but I found the emphasis too much.<br /><br />I will credit the author with remarkable perseverance in gathering material for the book. It was quite a labor, and I appreciate her dedication in telling this story.
1423136802|5.0|I choose this rating because the book is awesome. I love it so much. Amazon , you've done a great job.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|I've enjoyed the first book, the second was a stretch, but this one feels like it was phoned in, the plot is ridiculous, the characters are either saints or irredeemable, if I wasn't on a long flight I would have stopped after ten pages.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love it!! It is fantastic I got easily addicted to it. Disney did great work the graphics are fabulous<br />I recommend you getting it.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|Very enjoyable account of a Marine's experience in the Pacific Campaign. Sledge did a very good job of telling his story.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|I'll admit that I wasn't expecting to hear the sounds of the late 70s on the latest Daft Punk release.  I mean, they're robots, right?!  I was expecting sounds from the future!  Yet, most of the album is very analog dance music--lots of funky guitar licks, smooth vocals and old school synths.  Overall, Random Access Memories is a tribute to the disco and smooth rock sounds of yester-year, a la Daft Punk.  That said, this is fun, catchy, danceable music.  There are a few weak spots on the album, but overall, Daft Punk does a fantastic job paying homage to a much-maligned and forgotten--yet influential--era in music history.  I get a kick thinking about of all the kids who will be introduced to Giorgio Moroder, the godfather of much of today's dance music they love.<br /><br />Definitely worth the download, or better yet, I bet this album, in all its analog glory, sounds great on vinyl.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Outstanding writing and art style something about the walking dead and I'm not sure what just won't let me leave it.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I enjoyed the story. The twist didn't surprise me, but it was told fairly well. Worth reading.<br /><br />I would feel remiss if I didn't add a personal comment about the author's political leanings. Give up. You've lost. Treat everyone equal and get on with your life. Stop hating.
0670026557|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read -  tremendous insight into how you can succeed in this world by being a good person and giving of yourself.  Perhaps it's a book that more of us should read!
B005B19UPE|5.0|The book was easy reading...so sad, yet inspiring.  Appropriate for young people to learn about the Holocaust and what other went thru.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|I must admit to having a soft spot for Star Trek V.  It was released in the summer of 1989 and I saw it not long after I had turned 11 - so I was a very forgiving child who didn't pay as much attention to the flaws of a film if I found some strength in it.<br /><br />Now, as an adult, I know that The Final Frontier certainly has its flaws.  The special effects are largely terrible. The crew (Uhura, Chekov, Sulu) are swayed too easily by Sybok.  There are far too many decks as Kirk, Spock, and McCoy zoom up the turboshaft with legs fully suspended.  The center of the galaxy is a long way in with Sybok making no adjustments (he actually does make engine adjustments in the novelization).  Sybok isn't much of a villain (really isn't one and actually does something heroic at the end) and we find out that Spock has a half brother.  Oh - and the film isn't exactly packed with action.<br /><br />So flaw after flaw must mean that this is a terrible and completely unwatchable movie, right?  Not really.  On the whole, it actually feels quite a bit like an extended Star Trek episode.  Maybe that's disappointing for a film, but if you look at it in that way it actually becomes much more enjoyable.<br /><br />The characterization of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy here - along with their friendship is one of the highlights of this film, beginning when they are vacationing in Yosemite and continuing as the film movies along.  We learn more of their bond.  This family of Star Trek's trio of core characters is the heart of Star Trek V and it works quite well.  We discover much in regards to all three.<br /><br />While the film lacks much action overall, the attack on Nimbus III is a well orchestrated assault scene that works quite well.  It could be argued that a longer sequence would have been more entertaining, but the bit we get is exciting and well done - and also something unique to The Final Frontier (not a lot of ground assaults in these space movies).<br /><br />Some criticize the humor in Star Trek V, but I find that it works well.  There are some cheap laughs, but many of the jokes mostly work.<br /><br />Ultimately the major driving factor here is the characters and their stories.  Sybok's search for truth that leads Kirk, Spock, and McCoy closer to one another.  The closing Yosemite scene caps that off, showing the three have grown closer together than ever; more family than friends.<br /><br />It also must be mentioned that this is Jerry Goldsmith's finest Star Trek score.  The main theme introduced as the credits begin is gorgeous and sticks with you.<br /><br />So I'd give this 3.5.  It is flawed, but fun.  There's some good stuff here.  Is it Trek's best?  Certainly not.  I would not rank it ahead of any of the even numbered original Treks, which are all better rounded and more completer films.  I would say it is more accessible than The Motion Picture, though not as good overall as Star Trek III (though more humorous).  I may even admit that it is the worst of the Star Trek films - but the Star Trek movies are generally quite enjoyable.  I can't say that I loathe or am bored with any of them.<br /><br />The Final Frontier is flawed, but there are some redeeming qualities.  Look to the characters and minimize the flaws - you just might have some fun and be touched by the relationship of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|As usual. the video is not as good as reading the book, but it followed the book very nicely.  I enjoyed it and have shared with friends.
B00C061I3K|1.0|Howdy fellow BASS heads, LOL! I love electronic music like no otha... my favorites are Skrillex, LA Roux, the dude from Gangnam Style, Akon, David Guetta, and all of those dubstep commercials you say on XBOX Live!....but lately there has been much hype about this robotic band called \\"Dart Punk\\"...first of all. Why would you claim to be an electronic band if you have 'punk' in your name??? Second.. with all those guests apperances... how come they couldn't get ahold of Justin Bieber, Chad Kroeger, or even Fred Durst to rap a song or two!  I was so disgusting by this album after about 30 seconds I turned it off and had enough! It was taking precious time away from me watching the singing show with Usher and Shakira!!!<br /><br />For good electronic music... stay old school... Skrillex and La Roux...<br /><br />these daft punk jokers aren't very historic...
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Loved the movie and was anxious to have the music.  This wasn't quite as good at the original broadway version, but still enjoyable.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|It really helped my son understand fractions a lot better. His math grades went up a bunch. This is the best calculator app ever.
B00BMTX2QM|5.0|I am a recent convert to Cathedral, so it figures that they would call it a day right when I'm in the process of getting their music.  But holy cow, what a swan song!  Cathedral are heavily influenced by other doom predecessors, Black Sabbath especially, Trouble and St. Vitus, but they got the best endorsement of all by Tony Iommi complimenting them himself and even guesting with a solo on the \\"Carnival Bizarre\\" album.  In the world of doom metal, you can get no higher praise.<br />  There's a reason Iommi favors Cathedral.  Of all the post-early Sabbath outfits, they are the best of the bunch.  So innovative is guitarist Garry Jennings, who is the best dark riffmaster next to Iommi himself in the world and gifted the lyrics of Lee Dorrian that no other band comes anywhere near them, including Electric Wizard, the other only competition so to speak.<br />  \\"The Last Spire\\" as noted in many a review is a return to the earliest days and could easily have been the follow-up to \\"Forests of Equilibrium\\", their stunning debut album.  Jennings is absolutely on top of his game;  he is the only guitarist who could conceivably replace Tony Iommi if need be, and we sure hope that doesn't happen, but it does show how well Jennings has learned his craft.  Indeed, he is a grossly underrated genius.<br />  Eight songs stretch out over an hour of weaving ultra heavy tapestry, challenging and easily defeating all comers to the doom throne.  It's sad to know Cathedral are calling it a day, but this will be one of the greatest final albums ever recorded.  One hopes Jennings finds an outlet for his creative ideas.  The music world will be a lesser place without Cathedral.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|Like many other, I first heard of Band of Horses by hearing their song, \\"The Funeral.\\" I loved that song but the rest of the songs on Everything All the Time I thought weren't on the same level. Cease to Begin, on the other hand, blew me away. \\"Ode to LRC\\" is just a perfect rocker especially with it's triumphant outro. It quickly became one of my favorite records in the last little while and it made me a bona fide fan. I saw them live on those tours and they brought it every night.    When I first heard Infinite Arms I almost thought I'd downloaded (yes I download, sorry vinyl nerds) the wrong artist. It sounded a little foreign to me. Took me half way through the second song to be sure I had the correct band. At first I missed having 8+ rock songs on one record. Then I realized there aren't ANY unbridled throw down tracks on the entire record. There is plenty of rock music but it rocks more with soul than with volume and/or distortion. They seem to have become comfortable ... in a good way; I'm not suggesting complacency. I think Ben Bridwell challenged listeners a little who were accustomed to hearing his voice drenched in reverb to hear him up close, comparatively anyway. Whoever would rather hear his voice masked by reverb needs to have their head examined. You just don't find singers of his talent/skill every day. Band of Horses really branched out as far as instrumentation and sound. My personal rating system, which everyone should follow, is very strict because I have one category that I have less than 10 records in. That category is, \\"A Perfect Album.\\" This means every single song on the record is great. No duds. No fillers. Think of all your favorite records ... most have a couple of stinkers, let's be real. [Two States on Slanted and Enchanted?! Pains me that I could grant that record perfectionhood. I digress.] In my very humble opinion Infinite Arms is A Perfect Album. If you like more melancholy than upbeat, you have come to the right place. So many, not really SAD, songs that have a melancholy feeling to them. The lyrics are interesting and Ben Bridwell does seem to mean what he said in The General Specific, \\"what the writers say means s*** to me know.\\" They are more adventurous. Some of them are funny when you first hear them but later become poignant in their context. Make no mistake, some of it still rocks. \\"Older\\" is a slow honky-tonk rocker. Compliments brings it. Dilly doesn't sound like Spoon but has that feel. Straight ahead rocker but they make it great with the call and answer singing. And these guys harmonize masterfully. That is something that is often lost in the shuffle. Or maybe some folks don't like it. I love it and there's not a whole of tasteful rock 'n' roll with great harmonizing. They more than competently fill that void, thankfully. \\"On My Way Back Home\\" is just too beautiful to attempt to describe, as is the title track. But really the best song on the record is the next one.    I should add: it seems like Tyler Ramsey contributed quite a bit to this record and his influence shouldn't go unmentioned. Much of Tyler's solo work is melancholy, but quite beautiful, just like Infinite Arms. Coincidence? We have no way of knowing.    B'lee dat

B00AJER3SE|5.0|There are tons of movie reviews, so if you want to know about the movie see something else or IMDB. The Blu-Ray in my opinion is as good as the Terminator is ever going to look. The picture is amazing, some of the CGI and other technology is outdated and it shows, but as far as transfers go, it's nice looking. Everything looks the way it should and the picture is as good as it gets.<br /><br />Sound seems to be the issue a lot of people are having. I went into this with the understanding this was a low-budget film, they couldn't record in stereo and had to use a mono track and it's from the 80s. All of that considered, the sound is fine in my opinion. At times its low and you have to raise it up. But with all things considered, the sound is fine in my opinion. You're not going to get an amazing 5.1 sound from this movie if the original wasn't done with stereo sound. Just my two cents though.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Terminator, it's great for a cheap low-budget 80's movie.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This novel contained such deep aspects of human feelings and actions many can never understand.

B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Firstly, I absolutely adored the first few books in the sookie stackhouse collection. However, this book was predictable and tedious. It was an actual effort to sit and read. I was incredibly disappointed- complete waste of money.
B0036UMM84|5.0|I am a huge Streisand fan and this movie did not disappoint.  While I have not watched the other versions, this one does everything a good movie should do.  The love story between the two chararacters draws you in.  Eshter is amazing and many women can identify with her.  Kris Kristofferson holds his own and the chemistry between him and Streisand was great.  My favorite scene is the Evergreen song...just beautiful and one of the best songs ever written.  If you are a lover of love stories, this one is a keeper.  Would love to watch this on blue-ray.
B00004Y6TQ|3.0|the songs I liked in the movie did not seem to be on disc.  the songs are too similar for my preference
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|A very good movie but more of a vehicle for Daniel Day-Lewis.  It focuses on a short piece of Lincoln's presidency as other reviewers have described.  It is worth seeing but primarly for the acting and the specific focus on passage of the 13th Amendment but not as a biopic on Lincoln or the war.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|I would give this movie 10 stars if it would let me. Arnold still has it. awesome action all the way through. This is a must own dvd. what a great movie. What difference does it make how old Arnold is? Some people act like age has something to do with the movie. In my opinion, they are bias. This movie is outstanding and deserves every bit of a 5 star rating.
B005VPRDAY|3.0|I sent this to my granddaughter, and she really enjoys playing with them.  However, I was disappointed because you think you're getting a tub full of legos, but it only seems like a handful.  Most of the pieces are so tiny....less than the size of an pencil eraser.  I know legos are expensive, but didn't seem like a bang for my buck.

0670026603|5.0|Jojo Moyes takes on a very controversial subject in assisted suicide.  Is it moral?  Should it be legal?  Is it forgivable?<br /><br />Will Traynor took his last step into the path of an oncoming out-of control vehicle on a rainy morning in London.  Now a quadriplegic who will never again climb a mountain; feel the thrill of skydiving; or, make love to a woman, Will's world is contained in the annex of his parents' mansion where his only outings are doctor appointments and his only visitors are his parents and his male nurse, Nathan.<br /><br />Will requires a caregiver to help with the most basic of functions.  Louisa Clark needs a job since the caf&eacute; she's been working at for years suddenly closes.  Not exactly the type of job that Louisa was hoping to find, she has to take the work to help make ends meet at home where she lives with her parents, her sister and her nephew in a too small house.  Louisa, \\"Lou\\", agrees to a six month contract.<br /><br />Will, unknown to Louisa, has also agreed to his own six month contract.<br /><br />Dignitas is an organization based in Switzerland whose function it is to administer to those who wish to end their own life.  Assisted suicide.  Hoping to change Will's mind about choosing to end his painful life, his parents ask him to give them six months.  If at the end of the six months he still wishes to take his last breath, his parents, reluctantly, will take him to Switzerland.<br /><br />Louisa Clark is a small town girl living small town dreams.  It never occurred to her to dream bigger.  That is, until she met the completely exasperating, rude and frustrating, Will.  When Louisa learns of Will's six-month plan and his parents' agreement to help him, she quits her care giving job, not wanting to be a part of something she feels so strongly against.  Lured back by Will's Mother, Louisa makes her own plan to try to change Will's mind by proving to him that he can still enjoy his life.<br /><br />The friendship that grows between Will and Louisa is truly beautiful.  Even though Will's body is confined to that wheelchair, his heart is free to love.  Is love enough to make him change his mind?<br /><br />On a personal note, this book left me reeling for days.  My tears have dried and I've moved on to a new book to read but bits of my heart and stains of my tears will forever be left between the pages of ME BEFORE YOU.  ✰✰✰✰✰n Will and Louisa is truly beautiful.

B001KP2J3U|5.0|Peter Ustinov was never my favorite Poirot, but as a lifelong Agatha Christie buff I have loved this all-star (Ustinov, Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Maggie Smith, Mia Farrow, David Niven, George Kennedy, etc.) adaptation of one of Christie's best tales.<br /><br />Lois Chiles plays Linnet Ridgeway, a spoiled heiress who is talked by her best friend Jackie (Mia Farrow) - a perky, vibrant woman who is at the opposite of the wealth spectrum from Linnet - into giving a job to Jackie's handsome husband-to-be, Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale).  Within a short period of time, however, it's Linnet and Simon who end up in love and married ... and a spiteful, vengeful Jackie who follows the couple on their whirlwind honeymoon, stalking and ridiculing them at every turn.<br /><br />Enter the famous detective Hercule Poirot (Ustinov), on vacation and taking a cruise up the Nile when he runs into the Doyles - both of whom beg him to talk to Jackie before something truly bad happens.  But Jackie is not to be dissuaded, and soon murder occurs ... and the one person who seems to have a cast-iron alibi is Jackie.<br /><br />A VERY cool whodunnit, often played tongue-in-cheek and worth seeing for the cast alone (though the film also offers some beautiful location shots).  Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, playing (respectively) a rich curmudgeon and her manly nurse, are a special delight when on-screen, either alone or together, and the ending is purely typical of an Agatha Christie puzzle that will surprise those not in the know.  One of my favorites of the Christie films out there.
B008J34466|4.0|I enjoy listening to this CD but, am not a fan of all of the songs.  I love &#34;Just Give Me a Reason&#34; and several others.  Some are a bit off color but, on the whole, it's a good CD.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie is hard to watch for the most part. But the time goes by quickly so it must draw you in somehow. Don't watch this on a first date.
147674355X|5.0|Another great emotional read from this author. From the beginning you are captivated by the characters, invested in their future and curious about their pasts. How their lives are intertwined as the story unfolds is fascinating. The ending was heart-rending and had me in tears. I am very much looking forward to the next book in the series Losing Hope.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|In `Django Unchained' Quentin Tarantino continues to fictionalise history, as he did so successfully in `Inglorious B's'. Here he brings his violent comic-book style of film making to the period of black plantation-slavery in the pre-civil war southern states of the US.<br /><br />Essentially DU is a fantasy-revenge western containing all the clich&eacute;s of that genre as written by Sergio Leone in the 1960s. The screenplay is an amalgam of `Kill Bill' (the relentless repetitive splattering of enemies one by one, and sometimes 10 by 10) and IB (the fantasy revenge of a persecuted minority on their evil-cartoon-cut-out oppressors). As such its target audience is more likely to be juvenile and sensation-seeking than mature and sophisticated.<br /><br />The saving grace of all Tarantino's films is the witty and clever dialogue, which here (unlike the action and basic plot) is anything but formulaic and continues to entertain throughout. The excellent Christoph Waltz trumps even his stellar appearance as the Nazi villain in IB to deliver a second Oscar-winning performance as King Schultz, the catalyst who holds the story together and drives the action for all but the final reel. Waltz's dialogue is witty, original, clich&eacute;-free; delivered with a rare commanding intelligence and perfect timing. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in yet another outstanding character performance as the monstrous white racist and slave-owner Calvin J. Candie, Schultz's ultimate nemesis. Considering the restrictions of his dialogue Jamie Foxx is just OK but simply doesn't have the screen presence of for example Clint Eastwood in the `Dollars' movies to which DU pays homage; Samuel L. Jackson however shines in a difficult role as smart, sycophantic house slave Stephen inexplicably devoted to Candie. The only disappointment among the main characters is Kerry Washington as Django's enslaved and long-suffering wife Broomhilda. In place of the strong ballsy character full of defiance and witty dialogue that she might have been she instead just whimpers, whines and suffers causing the audience to wonder what on Earth does Django see in her?<br /><br />The mostly clever script however does not rescue the film from the usual Tarantino excess. Unable to resist the temptation to titillate the juvenile sensibilities of his target audience and instead offer the audience any deeper perspectives on slavery, almost every sentence of dialogue for the whole 165 minutes is sprinkled with the `n' & `f' words. The ketchup-splatter violence gets to be - well just dull, actually. It's overdone to the point of pastiche, so anaesthetises its audience to the degree that all impact is lost. Tarantino needs to mature as a film maker and realise that if a measure of profanity in the right place adds to the power of a script and occasional acts of violence can hook the audience, then relentless repetition actually diminishes the viewing experience and can cause any mature thinking audience (with a mental age above 12) to lose interest and switch off.<br /><br />So overall just OK: good dialogue and screenwriting with some exemplary acting performances, but ultimately marred by plastic, splatter-cartoon violence, almost ubiquitous unsophisticated racial stereotyping, little attempt at historical accuracy and as a film, lacking in serious substance. This is a shame, as the result could have been so much better. But hey, you may say, at the end of the day it's just schlock entertainment and fantasy fulfilment, not meant to be real - which is true.might have been she instead just whimpers, whines and suffers causing the audience to wonder what on Earth does Django see in her?<br /><br />The mostly clever script however does not rescue the film from the usual Tarantino excess.

B003QSOFFO|4.0|Ok, so this isn't the full on truth about what actually happened. We know Disney has a tendency to either romanticize or lighten things up for the kids. However based on what I have read they did capture the essence of the real Pocahontas's effervescent, innocent and charismatic personality. I loved this movie as a child and love it more as an adult especially once I began researching my family history and discovered that my great-aunt's husband of 50 years was a direct descendant of Pocahontas and her husband John Rolfe, who is mentioned in the sequel.<br /><br />I think this movie is done what it is supposed to.... entertain and give a nudge for the budding history lover to begin researching a real life person or persons.

B007G3H8Y0|5.0|After only recently discovering Train and listening to nearly all of their CD's, this has to be the best of them all.  There is not a bad track on the entire CD.  I listen to it almost every time I get in my truck and it never fails to get me drumming on my steering wheel and singing the lyrics, though I can't carry a tune in a bucket!  Pat Monahan's voice and elocution of the sometimes catchy, oftentimes heartfelt lyrics are amazing.  If you are looking for a really good CD of Train's music, you don't have to look any further.....this is it.

030758836X|4.0|This novel was pretty insane...definitely a huge page turner, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and I finished it in a few days(staying up until 1 or 2 am every night)The ending was somewhat disappointing, however I do understand why it ended that way and the message that was being conveyed. I would definitely recommend to anyone that loves mysteries!
147674355X|5.0|Holy hell this book is good. I immediately fell in love with the characters and did not expect all the twists the book had in store. I loved their story and so glad how the book ended....even though it left you still wondering some things. My only complaint on the story is it seems like there were some things left unsaid - I wanted to know more about the fight Dean had with the guy before he left school for a year. I feel like at the end it started to show more about the characters in the book and made me want more!
1936891026|5.0|This book is so incredibly powerful. When a friend of mine first pushed me to read this book, I wasn't sure what i was getting into. This book came into my life at just the right time, and I've looked back on my highlights countless times to remind me of what I learned. This is *not* a book for only artists or people working in the creative space, this is a book everyone can get something out of. I can't recommend it enough. For me, this is a Top 5 of all time.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Instant Classic - really exceeds the hype/expectations. People will be having fun dance parties and inspiring listening sessions to these songs for yeeeaaars - if thats not worth 5 stars then I don't know what is. I'm never easily impressed and I've never even written any reviews on here, but I honestly felt driven to make a review for once. No music collection can be complete without this. It's like Quincy Jones and John Williams had babies with every legendary musician you can think of and then those babies met and had a biblical sized superjam to end all superjams -- all you have to do is buy this album for front row seats.

She makes this song one that sticks.  Thank god , voices, techniques, feelings, composers have not disappeared.  Thank Cap Public Radio, 88.9 fm. for making  it happen ; that' why I am one of their subscribers and supporters for many years.  Here' s to them!  Here's. to Life!  Here's to Shirley Horn!

B000QCS8TW|4.0|The first 100  pages were very painful and slow. This was in part to the details being given about every single character. If you can manage to get past that part it gets very interesting.  Each of the character become so real and you find yourself rooting for certain characters to die.  The ending was great yet I won't be rushing to get the next book, I will wiki the character fates.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|This game is really awesome. But I have had some problems were I will be playing and the controls and everything just stop working which is very frustrating when you are in the middle of a boss battle. I also had a problem where all my skills and potions went away and the skills screen didn't have anything on it. So I quit out of the game and restarted my kindle fire but it was still the same so then I had to reinstall the game and restart all over again. I was level 26 at the time and just had gotten past the goblins boss and then had to restart l which really disappointed me. The game great though and if you guys over at gameloft fix those problems up it will be much better.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Gwenyth Paltrow was, as always, very good. Amazon was also very quick about the shipping process so we didn't have to wait very long to receive it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|After about 45 minutes we walked out of the 3-D version.  Fortunately the multiplex we were at had 2 screens in 2-D.<br /><br />The manager there told us they now sell more tickets for 2-D than 3-D. We had to wait about 15 minutes for the 2-D to start but it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />Into Darkness is a terrific Star Trek movie I enjoyed all the characters very much. To me Star Trek has always been more about the story and the plot rather than special effects. This movie delivers both very well.<br /><br />Hopefully when the Blu-ray comes out, they will include a true digital copy, as opposed to the universally loathed ultraviolet.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|I know 'The Dark Side of the Moon' is the record most frequently described as such, but I really couldn't disagree more. This is a band in its purest form: freewheeling, spirited, and not afraid to experiment. This is partly why this record is noticeably less 'consistent' than their later, highly-polished commercial successes; but it's also why the high-points have so much more impact.<br /><br />I hadn't listened to Floyd much for a few years now, but a friend recently insisted I come over and hear DSOTM on his new stereo system. He says it's the greatest album of all-time, with which I disagree. Admittedly, it did sound awesome from a purely audiophilic point-of-view. There was something missing, though. My friend thought for sure this experience would win a convert, but instead it inspired me to go home, queue up Piper in mono, and listen LOUD on my own system. Boy, am I glad I did.<br /><br />What was missing from DSOTM is present in large quantities here. The album has so much more punch, not only in its often much more raucous sound, but in the way its abundant creative spirit grabs a hold of your attention. Sure, it didn't have the pristine recording quality or the consistency of its younger sibling, but it makes up for that quite easily I think in just how thrilling the peaks are. For music-lovers who could take or leave the sound of later Floyd, don't you dare write this album off before hearing it. And when you do hear it, hear it in mono!

0385349831|3.0|This is the first book I've ready by this author, and I was generally entertained.  What this book attempts to do is provide quasi truisms, life insights, etc., through the context of a story.  The story essentially revolves around a city facing destruction hundreds of years ago, with various inhabitants discussing their problems with the local elder, who proceeds to address a series of topics (happiness, love, etc), in response to specific questions.  Unfortunately, I only found it to be average quality.  The insights were mostly not that inspiring, and bordered on either pitifully obvious, overly fatalistic, or other unworkable scenarios.  The concept was great, but the actual substance was weak.

B00A8307BG|4.0|I have been following Robin Trower, since about 1973. I saw him live in 1974, kick show and again in 1975 at Capitol Center in Washington DC. It did not take long for me to learn , this guy, is as good as, I believe, really better than Hendrix or Clapton. Why? he has a style all his own and is one of the few in the entire world, that can make a Fender do &#34;whatever&#34; he wants it to do. He does not have any bad albums. Now, about this album, like Carlos Santana remake of guitar singles classics, it is good. Not Robin's best though, but you must factor in his age. He does not have the energy or power of his one astonishing youthful performances. The music is good and the songs are classic, I would have picked some better guitar songs, more recent from the 60's and 70's than what he chose. Here, he focus on blues and older rocker songs and does a fine, if not better job, than the original performers. I'm glad I bought it, but felt other reviewer ratinigs were hyped up a bit, perhaps they don't own some of his more passionate music?

B00CE004XM|4.0|I developed a fascination with both Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa after their first collaboration Don't Explain.  When I heard that they were doing another album just two years later, I could hardly wait.  While they previewed a number of the songs and added commentary with their pre-release webisodes, the finished product really delivers the goods.  As with the first album, they worked with Kevin Shirley to select songs that span a large selection of recorded R&B and Blues.  There's a great mix of burners and rompers (\\"Nutbush City Limits\\", \\"Can't Let Go\\", and \\"Seesaw\\") and driven, slow burn ballads (\\"Close To My Fire\\", \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\", and \\"Strange Fruit\\").  Bonamassa delivers a blistering solo at the end of \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\", and Hart's vocals are spot on from beginning to end.  It is a great tribute to artists that they cover.  I found it interesting that both of the Bonamassa/Hart collaborations include a song from present day chanteuse Melody Gardot.  Seesaw features Hart's reinvention of \\"If I Tell You I Love You\\".  It speaks volumes for Gardot that she has been selected twice alongside the likes of Etta James, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, and Tina Turner.  The selection here adds a touch of Brazilian spice paired with Hart's playful vocal delivery.  The rest of the musicians give great supporting performances.  I wish they were bring this show to my town, but it looks like Europe gets the limited goods for now.  I will gladly settle for the recorded versions here.  I highly recommend this to all Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa fans along with those who enjoy new interpretations of R&B and Blues music.<br /><br />Download this:  \\"If I Tell You I Love You\\"

Halle Berry says, \\"she doesn't expect to ever be in a similar picture\\" just because it is so different a format.

143353083X|4.0|Overall the job of the team who worked on this version is remarkable.<br /> But I expected more details, meanings or explanations about specific facts (like the life and the deeds of Jesus Christ).<br />I found the explanations too simple, lacking, in my opinion, the philosophical immersion and the various implications in the history and the evolution of mankind.<br />However I understand that the task of the team was not conceived in this way, so they carefully avoided controversy and debate.<br />That is why I rate it 4 stars. Also the pages of the paperback version are very, very thin and look fragile so keep in mind this aspect.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I find this app useful when creating a professional presence online because you gain access to other professionals. It also useful when you are looking for a job or just some reccomendations. I reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a job.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|The events in the show are thought provoking and very interesting presented in a superb manner. In these episodes the evil is always defeated. Peter Falk is a master detective who establishes proofs by observing insignificant things and surprises us by solving the murder mystery at the end. I enjoyed the stories very much and I gladly recommend them to others. If you like mystery and detective stories, you will never be bored.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Great addition, must have addition to your collection if you are a fan of the series. I highly recommend it.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|A great television series in its prime. A great example of the golden age of television tha we currently live in.  Although MAd Men didnt win as many awards as it had in previous seasons, this was an outstanding season.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|Great addition, must have addition to your collection if you are a fan of the series. I highly recommend it.
B000002H6C|5.0|One of the most underrated albums of all-time.  Classic double-base resounds through the entire album.  Metallica at their apex!  One question, who still buys CDs?  I did, b/c I needed a hard copy of this album!
B003PIUC02|5.0|Great addition, must have addition to your collection if you are a fan of the series. I highly recommend it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I freaking loved this book!!<br /><br />I've never laughed so much while reading a book and I've never highlighted so many passages that I loved in a book. It came out swinging and never got slow, it was a great read, not too short, not too long. Perfect!<br /><br />Drew is a womanizing jerk, but man is he flipping funny! To imagine his POV was written by a woman just makes it even better. She does an amazing job of getting us in a man's head without actually being there. In this genre, we don't see too many books that are written in the mans POV and usually when it is, it's not as funny as this. This book reminds me of two books I've previously read, Wallbanger for the hilarity and Fate Interrupted. Both great books.<br /><br />Kate is a great character, easy to love. She's very strong, driven and dedicated. It had to be her that caused Drew to wake up and quit being a jerkbag. Although, there was some things that happened that were almost borderline cheating, it didn't get very ugly in that aspect. I know some people don't like that subject matter, but I think they're safe reading this.<br /><br />Overall, a hilarious read! I hope she continues this series and writes books from Jack and Matthew's POV's. I was glad she wrote this from Drew's POV, because I really think he was a much stronger character than Kate, not that she wasn't great as well. He was just hilarious!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Great addition, must have addition to your collection if you are a fan of the series. I highly recommend it.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|Great addition, must have addition to your collection if you are a fan of the series. I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book, and everything about it. I love the way the characters are presented. I love how you feel the emotion, and the love between the characters. The way Suzanne Collins presents all the information in the book was perfect, I felt like I was one of the gamemakers watching every move the tributes make.
B0058YPILY|4.0|Used this to boost the signal strenght on a long run from one end of the house to the other.  Made it possible to get channels that wouldn't come in before and cleared up a lot of the &#34;snow&#34;n the other channels.<br /><br />Quick and easy solution for improving signal strength.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I love all of their CD's but this one is definitely my favorite. Every song connected to the next seamlessly and beautifully. Couldn't ask for more. :)
193700788X|1.0|After waiting for every book in the series to come out we get this crap ending. This book didn't follow any of the normal characteristics of the characters in the previous books. It was quite obvious that the author just up on the past few books. I wanted eric and sookie to find a way to be together and that didnt happen. What the hell kind of ending was this? Sookie and  sam end up together that was out of the blue. Sookie wasnt even upset that eric left her. Let alone all the past charcters she brought back that were long gone. Half the time I didnt even think I was reading a sookie Stackhouse novel instead I felt that I read a novel about an incent girl being convicted wrongly. Where were all the vampire's?  This story line made no sense at all. It was horribly written and I didnt even want to finish the book personally. Highly disappointed that the series was thrown down the drain.  Might was well turned on the meat grinder and shoved this book in it. Thank you for wasting my time and money on such an awful book. Would not recommend this book to any fan following the series you'll be highly disappointed and confused!!!!
B003K16P3M|5.0|Enthralling book, stunning story telling and world building. Katsa is the strong, inspiring female protagonist girls today should be reading.
0553801473|5.0|Such a great book. Martin definitely delivers in the latest installment of the series. Only downside is that all I want to do now is read the next one!
B001XUPF2O|5.0|I had heard so many raves about the Dark Knight and it took me years to finally watch it. It was worth it. A deeper look in to the &#34;Hero&#34; persona--the good, bad, hopeful, pathological. I also like that the film has a sense of mystery about how things will turn out.
1401307450|5.0|As a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, this book is a must have. Anthony Kiedis is very candid about his life and career. A great read.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book was just amazing I felt every emotion the writer was putting on the pages It made me happy,sad, mad. It was just a wonderful story about a young women who didn't seem so young because of everything she had been through with her husband and when she was finally free you just couldn't help but pull for her and want her to make it and be ok and happy because she deserved to be and the ending is so surprising. It's an absolute must read  for anyone who loves a great story with lots of ups and downs
067941715X|3.0|Beware ladies, this is a guy's opinion.<br />This book was a difficult read for me. I liked the story and the plot was solid, but the characters, including the main one, were very hard to enjoy for the long haul. Mr. Tilney was an acceptable character though, and he is the main reason I could bear reading through the bulk of the sections where he cropped up. Catherine, the heroine, was quite the opposite. She was young and VERY naive, dealing with nights out on the town should never be so tedious, but this girl managed to amplify every little thing that happened around her. Her companions, save for Miss Tilney, were equally frustrating, not to mention forceful and stronger in will as well as more experienced in the arts of manipulation than Catherine could ever hope to be. She was as weak and inexperienced as a sheltered girl of 17 should be, so I suppose I must say that I am more frustrated with the natural mindset of teen-aged people than with Jane Austen's depiction of them because she must have done a bang-up job in order for Catherine's decisions to annoy me so very much! The plot was typical for Austen's works, but this story is not as well known as say Pride and Prejudice. This is probably due to some measure of the reasons stated above. Either way, it was worth reading and was not wholly bad in the least.<br /><br />Overall: I would encourage others to read this book. It was a good read, but the characters are not the kind I am willing to admit falling in love with. I think Mr. Tilney displayed the highest degree of common sense and is therefore my favorite from this book as I am sure he is for many other readers as well. It is not an age specific article, although teens will appreciate Catherine far more than adults.<br /><br />The physical book is wonderfully though not fancily bound, and the extras included with it are worth your attention. If you love Austen's work and are looking for a really good publication, then this is the copy you want!
B001LX2J22|4.0|I think the movie had a plot that unfolded in a comfortable time frame. Enjoyed it, as I did the other Hanibal movies
B00632HWOG|4.0|This is my email of choice at the moment.  We will see what the future holds.  It is easy to access and I like that my mail stays stored until I am ready to review it.
B001O37WTY|1.0|I love John Malkovich however the characters portrayed by Cameron Diaz and John Cuzak did NO JUSTICE to their otherwise reputable acting careers. I'm not saying they are award winners - but there are many movies that I think they did an excellent job in - this one really sucks.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I think we the American people should be able to access more books about our National security and its happenings.  This book kept my attention fully and has pushed me to analyze the news with more knowledge than before.  I like this genre and look forward to more books like this.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am not a fiction reader, but this story caught my attention and surprised me at the end. loved it
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book on my Kindle where you can see what percentage you have completed.  At 40% it was finally beginning to get interesting.  It is written from two points of view, the husband and the wife.  If you find it difficult to switch back and forth it will be somewhat confusing.  Some parts are predictible, and some intriguing.  I am not fond of the ending but that's just me.  I guessed what would happen but I think it's because I read quite a bit.  I am not sure I would read another of her books entirely, but I would give it a try.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Almost as<br /> good as Percy Jackson stories and one of the best books I've ever read in my life time
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Loved the movie and you can't beat what you get for the price! If you haven't seen this (or even if you have) you won't be disappointed with this purchase!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book two felt short and rushed, not so with three. This was a highly entertaining series; and book three finishes the trilogy off nicely.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|I purchased this as a gift but  the recipient didn't care for it . The dvd operated like it was meant too.
0307712508|5.0|When it comes to science, I am one that normally glosses over. Not so with The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Here Rebecca Skloot has woven together a medical mystery with social history, biography, autobiography and a study of medical ethics into a fascinating account that makes me want to know more.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook on my commute, which was excellently done by Cassandra Campbell with Bahni Turpin. And the audio version includes an interesting interview with the author at the end.<br /><br />I had never heard of HeLa cells, much less Henrietta Lacks, before listening to this book. But now this piece of history and science has come to life, causing me to ask questions about medical ethics that never occured to me before.<br /><br />I am a high school librarian, and have recommended this title to my colleagues, but especially those who deal with health, biology and medical ethics issues.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|I purchased this as a gift & I haven't received any complaints about it. I hear it being played from time to time so what more can you ask for ?
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I was just so happy that we finally got the ending of the Wheel of Time that I was perfectly happy with ignoring a couple of little hiccups here and there in the narrative. Sure, we will never get to read exactly what Robert Jordan would have written had he been able to, but Brandon Sanderson did just about about as wonderful a job as could be humanly expected in the situation.
B00821OX98|5.0|hope we get to see them all  enjoying the  free streeming comes with this membership<br />watching somethng every day.<br />thank you

B000002TLX|5.0|This is the second compilation I bought for Richard Marx who is known by his great hits during late 80s to mid 90s. In Japan ballad collection \\"ballads\\" was released during mid 90s. While ballads covers major hits from Richard Marx's debut(1987), Repeat Offender(1989), Rush Street(1991) and Paid Vacation(1993), this 1997 compilation has some tracks from Flesh and Bone such as UNTIL I FIND YOU AGAIN, and TOUCH OF HEAVEN. Particularly I am happy that TOUCH OF HEAVEN is included here because it showcases Richard Marx's soulful appeal quite well. Also this compilation recovers guitar parts of my favorite ballad songs ANGELIA and HOLD ON TO THE NIGHT. Ballads has shorter radio edits of both songs which cut off guitar parts. ANGELIA is album version and HOLD ON TO THE NIGHT is close to album edition. Downside is that this compilation lacks some of the great hit songs such as TOO LATE TO SAY GOODBYE, CHAINS AROUND MY HEART, and great should-be tracks such as WAIT FOR THE SUNSHINE from Repeat Offenders and NOTHING TO HIDE and SILENT SCREAM from Paid Vacation.<br /><br />After this compilation is out Richard has some nice works such as<br />DAYS IN AVALON, MY OWN BEST ENEMY, and INSIDE MY HEAD. He is also known as the songwriter for grammy-winning song by N Syncs \\"THIS I PROMISE YOU\\".<br /><br />Verdict: Nice compilation to recap Richard's glory days<br />Rating: 95 out of 100<br />Recommended for: 80s to mid 90s pop music fans
B006LSZECO|3.0|Kept my attention, had a few twists, but then just fizzled out. Worth reading if you don't mind crappy endings.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was able to relate to the contest of the book, due to how accurately, my personal feelings and worries were described in it. This book inspires women for action, providing them with guidelines for their career paths and gives a comforting feeling, which insures that everything is going to be just fine, if you follow your dreams and passions.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love this book!!! Would love to find more just like this! I can't wait to read more by Emma Chase!
0375869026|5.0|My 11 year old granddaughter asked for this book so I ordered it.  She has never had preowned books so I was waiting for her<br />to say something about it.  The only thing she said was that it was a great book.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a very good read and I went into it with extremely low expectations. I am definitely going to read the rest of the trilogy.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth and Joe have done it again. This effervescent follow up album to the exquisite Don't Explain is again stellar, yet more upbeat, high energy, soulful and rockin. No sophomore slump here. Beth & Joe have hit their stride and perhaps are even more in tune with working together on the second go around.<br /><br />A classy choice of songs have been selected, previously recorded by Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Billie Holiday, Donnie Hathaway, Lucinda Williams, Buddy Miles, Tina Turner, Slackwax, Melody Gardot, and Nina Simone.  From big band sounds, to sultry ballads, to balls out growl and howl, to French inspired with Arlan Schierbaum on accordion. Somehow the diversity of the songs are tied together to make a cohesive whole. Anton Fig gives a powerhouse performance on drums with the rest of the excellent band Blondie Chaplin and Carmine Rojas rounding everything out.<br /><br />Vintage songs and in a sense vintage recording as well. Producer Kevin Shirley's method of recording live in the studio with the entire band playing together is the antithesis of so much of today's manipulated and computerized music. This band is interacting with each other and having FUN - and you can hear it in the music! Later in the process the horns by Lee Thornburg and Ron Dziubla are added as well as the strings by Jeff Bova which just takes everything to yet another level.<br /><br />Beth Hart not only has an effing astounding voice, but the ability to truly connect with the material and make it her own, then communicate the emotion behind it. Joe Bonamassa augments the songs and compliments Beth's vocals perfectly with tasteful guitar work that is restrained in places and in some places he really lets loose. He shines on the solo at the end of I Love You More than You'll Ever Know with bluesy, soulful work.<br /><br />Stunning record. Brilliantly done. One of the best albums of the year. A big sassy bitch of an album!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Visually this game is very pleasing. Kind of disappointed when I completed it. I was hoping for more! I would definitely recommend this game to friends.
0671449028|5.0|Cute illustrations and a great rhyming story make this the perfect read-aloud book before going to bed. My 3 children chose this book so often I still have it memorized 25 years later!!!

B000002J0B|4.0|If you're an old hippie, like myself, the way to go is previously owned CD,s.<br />You probably won't listen to them all the time (?) but they're always available when you get that song stuck in your head.

I contacted the manufacturer with a picture of the package(I\\"ll update later with their response).<br /><br />5/22/2013<br />Edit:-<br /><br />The manufacturer confirmed the product is Authentic from the S/N# sticker which is found on the side of the plastic box.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|great and entertaining.  a great value for the money.  I have watched the first five disc and will startthe next  ones asap.  wberry
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Very predictable... reads like it was written to be a movie and accordingly you can anticipate what's going to happen based on other movies seen in the past.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|something to pass time.. to put you to sleep. it better for young kids. its okay.. it was free. enjoy
B003O86FMW|4.0|Short but easy to read.  Picked up right where the first book ended.  Honestly didn't see some of the stuff coming - unlike the final book in the series.  Held my interest throughout.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game has a good tutorial so is easy to follow. There is also plenty to do so you can expand as much as you like.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a really good game. The only thing that sucks is the amount of space(749.Mb) it takes up.Besides that the game is pretty fun to play;you can play online with friends or just play alone<br />.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Like Batman? Like special features? Like Bluray? Look no further! &#34;its the BAT-man&#34; I need seven more works for this.........
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was an enjoyable game for the most part. My pet peeve with these adventure games is all the running back and forth from location to location but this game doesn't make you do that - once you're in a location there are only a handful of options of where you can go. That was a huge plus for me. The story was pretty intriguing and the game has an actual end to the story which was also nice. My reasons for not giving it 5 stars -- the hidden objects are sometimes extremely hard to see (even using the zoom feature - so the hint button came in handy), and sometimes you have to tap an item several times to get it to highlight. Also, there aren't many mini-games and I kind of missed them. Overall, though, I liked it and feel it was  worth the money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very favorite show ever.  I think I may have to start over again and watch it from the beginning!  Can't wait until season 4
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|This lavelier mike is a good deal. Very well build and with all needed accessories. The only negative point I could find is that it picks up too much ambiant noise. But for the price, I'm willing to deal with it as really good professional wireless lavalier mikes start above 500 $ per unit and I needed 4 lavalier mikes!
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|I loved the way the movie started out.  Seeing the girls acting wild and distorted.  Also not seeing \\"Mama\\" except for quick movements and shadows.  However;  here comes the CGIs...from the middle of the film to the end.  I felt like I was watching a Saturday morning cartoon.  This reminded me of how \\"Prometheus\\" ended up. Another big disappointment!  I totally agree with other reviews, bring back the films with real actors and props leave out the CGIs.  Not very convincing!
B00C061I3K|1.0|If I could give it zero stars I would.  After reading their article in GQ (can't remember the mag) last month even they said this album would suck and I now believe it.  This sounds like some lame disco music to sleep to, again I understand not trying to repeat the same sound but come on put some life into it.  At least the chemical brothers (from the same era) keep their music jumpin.<br /><br />In conclusion.... When artists get bored with their sound (Pearl Jam, Radiohead comes to mind)they tend to just tone it down and call it art.<br /><br />Peace
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Overall this works well and quickly gets dull knives sharp.<br /><br />I'd say the two areas I'd point out would be the size and the lifespan.<br /><br />Size: It would be much easier to manipulate and use both sharpening surfaces if there was at least about another inch of surface on the plastic. Just a personal thing maybe, but with different sized knifes (specifically larger knives) the extra area to grip would be nice but not a dealbreaker<br /><br />Lifespan: I've only been using it a short time so it's a bit difficult to tell but I'm a little concerned that the wear surface (not just shavings from the knives) is showing signs of wear. Might take more time to know if this is of any real concern.<br /><br />Still a great sharpener and a good value.
0685239276|2.0|I did not enjoy this at all. The book revolves around a girl who wants to preserve her family to include only her father and herself. No one else. She doesn't want her father to marry anyone to split apart the family. Not Elsa and definitely not Anne. I find the protagonist, Cecile, to be very annoying. She is the most indecisive person I've ever met. One chapter she can want to seek revenge. Then she'd let it go in the next chapter. Her decision just keeps changing each chapter. It got very annoying, just like her. And I did not like the ending at all.
0425252868|5.0|My mother (94) and a WWII veteran who &#34;fought the war with a typewriter at Headquarters&#34; could not put this book down.  She says it is historically accurate and confirms so many details told her by my father, also a WWII veteran. It was a time of hand-to-hand combat, fighting without GPS and computers. Laughter and tears. A revelation of humanity within an inhuman situation.
0142410705|4.0|I'm a bit disappointed by this book after reading The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns. Compared to those two, this one just seems to be missing something. It wasn't quite as funny as those two either. It has an interesting premise, but I did not connect with the character Collin. He is obsessed with anagrams and trying to find a theorem that can predict how future relationships will end. I find both of those things to be very interesting, but there can only be a certain amount of ranting about theorems because I stop caring. The book definitely has some twists and turns that keep me interested. However, none of those points made me think \\"Gee, this is my new favorite book\\".
1451697686|5.0|I have followed Bea's blog for some time and asked our library to get her book....great ideas, not preachy but really inspiring.  Lots of ideas to get anyone started, something for everyone.  Bea will be to Zero Waste and general trash reduction what Amy Dacyczyn is to frugality with the classic Tightwad Gazette.  You won't be disappointed. Recently our neighbor asked why our large family  produces half the trash of their family of 2....a very happy moment!...but always room for improvement!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Nicely paced  and easy to learn without getting bored . Great for kids and adults. At $1 it i s definitely worth getting
030758836X|5.0|Great summer read, or winter, fall or spring for that matter.  Amy and NIck embody the image of the self absorbed metro couples today.  Amy's perfectionism, Nick's disconnect represents our computer obsessed culture.  How well do we really know the people we are with, when we spend our day in virtual relationships.  Do we even know how to discover each other anymore? Suspenseful, yes.  Did I guess ( I don't want to give anything away), yes, did it matter- no!  Like the rest of the book, the ending was a necessary commentary on the morally bankrupt society we find ourselves in today.  Filled with cliches, I loved the twist at the end.  Did it make me uncomfortable- for sure- and that's a good book!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a pretty fun game if u like puzzel games these kinds of games are alwyas a good mental game to work ur brain so I give it a 5 star rating
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. It compares well to sim city. I think it is addictive though, so play at your own risk. It can be a time hole.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game. It was so interesting and I loved every minute of it! Challenging yet FUN!!!! A definite must play.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was so captivated by these books that I was neglecting my duties around me because I didn't want to stop reading them.  I'm glad it only took me a few days to read them.<br /><br />I recommend these as a must read for the older teen and above crowd because of the violence.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I usually only buy a CD if over half the tracks are good. Out of 11 tracks, I like 9 of them!! Great CD!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Addicted to this game ! Can't seem to stop playing! Love the options for play! Would definitely recommend this game to all solitaire players!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I installed this CPU on a new GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 to upgrade a computer that did a lot of word processing.  The computer originally had an AMD Phenom 9750 with a Chipset AMD 780G.  There is an amazing difference. CPU runs very cool with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus.  Had no problems installing.  Great CPU for an excellent price. The user is running a digital transcription software that used to lapse, but now runs very smoothly.
067101756X|4.0|Can be a tough read for some. However the subject matter is riveting. Some of this book is very believable but don't take my word for it. Read it
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|Cruise has good acting chops and throws them around in this film about a ex mega soldier and drifter who gets in the business of clearing a comrades name. The film was such a bore that when the action/fight scenes came (and they were decent), you got a chance to perk up in your easy chair only to slump back into it for the next 45 minutes. Its too bad all the film had was Cruise with big brass ones bringing it to the bad guys a few times. The surrounding story is a snore with just a smidgen of tension. The door looks open for a sequel and if the makers step up the storyline and add some interesting characters that are not as bland as the first go, it could be good.
1574214276|3.0|This has some good patterns and ideas but there is not a whole lot of them.  Small volume, only 20 pages with a section for children.
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|Well, although I don't usually write a movie review, I've decided to write a few for some of my favorite movies of all-time. The Edge is one of my all-time pesonal favorites, and comes Very Highly Recommended. This is classic story telling at it's very best. They just don't make movies like this anymore. I've had a copy on standard dvd ever since it became available. I decided to order a copy on blu-ray after reading the top-notch video & audio reviews. And, let me tell ya, I was not disappointed. The picture is very vivid and clear, with amazing color. It was like watching the movie for the very first time (well, almost). The landscape as the plane is flying in the air is simply breath-taking. The sound, nothing short of superb as all six speakers work in unison. The actors, along with the acting and plot are all first-rate. And, there is just the right amount of adventure. Oh, and let's not forget about the real star of this movie, The BEAR!!!!! I've only been watching movies for the past ten years. I've always been an audio lover, but it's only been since the last ten years that I started watching movies. Believe it or not, I didn't watch much tv and didn't even own a tv until 2002.  I can't stress enough about how amazing it is to watch and experience a movie in 5.1 Surround and up, with an HDTV. I feel that for all movie lovers it's a very, very worth while investment. BTW, 4K Ultra HD is here. I can only imagine what it must be like to have that with at least 7.2 Surround. WOW!!!!!!!!!!
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Strange as it may seem, the horses in the film did not do for me what the horse puppets did for me in the Making of  the film, but then it's all a matter of personal expectaions. I would if possible, rather see the play than the movie.
0062059963|3.0|This book is frothy and enjoyable, and I did totally devour all of the twists and complications (especially re: Maxon) even when I saw them coming.  That said, I find the character of Aspen to be completely wooden and while America's indecisiveness about Maxon makes total sense (I mean, she'd be the princess...that's a lot to swallow no matter how dreamy the prince is) the love triangle doesn't really work for me because Aspen is a total placeholder character that could be easily renamed \\"Insert Plot Device to Create Love Triangle Here.\\"  At this point the choice shouldn't be between Aspen and Maxon, but between Go Home and Maxon.<br /><br />I have to say America had some great character moments and I do still like her as a protagonist even when she is being ridiculous. But there is something about this book in particular that seems decidedly, well, misogynistic. While I enjoyed the fact that Maxon wasn't so lily-white as he seemed in the first book, the way that America ends up ultimately accepting his behavior without much recrimination seemed a little off to me.  Instead of being a scathing commentary against the inherent offensiveness of this national Bachelor-like competition to find the future queen, like the first book, this book sort of gets caught up in itself and ends up suggesting some slightly unsavory things about a woman's place and a woman's worth.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Again, I am totally intrigued by Maxon, but I was also pretty disturbed by him making out with Celeste.  And while his character seemed momentarily unredeemable Cass did a good job of re-complicating him, but his very lame and weak explanation for his behavior with Celeste was, well, not very good writing.  I think a slightly more experienced author could have kept in the make-out scene but spun the explanation in a more positive light--not so much \\"oh I just really needed to make out with someone so I just used that gold-digging skank Celeste\\" and more \\"I was feeling really overwhelmed and you and Kriss were pushing me away and she made me feel so desirable and I was so confused and I'm really sorry.\\"  Come on, he didn't even really apologize!<br /><br />However, in spite of my misgivings I am definitely going to read The One because this series moves along at a pretty fast clip and I totally want to know what happens.  It's more well-written than Twilight...but not necessarily better-plotted.  It's a fun mind-vacation and since the premise of the series is actually quite intriguing I guess I'm willing to forgive a lot.
B009R659L8|5.0|The story line is tight and moves right along.  It's fast reading and a &#34;one-nighter.&#34;  It all ties together nicely and you finish the book satisfied.  It's a mystery, not a thriller.
B002ZG99J0|1.0|horror, terror, suspense?? naked chicks? naaa naaa nothing..low budget cheap movie, no sense movie, two  boring chicks full dressed talk like parrots 33 minutes in some dream dorm (WT what dorm is nice?) even is no close or copy to white female or other suspense movie, bad actors,  bad dialogue, bad movie, stay away of this movie, really bad movie, the director and producer must be banned to film another movie...stay away don't rent or buy
B00BYISQTO|5.0|The National is one of those groups that you don't quite understand at first, yet with time their music becomes something personal and affecting. With every album they expand their sound, dig a little bit deeper, and unearth some treasures that leave you speechless. Trouble Will Find Me is exactly what you would expect from this group: tight musicianship, haunting atmosphere, and melodies that stick with you long after the record has finished playing.<br /><br />The good news for fans is that this isn't a radical departure from what's come before. If you've enjoyed anything from their previous albums then you'll feel right at home here among the band's trademarks. Matt Berninger's delicate baritone voice glides effortlessly over every cut, from the tender opening of \\"I Should Live in Salt\\" to the creepy introspection of \\"Demons\\". He remains the group's driving force and instantly pulls you into the dark and sordid affairs of these songs. The band members themselves are solid as always and each one adds a subtle yet indelible touch every step of the way. Repeated listens reveal just how intricate these songs are and you'll begin to hear flourishes and small production touches that had previously remained hidden. Musically it's a bit more fast-paced, akin to their earlier work and the sequencing ensures that ballads like \\"Fireproof\\" and \\"This Is the Last Time\\" are mixed nicely with driving anthems like \\"Sea of Love\\" and \\"Graceless\\". The mixing is well-balanced and thankfully isn't too compressed. The record has some breathing room and continues to give off an aura of intimacy that makes it easy to get lost in the atmosphere.<br /><br />While The National hasn't changed up their sound in any significant way, they've proven to be great at what they do and Trouble Will Find Me is a stellar addition to their impressive body of work. It lacks some of the unpredictability and obtuse arrangements that made High Violet so incredible but it's comforting to find the band staying fresh and building upon what's come before. This is a great treat for dedicated fans and a welcome springboard for curious newcomers. Highly recommended.g fresh and building upon what's come before. This is a great treat for dedicated fans and a welcome springboard for curious newcomers. Highly recommended.
B00006AUIG|1.0|This has to be, hands down, the dumbest movie ever made. It's not even remotely scary and I wish I could unwatch it.
0143120581|4.0|I really liked this book. The story is well-written and the topic was riveting.  I think it's rare to read a memoir that is so brutally honest and sincere.  Ms. Chua knows how to build a story.  She doesn't try to sugar coat anything and she bares her soul, showing her successes as well as her failures. Plus, her daughters helped her edit the book, so the perspective isn't one-sided.  Sometimes I laughed out loud and felt bad for Ms. Chua.  Other times I wondered if she was crazy.<br /><br />For anyone who thinks this is a guide to Chinese parenting: please stop.  It isn't.  This is one mother's story. There are some cultural similarities amongst mothers of a given culture, sure; but it is ridiculous to think that all mothers of any ONE culture parent the same exact way.  I did see some commonalities between her parenting and the way my parents (both Chinese) raised me.  However, despite the fact that my mom did assign me extra homework and sign me up for piano lessons, she also allowed me to go to sleepovers, let me sing/act in plays, and never (I mean never) criticized me.  She was strict, but never mean.<br /><br />If you are interested in one Chinese mother's experience raising children, you will have front row seats through this highly entertaining book.  It's easy to criticize other parents when you're sitting in a comfortable arm chair, but what parent is perfect?  Whether you agree with Ms. Chua or not, you have to admit the lady is brave to bare her self-admitted flawed parenting techniques to a world that loves to judge and criticize others (especially parents).  I respect Ms. Chua for doing that.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's cute and fun.  I loved my little pony when I was a little girl and my kids still love it
0385349947|5.0|Lean In is thought-provoking, inspiring, motivating, honest, funny, and fair. Every chapter made me think. Sometimes I had to put down the book in wonder because I identified so much with what she was saying.  It was eye-opening.  When she talked about being called &#34;bossy&#34; as a child because she liked to organize and lead, I saw myself, too.  I nodded in agreement with her observation that traits admired in men are discouraged in women.  The little boy who leads and organizes is seen as a born leader with initiative.  The little girl who does the same is seen as a bossy know-it-all who doesn't play well with others.  How true, and sad.<br /><br />I've read some criticisms about the book and it seems to me those people fall into a few categories: (a) they didn't read the whole book, or didn't get it; (b) they were getting defensive as a result of their own insecurities, thereby twisting her words, or (c) they were dismissive of her advice because they saw her as &#34;privileged.&#34;  I think people need to remember that Ms. Sandberg didn't grow up with tons of money, pampered in a lavish cocoon.  She worked hard to get where she is, and is able to afford some what she has in part due to her hard work (and in part due to her husband's hard work).  This book isn't about how to become like her.  It's about how to find your own strength and value as a woman (as a person), when you're a part of a society that constantly encourages you to follow others instead of lead.<br /><br />Ms. Sandberg advocates choice and equality above all, not one way all women should be. I think the most ''controversial'' part of her book is that instead of only blaming men or putting all the responsibility on men to ''give'' women equality, she also suggests ways that women can empower and help themselves and each other.  I found that empowering and validating! I think hers is a much needed voice in modern dialogues about gender equality in the home and in the workplace. It's also insightful for and applicable to men too. Ultimately, one of her main messages is TEAMWORK.  Women's place in society and in business cannot change unless we roll up our sleeves, and also go to work with our male allies.  It is not an us vs. them game - that just sets us up for failure (something that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. also warned against).  Ms. Sandberg explains exactly HOW to work toward equality based on personal experience and multiple psychological and social studies - she doesn't just theorize. Plus she gives great business advice, which is very helpful.<br /><br />I loved this book and have recommended it to all the women in my life.  I've even recommended it to some men.  It is highly informative as well as entertaining!  How often does that happen?  I think you should check it out.ghtful for and applicable to men too.

B00992CF6W|4.0|It is really good the game developer really thought about it and made it good they are doing really good on their games. The maps are kind of small but it is still good. Mine for diamonds and gold and defend against angry creepers, skeletons, and more! if you get this, and you like adventure, you will have a good time!!!
0375842209|5.0|Intense story, amazingly well written.  Fast paced and emotional.  It really is a must-read for people who look for out of the ordinary, really good books.

B00736ZKGS|5.0|Our daughter is crazy about one direction.  This was the perfect surprise for her.  She watches it over and over.
0553381407|5.0|This book helps to give a lot of perspective on why we behave the way we do, how to respond in toxic relationships in order to help break the cycle of abuse, and how to start living life for yourself! I really enjoyed reading this book and was a little surprised to find that I had more toxicity surrounding my life than I originally had thought. I highly recommend this to anyone struggling with a relationship, whether it is with a family member or spouse. Forward gives great advice to start using non-defensive responses and communication to not only better your personal relationships, but those at work as well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game, so refreshingly different than all same old games out there. Can't wait for the next Room! Great job on the graphics keep up the great work.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|The ineraction of characters is gripping.  A good story about a lifestyle that no longer exists. Historically correct in its portrail of WWI.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|In all my life I do not think that I've read a book that spoke to my core more than this one.  As a veteran cosmic rocker from the 70's I'd had \\"trips\\" that gave me hope that the world is more than what we \\"see\\".<br />I'm no longer afraid of death.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|A well acted and interesting show, but do they have to kill off everyone? Seems to me that the writers could have been more creative.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Good book, gives you new perspective on how to make others feel loved.  Will use this with my kids as well as with my hubby.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|It's fun the first two minutes. Then it gets all glitchy and then you have to buy something 100 times. Plus there isn't a save button which is annoying. Finally, it sucks on the kindle. I have a kindle fire hd and the graphics still die like crazy. There is also one quest that you can't do on th  kindle since you can't collect your daily bonuses. Overall it's terrible-don't buy it.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is an amazing album in many ways though I wonder what the talking is about in track 3? It's like an interview over music and I don't know who the person is being interviewed?<br /><br />The music on this album is engineered very well and the songs are like a cross between Earth Wind And Fire, Blue Man Group and  Kraftwerk. That's the best way I could describe it.<br /><br />I was never much of a Daft Punk fan before but have now been turned on to the band because this album is so good.<br /><br />Yes, it's not a 'kids' album and is more grown-up than what I had heard of Daft Punk before. This is a good thing. It appeals to a wider audience!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent hard to put it down one of Stephen kings best kept me in suspense right to the end a must read
B005S9ELM6|4.0|This is a superb film, and even though those of us old enough to remember the events all know how it ends, it is a thrilling ride to the known conclusion.  The cast was perfectly chosen, and the sets, costumes, and portrayal are right on the button.
B007THA4FI|3.0|i wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but i wasn't too impressed with this book. i read it a month ago and barely remember the plot. it passes time, that is all.
B00B49GSOS|4.0|I expected that Jackson would have pumped out another formula version of the Tolkien story, but despite only going from the beginning of the story and ending at Smaug's lair, the film was beautifully put together.  The Dwarves were also portrayed with lots more character than in previous Tolkien films, which was nice.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|started watching the HBO series and decided to pick up the books. they are awesome. well written, breeze right through each one. what will happen next!?!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|New to kindle hd and shocked with short battery life (compared to plain kindle) I downloaded free version of this app. Find it useful to have more predictability with UAE of my device.  Seemed reasonable to support the developers, and small price  to pay for removal of ads. Paid for version has lots of info.I don't need but after calibration, fulfils main role well.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|i enjoyed these books, even if they are geared toward a younger crowd. not as impressed with the first film, glad i read the book first.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Spielberg has done us a service by making a great film about our sixteenth president. Less a biography than an absorbing political drama, it is engrossing.  Great performances all around.
0553328255|5.0|Very entertaining, love all the different narrations. Sir Arthur did a great job. I need 8 more words, now two.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|It would seem that a new artist's follow-up album is their first chance at abject failure; Miss Emerald's second offering is shockingly wonderful. Fusing classy 20th century genres with generous samplings of hip hop's better tones (absent the misogyny), leads me to believe that there's still hope for popular music.
B005LF9KMI|3.0|the book is better (and it usually is) than this flick! Now I know what Stephen meant when he used to say how disappointed he was (or possibly is) in some of the films made from his books. This is one movie that makes you sit and say, &#34;What the&#34; and just cut it off before saying too much. Just let it go.... just let it go....
B004SIP7AS|3.0|I love this classic Jane Austen story with Ms. Paltrow.  Dissapointed that there are NO COMMENTARIES, nothing extra.  Would love to find a copy with the director's commentary if one exists.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|It is a slow moving movie, but it also brings you in a little at a time. Is it for everyone I think not but that is my opinion.
B00000F14B|5.0|Our Music Curriculum at our Public School studies &#34;MUSIC MAN.&#34;  Clips from the film make it come alive for our young 5th grade students from a completely different time period.<br />This classic rendition is timeless, and great to get input from the original cast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best running games i have ever played besides temple run so you huys should check it out later homies.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It's ok but I got this on a Kindle which means that it's a janky app that tries but is still held back by Kindle being considered a 3rd rate device that doesn't even have other Google apps... :/<br /><br />Don't buy a Kindle or you'll be stuck leaving mediocre reviews like this.
B00AA0U046|5.0|MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
B00C061I3K|5.0|I had already listened to this album when iTunes got the jump on everyone and started streaming it, and I instantly fell in love with this album. From the opening \\"Give Life Back to Music\\" I was hooked. This feels like a sequel to Discovery, and in my opinion is just as good. Picked this up today at my local record store (and got a paper mask replica of the album cover, unexpected) and I've already played this several times nonstop. It's definitely a departure from their 'traditional' sound but that's not a bad thing. Definitely a must have for any Daft Punk fan or a fan of music in general.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end! Jodi Picoult wrote this novel extremely well. This is only the second B-) book of hers that I have read but after this I want to read many many more!!!!!
B003QSMC18|4.0|I was accidentally tipped off two a few crucial details early on so a large amount of the plot was a bit ruined for me tried as I might avoid knowing anything. Despite this, the movie was incredibly enjoyable. &#60;No spoilers below&#62;  The film started off quite well, introducing the main character, her role, and passion was very important before threatening it to jump-start the story. The supporting character (blond chick can't remember her name), was excellent. I thought she was going to be a witch or sub-villain, the snobby up-nosed friend. But she wasn't. That's what I liked about her so much, she was a real good friend. I was quite horrified to see her after the intro when the characters are grown up as giddy as she was, but she was really fun.  I did not care for the villain. Classic Disney isn't the best with villains IMO (Gaston and Frollo the exceptions), but this guy was downright shallow. His motives were unclear and very poor. Sure he was a bit scary and clearly evil but I was hoping that maybe he would've been introduced early on in the beginning as well. Instead he just sort of, popped up.

B00C061I3K|5.0|\\"A light but polished, elegant record whose robotic vocals would hold expressiveness and emotion.\\"- Thomas Bangalter.<br /><br />Random Access Memories, the fourth album from Daft Punk, is eclectic, innovative, engaging and very interesting to listen to. If you're expecting just another EDM cd, you'd be disappointed.  If not, you're gonna love it.  Lending their cache to the effort are singing legend Paul Williams, Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Pharrell Williams, Chilly Gonzales and music icon Nile Rodgers, whose fingerprints are all over the place.  The decision to take it back to a classic early 80's mix of disco and smooth jazz-styles featuring session musicians is a good one.  This cd sounds... alive!  You'd almost think the late Roger and Larry Troutman from ZAPP! were looking down on them while they made it.  With 13 tracks, each one has something special, something to make you want to explore and not just play them.  Also makes it hard to pick out some to highlight.<br /><br />01- Give Life to Back to Music: if you're of that certain age, soon as you hear the drums, rhythm guitar, bass and party chatter flowing through this one you'll want to lace up your roller skates and hit the rink!  And you won't take them off until the cd's finished.<br /><br />03- Giorgio by Moroder: a slice of musical history with disco icon Giorgio Moroder as he outlines his music journey through snippets mixed in with the beats and rhythms.  Most interesting is how he was recorded with three distinct mics- including two from the 60s, 70s- to reflect his decades-spanning career.<br /><br />05- Instant Crush with Julian Casablancas: One of my faves, but the music is almost spot on from another 80s tune, \\"Eye In The Sky\\" by Alan Parsons Project, right down to the filtering of Casablanca's voice (Thanks to Eric Shepard and Booky McGee for helping me out with that).<br /><br />06- Lose Yourself to Dance with Pharrell Williams: Not really into his singing, but this one is one of the best tracks!  And yeah, those are real hand claps you're hearing.<br /><br />07- Touch featuring Paul Williams: Williams also wrote the lyrics.  Ever-shifting and psychedelically complex, it's rumored to be based upon a Brian de Palma film that Williams also starred in and scored.  Reminds you in a lot of ways of the Beatles, especially \\"A Day in the Life\\".<br /><br />08- Get Lucky with Pharrell Williams: the first single release.  It's what a night out is all about, not just what the title's metaphor suggests.<br /><br />09- Beyond: starts out with string sweeps like a movie score, but switches into a keyboard/guitar rhythm straight from Michael McDonald's classic \\"I Keep Forgetting\\".<br /><br />11- Fragments of Time with Todd Edwards: another infective, jazzy upbeat tune to nod your head to.  Singing reminds you of Justin Timberlake or Jon B.<br /><br />13- Contact: starting with a recording from the Apollo 17 mission describing a strange object witnessed in space to set the tone, there's some shades of TRON: Legacy here, but what really makes it are the drums as the song progresses and peaks.<br /><br />This one is completely unexpected and that's part of what makes it so much fun!  It's a bold, creative effort from the boys and proves the old adage of sometimes you have to go back in order to move forward.racks!

B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is a video library must-have.  I ordered it because I was tired of waiting for it to return to TV.  Colin Firth is amazing!  The acting quality and his ability to become an individual with a speech impairment was absolutely remarkable.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|If there is a better way to avoid noisome, objectionable ads on webpages I have not found it.  I have been using the various forms of Adblock ever since it appeared for Firefox, maybe 7-8 years ago.  It is invaluable.
0143113100|4.0|Not everyone knows what's in this book.  Intriguing. A medical book that's not all medical words. worth the price of it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great Cinematography, excellent acting and closely adheres to the books.  People who like historical fantasy will appreciate this well done movie.  Who doesn't like to fantasize about dragons.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|If you have not seen this movie yet you have got to see it. The acting is top by all actors. It just touches and pulls at your heart all through the movie. See it and enjoy
0553801473|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel, however the author does ramble on in his discription of landscapes, various costuming and surroundings.  He also introduces minor characters that we will never hear about again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed this, much more so than the Zombie Survival Guide (its predecessor of sorts).  It isn't so much a story as a collection of interviews giving the viewpoints of characters regarding the zombie apocalypse.  While not riveting, it is very interesting.
B00005JL96|5.0|I really think this is one of Disney's cutest  animated shows.  I really enjoy the Elvis Presley music they used
B000QRIGLC|5.0|If you don't respect what our Navy SEALS (and any other special forces) train for and go through after reading this book, then you will never get it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|The Columbo Complete series is great. The acting/stories are a good as I remember. Finally all together in one set. Thanks!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch is like an old shoe. Always comfortable and never fails. This is yet another compelling page turner of a story from Mr. Connelly, who continues a winning streak with this latest entry in the Bosch series. A great read for any fan of the series, and even if you have not read a one.
B001AITGWE|1.0|I had high hopes for this film, but as it wore on and on I just got more and more bored. The story is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional and the progression of events is standard for a pretentious culture flick masquerading as an action movie. If you want to see social commentary set in LA, watch Crash.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Tremendous imagination!  Some of the incidents are not for the faint of stomach, though.....still very enjoyable.  I have recommended it to my wife....and she is difficult to please.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I absolutely love this app! It's fun for all ages-- my daughter's 10 n loves it and I'm 30 and I love it!,  it's basically pictionary with a twist. U don't have to KNOW how to draw well- u just have 2enjoy drawing!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Hands down the best free military game available. Constantly find myself playing one more mission. The WWII facts are cool also.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love it. Easy to use and maneuver to which ever position I want. Also protects my Kindle when I take it with me.
0440244412|5.0|This series gets better and better. And this was the perfect finale for it. KMM wraps up Macs story. All of the major questions are answered. Mac learns what she is, but more importantly who she is and who she is not. I must caution anyone thinking of starting the Fever series, they must be read in order, starting with Darkfever. And please keep in mind, each book, is more like a very long chapter of a longer book. Nothing is wrapped up until the final book. But it is a great read! Highly recommended.
0486278077|3.0|Everything was up to par except the font was very small and the spacing per page made it difficult to read.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Every song brought back memories... Great party cd-- we've danced into the wee hours . For any rocker- this is a must buy. Jeff Lynn is a master
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Easy for him to learn, caught on quickly. Plays it over & over. Would play for hours if he could!!!!! :) :) :) :) :)
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Recommend you order the five book set - wish I had.<br />Wound up reading bks 1-5 straight through (they are that good)<br />Holding my breath for books 6 & seven!
0345803485|5.0|It's just awesome and hot! You need to buy it. Regret not getting all three books, but I soon will.
0446585041|4.0|I wish I would have read this one first.  Since Ellen is on TV now and so much more known it seemed like I knew a lot of this.  She is still so funny.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is truly amazing. It has so much inspiration and is not complicated at all. I only wish that in the future I will still have my pinterest because it keeps my ideas somewhere accessible. If you are having doubts just go for it. The best part is that it's free!
B000069KGM|5.0|The sound and clarity are fantastic. It`s my boys, I`ve been a fan since 1967.<br />I play it on my Bose and the music rocks the house.  Yeah baby!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|lyk Srsly I luv playing dis game it's so entertaining when he bored *.* it's cute u shud get dis game now ;) gosh people it's Amazing LOL
B00CAJP0ZO|4.0|It's not the black eye peas, but its worth an MP3 download.  Will teams up some great artist to deliver to good album.  Worth checking out.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg's message provides hope to a new generation as well as those of us inspired by Betty Friedan's &#34;Feminine Mystique.&#34;  While still recognizing the inequalities women face at work and at home, she moves the conversation up a level, and supports women to take responsibility for their inner blocks to having power -- since our only control is of ourselves, after all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Completely addicted to this game.  I feel like a kid again, can't seem to put it down.  Every level more intriguing than the last.
B009NY43NY|3.0|No spoilers here- I will simply say that although I agree with many other reviewers, I still love Charlaine Harris' works. If you are a fan of her other works, you'll definitely see some reflection of her previous works in this book.  I honestly think that she just got burned out writing this series and was tired of the whole affair. The book has that frustrated feel of the last of 50 Christmas presents being wrapped: \\"here, just wrap it up, who cares if the seams don't match and there's places the box shows!\\"<br /><br />I still enjoyed it.  It was a relief to see it finished, and endings are decidedly tough to write.
0810970686|5.0|It was sugnificantly less expensive thant he stores. These series of books has made reading exciting for my grandson.  Great buy
B006LSZECO|1.0|ugh... I've never read a book where the ending was that nothing happend. It's as if the author, herself, got tired of trying to figure out what \\"should\\" happen, and decided that it was easier to simply stop writing.
0810994739|5.0|This is a great deal.  My grandson loves this series of books.  These books make reading exciting for my grandson.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Great entertainment from America's greatest author.  You can not go wrong reading this one to yourself or with your kids.
0307887898|5.0|This book has really helpful information.  It is well written and easy to read.  I have recommended it to others.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The last 2 books were written as if she did'nt want to bother having made her money on the sale to True Blood.<br />Your loyal readers made you, what a wasted ending to a great series. Disappointing does'nt describe it!
B0012DW6W4|1.0|I didn't find this interesting.  I didn't finish watching it.  I would not recommend it to others.  There are better things to watch.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is cool and funny and awesome. I play this game all the time. If I was a video game critic I would rate this game one milling stars!!!
B00445RHKI|1.0|I find the storyline a little dull.  The characters seem very shallow.  There are too many stereotypes.  There are better things out there to watch.
0071422943|5.0|this book has everything that is needed. its a little hard to look for stuff but still its really useful when searching for ideas. Its a bible that has everything.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is a great buy especially for Batman fans! The photo book that comes with it is awesome! This set really provides an in-depth view of the creative process and measures taken in order to deliver the best Superhero Comic Movie Trilogy!!! Upon watching the bonus features, you will grow fond this cinema and the expertise of C. Nolan as a director and his creativity as a visual storyteller!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a romantic roller coaster!!  I read the last 10 chapters non stop.  I love this & can not wait for the last book.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|The same good stuff that he's been putting out for years, only better! A must for any serious collector wrapped in beautiful,<br />classy packaging.
B00005JM02|2.0|The end 40 minutes of the DVD is un-watchable.  It skips quite a bit with no sound.  Disappointing to grandchildren.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|What an incredible voice. Get this and the other album entitled &#34;21&#34; and you will see<br />what all the fuss is about.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Looking forward to more of John Puller. This was my first Baldacci book and I must say now I'm hooked. Straight up good reading and endless entertainment.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Fun and exciting with good special effects and acting. Kirk can be a little grating. Wish there was more emphasis on the science exploration aspect of Star Trek.
1442419814|4.0|In the review written by Amazon.com, the reviewer refers to David as Tally's newest lover.  This is wrong since there is no sex in the book at all.  There is some romance and kissing, but that's it.  The book is very enjoyable, well written and original.  This is a great read for any young adult.  However, if you are a parent looking at reviews of the book before letting their child read it, the reviewer's comments are misleading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I can only repeat what others have stated. This is easy<br /> to use and convenient.  A tip of the hat to the creators..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is awesome. the greatest.  controles hard to get used to. I like the desert. recommend getting the motorcross bike. upgrade it all the way.highly recommend it. it is not a little kids game. I know it looks like it.
B008J4L3E6|3.0|I have always loved Ms. Clark's books and have read every one.  I don't believe though that this book meets the same excellence as past books.  The book is good, and I'm glad I purchased it.  I just can't say it is as great as past books and it's like she's following the same formula.
193700788X|1.0|Sad.... The author was to busy making sure that every character ever spoken about in the series showed up in the last book that she totally forgot to tell a good story.  The story line is weak and the humor in the stackhousevseries is missing. Very disappointed. I love all four of charlaine Harris series but this was a terrible way to end
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great to sit and play while watching tv. This gave us addicting and fun!! Even my 7yr old likes to post!
1452110581|5.0|Purchased this as a birthday gift for a friend cause unfortunately she has a cat that pees on things.  She got a big kick out of it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for more!  Suspenseful and fun to play, I wish all games were this challenging. Try it without using the hints for a longer play through.
B000068FXR|5.0|Their best album ever, in my humble opinion. Loved it when it came out (yes, I'm that old) and love it it more now. Supertramp were at their creative peak when they produced this album.
B00772M1F6|1.0|Bought for one song,didn't care for the rest - you've done that haven't you! uh huh - I thought so! Its in my sell/trade pile now 1-star for one song !!!!
B000068FY0|5.0|This album is second only to Crisis? What Crisis? Of course, many people will dispute that statement, but hey, it's only my personal opinion. Any fan of Supertramp will have at least both these albums in their collection, won't they? But if, somehow, you're new to Supertramp and you want a place to start . . .<br />  Enjoy some real music when the people who made music were MUSICIANS.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love these games, they're fun, they don't crash, some levels get challenging. A lot of fun!!  He is super cute to and now he has om nom friends =)
B009IA9OLE|5.0|i rated it highly because this game does not freeze , during mid play like food tycoon, so keep up the good work.
B004J88SGC|5.0|Awesome concert. Great songs, great music, great performers. One of the best. I also enjoyed the tribute to our nation's first responders.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A good game using strategy and luck. Very addictive when planning where to place the coins. Cute graphics and prizes.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I got this app because I keep lots of lists. Evernote lets me do what I want with its outlining features. It is as useful as you make it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I remembered this show on a whim as I collect A LOT of TV on DVD and Movies.  I was thrilled to see this available.  This series really caught the edge of a generation that was fed up with the status quo.  There are a lot of great moments of teen angst, the animation is simple but still makes an impact.  It's a series about what is being said versus the animators skill, so if you are more interested in substance vs flash . . . this is definately worth adding to any collection.
1401223176|5.0|I truly can't say anything negative about this. This includes the entire Hush series and this is easily in my top 3 favorite Batman comics. Cameos from all over Gotham and a rich, deep story that keep you turning pages until the very last one. Buy it! Don't even hesitate!
B0072OFM28|2.0|This season ended waaaayyy too soon!  In total suspense waiting for the next season to see what happened!!!  This series should be 30 seasons long!
B000MD7OKY|4.0|I have watched this movie a few times in the past few years. It is hard to think of any movie stars that can measure up to Cary Grant and Grace Kelly today. I must say though I am used to the pace of films today and in some places upon repeat viewings I am skipping through. The quality of this version is first rate. I think Hitchcock would approve.
0321213351|5.0|This book was very informative and gave me a great overview of patterns.  Having never worked with patterns before this book was a perfect introduction to be used for class.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I have been reading the Percy Jackson books and heroes of Olympus, so I decided to try this and it is just as good.I love riordian's connection to myth and mythology!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I purchased this book on the spot when I saw others noting that this author fits right in with the likes of Jim Butcher and Patrick Rothfuss. I think someone also mentioned Illona Andrews. All are authors that I adore. Given that plus the 700+ reviews for this and the crazy low price for the kindle edition, I made the purchase.<br /><br />This book is nothing short of fantastic. The story telling format fits quite well. I was highly satisfied that the book answered a great many of my questions and ended on a note that is a coin's edge between happy and cliff hanger. There's definitely so much more of this story left to be told. And, yes, I'm rabid for the next one.<br /><br />All of those things said, I will say that the story took me a little while to get into. I really perked up when they got to the first of the Tests at the Order. The author did an incredible job of giving enough details on life and training at the Order while also moving the story forward and advancing the timeline of the particular brothers. The characters themselves are richly painted. I feel like I know them, though, not to the degree that I feel like I know Kvothe from Name of the Wind. That wasn't a knock. Just an observation.<br /><br />When you start nearing the end of this book you find yourself quite worried. There are still many things to be discussed; questions to be answered. Like I said, the author found a good balance between answering enough to seal the ending, but leaving many remaining to keep your interest.<br /><br />Simply put, I can't recommend this book highly enough.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great first person shooter for the kindle fire. This puts other basic tablet games to shame. It's similar to grand theft auto
B000083E79|5.0|I love Cher.  The only true Diva.  Great CD.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|My only problem is that I had to keep running the amazon app to get the angry birds app to work so I deleted both.  will get my angry bird fix on my computer, not my phone.
B001DSNEJM|5.0|A great movie at a great price.  I would recommend this movie and give it 2 thumbs up!  Thank you.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I remember playing this on my cousin's ipad and I loved it, but was upset that it wasn't available for the kindle. Now it's here!! Thank you.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am in love with the Hobbit and LOTR! This movie was great and I will watch it until I wear it out!
B00CL68NOG|1.0|I just started playing this movie and the quality is like in watching a YouTube video. Horrible, worst quality I've witnessed from amazon Instant watch
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|something to watch when nothing else on tv;  price was good deal for older programs that were series when I was younger
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Kudos to writer, he composed it very well. it honestly describes + & - about Steve's personality. Inspiring :-)!...Few details (over explained) related to his music passion make it boring sometime.<br /><br />I would love if my son reads it when he is in his senior high school and also would recommend this book to young professionals and people who is in mid-career.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have been a fan of the cut the rope franchise since the beginning. This game does not disappoint. I love the new levels, the new om noms, and the new game mechanics!!!
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|pretty good for just wasting a little bit of time but not for a long period of time, so take it in small portions
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Great movie overall, but I was expected much more. Especially with all the hype at the beginning of the year. I was a little turned off by the way the movie was filmed. I have much rather it be filmed the traditional way. If you are a Keira Knightley period film fan, it will satisfy you need.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it starts off super easy and that can be hard to get past but eventually it speeds up and you get you money worth, plus you get a lot to play for free which is always a bonus
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I had download this game last night and from now I can play a FPS game without needed my PC. Haha
B009QU9X44|5.0|I am transported back to Africa when reading Americanah! Much of the content is so typical of everyday life in Nigeria as well as the experiences by Africans in America. I am enjoying reading this book but I imagine that if you have had no close association with this culture, you may not 'get it'.<br />'Half of a Yellow Sun' was also a beautiful read and I found myself in Africa, once again!<br />Adichie writes in the way that I would like to be able to express and articulate myself. She is brilliant.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Even better than the first.  Has everything you could want from a book, and more.  Martin has successfully made a fantasy series that can only be challenged by Tolkien.
B000006RHL|4.0|What else can be said about this awesome live show. This was recorded durng their peak and contains all of the songs that the hard core Maiden fans want to hear including Revalations, The Number of the Beast, Run to the Hills, Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, The Flight of Icarus, Iron Maiden and many more. The show is full throttle and the guitar and vocals are phenominal!
1582701709|5.0|If you read this book and think before hand that it will be a waste of time.....you are right.<br /><br />If you read this book with an open mind and feel there is a opportunity here to enjoy life so much more than I do now and see that life is supposed to be fun, full of love and happiness. That this book just gave my the focus i needed to see that we do hold the key to open the door so that every day can go the way we want it to go because we are driving the bus . So that you feel that this was the best book I ever read in my 61 years of life.......you are right.<br /><br />I would welcome any opportunity to discuss this book with the world ,  any country, any person . May you have a great day and God bless you,<br /><br />Brian
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My son loves this movie! I love having an electronic version so we can watch it wherever we go. The movie teaches a great lesson in a fun and exciting way with music and cute characters.
1449325947|5.0|CSS3: the missing manual contains a lot of information on CSS3. The author of the book takes a 3 part approach to presenting CSS3. First, for each part of CSS3, selectors, inheritance, text formatting, etc., he presents the concepts then the details of implementation of that particular feature of CSS3, then he rounds out the chapter with a tutorial in which he puts the concepts and implementation details into action. I think this approach is very useful. I also think that the author manages to put a lot of information about CSS3 in this CSS only book, something that would be impossible had tried to also put in information about HTML. As it is, this book is 550 or so pages! If you have a working knowledge of HTML and are interesting in going on to the next logical step in web design, then CSS3: the missing manual would definitely be a good addition to your library.
B003YUQC0A|1.0|It's not what I expected it to be. I guess I should have known that Crocs would have a rubbery interior. But that's not what I wanted, so I returned them. It's not the shoe, it was me.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|This book is more than just self-help material. It's a thorough look into the most ingrained aspects of what constitutes our personality, our habits. The silver lining: we ARE in control if our destiny and eventual change. The key is recognition, discipline and hard work. Read this book even if you're not that interested in psychology. The case studies and examples alone are worth it.
B00004U45G|5.0|The Black Crows with Jimmy Page covering Led Zeppelin tunes...What more do I need to say. This album is great.
B008476HBM|5.0|It's pride and prejudice! everyone needs this on hand for when you need a great love story!<br />OR Persuasion or Sense and Sensibility! or....
B0089LOG02|5.0|Words cannot express the eloquence of this precious story!  One must read it and be absorbed by it.  A true masterpiece!
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|This movie didn't excite me. It's gentle and mild, but also a bit weird and nonsensical.<br />Plot: 2/5 A romance between preschoolers?<br />Characters: 3/5 They were interesting, but the voice acting wasn't very good and Ponyo's a little annoying.<br />Setting: 4/5 Nice under the sea scenes.<br />Animation: 4/5 The strongest aspect of this film, if you're one to watch a movie just for the pretty pictures, you'll want to see this.<br />Total: 13/20 Clean but strange, and definitely not made in America, this movie is a worthwhile watch but absolutely not something to see over and over again.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|A little bit too glamorized at times but pretty spot on overall, amazing performances by the children in this movie!
0812550706|3.0|This book could be in the dictionary under science fiction, but I've seen better.<br />Plot: 5/5 Definitely the book's strongest aspect. Extremely well executed.<br />Characters: 2/5 Ender, poor Ender. No friends, no family, hardly even any allies. All the supporting characters may as well be pieces in a game board, they're that real to you.<br />SPOILER<br />It gets even worse at the end, where the Buggers come in.<br />Setting: 3/5 Unimpressive.<br />Writing Style: 1/5 It annoys me. This book is really pretty dirty, though absolutely not the worst you might find in sci-fi, it's not clean and honestly even if the dirty parts were censored, it still wouldn't be that well written.<br />Total: 11/20 I can see why everyone seems to like it so much, but honestly, it's not that good. If you read a book for plot, I completely recommend this. If you read for the characters, this book is a waste of your time.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|It kept me intrigued and enjoyed the all the characters. It's definitely an action packed Spielberg movie. I recommend it!
B00003CXBK|3.0|This movie had its ups and downs.<br />Plot: 2/5 A prince (that's him there in the picture) gets attacked by a demon, and is doomed to die. Before he does, he strikes out on his own to investigate. Eventually,, he makes his way to Iron Town, and the rest of his movie is about his interaction with forest spirits. It's interesting but the plot line is rather muddy.<br />Characters: 3/5 Complicated. That's the best way I can think to describe them. None of them seem really pure good or evil, similar to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. That much being said, the protagonist wasn't all that likable.<br />Setting: 3/5 High Fantasy,didn't leave much of an impression on me. It takes place in the distant past.<br />Animation: 5/5 Studio Ghibli's got a good reputation for its animation. I see why.<br />Total: 13/20 If you're already into anime, watch it. It's pretty good. If you're not, don't. The Japanese folk lore and myths mixed in here will seem completely bizarre to you. Over all, an alright movie as long as you're not disconcerted by the Japanese culture and you don't expect very fleshed out characters.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Finally catching up and this is season was pretty awesome. I would recommend it to anyone who's into Criminal Minds.
B004CRR9G0|3.0|This movie has some serious mixed feelings around it. Should have read the manga first, that's for sure.<br />Plot: 2/5 If you don't know going into it that this was a manga first, you definitely know coming out because the story line is obviously truncated.<br />SPOILER<br />The toxic jungle is supposed to clean the soil, but the soil seemed fine before, and all the toxic jungle seems to be doing is being, well, toxic.<br />Characters: 2/5 Don't get me wrong, Nausicaa is likable enough. The other characters, particularly some allies that she picks up along the way, I found hard to relate to.<br />SPOILER<br />I really couldn't like the insects, even though Nausicaa did. They just seemed too gross.<br />Setting: 4/5 Post-apocalyptic green sci-fi.<br />Animation: 3/5 This is where the mixed feelings come in. The pictures here are truly incredible. Mr. Miyazaki's best, and that's saying quite a lot. Unfortunately, the background music bad. Very. Even though some parts are pretty-and some aren't-the volume is not controlled. It sometimes blots out the dialogue and can be really just obnoxious.<br />Total: 11/20 A movie with potential that it didn't do much with.
B000J1U0ZK|5.0|I love this movie. People need to realize that this is after all of the crazy that happened in the first two movies and the last 3 movies.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I LOVE this movie. It's so smart, different and funny! Great cast! I had this on DVD and watched it with all my friends and family, then I decided I wanted it on Blu ray because the scenes are so colorful and beautiful.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|I've been listening to Tyler since the beginning and he's really grown as an artist. Give this CD a chance I enjoyed almost every track on the CD.
B0068RHSCW|1.0|This may be one of the most horrible movies ever made. The biggest question is how they even got Daniel Craig - between Bond and Dragon Tattoo - for this dung heap. Right from the get-go, I mean 30 seconds in, you can tell this is going to be awful. I'm sure entire dissertations could be written on how bad this truly is - Craig floats through as if his mind is totally somewhere else; there are non-sequitor scenes and lines of dialogue that have no purpose whatsoever. NOTHING makes any logical sense - not the story, not the characters' reactions to what's going on... it's absurd how wretched the whole thing is.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Since the dawn of television greatness, when it had but a handful of channels color TV was blossoming, and you would wind down the late hours with the star spangled banner before signing off with no other recourse but go to bed or read a book, man was journeying a new frontier. That series plus a host of many others with good or bad remakes have held our attention one way or another. Some have come & gone, some still remain, and Star Trek is one who has a legion of fans still enthralled, wanting more.<br />The series went through many changes even winding up on those retro Saturday mornings when it wasn't retro, either live or animated. Then it had the original crew form a movie series which actually continued the legacy into high gear, thus furthered by \\"the next generation\\".<br />But the series doesn't feel truely at home without the chemistry between the original crew headed by James T. Kirk, and that my friend, is where the action is, and this reboot makes no bones about it, this is what Star Trek is all about.
B00AMS38YU|1.0|I'm not one to pull the race card out usually, but this is the most RACIST movie I've seen in a long time. All of the Asians in this film are into gambling schemes and the main girl, supposedly Chinese, has a THICK Filipino accent. If blacks or Mexicans or Puerto Ricans or Jews or Arabs were portrayed this way, in such broad stereotypical brush strokes, there would've been protests and boycotts. L-A-M-E.
B002NLY0V4|5.0|Jared and Jensen are the perfect actors for this production.  The emotional expression of their roles in this production are marvelous!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics are incredible. It is a true puzzle that will frustrate you, yet keep you spell bound. Thoroughly enjoyed and cant wait for the next chapter.
